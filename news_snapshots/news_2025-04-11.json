    "title": "Is the alleged MS-13 gang member going to be returning to the US?",
    "article_text": "The Federalist correspondent Brianna Lyman joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss a DOJ appeals order to return a suspected MS-13 member to the U.S. and 19 states suing over President Donald Trump's election executive order. A Maryland federal judge on Friday told the Trump administration to comply with aSupreme Courtorder \"in good faith\" regarding the ordered return of an alleged MS-13 gang member erroneously deported to El Salvador. Kilmar Abrego Garcia, aSalvadoran national and Maryland resident, was deported to El Salvador last month for being an alleged MS-13 gang member. His attorneys have maintained that he does not have any ties to the violent gang. In a Friday hearing, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to provide daily updates as they comply with Thursday's Supreme Court order upholding her previous order to return Abrego Garcia to U.S. soil. FEDERAL JUDGE HAMMERS DOJ ON WHEREABOUTS OF ALLEGED MS-13 GANG MEMBER FOLLOWING SCOTUS ORDER \"I hope you will, in good faith, comply and we’ll take it from there,\" Xinis said Friday. \"I want daily updates until this matter is resolved.\" Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign and Xinis made clear during the hearing that they did not agree on their understanding of the high court's order. On Thursday, the Supreme Court wrote that Xinis' order \"properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.\" A Maryland federal judge on Friday told the Trump administration to comply with a Supreme Court order \"in good faith\" regarding the ordered return of an alleged MS-13 gang member, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, erroneously deported to El Salvador.(Fox News) The high court also said the \"intended scope of the term ‘effectuate’\" in Xinis' order is \"unclear, and may exceed the District Court’s authority.\" \"For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps,\" the Court wrote. \"It's going to be very difficult for the parties and for the trial court to understand what the scope is of the Supreme Court's order once the trial court takes the issue back up,\" defense attorney Phil Holloway told Fox News Digital. MARYLAND IMMIGRANT WRONGLY DEPORTED TO EL SALVADOR MUST RETURN TO US, SUPREME COURT RULES Holloway said that the ambiguity in the high court's order could lead to the case ending up in the justices' hands again for further clarification. \"The government is going to say that they are operating in good faith to comply with an order from the Supreme Court that is murky, and they're trying their best to comply with it,\" he said. \"At the same time, the president's trying to exercise hisexecutive authorityunder Article II, which also the Supreme Court said the lower court must recognize.\" Jennifer Vasquez Sura, the wife of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, speaks during a news conference at CASA's Multicultural Center in Hyattsville, Maryland, on April 4.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) Holloway said the government can take various routes as it moves forward, including seeking a reprieve from Xinis' order and arguing that it is \"unduly burdensome, and it hinders the president's executive authority.\" \"I think they may wind up trying to get him out of that prison and sending him to a different location,\" Holloway said. \"But I think they're going to fight pretty hard on whether they actually have to bring him back toU.S. soil.\" DOJ ASKS TO DISMISS VIRGINIA CASE AGAINST SALVADORAN ACCUSED MS-13 LEADER SET TO BE DEPORTED Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University and a Fox News contributor, said that the extent of the district court's power to order the government to comply with the Supreme Court's order is also in question. \"It's entirely unclear what, if anything, the court can do beyond other than nudge the administration in this direction,\" he said. In a Friday hearing, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the government to provide daily updates as they comply with a Supreme Court order upholding her previous order to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to U.S. soil.(U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland via AP) Heritage Foundation Legal Fellow Hans von Spakovsky specifically pointed to the Supreme Court noting that the district court must give \"[d]ue regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct offoreign affairs.\" \"So while the government has to act in good faith to use diplomatic efforts to negotiate Garcia’s return and keep the district court informed of its efforts, the district court cannot give the government direct orders on how to accomplish this foreign policy task or penalize the government if it is not successful,\" von Spakovsky said. CLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The assumption is that if the court determines that the administration is acting in bad faith, it could take some other action,\" Turley noted. \"The question is, how do you make that determination?\" Turley said the district court could hold the government in contempt if it determines the administration acted in bad faith. However, enforcement may be challenging, given Abrego Garcia is overseas and the president’s Article II authority over foreign affairs. Haley Chi-Sing is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

The state accused the USDA of \"withholding funding used to feed children in schools, childcare centers, and after-school programming as well as disabled adults in congregate settings,\" an argument the judge agreed with.

    "article_text": "NTSB Chairman Jennifer Homendy provided updates Friday on the investigation into Thursday's fatal helicopter crash in the Hudson River. TheNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB),during a news conference Friday at Jersey City Hall, said \"everything is on the table\" and it was not \"rul[ing] anything out\" in its investigation into the fatal crash of a tour helicopter in the Hudson River Thursday. The NTSB will look into witness reports of a large flock of birds in the area before the crash. The Bell 206 helicopter, flying for the tour company New York Helicopters, went down in the Hudson River near theJersey City, New Jersey, coastline at about 3:17 p.m. Thursday, according to New York Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner Jessica Tisch. New York City Fire Department (FDNY) andNYPD diversentered the water within minutes, pulling the pilot and members of a family visiting from Spain, including Siemens executive Agustin Escobar; his wife, Mercè Camprubí Montal; and their three young children, from the water. All six aboard were pronounced dead. Escobar was in the country on a business trip, and his family flew out to extend the vacation in celebration of Montal's 40th birthday, according to a statement from Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop. The children were all under 11 years old. A file photo of the victims of a helicopter crash in New York City Thursday, April 10, 2025.

NYPD divers are still searching for pieces ofthe aircraft,including the main rotor, tail rotor, main transmission, roof structure and tail structure. However, Homendy said witness reports have already aided investigators in the agency's preliminary investigation.

However, Duffy confirmed \"several minutes prior to entering the special flight rules area, air traffic control from LaGuardia Airport was providing support,\" according to the statement.

We've issued numerous regular recommendations on safety management systems, on particular regulations for Part 91.\" The question was asked after Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., and a number of other officials expressed concern about tour helicopters. \"Staten Island residents remain deeply concerned about the frequent low-flying tour helicopters whose flight paths continue to frequently pass over their neighborhoods at all hours of the day,\" Malliotakis wrote in a statement. \"To prevent another tragedy, these tourist helicopter flights over NYC must be more heavily regulated and restricted, if not come to an end entirely.\" One of the young victims of the helicopter crash in New York City Thursday, April 10, 2025.(New York Helicopter Tours, LLC) Homendy added it is \"too early\" to speculate about what the NTSB will recommend as a result of the investigation but noted \"this is a concern that we've raised for a number of years.\" \"Certainly, we raised this after the FlyNYON crash in a specific report. … It was very comprehensive about our recommendations, specifically about air tour operators,\" she said.

The threeDemocrat-led statesaccounted for $305 million in improper claim payments, DOGE said Thursday. The group added thatCaliforniaalso accounted for 68% of the benefits that were dispensed under former President Joe Biden to parolees identified by federal authorities as being on the government's terrorist watchlist, or who had criminal records.

Additionally, DOGE also found this week that it was \"routine\" under the Biden administration to admit immigrants into the country with minimal screening and, as a result, led to more than 6,000 people — either with criminal records, or flagged on the FBI's terror watchlist — entering the country.

For the first time since Hamas seized power 18 years ago, they are speaking out against Hamas at great personal risk. \"Since Oct. 7 people have been blaming Hamas and recognizingHamas started this war,\" Moumen Al Natour said. A Gaza lawyer and former political prisoner of Hamas, Al Natour knows very well the risk he is taking by making public statements against Hamas. \"I would be lying if I said I was not afraid,\" he said through a translator. \"I am afraid like any citizen living as a hostage under Hamas rule for the last 18 years.

On March 26, thousands of Palestinians took to the devastated streets in the Northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. They chanted, \"Out, out, Hamas get out\" and \"The people want the fall of Hamas.\" A demonstration in Gaza against Hamas would have previously been a guarantee of a heavy-handed response from the terrorist organization. Now, Hamas is weakened, partially by Israeli Defense Forces, partially by the desperation of the Gazans Hamas claims to serve. \"Recently, anger has been increasing towards Hamas because the situation is deteriorating,\" said Al Natour.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump answers a question about potential military action against Iran if it doesn't agree to a nuclear deal. PresidentDonald Trumpremains adamant that his administration will engage in \"direct\" nuclear talks with Iran on Saturday in Oman, while Tehran appears to remain equally steadfast in its insistence the negotiations will be \"indirect.\" Middle East envoy Stever Witkoff is scheduled to travel to Oman, where he could potentially be meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, though the Iranian official has so far maintained the talks will be held through a third party. While it remains unclear who will get their way regarding the format of the discussions, Iran expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Behnam Ben Taleblu, said thispublic controversybetween Washington and Tehran is all a game of leverage. \"Both sides have an incentive to either overrepresent or underrepresent what is happening,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"These are often the negotiations before the negotiations.\" IRAN MULLS PREEMPTIVE STRIKE ON US BASE AFTER TRUMP BOMB THREATS President Donald Trump speaks to reporters as he signs executive orders in the Oval Office on April 9, 2025.(Getty Images) \"For the White House, the desire to be seen as having direct talks with the Islamic Republic is high,\" he said, pointing to the lack of direct engagement between Washington and Tehran dating back to his first term and the regime’s deep disdain for the president, as witnessed in an apparentassassination attempt. While theIranian governmenthas long held contempt for the U.S., a sentiment that has persisted for decades, Trump is \"very different,\" Ben Taleblu said. The security expert highlighted the2020 assassinationof top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the crippling effect of the U.S.-sanctioned maximum-pressure campaign and Trump’s open support for the Iranian people as the major issues that have rankled the Iranian regime. \"Trump is a very bitter pill to swallow, and I think the supreme leader of Iran once said that the shoe of Qasem Soleimani has more honor than the head of Trump,\" Ben Taleblu said. \"Being seen as directly negotiating with someone [like that] would be making the Islamic Republic look like a supplicant. \"The U.S. wants to be seen as having driven Iran to the negotiating table, and the Islamic Republic does not want to be seen as being driven to the negotiating table,\" he added. Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani is shown in 2016.(Press Office of Iranian Supreme Leader/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) AHEAD OF TRUMP ADMIN-IRAN TALKS, NEW REPORT SAYS IRAN NUCLEAR THREAT RISES TO 'EXTREME DANGER' Tehran’s chief advantage is the fact that, despite severe U.S. sanctions and geopolitical attempts to halt its development of a nuclear weapon, it has made serious gains in its enrichment of uranium to near-weapons-grade quality, as well as with itsmissile program, a critical component in being able to actually fire a nuclear warhead. It also has drastically closer ties with chief U.S. adversarial superpowers like Russia and China, whose position and involvement in countering Western attempts to disarm a nuclear Iran remains an unknown at this point. While Iran holds significant leverage when it comes to negotiating with the Trump administration on its nuclear program, Washington has a plethora of levers it can use to either incentivize or coerce Tehran into adhering to international calls for the end of its nuclear program. \"The U.S. actually has a heck of a lot of leverage here,\" Ben Taleblu said, pointing to not only more economic sanctions, including \"snapback\" mechanisms under the United Nations Security Council, but also military options. Trump last monththreatened to \"bomb\"Iran if it did not engage in nuclear talks with the U.S. But some have questioned how long the administration will allow negotiations to persist asJCPOA-era snapback sanctionsexpire in October 2025. The White House would not confirm for Fox News Digital any time restrictions it has issued to Iran, but Trump on Wednesday told reporters, \"We have a little time, but we don’t have much time.\" The Foundation for Defense of Democracies analyzed where Iran's nuclear infrastructure is located.(Foundation for Defense of Democracies) TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO STOP IRAN FROM MAKING NUCLEAR BOMB: 'DANGEROUS TERRITORY' \"The regime has its back against the wall,\" Ben Taleblu said. \"A military option, given what has been happening in the Middle East since Oct. 7, 2023, is an increasingly credible option against the Islamic Republic of Iran.\" \"And the regime is engaging, now, to delay and prevent a military option from ever materializing,\" he added. \"They are hoping to use talks with the Americans as a human shield against the Israelis.\" \"So long as you're talking to America, the Israelis aren't shooting at you,\" Ben Taleblu continued. Trump this week said that it would be Israel who would take the lead on a military strike on Iran, not the U.S., should nuclear talks fail, which again could be a negotiating tactic as Israel has already demonstrated it will not hesitate tomilitarily engage with Iran. \"Pursuing wholesale disarmament of the Islamic Republic of Iran is incredibly risky, and it doesn't have a great track record of succeeding,\" Ben Taleblu said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talks to President Donald Trump during a meeting in the Oval Office on April 7, 2025.(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Iranian expert said the only way to actually take on the Islamic Republic would be through a \"broader\" and \"more holistic\" strategy that focuses not only on nuclear nonproliferation but removing the \"Axis of Resistance,\" scaling up sanctions and having a \"ground game\" to counter the regime through cyber, political and telecommunication strategies \"for when Iranians go out into the street and protest again.\" \"What the Islamic Republic would always want is to have you focus on the fire and not on the arsonist, and the arsonist is quite literally a regime that has tried to kill this president,\" Ben Taleblu said.

Ben Cline, R-Va., asked Haim whether the charges against him were \"a case of the administration using weaponizing law enforcement to intimidate you and other dissenters.\" \"There has to be a certain standard with ourjustice system, where people can't just bring these charges and power through the courts and send these people to prison, because that's what was going to happen to me,\" Haim said. Cline also asked Lytle whether the federal government treats whistleblowers differently depending on who's in office.

It's really outrageous, and the fact that he was charged in this way shows that the prosecutor was out to get him. He was biased.\" Later in the hearing, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., further pressed Haim about releasing the medical records, asking whether children and their families should worry about their private information being released. \"When children are being mutilated and sterilized,\" Haim said, adding that personal information, like the names of the patients, was not included. Haim, a surgeon formerly affiliated with Texas Children's Hospital, was indicted on federal charges last year for allegedly accessing and sharing private medical records of minors receiving transgender medical procedures. Haim's whistleblower report occurred during a transitional periodin Texas'policies regarding transgender treatments for minors. In March 2022, Texas Children's Hospital announced it would stop such services to children following Gov. Greg Abbott's directive to investigate such treatments as potential child abuse. The hospital later resumed these services after determining compliance with existing laws. In June 2024, the Texas Supreme Court upheld Senate Bill 14, which prohibits gender-affirming care for transgender minors in the state, with the law taking effect on Sept. 1, 2024. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP DOJ prosecutors claimed Haim obtained these records under false pretenses, violating the HIPAA and providing them to the media to harm the hospital's reputation. Facing up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, Haim pleaded not guilty, arguing that no personally identifiable information was disclosed and that he was blowing the whistle on \"child abuse\" in the hospital. In January, the DOJ dismissed the case \"with prejudice,\" preventing future prosecution on the same grounds. Four days later, PresidentDonald Trumpsigned the \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation\" executive order, suspending federal funds for gender-transition procedures for minors, including coverage under Medicaid.

White House envoy Steve Witkoff was in Russia on Friday to meet with Russian PresidentVladimir Putinafter peace talks with Ukraine stalled out in recent weeks, \"frustrating\" President Donald Trump. \"This is another step in the negotiating process towards a ceasefire,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said of the meeting. \"I think the president has been quite clear that he's been continually frustrated with both sides of this conflict, and he wants to see this fighting, and he wants the war to end.\" Russian media broadcast images of Putin and Witkoff meeting at the presidential library in St. Petersburg. Leavitt said the U.S. had \"leverage\"over Ukraineand Russia to pressure them to agree to peace. TRUMP ENVOY DOESN'T BELIEVE PUTIN WANTS TO TAKE OVER EUROPE Russian President Vladimir Putin, right, shakes hands with President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff during a meeting in Saint Petersburg, Russia, on Friday.(Sputnik/Gavriil Grigorov/Pool) \"We believe we have leverage in negotiating a deal… And we're going to use that leverage. And the president is determined to see this through,\" Leavitt said. Trump has demanded that both sides agree to an immediate 30-day ceasefire while they hash out a longer peace deal. Ukraine has agreed to this, while Russia has not. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed Ukraine had foundtwo Chinese menfighting on behalf of Russia within their borders, a development that would suggest Russia is receiving direct manpower aid from both North Korea and China. Zelenskyy said at least 155 Chinese citizens were fighting for Russia as he accused Putin of \"prolonging the war\" — a claim the Kremlin denied Thursday, stating that China takes a \"balanced position\" to the war and that \"Zelenskyy is wrong.\" Fox News Digital has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Defense for further comment. Ahead of Witkoff’s meeting with Russian officials, Trump ramped up pressure on Putin, writing on Truth Social: \"Russia has to get moving. Too many people are DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – a war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!\" Trump said on March 31 that he was \"pissed off\" with the Russian leader and threatened to put \"secondary tariffs\" on Russia's oil exports, its financial lifeline for the war effort. That could mean sanctioning countries that buy Russian oil or cracking down on its \"shadow fleet\" of tankers carrying oil across the globe in disguise. Trump has previously aired out complaints about Zelenskyy, too, calling him a \"dictator without elections.\" A public White House meeting last month erupted into a near-shouting match where Zelenskyy abruptly left the premises.

We hope that we are getting relatively close to getting a deal between Russia and Ukraine to stop the fighting,\" Trump said during a Cabinet meeting on Thursday. The U.S. and Russia carried out a prisoner exchange deal that saw the return of ballerina and U.S.-Russian citizen Ksenia Karelina to the U.S. on Friday.

    "article_text": "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., discusses the GOP's agenda, President Donald Trump's tariffs and budget negotiations on 'Hannity.' EXCLUSIVE:One day after the House passed its version of the \"big, beautiful\" budget bill demanded by President Donald Trump, Senate Republican leaders were bullish on the prospects of a deal coming together when lawmakers return from Passover/Easter break. \"Republicans have a bold agenda. The sooner we pass it, the sooner we can reverse the damage that Democrats have done over the last four years,\" Senate Majority WhipJohn Barrasso, R-Wyo., told Fox News Digital, as Senate leaders made a high-dollar budget cut promise earlier in the week. \"The American people need certainty that they aren’t going to face the Democrats’ $4 trillion tax increase,\" said the lawmaker, whose role is to \"whip\" or tally Republicans’ planned votes ahead of them being cast on the floor. Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thuneof South Dakota remains under pressure to deliver on $1.5 trillion in budget cuts he pledged to secure some of the votes from waffling House conservatives. The Senate version of the bill that passed earlier this month only called for $4 billion in spending cuts – a massive discrepancy from the House's version. AK SEN LITERALLY SHREDS BIDEN'S ENERGY ORDERS In exchange for their votes, Thune and Barrasso must coax Senate GOP moderates and members with concerns over potential Medicaid or entitlement cuts that they won't be part of the sizable slice. Additionally, the debt ceiling is projected to be hit during the summertime, which Republicans will have to reckon with financially as well. A failure to adjust for that ceiling could result in default. TRUMP'S BIG, BEAUTIFUL TAX AGENDA SCORES MAJOR VICTORY However, Thune was equally optimistic as Barrasso about pushing through Trump's agenda, saying the upper chamber’s agenda will be \"packed\" overall. \"More nominations to confirm. More burdensome Biden regulations to repeal. A tax bill – and border, energy, and national security bill – to continue drafting,\" he said. Speaking to Fox News Digital, Thune said committee leaders were working through the holiday on varying legislation planned to come for votes soon after they return. \"And, of course, appropriations season is almost upon us. And I remain committed to considering as many appropriations bills as possible under regular order,\" he said. Sens. John Barrasso, left, John Thune, center, and Tom Cotton, right, address reporters.(Getty) Regular order refers to matriculating bills through the committee process, which Thune previously said promotes bipartisanship and trust between lawmakers and the parties. The practices of governing by long-term continuing resolutions, or CRs, are considered antithetical to regular order. Barrasso said the American people need to knowthat Republicanswill stand firm on investing in domestic energy and border security in their post-Easter return. \"Our goal is to get this bill passed and sent to the president’s desk as quickly as possible. We’ll work towards that every day until it’s done.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., for comment on Democrats’ short-term plans but did not receive a response. Thursday’s House bill passed generally along party lines, after fiscal conservatives largely balked at the financial figures. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The number of GOP holdouts was eventually whittled down to two – Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Victoria Spartz of Indiana – who voted with the Democrats, albeit for ideologically opposing reasons. \"Our first big, beautiful reconciliation package here involves a number of commitments. And one of those is that we are committed to finding at least $1.5 trillion in savings for the American people, while also preserving our essential programs,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said.

Kim Reynolds discusses the education reform movement in the state and reports that former President Donald Trump is considering her for his education secretary on 'The Ingraham Angle.' Iowa Republican Gov.Kim Reynoldswill not seek re-election in 2026 after nearly 10 years serving in the state's highest office, teeing up what may be a competitive Republican gubernatorial primary in 2026. In avideo announcement releasedon Friday, Reynolds thanked Iowans for their support throughout her political career and said she will not campaign for another term as governor to focus on her family. \"Today, I want to share a personal decision with you; one that was not made lightly, but comes with a full heart and a deep sense of gratitude. After a lot of thought, prayer, and conversations with my family, I have decided that I will not seek re-election in 2026,\" she said. Reynolds began her political career in the Clarke County treasurer's office, before winning election as a state senator and later as the state's lieutenant governor. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON IOWA Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds is interviewed by Fox News Digital at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2023.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) She has served as governor since 2017, when then-Gov. Terry Branstad was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as ambassador to China during President Donald Trump's first term in office. Reynolds was elected to a full term as governor in 2018 and re-elected in 2022. \"This wasn’t an easy decision, because I love this state and I love serving you,\" Reynolds said in a video posted on social media. \"But, when my term ends, I will have had the privilege of serving as your governor for almost 10 years.\" Reynolds said the work isn't over yet and is committed to \"working hard for you every single day until my term ends,\" referring to her time as governor as the \"greatest honor of my life.\" \"This public service has been an incredible journey — one I wouldn’t trade for anything, but as Iowans know, family is everything,\" she said. \"Through the years, my parents and my husband Kevin, our daughters, and our grandchildren have stood by my side, supporting me through every challenge and every victory. Now, it’s time for me to be there for them.\" IOWA GOVERNOR SIGNS BILL REMOVING TRANSGENDER PROTECTIONS FROM CIVIL RIGHTS CODE Seasoned Iowa-based Republican strategist Jimmy Centers, who served in the Reynolds administration, said \"her governorship is historic\" for more than being the first female elected Iowa governor. \"It’s more than just her agenda; it’s about what she accomplished as governor. She was bold. She went out and sold her vision and she got it passed,\" Centers told Fox News. Nicole Schlinger, a longtime Iowa and Washington D.C.-based conservative strategist who is well-connected with evangelical groups, said that Reynolds \"has been a transformation governor.\" Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds speaks during a news conference at the Statehouse in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 31, 2024.(AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall, File) But Schlinger told Fox News that \"Kim Reynolds has put a lot of things in her life on hold for the state of Iowa and if you’re going to decide what you’re doing for re-election in 2026, now is the time you’re going to be making that decision.\" The Republican Governors Association (RGA) praised Reynolds for \"her bold vision and conservative leadership\" and said she \"delivered transformational results for Iowa.\" Iowa, which was once a key general election battleground state, has turned red over the past decade, and RGA communications director Courtney Alexander said \"we are confident that Iowa will continue to remain in Republican control.\" But the rival Democratic Governors Association (DGA), pointing to Trump's sweeping and controversial agenda during his first three months back in the White House, said that \"even former RGA Chair Governor Kim Reynolds knows she can’t defend her party’s destruction of the economy and extreme, unpopular agenda for the next two years.\" DGA communications director Sam Newton argued that \"in addition to leaving behind a failed record of corruption, gutting public education, and banning abortion, Gov. Reynolds has thrown the wide-open GOP field for governor into complete chaos. We look forward to holding Iowa Republicans accountable as this competitive race ramps up.\" Following Reynolds' announcement, there was instant speculation that Iowa attorney general Brenna Bird, who was a top surrogate for now-President Donald Trump during the 2024 campaign and who spoke at last summer's Republican National Convention, may make a bid to succeed the governor.

I am committed to continuing my work on behalf of Iowans and to support President Trump,\" she added. Among the Republicans who may also have an interest in potentially running in 2026 to succeed Reynolds in the governor's office in Des Moines are longtime state agriculture secretary Mike Naig; state House Speaker Pat Grassley, the grandson of longtime Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa; and all four members of Iowa's all-GOP congressional delegation — Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (IA-01), Ashley Hinson (IA-02), Zach Nunn (IA-03) and Randy Feenstra (IA-04).

Bobby Kaufmann, son of longtime Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann. RED STATE MOVES TO DEFUND COUNTY AFTER LEADER VOWS TO ‘INTERFERE AND INTERRUPT’ ICE DEPORTATIONS Longtime Republican strategist David Kochel, who has worked in Iowa politics for decades, noted that the Republicans have a \"deep bench.\" When it comes to the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, speculation centers on Iowa state auditor Rob Sand, who is currently the only Democratic statewide officeholder in the Hawkeye State. Reynolds, pointing to Iowa's shift to the right in recent election cycles, said the GOP \"will remain in great hands\" as the next generation of Iowa Republicans build on her legacy. Iowa Gov.

Ensign said the government had understood the order to require that it must \"hear what the executive branch says in a brief.\" \"We read the Supreme Court’s order differently,\" Ensign said. \"It said deference to the executive branch.\" Xinis, instead, said her reading was that the government take all the necessary steps to facilitate the return as soon as possible. \"I hear you and disagree,\" Xinis responded.

    "article_text": "Former Anheuser-Busch executive Anson Frericks explained how companies' focus on politics and social issues backfired on their bottom line as President Trump reassures Americans about market uncertainty. FIRST ON FOX:A conservative nonprofit is warning Tennessee lawmakers about a hospital group it says is quietly pushing radical DEI policies — even as some of those lawmakers have taken the group’s donations. As institutions begin aligning their policies withPresident Donald Trump’sefforts to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, Consumer's Research Group, a nonprofit conservative consumer agency, sent a letter to several Tennessee Republican lawmakers urging them to cut ties with the Tennessee Hospital Association (THA). \"Tennessee representatives who accept DEI Dollars from woke institutions like the Tennessee Hospital Association are putting themselves directly at odds withPresident Trump,\"executive director Will Hild told Fox News Digital. \"The President was clear: organizations continuing to push discriminatory DEI policies should be investigated.\" RED STATES GET IN LINE WITH TRUMP'S DEI BAN IN SCHOOLS AS COMPLIANCE DEADLINE NEARS Conservative nonprofit Consumers' Research unveiled a new campaign against Vanderbilt University Medical Center, accusing it of hiding its DEI resources and climate activism behind password-protected web pages online.(iStock) The letter, sent to Lt. Gov. Randy McNally and House Speaker Cameron Sexton, both Republicans, comes after thegroup launched a campaign last monthtitled \"What Is Vanderbilt University Medical Center Hiding?\" after finding that the university had been not just deleting some of its references to DEI commitments and resources, but also hiding them behind password-protected web pages. The letter was also cc'd to state House Majority Leader William Lamberth, state Sens. Shane Reeves, Jack Johnson, Ed Jackson, Becky Massey, Ferrell Haile and state Reps. Gary Hicks, Sabi \"Doc\" Kumar and Ryan Williams. Public documentsindicate the lawmakers received financial backing from the THA, which the association found still promotes DEI and \"'health equity' through its Council on Inclusion and Health Equity.\" \"Our campaign asking what is Vanderbilt University Medical Center hiding exposed the health system's frantic and futile attempts to cover its widespread DEI tracks – essentially waving a great big red flag asking to be investigated,\" Hild added.

    "article_text": "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin breaks it down on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’ FIRST ON FOX:Republicans in Congress are launching a probe into a Biden-era green energy grant program that sent billions in funding to climate groups tied to Democrats and former President Joe Biden's allies. GOP leaders on the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent letters to the eight nonprofits awarded grants from the $20 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), seeking answers to ensure the Biden Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) followed proper ethics and conflict of interest protocols in distributing the funds. In February, the Trump administration's EPA announced it would take steps to get the money back, citing concerns over a lack of oversight related to how the money was being disbursed. In the announcement,new EPA administrator Lee Zeldincited comments from a former Biden EPA political appointee, who described disbursements made through GGRF as akin to \"tossing gold bars off the Titanic,\" because Biden officials were allegedly trying to get money out the door before Trump took over.

Meanwhile, during Power Forward's first few months of operations — prior to receiving the funding — the group reported just $100 in revenue. Climate United, another group that received the most money from the GGRF, roughly $7 billion, currently staffs a former Biden climate advisor who worked during the last two years of the former president's term. The same group is also run by a CEO with ties to the Obama administration and a board member who was among those invited to Biden's signing ceremony for his multitrillion-dollar infrastructure bill in 2021. Several GGRF grant recipients have tiesto Democratsand Biden advisors, andsome were reportedly foundedshortly before or after the Biden administration announced the program. Meanwhile, these groups, according to Zeldin, had sole discretion on how to use the funds.

    "article_text": "Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-AK, tells Fox News Digital the White House is on board with an 800-mile project that will create thousands of jobs and boost trade with the Asia-Pacific. FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, literally tore up a list of 70 orders former PresidentJoe Bidenenacted that he said stymied the Last Frontier’s energy capabilities, and spoke Thursday about a bright future for the Land of the Midnight Sun. Sullivan described the Trump administration’s openness to building an 800-mile LNG pipeline to power the U.S. and trade with Asia. The pipeline would run from Prudhoe Bay – on the Arctic Ocean – to the Kenai Peninsula near Homer. Currently, essentially the only way to transport liquefied natural gas on the North Slope is via the AK-11 Dalton Highway of \"Ice Road Trucker\" fame, which is considered very inefficient and dangerous. \"This is a huge project, very geostrategically important — and, of course, it's important to Alaskans to get us the gas we need… but also to get our allies: [South] Korea, Japan, Taiwan, energy that they need.\" AK CAN BE ‘CURE TO THE NATION’S ILLS' WITH HELP FROM TRUMP ADMIN: GOV DUNLEAVY Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-AK, holds up President Trump's order forwarding Alaska energy.(Fox News/Charlie Creitz) Sullivan said Japan is still buying oil and gas from Russia – while a source familiar with the pipeline plans noted an Alaska-to-Asia trade route does not include any diplomatic or geographic pinch points like those that exist in the Mideast and elsewhere. \"Korea and Taiwan are getting their LNG from Qatar. None of that makes sense.Alaska is really close– We were the first place anywhere in the world to start exporting LNG in the late 1960s,\" he said. \"We did that to Japan for over 50 years.\" In his Joint Address to Congress, PresidentDonald Trumpflagged the pipeline plan, saying he is working on a \"gigantic\" project in Alaska. Amid tariff and trade news, Sullivan said building the pipeline and supplying both North America and Asia with LNG obtained through the U.S.’ environmentally conscious means could reduce the West-to-East trade deficit by up to $10 billion per year. Plus, the pipeline itself could \"revitalize\" the domestic steel industry and employ thousands of Americans. He also sought to dispel a \"fallacy\" often touted on the left, that Native communities in and around the LNG territory are opposed to such development. \"Most of the media gets it wrong,\" he said. \"The Alaska Native people … want this resource development done. This is how you help them with regard, not only to their economy, but their health, their pride, right?

They would never meet with them to develop their resources.\" When it comes to politicians in other states allegedly trying to dictate energy policy in Alaska, whether on environmental or other grounds, Sullivan quipped, \"we don't appreciate the lower 48 radical environmentalists coming up telling us what to do. And I really don't appreciate what my Senate colleagues who try to do that, too.\" \"You may have seen I gave a speech last week on the Senate floor ripping the hell out of one of them just because he needed it, right.\" As for talks with Trump, he saidSecretaries Scott Bessent, Howard Lutnick and Doug Burgum have been very open and supportive. Procuring financing is the next major battle, along with reciprocal trade agreements with target countries. \"Then you can finance these projects and start to build them. We're talking about laying pipe as early as the end of this year or the beginning of next year.

The project is the only West Coast venture to secure federal permits and $26 million in loan guarantees. It would utilize more than 500,000 tons of steel and 5 million cubic yards of concrete. In remarks to Fox News Digital, Energy Department spokesman Ben Dietderich said Alaskan LNG \"has massive potential.\" \"Accessing over 100 trillion cubic feet of North Slope natural gas will provide enormous energy security to the United States and its allies, thousands of high-paying jobs, and is estimated to reduce the United States trade deficit by $10 billion annually,\" Dietderich said. \"While the previous administration openly discouraged investment in American LNG, President Trump and Secretary Wright are committed to expanding American energy at home and abroad.\" \"Potential large scale investments and partnerships in U.S. LNG projects, including Alaska LNG, were discussed in the Secretary’s meetings with UAE officials yesterday and the Secretary intends to also raise these in Saudi Arabia in the coming days as well.\" Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

PresidentDonald Trumpis weighing in on a national debate, apparently calling on Congress to make Daylight Saving Time permanent. \"The House and Senate should push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day. Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!\" the president declared Friday morning in a post on Truth Social. Most parts of the U.S. participate in the twice-annual time changes when clocks are either set forward or backward by one hour.

(KTTV) A group ofCalifornia Republican lawmakersis asking for a formal audit of the state’s Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal, after its costs have gone up significantly after a law went into effect last year allowing illegal immigrants to enroll. The Medi-Cal program is $2.8 billion over budget, as it was originally expected to cost $6 billion this fiscal year. Since then, the governor’s office has requested $6.2 billion in two separate loans.\"On March 12, 2025, the Governor informed the legislature that Medi-Cal was insolvent and could not continue to pay all of its obligations to healthcare providers,\" the letter states.

Gavin Newsom's upcoming podcast will be the second one he is involved with.(Getty Images) \"Despite the alarming nature of this problem, the Governor has failed to provide an explanation for why Medi-Cal costs are far greater than what was budgeted. Many are concerned that continued growth in the cost of Medi-Cal benefits for undocumented immigrants is a major driver of the cost overruns,\" the letter continues.

    "article_text": "Republican Rep. Mike Lawler tells Fox News Digital he'll make a decision by the 'middle of the year' on whether he'll launch a 2026 campaign for New York governor. Republican Rep. Mike Lawler's opinion of DemocratGov. Kathy Hochulof New York is crystal clear. \"I think Kathy Hochul is the most feckless, incompetent governor in America,\" Lawler said in an interview with Fox News Digital. Lawler, who's in his second term representing the state's 17th Congressional District, which covers a large swath of New York City's northern suburbs, is mulling a 2026 GOP run for governor. \"I'll make a decision at some point – middle of the year. Obviously, you know if we're going to do it, you got to get out there, and you got to campaign hard,\"Lawler said. LAWLER SOUNDS ALARM OVER DEMOCRATS ‘INCITING FAR-LEFT ACTIVISTS’ Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y.(REUTERS/Anna Rose Layden/File) He added, \"I haven't made a decision yet. I think, obviously, there's a number of factors in play, but you know, we're working through that right now.\" Lawler is one of three Republicans mulling a gubernatorial run. So are Nassau County executive Bruce Blakeman and longtime Bethany town supervisor Carl Hyde Jr. It's been 23 years since a Republican won a gubernatorial election in heavily blueNew York. You have to go all the way back to former Gov. George Pataki's second re-election victory in 2002. KATHY HOCHUL'S POLLING PROBLEMS? But Hochul's approval ratings and favorable ratings remain underwater, giving Republicans hope the losing streak will come to an end next year. The governor also faces potential, longshot, primary challenges from her lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado, as well as Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York City. \"There's a reason New York leads the nation in out-migration. It has nothing to do with the weather and everything to do with the high cost of living and the declining quality of life from the migrant crisis to the crime epidemic in New York to the overall cost of living,\" Lawler said. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite/File) And the former political strategist and adviser-turned-politician said \"people can't afford to live in New York. They want balance and common sense, and I think that's where there is an opportunity, if you articulate the vision to New Yorkers. They're pragmatic, they're commonsense, and they understand the need for change.\" Democrats disagree. \"Whether it’s working to lower costs for families or protecting fundamental rights, Governor Hochul is a fighter for all New Yorkers with a record of getting results,\" Democratic Governors Association spokesperson Kevin Donohoe told Fox News. And Donohoe argued that \"while Governor Hochul is laser focused on delivering on the priorities that matter to her state, New York Republicans every day are supporting Donald Trump’s agenda that is hurting the Empire State. By spending their time currying favor with Trump, Republicans are setting themselves up for a messy and chaotic primary that will leave whoever emerges as the nominee badly damaged.\" In 2022, then-Rep. Lee Zeldin had the best performance by a GOP gubernatorial candidate in New York since Pataki's 2002 victory. Zeldin, who now steers the Environmental Protection Agency in PresidentDonald Trump'ssecond administration, lost to Hochul by less than six and a half points. And Trump lost the state to then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 13 points in last November's presidential election, but that was a 10-point improvement from his loss margin to Joe Biden in the 2020 election. REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS CAMPAIGN CHAIR REVEALS ELECTION BATTLE PLAN While Republicans have been more competitive statewide in New York the last two cycles, Lawler said next year's elections will \"be determined by a few things.\" \"No. 1, does the economy take off?\" he said. \"And with the tax bill, with energy production increases, you know, if the economy takes off, then I think people are going to be very willing and open to change in New York.\" \"Obviously, what we're doing at the border matters,\" Lawler said. \"New York has borne the brunt of some of the disastrous decisions of the Biden administration and Kathy Hochul, spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money on free housing, clothing, food, education and health care for illegals.\" Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York is interviewed by Fox News Digital on April 7, 2025, in Washington.(Fox News/Paul Steinhauser) And Lawler pointed to his push to raise the cap on the state and local tax deduction, known by its acronym SALT, which is a pressing issue for many New Yorkers. \"Do I deliver on things like SALT and lifting the cap on SALT? And so, if we get these things done, and you know, things are looking up, I think New Yorkers can be very open to a change,\" he said. Lawler grabbed attention in 2022 by narrowly defeating incumbent Sean Patrick Maloney, the then-chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But he's currently one of only three House Republicans who represent districts carried by Harris in November. Asked if he needs to keep his distance from the president if he seeks statewide office in New York, Lawler told Fox News, \"Look, he's the president of the United States, and [I] certainly would welcome his support.\" MAJORITY IN NEW YORK WANT CHALLENGER TO DEMOCRATIC GOV KATHY HOCHUL: POLL President Donald Trump(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein/File) But he also said \"New Yorkers will make a determination, though, based on the choice before them\" rather than on Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"If you present a viable alternative vision to New Yorkers and explain how you're going to deal with housing, how you're going to deal with infrastructure, how you're going to deal with crime, how you're going to deal with the fact that Wall Street is leaving New York in droves, these are significant issues that we have to tackle,\" Lawler said. \"And it requires leadership. It requires a plan. And I think if that is presented to New Yorkers, they'll make a determination based on that.\"",

    "article_text": "Obesity medicine specialist Dr. Holly Lofton joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss intermittent fasting and if Ozempic is linked to mental health issues. Professional golferPhil Mickelson, who made his 32nd start in The Masters this week, has been open about his commitment to health and wellness. The six-time major champion and three-time Masters winner has said he follows afive-day prolonged fast, which led to him dropping 25 pounds in 2023. Intermittent fasting (IF) has become a popular weight-loss strategy in recent years. THIS WEIGHT LOSS PLAN PERFORMS BETTER THAN TRADITIONAL DIETING, STUDY FINDS There are several types of intermittent fasting — but they all follow the same concept of alternating betweenfasting and eating. Phil Mickelson is pictured competing in golf tournaments 24 years apart, in 2001 (left) and 2025 (right). The six-time major champion and three-time Masters winner has said he follows a five-day prolonged fast, which led to him dropping 25 pounds in 2023.(Reuters / AP ) With a time-restricted approach, the dieter only eats during a certain window. For example, with the 16/8 method, the person fasts for 16 hours and then can eat within an eight-hour span, between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Other versions involve fasting for a full 24 hours once or twice per week — or only consuming limited calories on fasting days. FASTING-LIKE DIET COULD SLOW THE AGING PROCESS, STUDY SUGGESTS: ‘LIVING LONGER AND HEALTHIER’ Dr. Christopher Rhodes — a longevity, fasting and biomimetics researcher in California, shared his thoughts on Mickelson’s radical fasting program, which also includesdrinking coffeewith supplements. \"A five-day prolonged fast like the one Phil Mickelson follows will have profound effects on metabolism and weight loss,\" he told Fox News Digital. Phil Mickelson watches on the sixth hole during the first round at the Masters golf tournament on April 10, 2025, in Augusta, Georgia. The athlete has been open about his commitment to health and wellness.(AP Photos) \"It fundamentally shifts the energy state and fuel sources in the body and forces stored fat to be burned as energy, but certainly at the expense of elite athletic performance, especially in the later stages of a fast.\" Fasting for longer than 24 hours will deplete the body’s glycogen stores and cause it to enter ketosis, a state where it primarily burns fat and ketones for energy, according to Rhodes, who is also the founder of nutrition companyMimio Health. \"While this will accelerate fat loss and provide benefits to overall metabolic health, the body will still need to produce some of its own glucose in order to support brain function and will start to break down protein sources, like muscle, to maintain proper glucose levels.\" \"A five-day prolonged fast like the one Phil Mickelson follows will have profound effects on metabolism and weight loss.\" Over time, this will result in muscle breakdown, strength loss, fatigue and lower overall energy levels, which could hinder athletic performance, according to the expert. Mickelson has spoken about his own muscle loss as a result of his fasting. \"I also lost muscle, so I had to start lifting, and I've been lifting and slowly have been getting my speed and strength back to where I need it to be,\" he said during the 2023 Masters. There are several types of intermittent fasting — but they all follow the same concept of alternating between fasting and eating.(iStock) For elite athletes, maintaining muscle mass and metabolic flexibility is critical, Rhodes said. \"Extended fasts may slow down recovery, impair high-intensity exercise performance and even reduce power output if not properly managed.\" The doctor cautioned that a prolonged five-day fast should not be performed more than a few times per year, with plenty of recovery time in between. FASTING COULD REDUCE SIGNS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, STUDIES SUGGEST: 'PROFOUND EFFECTS' Certain groups — such as those at risk of muscle loss, likethe elderly— should avoid five-day fasts, he said. \"While fasting can improve insulin sensitivity, cognition, cellular function and metabolic efficiency, shorter intermittent fasting windows or fasting-mimicking strategies may offer similar metabolic benefits without the drawbacks of extreme caloric restriction,\" Rhodes added. Mickelson reportedly drinks coffee with supplements during his fasts, something Rhodes recommends as a means of preserving energy and muscle mass duringweight loss. \"During prolonged fasting, the body begins to break down both protein and fat for energy, which can lead to muscle loss,\" he said. Mickelson reportedly drinks coffee with supplements during his fasts, something Rhodes recommends as a means of preserving energy and muscle mass during weight loss.(iStock) \"Supplements such as amino acids, fatty acids, electrolytes and certain metabolic bioactives can help mitigate this.\" The doctor noted that supplementing with branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), creatine or HMB (hydroxymethylbutyrate) can help to preserve muscle tissue, performance and strength while staying in a fasted state. INTERMITTENT FASTING COULD REDUCE HAIR GROWTH, STUDY REVEALS \"Likewise, supplementing withessential vitamins, minerals, amino acids and omega 3s like EPA and DHA, which the body cannot produce on its own, would be crucial for maintaining high-level functionality during prolonged multi-day fasting,\" he added.

For elite athletes, maintaining muscle mass and metabolic flexibility is critical, Rhodes said.(AP Photos) Caffeine from coffee can also serve to provide calorie-free energy, Rhodes noted, while alsosuppressing appetiteand providing a cognitive boost to combat potential fasting-induced brain fog. \"Prolonged fasting can deplete electrolytes like sodium, potassium and magnesium, which are essential for muscle function, hydration and energy production,\" he said. \"If his supplements include these electrolytes, they may help prevent cramping and fatigue.\" Regarding Mickelson’s comments about lifting weights during his fasting stints, Rhodes agreed that weightlifting is essential for preserving and building muscle during weight loss. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The body operates on a ‘use it or lose it’ principle, especially during periods of caloric restriction or fasting, where it’s actively needing to mobilize energy sources from the body to sustain itself,\" the doctor said. \"Muscle is one of the most energetically costly tissues to sustain, so if we’re not using it on a daily basis, the body will preferentially start breaking down muscle to conserve energy.\" Weightlifting is essential for preserving and building muscle during weight loss, experts agree.(iStock) Resistance trainingsends a signal to the body that lean mass is essential for survival and tells it to prevent excessive muscle breakdown, prioritizing fat for fuel. \"For athletes like Mickelson, weightlifting also helps maintain neuromuscular coordination, joint integrity and power output,\" Rhodes said.

Those who were classified as heavy drinkers had a 133% greater risk of havingvascular brain lesions(abnormalities in the brain's blood vessels) compared to people who never drank. The risk was 89% higher than former heavy drinkers and 60% higher than moderate drinkers. \"Heavy alcohol consumption is a major global health concern linked to increased health problems and death,\" the study author said.(iStock) The heavy drinkers and former heavy drinkers were also more likely to develop tau tangles, which are protein deposits in the brain that are a common marker ofAlzheimer’s disease.

Whether it’s managing your blood pressure,staying physically active,eating well or maintaining social connections, small changes in your daily routine can help you take better care of your brain over time,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"Small changes in your daily routine can help you take better care of your brain over time.\" Brian Snelling, MD, of the Miami Neuroscience Institute, part of Baptist Health South Florida, was not involved in the study but shared his input on the findings. \"The influence of factors like chronic pain and a sense of purpose on brain health was notable and often overlooked in neurological care,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Also, the suggestion that reduced activity may be a symptom rather than a cause of brain disease challenges how we interpret early signs.\" Total cholesterol was one of the modifiable risk factors shared by at least two of the three cognitive disorders.(iStock) Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, said he agrees with the findings of the study. \"These factors are all well-proven to decrease inflammation in the body and thereby the risk of stroke, dementia and late-life depression,\" he told Fox News Digital. To keep from becoming overwhelmed, the researchers recommend regarding the 17 factors as a \"menu of options.\" \"You don’t have to address them all at once — starting with one to three small, realistic changes can already make a meaningful difference,\" said Singh. \"These findings might help people consider which of these 17 risk factors could be a starting point to take better care of their brains.\" NEW BLOOD TEST DIAGNOSES ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE AND MEASURES HOW FAR IT'S PROGRESSED Singling out one area to start with, Singh recommended measuring blood pressure and taking steps to keep it at a healthy level. \"There are many ways to control your blood pressure — reducing salt intake, increasing physical activity, eating morefruits and vegetables,managing stress and taking medication when prescribed,\" she advised. Singling out one area to start with, the lead study author (not pictured) recommended measuring blood pressure and taking steps to keep it at a healthy level.(iStock) Other important areas to focus on include sleep, social connections, blood sugar and physical activity, according to the researcher. \"The most important thing is to start somewhere — even small improvements can make a meaningful difference for your brain health,\" she said. BRAIN AND MEMORY ARE BOOSTED BY EATING ONE PARTICULAR DIET Many of the factors are interconnected, Singh noted. \"Progress in one area often supports progress in others,\" she said. \"For example, becoming more active may help to improve sleep or lower blood pressure.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Managing blood pressure and kidney health, as well as staying mentally and socially engaged, are key strategies to protect the brain, according to Snelling. \"Proactive brain care should start well before symptoms appear,\" he said. Like any study, Singh noted, this one had several limitations. \"We focused on modifiable risk factors that overlapped with at least two out of the three conditions — as a result, we may have excluded important risk factors that are specific to just one condition, particularly certain psychological or behavioral factors related tolate-life depression,\"she told Fox News Digital. Maintaining social connections is one of the most important strategies for protecting brain health, according to experts.(iStock) The researchers also relied only on existing meta-analyses, which meant some potentially important factors in smaller studies may have been missed. \"Additionally, the strength of evidence varied across risk factors and conditions, and we couldn’t establish causality — only associations,\" Singh said. \"Still, we hope this work offers a useful starting point for prevention-focused research.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Snelling agreed that while the large review shows strong associations, it doesn’t confirm cause and effect. \"It also highlights the need for more high-quality data, especially around late-life depression.\" \"Proactive brain care should start well before symptoms appear.\" Overall, experts agreed the study emphasizes that lifestyle changes can be instrumental inpromoting healthand longevity. \"Diet, exercise, sleep and having a purpose in life aren't just good for brain health — they are also critical in preventing numerous chronic diseases,\" family physician Dr. Brintha Vasagar, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, told Fox News Digital.

    "article_text": "Education Secretary Linda McMahon discusses the Trump administration’s actions on transgender athletes in women’s sports on ‘The Faulkner Focus.’ USA Fencing has acknowledged a forthcomingfederal investigationinto an incident that occurred at one of its events where a women's fencer was punished for refusing to face a transgender competitor. The investigation, which will be carried out by the newly-formedTitle IX investigations teamin conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education and Department of Justice, was announced on Friday by Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The incident, which occurred at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland on March 30, saw female fencer Stephanie Turner take a knee in protest of trans competitor Redmond Sullivan. Turner was then disqualified from the event and escorted out of the venue. USA Fencing provided a statement to Fox News Digital saying it will cooperate with the investigation. \"USA Fencing will respond and cooperate to any inquiry as required by law,\" the statement read. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM The incident involving Turner quickly drew national attention after a video of her taking a knee to protest Sullivan went viral. The footage ignited widespread awareness and backlash against USA Fencing's gender eligibility policies. Turner told Fox News Digital that she came to the decision to take the knee the night before the event, when she checked the competition pools and saw that she would be competing against Sullivan. \"I saw that I was going to be in a pool with Redmond, and from there I said, ‘OK, let’s do it. I'm going to take the knee,'\" Turner said. \"I knew what I had to do because USA Fencing had not been listening to women's objections regarding [its gender eligibility policy].\" WHO IS STEPHANIE TURNER? WOMEN'S FENCER WHO KNELT TO PROTEST TRANS OPPONENT AND IGNITED GLOBAL AWARENESS USA Fencing first enacted its current trans-inclusion policy in 2023. It allows transgender athletes to compete in the women's category at both the junior and senior level after completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment. Proof of compliant hormone therapy must be provided prior to competition, but the organization has taken even further steps to prioritize its trans competitors. In November 2022, it announceda policyto give preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that \"harm members of LGBTQ communities\" and states that do not \"have laws undermining the reproductive health of women.\" That policy went into effect in the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. It later released alist of statesthat it intended to \"avoid where possible\" and the states that it flat out would not allow hosting major events. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP This past December, a nonprofit fencing organization, the Fair Fencing Organization, penned an open letter toUSA FencingBoard Members urging the re-evaluation of its stance on several issues, including transgender inclusion. Just days later, however,board members voted againstseveral motions to approve an all-female task force to re-evaluate and revise the current transgender policy, in an 8-3 vote. Now, after siding against women fencers seeking protection from trans inclusion, USA Fencing faces potential federal sanctions. This Title IX investigation will be one of the first missions for the newly formed Title IX investigations team, which was officially formed last week. The initiative was announced last Friday with the mission to \"protect female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Joe Concha discusses a heated school board meeting in Maine over the fight to protect girls sports. FIRST ON FOX:The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) referred the Maine Department of Education (MDOE) to the Department of Justice Friday for continuning toallow trans athletesto compete in girls sports. It's thesecond DOJ referralthe state's educational institutions have faced in the last month over the issue, after the Department of Health and Human Services referred MDOE, the Maine Principals' Association and Greely High School March 28. Now, the OCR informed Maine Assistant Attorney General Sarah Forster of a second DOJ referral in a letter Friday. The letter, obtained by Fox News Digital, states that earlier Friday the Maine attorney general's office formally notified OCR it would not sign a resolution agreement to amend the state's gender eligibility policies to comply with Title IX, so the DOJ referral must be made. \"Accordingly, OCR has determined compliance cannot be secured by informal or voluntary means,\" the letter states. \"OCR now refers this matter to the Department of Justice with a recommendation for appropriate proceedings, to enforce all legally available remedies.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM OCR also says it is initiating proceedings to have further funding to the state suspended or frozen. \"This letter also serves as notice to MDOE that OCR is initiating administrative proceedings to suspend, terminate, defer final approval, and/or refuse to grant or continue Federal financial assistance to MDOE,\" the letter said. The DOE announced in a statement that it will initiate an administrative proceeding to adjudicate termination of MDOE’s federal K-12 education funding, including formula and discretionary grants. The USDA recently announced afunding freezeto the state over the issue. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER Maine officialsfiled a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Monday in response to the agency’s decision to freeze funding to the state for its refusal to reverse its transgender athlete participation policy in schools. Fox News Digital has reached out to the Maine attorney general's office for comment on Friday's referral. The state has been under federal pressure in recent months to protect female athletes from trans inclusion after several controversial incidents involving trans athletes and an ongoing feud between President Donald Trump and Maine Gov. Janet Mills. After Trump signed an executive order to ban trans athletes from women's and girls sports Feb. 5, Maine was one of the many states that openly defied the order. The state's divide on trans inclusion was then brought to light when Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby identified a trans athlete in a social media post who won a girls pole vault competition for Greely High School that month. The post brought national awareness, including from Trump, who vowed to halt funding to the state if it continued allowing males in girls sports during a  meeting of GOP governors Feb. 20. The next day, Mills' office released a statement threatening legal action against Trump, who engaged in a verbal spat with Mills over the issue at a bipartisan meeting of governors later that day. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Just hours after that, the U.S. Department of Education announced its initial investigation into the state for potential Title IX violations. Libby was censured for her social media post on the premise she identified a minor by name and with a photo. However, Libby has since filed a lawsuit to have the censure overturned, arguing the trans athlete had already been identified by other media prior to her post. The lawsuit has gone to trial in a Rhode Island district court. In addition to the incident involving the pole vaulter at Greely High School, other instances have affected multiple girls across the state who have had to compete with and share locker rooms with biological males. Maine teen Cassidy Carlisle previously told Fox News Digital about how she had to share a locker room with a trans student while in middle school. She then had to compete with another trans athlete in Nordic skiing last year. \"The defeat that comes with that in that moment is heartbreaking,\" Carlisle said. \"I'm just in shock in a way. I didn't believe it. … I didn't think it was happening to me.\" Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that out of about 600 registered Maine voters, 63% said school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it’s \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" The poll also found that 60% of residents would support a ballot measure limiting participationinwomen’s and girls sports tobiological females. This included 64% of independents and 66% of parents with kids under age 18. Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

McMahon announcedthe news during an interview on Fox News' \"Faulkner Focus.\" \"We have a special Title IX investigations team that is going to be investigating anyone who was associated with this to make sure that this doesn't continue to happen,\" McMahon said. \"The president has made crystal clear that he is not going to tolerate men being able to compete in women's sports, he signed an executive order, and we're upholding Title IX. \"For those who violate these provisions, we will investigate you and take action.\" WHO IS STEPHANIE TURNER? WOMEN'S FENCER WHO KNELT TO PROTEST TRANS OPPONENT AND IGNITED GLOBAL AWARENESS Department of Education spokeswoman Julie Hartman told Fox News Digital that the University of Maryland has \"responsibility\" for the incident as the host site for the event where it took place, as well as Wagner College, which previously rostered the transgender fencer. \"The nation watched as a female competitor bravely took a knee and forfeited an inherently unfair fencing match after discovering that her opponent was a male. No woman should have to recuse herself from a match that she trained diligently for because she fears for her safety. As a tournament host, University of Maryland has a responsibility to follow Title IX by not allowing males to compete in female competitions and occupy female-only intimate facilities,\" Hartman said. \"Similarly, Wagner College has a responsibility to not allow males on female rosters. Unlike the Biden administration, which weaponized Title IX contrary to its meaning to deny female athletes their civil rights, the Trump Administration’s Department of Education and the Department of Justice’s Title IX Special Investigations Team will not allow recipients of federal funding to deny women’s equal opportunity protections under the law.\" This investigation will be one of the first missions for the newly formed Title IX investigations team, which was officially formed in conjunction with the Department of Education and Department of Justice last week. The initiative was announced last Friday with the mission to \"protect female athletes, from the pernicious effects of gender ideology in school programs and activities.\" \"Protecting women and women’s sports is a key priority for this Department of Justice,\" Attorney GeneralPam Bondisaid Friday. \"This collaborative effort with the Department of Education will enable our attorneys to take comprehensive action when women’s sports or spaces are threatened and use the full power of the law to remedy any violation of women’s civil rights.\" TRANSGENDER FENCER SCORES WORLD TITLE OVER 14-TIME WOMEN'S CHAMPION Department of Justice spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre placed blame on former President Biden for the influx of incidents involving trans athletes causing disruptions to women's sports. \"Women across America have spent the last four years disenfranchised by the Biden Administration that allowed men to compete in girls’ sports - jeopardizing their safety, stealing their scholarships, and stripping them of hard-earned awards. The Title IX Special Investigations Team will continue to go after bad actors who continue to endanger young women with woke gender ideology and will leverage every legal resource available to ensure states and organizations follow Title IX to protect women’s civil rights and competitive sports,\" Baldassarre said. The incident involving Turner quickly drew national attention after a video of her taking a knee to protest transgender opponent Redmond Sullivan at the Cherry Blossom Open in Maryland went viral. The footage ignited widespread awareness and backlash against USA Fencing's gender eligibility policies. Turner told Fox News Digital that she came to the decision to take the knee the night before the event, when she checked the competition pools and saw that she would be competing against Sullivan. \"I saw that I was going to be in a pool with Redmond, and from there I said, ‘OK, let’s do it. I'm going to take the knee,'\" Turner said. \"I knew what I had to do because USA Fencing had not been listening to women's objections regarding [its gender eligibility policy].\" The referees then dealt Turner a black card, which represents the most severe penalty, leading to expulsion from the tournament or event for serious rule infractions or unsportsmanlike behavior. Turner said she was then escorted to the bout committee and had to explain what she did. She said the members then handed her a copy of the association's transgender policy and made her sign a document acknowledging the black card. Turner said she signed the document under objection. USA Fencingpreviously provided a statement to Fox News Digital addressing the incident. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"USA Fencing enacted our current transgender and non-binary athlete policy in 2023. The policy was designed to expand access to the sport of fencing and create inclusive, safe spaces. The policy is based on the principle that everyone should have the ability to participate in sports and was based upon the research available of the day,\" the statement read. A USA Fencing spokesperson also told Fox News Digital that Turner was not penalized for her stance against trans inclusion, but simply for refusing to fence. \"In the case of Stephanie Turner, her disqualification was not related to any personal statement but was merely the direct result of her decision to decline to fence an eligible opponent, which the FIE rules clearly prohibit,\" the spokesperson said. USA Fencing then addressed the controversy with a public statement on Thursday, defending its trans-inclusion policies. \"USA Fencing remains committed to fostering an inclusive, respectful community for everyone in our sport. We believe in the principle of creating a safe communities where all athletes, and community members, have a place,\" the statement read. \"While we understand there are a range of perspectives, USA Fencing will continue to engage in respectful, research-based dialogue and review as policy evolves in the Olympic and Paralympic movement as well as domestic law, hate speech of any kind is not acceptable—online or in person. Let's keep the conversation respectful and the strip welcoming to all.\" The organization first enacted its current trans-inclusion policy in 2023. It allows transgender athletes to compete in the women's category at both the junior and senior level after completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment. Proof of compliant hormone therapy must be provided prior to competition, but the organization has taken even further steps to prioritize its trans competitors. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In November 2022, it announceda policyto give preference when selecting host cities for national tournaments to states without laws that \"harm members of LGBTQ communities\" and states that do not \"have laws undermining the reproductive health of women.\" That policy went into effect in the 2023 season, the same year it changed its gender policy. It later released alist of statesthat it intended to \"avoid where possible\" and the states that it flat out would not allow hosting major events. This past December, a nonprofit fencing organization, the Fair Fencing Organization, penned an open letter toUSA FencingBoard Members urging the re-evaluation of its stance on several issues, including transgender inclusion. Just days later, however,board members voted againstseveral motions to approve an all-female task force to re-evaluate and revise the current transgender policy, in an 8-3 vote. Now, after siding against women fencers seeking protection from trans inclusion, USA Fencing finds itself plunged into a global controversy after Turner's viral protest.

    "article_text": "California attorney Erin Friday discusses her confrontation with assembly member Marc Berman over the Trump administration's threat to pull federal funding from states that allow transgender athletes to compete in women's sports. Texas Attorney GeneralKen Paxton'soffice announced Friday that the Dallas Independent School District (\"ISD\") has agreed to an order to ensure the district is not violating state law by allowing trans athletes to compete in girls’ sports. The agreement comes after Paxton requested records from Dallas ISD in February following the release of a video that showed a school district officialexplaining loopholesto a parent and how they could get their biologically male child on a girls' sports team via an altered birth certificate. The video, which was made by an undercover journalist from the outlet Accuracy in Media, showed a Dallas ISD LGBTQ youth coordinator saying that Texas had not made a distinction between providing either an original or updated birth certificate for school sport gender eligibility. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Always refining, you know? They find the loopholes in everything,\" the advisor said in the video. \"I tell people all the time, I will go to jail for saving their child’s life,\" the advisor continued. \"I guess no conservative kids come out gay.\" Later in January, a school official from the Irving ISD was seen telling an undercover journalist about the same loophole in another Accuracy in Media video. HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE \"Could you legally change the gender on a birth certificate? I don't know enough about that subject,\" the Irving ISD official was seen saying in the video. \"If you can get that done, and you turn us a birth certificate that says ‘this gender,’ that's the gender we go with.\" Paxton then requested an extensive list of documents from Dallas ISD and Irving ISD on Feb. 6. On March 31, Paxton filed a legal petition to conduct depositions of key Dallas ISD officials to ensure that the District is not violating Texas law by permitting biological males to participate in girls’ sports. Now, Paxton has come to an agreement with the Dallas ISD to ensure that such loopholes won't be exploited.

Biological males have no place in girls’ sports, and any Texas public schools doing otherwise will be held accountable,\" Paxton said in a statement. In June 2023, Texas passed the Save Women's Sports Act, which bans trans athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and only allows students to compete in the gender category listed on their birth certificate. The law only allows schools to recognize changes made to birth certificates that were made to correct a clerical error.

Despite an impressive 51 years in the sports industry representing the crème de la crème of athletes, Leigh Steinberg's career as an agent and philanthropist is far from over. Steinberg’s approach to athlete management, which includes negotiations for top-tier athletes such as 64 first-roundNFL Draftpicks in just the first eight years of his career, elite MLB players and Olympic athletes, has remained strategic in both hustle and heart for decades.

Among the voices behind the foundation’s public service announcement and educational campaigns are former NFL quarterback Warren Moon, former defensive end Bruce Smith and former linebackerRay Lewis.

    "article_text": "Minimally invasive procedure at the Mayo Clinic uses NeuroOne's cutting-edge brain implant technology. Imagine waking up seizure-free after years of suffering. For 17-year-old Clara Fuller, this dream became reality thanks to groundbreaking brain implant technology. Her journey from relentless seizures to a normal teenage life highlights the incredible potential of medical innovation. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW Brain implant patient Clara Fuller(NeuroOne) At just 13, Clara began experiencing uncontrollable seizures that baffled doctors. Initially misdiagnosed with anxiety and gallbladder issues, she even underwent unnecessary surgery before doctors finally identified the real culprit: epilepsy. But this wasn’t just any epilepsy; Clara had multifocal epilepsy, a rare and severe form that resists all medication. \"Every night I would have seizures, up to 10, and it was just miserable,\" Clara said, recalling the years lost to her condition. Her adolescence was marked by sleepless nights and constant medical challenges, robbing her of the simple joys of being a teenager. For years, there seemed to be no solution in sight. Brain implant patient Clara Fuller(NeuroOne) AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS Everything changed this past summer when Clara became the first pediatric patient to undergo a minimally invasive procedure at the Mayo Clinic using NeuroOne's cutting-edge brain implant technology. The device, known as theNeuroOne OneRF Ablation System, is the first of its kind FDA-cleared technology designed for both diagnosing and treating neurological disorders in one procedure. \"It took them maybe 30 minutes, and the longest part was setting up,\" Clara said about the procedure that transformed her life. Dr. Brin Freund, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, explained Clara’s case in more detail: \"Clara has had a history of seizures that, unfortunately, were uncontrolled with medications. In these cases, surgery may be the only option to reduce and potentially cure the seizure disorder. After a thorough diagnostic evaluation, our group at Mayo Clinic Florida recommended implantation of electrodes (stereoelectroencephalography, or stereo EEG) in the brain to determine where her seizures were originating, in order to develop a surgical plan to treat them. \"Clara and her family were very much in agreement with this plan, given how debilitating her seizures had been and the failure to control her seizures with medications. Clara underwent implantation of NeuroOne electrodes in order to record seizure activity to determine where her seizures were arising from and then to potentially treat them by performing radiofrequency ablation in these areas.\" Brain implant patient Clara Fuller(NeuroOne) HOW ELON MUSK’S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS The NeuroOne system uses ultra-thin electrodes to pinpoint the exact source of seizures in the brain. Once identified, it employs radiofrequency energy to disrupt abnormal electrical signals in problematic brain tissue without permanently damaging surrounding areas. This dual functionality, diagnostic and therapeutic, is what sets it apart from traditional methods that require two separate surgeries. NeuroOne CEO Dave Rosa explained: \"What separates our technology from others is that our device can be used for both the diagnostic part – finding the area of the brain – and then ablating or destroying that tissue, all in the same hospitalization.\" He added that this approach minimizes patient risk by reducing the number of procedures and hospitalizations required. Freund emphasized this advantage: \"Stereo EEG electrodes provide the ability to localize seizure onset with excellent precision as long as the electrode implantation is planned thoroughly and accurately. With regards to the NeuroOne electrodes, they allow for radiofrequency ablation to be performed while the electrodes are still implanted without having to remove them. We can therefore not only localize the seizure onset but provide a surgical treatment and potentially avoid a second and potentially more extensive or invasive procedure such as a craniotomy and resection of brain tissue. \"The NeuroOne electrodes allow us to control the conditions of the ablative procedure. They also provide us more confidence that the electrodes will withstand the duration of the implantation, which would include recording seizure data, performing the ablation and then recording more data after the ablation to ensure that the treatment achieved the intended goal.\" Brain implant patient Clara Fuller(NeuroOne) THIS MIND-READING TECH USING AI CAN CONVERT BRAIN ACTIVITY INTO TEXT The results have been nothing short of life-changing for Clara. Since undergoing the procedure, she has been completely seizure-free. She’s now back to enjoying school, sports and uninterrupted sleep – things most people take for granted but were once unimaginable for her. According to Freund: \"Regarding the implantation itself, she did very well and there were no adverse effects. The first ablation did not cause any acute complications. We then performed a second ablation a few days later after data was recorded from the electrodes demonstrating ongoing seizure activity to ensure that her seizures would not recur. This was also well-tolerated without complications. We have now followed up months after the electrodes were removed and there have been no signs of ill effects due to the implantation or the ablations. She has been seizure-free since the ablation and has done amazingly well.\" Clara’s story offers hope for others living with drug-resistant epilepsy, which affects about one-third of the 3 million Americans with epilepsy. According to Rosa, \"The desire to expand ablation therapy to patients suffering from seizures that do not respond to drug therapy was our driving force.\" NeuroOne One RF Ablation System(NeuroOne) NeuroOne’s innovative technology isn’t just limited to epilepsy treatment. The company plans to expand its applications to other areas, such as pain management for facial pain and lower back pain, using the same RF ablation technology. Rosa also sees potential for treating neurological conditions beyond epilepsy:\"Pain management appears to be the largest opportunity outside of brain ablation.\" Dr. Freund believes this technology could dramatically improve long-term care for pediatric epilepsy patients like Clara: \"This technology could allow for limiting the number of procedures that are required to treat drug-resistant focal epilepsy and also provide immediate feedback as to whether or not a surgical treatment was effective. This could potentially reduce the risk of adverse events by limiting the number of times that a brain surgery would be needed. This technology also allows us to access deeper parts of the brain to provide surgical treatment.\" He added that the impact may soon be widespread: \"In our practice, we are now using these electrodes in every case that requires Stereo EEG for treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy. I think as these types of electrodes are used at more centers and they get more experience, there would be no reason not to use them.\" SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES NeuroOne One RF Ablation System(NeuroOne) Clara's remarkable journey from a life plagued by seizures to one of freedom and normalcy underscores how advancements in medical technology are transforming lives in profound ways. Her story offers hope for those struggling with drug-resistant epilepsy and other neurological conditions. As technology continues to push boundaries, we can expect even more groundbreaking treatments to emerge, offering new possibilities for those who once felt limited by their conditions. In the words of NeuroOne's CEO, this revolutionary technology promises a future where fewer surgeries and safer outcomes become the norm.

    "article_text": "Orthodox Union executive vice president joins 'The Faulkner Focus' ahead of his congressional testimony on antisemitism and the 'March for Israel' rally in Washington, D.C. Our son first met his distant cousin when they were both students in an advanced Jewish studies program overseas. Walking home from their study hall together in the last days of winter, they began to compare notes on how their fathers would conductthe Passover seder. They were shocked to discover that their long-separated families chanted much ofthe Passover Haggadah, the story recited during the festive meal, to identical beautiful but obscure tunes. Though their great-grandfathers had been driven apart by world wars and forced emigration more than a century earlier, not only their faith but even the shared religious flavor and music of their family home was alive and well four generations later. As remarkable as this is, it is not unusual. It is why Jews everywhere will put such emphasis on gathering their families around their seder tables this Passover, knowing that it is around those tables that they will forge the ties of their children to the faith they so cherish. Long-separated families chanted much of the Passover Haggadah, the story recited during the festive meal, to identical beautiful but obscure tunes.(iStock) This assumption is woven into the Passover narrative itself, as the seder commemorates the night before Moses led the Jews out of Egypt. Instead of departing the land directly from the fields and construction sites where they had labored, God insisted that they first spend that entire night in theirfamily homeswhere they could reconnect to both family and faith as they offered and partook in a meal of a sacrificed lamb or goat. AT PASSOVER WE ARE REMINDED WHY RITUALS ARE IMPORTANT It was in their homes around the renewed family table that they would find God and God would find them. The home – not the Temple or the synagogue  – was the setting in which the foundations of faith were laid and it is the setting we replicate each year in our desire to perpetuate that faith, to ensure that future generations continue the tradition. What does the future hold for our tradition andreligion in generalin America? This haunting question gnaws at clergy and parents across faith communities. Studies continue to show serious rates of decline in attendance at religious services across many faiths and denominations. Even the steadying of this decline found in the recent Pew Religious Landscape Study is obviously short term, as that data shows overwhelming gaps in religious observance between younger and older Americans. How do we address this decline? Much can and must be accomplished with engaging and relevant religious services, programs and teachings and by truly compassionate, moral and inspiring faith leaders. Clergy and institutions cannot allow themselves to become or remain stale and must instead promote the truths and traditions of faith along with fresh and compelling ideas and experiences. But – as decades of research have shown – an even more impactful predictor of our children’s religious future is the extent to which we weave our faith into the fabric and atmosphere of our homes and families. FORGET CANCEL CULTURE. EMBRACE PASSOVER CULTURE This was underscored by a recent qualitative study conducted by the Center for Communal Research of the Orthodox Union exploring attrition and connection in American Orthodox Judaism that discovered that even among those who reported that they had left Orthodox Judaism, most continued to maintain the rituals, traditions, and practices they observed at home, toward which they maintained warm and fond feelings. The youngest person at the seder is asking the Four Questions (Mah Nishtanah), which provide the impetus for telling why this night is different from all other nights.(iStock) For example, those who violate Orthodox norms of the sabbath by driving or using their phones continue to recite the Friday night blessings over wine and challah bread, or to hold a Passover seder meal. The extent to which connection is forged at home should lead parents to ensure that their religious home life is warm, full, and meaningful and that it leaves their children with positive associations that fortify religious bonds. Houses of worship, religious schools and institutions play a crucial role inbuilding faith communities, creating the enduring framework for worship and conveying religion’s fundamental truths, but the most consequential houses of faith are our own homes.

That is our seder table, our family table, where – if we play it right – we will plant the seeds for the perpetuation of our faith and the faith of our fathers and where the songs of faith that we sing today will resonate for generations.

    "title": "Trump's got Iran cornered by following Reagan's doctrine",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump answers a question about potential military action against Iran if it doesn't agree to a nuclear deal. The Islamic regime is weak and teetering on its own structural flaws, but no one would know it by the rhetoric coming out ofIran. In fact, just as Moscow did before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tehran is deflecting blame for troubles at home and engaging in double-talk abroad. Ask any Iranian observer and they will tell you that obfuscation has been standard practice of the regime since the Islamic Revolution. While U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is preparing to meet his Iranian counterparts in Oman this Saturday, Tehran continues to quibble over whether the two will ‘talk  or ‘negotiate’ or whether they are ‘indirect’ or ‘direct’. AHEAD OF TRUMP ADMIN-IRAN TALKS, NEW REPORT SAYS IRAN NUCLEAR THREAT RISES TO 'EXTREME DANGER' \"The Islamic Republic resembles a late-stage Soviet Union,\" writes Iran expert Karim Sadjadpour, \"economically and ideologically bankrupt and reliant on repression for its survival.\" To borrow from PresidentDonald Trump, the clerics in Iran  \"do not have the cards.\" Tehran’s proxies such as Hamas and Hezbollah are hurting or on life support, the population is openly defying the authorities, the currency has plummeted, Biden’s policy of looking the other way on sanctions has been reversed by President Trump, and Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahustands ready to deter the regime from acquiring nuclear weapons. History has shown us that authoritarian regimes collapse slowly but spectacularly. A few years before the disintegration of the Soviet Empire in 1989—when deep cracks had begun to appear in the Kremlin—Soviet General Secretary Konstantin Chernenko—who led between Andropov and Gorbachev—stated: \"If anyone harbors the illusion that the Soviet Union can be intimidated by force…. they are gravely mistaken. Such miscalculations could have catastrophic consequences.\" TRUMP HAS A TIMELINE IN MIND FOR IRAN NUKE DEAL, TAPS ISRAEL TO LEAD ANY POTENTIAL MILITARY ACTION To be sure, there are glaring differences between the Soviet Union of the mid-1980s and the Islamic Republic of the mid-2020s. Despite its land grab, Russia is not a revolutionary state. It has consistently sought to create a buffer zone on its western border to deter American power and influence, but it has yet to try and topple America itself. The Islamic regime, on the other hand, is a revolutionary force disguised as a sovereign state. Its stated goal is to export the revolution and establish a global Islamic caliphate. Regionally, it has continued to destabilize the countries in its periphery. Farther away, it has infiltrated western societies through massive cyber propaganda and assassination attempts. There are also fundamental differences between Presidents Reagan and Trump. Where Reagan was forthright about his disdain for communist Russia, relegating \"the evil empire\" to \"the ash heaps of history,\" President Trump has struck a less stringent tone, offering direct talks while also threatening \"strong\" military action. More broadly,Ronald Reaganregarded his presidency as the battle of good vs. evil and feared a world-wide nuclear Armageddon if the Russians were not stopped. President Trump views the world as a series of transactions waiting to be negotiated and fears the loss of American primacy on the world stage. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION A successful outcome for President Trump rests on removing the specter of a nuclear-armed Iran so that he can devote his energies toChinaand the broader trade negotiations. By default, or design, President Trump’s Iran policy has mirrored President Reagan’s doctrine in countering the Soviets. Like the former American president, Trump has consistently increased his leverage against Tehran—the Abraham Accords and military and moral support for Israel are two such examples— so that he can exact a better outcome during negotiations. This strategy is in line with Reagan’s National Security Decision Directives 75 (NSDD 75) a comprehensive set of interdepartmental strategies that countered the Soviets along the three prongs of blocking and rolling back Soviet adventurism, increasing internal pressure, and pursuing direct negotiations from a position of strength. NSDD 75 was further strengthened by Reagan’s firm belief that like a Potemkin village, the Soviets’ power was illusory and that deep flaws hid behind the Kremlin façade. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For his part, President Trump has not wavered from his campaign message that \"Tehran can’t have nuclear weapons.\" He has continued to tighten the noose aroundIranwhile insisting they agree to direct talks. Such a move has rattled Iranian officials, who must now walk the tightrope of repelling American demands while retaining their hold on power. President Reagan’s doctrine of pressuring the Soviets on all fronts did not end well for the USSR, as it collapsed in less than six years after his signing of NSDD 75 in 1983.  Whether the parties in Oman \"negotiate\" face -to-face or \"talk\" in different rooms entirely—Tehran will be well-advised to remember thatMoscowcould not afford to snub Washington and Tehran cannot either.

    "title": "JASON CHAFFETZ: Democrats have made a fatal error opposing DOGE",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump was asked by a reporter on Air Force One about how long DOGE chief Elon Musk will stay in his position. Forced to defend the indefensible, Congressional Democrats are having trouble coming up with rational arguments against fighting the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse being exposed by Elon Musk’sDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE).  The combination of legal nitpicks, personal attacks, and apocalyptic warnings reflects a scattershot approach that is no match for DOGE’s clear populist appeal. Case in point – the April revelation from Valor CEO Antonio Gracias thatDOGEfound some 2.1 million Social Security numbers given out to non-citizens in 2024, many of which were being used to access social programs. Democrats have largely refused to engage with the argument, offering only denials, deflection, and ad hominem attacks. Delaware Senator Chris Coons elicited an eye-roll from Fox News’ Martha MacCallum when he attempted to minimize the fraud in an April 2 interview. Acknowledging just one type of fraud in which the rate is reportedly low, Coons then pivoted to ad hominem attacks on Elon Musk. AMERICANS GRADE DOGE AND ELON MUSK'S EFFORTS WITHIN THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION Biden’s home state senator was left scrambling after MacCallum pressed him on the solvency of the program, asking, \"What have Democrats done to find the waste, fraud, and abuse in Social Security?\" Coons could only dissemble. Democrats have done nothing to prevent insolvency. There is no good argument to be made. Likewise, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is having trouble finding a persuasive line of attack.  He has resorted to claiming Trump and Musk are engaged in deep corruption and self-dealing even as they expose thedeep corruptionand self-dealing of the Democrats’ nonprofit grift machine. Schumer’s tactic is even less effective in light of a recently unearthed clip from 1995 in which Schumer himself sounds unabashedly . . . DOGE.  \"All over where we go, people say, why can’t you stop illegal immigrants and others from coming here,\" says the 1995 Chuck Schumer. \"And the number one answer we give our constituents is when they come here, they can get jobs, get benefits against the law because of fraud,\" he says self-righteously.  It would seem 1995 Schumer made more sense than this 2025 Schumer. Apocalyptic warnings don’t seem to be working, either. Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin called DOGE a coup operating \"from the shadows.\" In February, he filed a FOIA request in which he and Virginia Rep. Gerry Connolly referred toDOGEas an \"oligarchical techno-state.\" In an interview, Raskin claimed, \"it’s a dystopian nightmare unfolding before our eyes.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION That alarmism and dire tone directly conflict with the public mood.  Newsweek reports that 65 percent of Democrats support cutting waste through expenditure reviews. This chilling vision of government collapse contrasts sharply with the $140 billion in savings DOGE has already documented. Voters don’t see the savings as an existential threat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Even Democrats’ derisive references to a young DOGE employee as \"Big Balls\" only served to make the young man a sort of folk hero. Democrats ultimately make a fatal error by opposing DOGE’s success rooting out the fraud with American’s taxpayer dollars. They appear to be for the fraud and waste. And without a viable, reasonable, common-sense alternative, their attacks fall on deaf ears and leave most to wonder, \"What do Democrats really stand for?\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JASON CHAFFETZ Jason Chaffetz is a FOX News (FNC) contributor and the host of theJason In The Housepodcast on FOX News Radio.

    "title": "Anti-American leftists could turn South Korea into the next Venezuela",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. South Korea’s Constitutional Court,by unanimous decision, removed conservative-leaning Yoon Suk Yeol from office on April 4, citing his December 3 declaration of martial law. The election to replace Yoon has been set for June 3. An anti-American, hardcore leftist, Lee Jae-myung of the Democratic Party of Korea, is now the leading candidate to become the 14th president of the Republic of Korea. If Lee gets his way, he will almost certainly try to end South Korea’s alliance with the United States and there will be nothing stopping him from opening his country to more Chinese and North Korean infiltration. He apparently believes in the reunification of Korea, so as president he will probably do all he can to merge his Republic of Korea into the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the formal name of North Korea. TRUMP SAYS HE HAD 'GREAT CALL' WITH SOUTH KOREAN LEADER, SUGGESTS DEAL POSSIBLE The South Korean people as a whole do not share Lee’s agenda, but there are two problems. Lee is absolutely ruthless — he threatened \"horrific mass bloodshed and chaos\" this month if the Constitutional Court freed Yoon — and his party is almost certain to rig the next election. National Assembly employees spray a fire extinguisher towards soldiers at the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea, Wednesday, Dec. 4, 2024. (Cho Da-un/Yonhap via AP) The next election, therefore, could be the last in Korea. All the national elections this decade in South Korea have been marred by fraud. Minjoo, as the Democratic Party of Korea is commonly known, almost certainly changed ballots in at least the last three national elections, starting in 2020. Its \"uniformly narrow\" wins in district after district in the National Assembly contests in 2020 were \"statistically improbable\" as were the results in the National Assembly election last year. The results in both 2020 and 2024 were substantially different than late polling suggested, an indication of ballot fraud. Also, improbable was Lee Jae-myung’s impressive showing in the 2022 presidential election, which he lost to Yoon by a much closer margin than the last polls indicated. What is the possibility of ballot rigging now? \"There’s a very high likelihood of fraud in the upcoming South Korean presidential election, say, 99%, maybe 100%,\" Grant Newsham, a South Korea analyst, told me after Yoon was removed. \"Every stage of the electoral process is susceptible to manipulation and outright fraud. The National Election Commission, the NEC, is a tainted organization and shows no signs of wanting to address vulnerabilities, much less actual evidence of fraud.\" \"The NEC after the Constitutional Court’s ruling is even more powerful,\" Tara O of the East Asia Research Center pointed out in comments to me recently. \"They hate it when anyone mentions election fraud.\" South Koreans mention fraud, with good reason. In October 2023, the South Korean National Intelligence Service tried to penetrate the country’s election infrastructure and found that the NEC’s system was easily compromised. The NIS found it could manipulate votes, vote counts, and electoral rolls, among other things. North Korea’s hackers,including the notorious Lazarus Group, also have penetrated the NEC’s system. South Korea's main opposition Democratic Party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is leading the presidential race. FILE: Lee speaks during the disbandment ceremony of the party's election committee for the parliamentary election at the party's headquarters in Seoul, South Korea, Thursday, April 11, 2024.(AP Photo/Lee Jin-man) Worse, as Newsham points out, \"There’s been no apparent effort to strengthen the NEC network.\" There has been an almost complete failure by government officials and prosecutors to examine and fix what independent observers, such as Newsham, have observed. The failure to fix South Korea’s faulty election infrastructure will have consequences. \"This upcoming election is Minjoo’s best chance ever to get control of the main levers of power and move the Republic of Korea toward a one-party state, its long-term objective,\" says Newsham, also author of\"When China Attacks: A Warning to America.\"\"Will they cheat your way to power with this last piece of the puzzle, the presidency? Of course, they’ll try.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Why should Americans care? The last leftist president, Minjoo’s Moon Jae-in, tried to force Samsung and other South Korean giants to disclose technology, thereby giving China invaluable assistance. Samsung, along with Taiwan’s TSMC, makes the world’s most sophisticated computer chips. Its tech in the hands of Beijing, especially if Taiwan were to fall to China, would give China control of chipmaking worldwide. Geopolitical considerations are even more important, and China and North Korea know what’s at stake. Beijing and Pyongyang have actively engaged in covert efforts to overthrow South Korea’s democracy. As David Maxwell of the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Asia Pacific Strategy reports, \"China’s United Front Work Department has been conducting extensive covert operations in South Korea as part of Beijing’s broader ‘unrestrictive warfare’ strategy.\" What is the possibility of ballot rigging now? \"There’s a very high likelihood of fraud in the upcoming South Korean presidential election, say, 99%, maybe 100%,\" Grant Newsham, a South Korea analyst, told me after Yoon was removed. Maxwell also notes that pro-North Korean elements within South Korea, including political figures, civic organizations and clandestine groups, are receiving \"covert assistance\" from North Korea’s United Front Department and Reconnaissance General Bureau. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP A destabilized South Korea would pose significant challenges to American security interests. As Maxwell, who served five tours of duty in the South with the U.S. Army, points out, \"For North Korea and China, undermining the South Korean government is a means to fracture the Republic of Korea-United States alliance, dismantle the U.S. nuclear umbrella, and ultimately drive Americans forces out of the Korean peninsula and mainland Asia.\" Newsham worries about something that now seems inconceivable but is in fact entirely possible. \"South Korea,\" he says, \"could become the next Venezuela.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GORDON CHANG Gordon G.

    "title": "I survived the Iran hostage crisis. People in countries like Iran desperately need the VOA",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Over the 44 years since my release as a hostage of the Iranian regime, I have witnessed firsthand theunmet aspirations of the Iranian peopleand the vibrant, if often painful, struggles of the Iranian diaspora. Millions of Iranians have consistently and bravely reached for democracy, time and again defying a regime that has proven both unpopular and dangerous. For decades, theVoice of America’s (VOA) Persian servicestood as a beacon of hope amid darkness — a trusted conduit for uncensored news and independent analysis that empowered grassroots communities. Whether during the Green Movement of 2009, the mass protests of 2017-18, the widespread demonstrations of 2019, or the Women Life Freedom protests of 2022 and 2023, VOA’s Persian broadcasts offered a glimpse of a future free from the tyranny of a regime desperate to cling to power and energy to women and men willing to risk life and limb by standing up for our shared values. TIME IS RUNNING OUT TO STOP IRAN FROM MAKING NUCLEAR BOMB: 'DANGEROUS TERRITORY' Yet today, that critical lifeline has beensilenced by a recent executive order.The president’s directive has taken VOA off the air — a move that undercuts not only the aspirations of millions of Iranians but also a comparatively low-cost broader effort to cast off one of the world’s leading, antagonistic, anti-American forces that funds, trains and executes attacks against Americans and American interests around the world. Barry Rosen, former press attaché at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, answers questions at a news conference at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Jan. 27, 1981. Rosen was one of the 52 hostages held in Tehran for 444 days.(AP Photo) This action is emblematic of a broader retreat: earlier this year, thousands of international assistance programs were dismantled, undermining investments in global stability and the promotion of democratic values among the global grassroots. When VOA was on the air, it did more than inform — it challenged state propaganda and gave voice to a people yearning for change. Its silence is a setback not only for those who have long resisted an unjust regime but also for the United States, whose own security is intertwined with the stability of free and open societies. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It’s no wonder that authoritarian states across the globe have publicly cheered for the end of VOA. Chinese state media celebrated the dismantling of VOA, with one state-owned media outlet writing, \"The so-called beacon of freedom, VOA, has now been discarded by its own government like a dirty rag.\" Russia state TV broadcasters celebrated on air after the program’s termination, saying, \"I'm addressing independent journalists: die, animals!\" Countries like China, Russia and Iran know that the loss of a trusted source of global information will enhance their own propaganda machines and allow them to further spread anti-democratic values at the expense of democracies like the United States. They know that the end of VOA is ultimately a win for authoritarianism. Barry Rosen was one of the 52 American hostages were held in Iran for 444 days.(API/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images) Critics argue that domestic challenges should take precedence, particularly amid a faltering global economy, but the abandonment of VOA and international assistance programs surrenders influence to authoritarian forces like Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and terrorist groups like the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with their own media presence inside the Islamic Republic, not to mention their allies in Russia and China. Yielding to these enemies is not smart, strategic or in America’s interests. I have seen the cost of repression and the price of isolation. The Iranian regime that once held me captive continues to imprison the hopes of its citizens with an iron fist. And while the struggle for freedom remains arduous, the resilience of the Iranian people offers a clear mandate: they will not accept silence. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For Republican policymakers, the choice is stark. Restoring a voice like VOA’s and remaining fully engaged around the world is not merely a matter of supporting international assistance; it is a strategic imperative. Re-establishing channels of free information, empowering those who dare to challenge authoritarian rule and supporting individuals and groups around the world who share our commitment to democratic values reflects our national interests and will demonstrate our commitment to standing with those who want to stand with us. Now is the time to write the next chapter in America’s strategic support for international assistance programs that champion freedom, human rights and the free exchange of ideas. The prospects of a free, democratic Iran — and pro-democracy efforts worldwide — depend on it. Barry Rosen is a survivor of the Iran hostage crisis and a co-founder of Hostage Aid Worldwide. He was chief of Voice of America’s Central Asian Service from 1974 to 1978.",

The brief, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division, calls Meta’s fair use defense “a breathtaking request for greater legal privileges than courts have ever granted human authors.” “The use of copyrighted works to train generative models is not ‘transformative,’ because using works for that purpose is not relevantly different from using them to educate human authors, which is a principal original purpose of all of [authors’] works,” reads the brief. “That training use is also not ‘transformative’ because its purpose is to enable the creation of works that compete with the copied works in the same markets – a purpose that, when pursued by a for-profit company like Meta, also makes the use undeniably ‘commercial.’” The International Association of Scientific, Technical, and Medical Publishers, the global trade association for academic and professional publishers,also submitted an amicus briefin support of the authors on Friday.So did the Copyright Alliance, a nonprofit organization representing artistic creators across a broad range of copyright disciplines. Hours after this piece was published, a Meta spokesperson pointed TechCrunch to amicus briefs filed by a smaller group of law professors and the Electronic Frontier Foundation last week supportingthe tech giant’slegal position. In the case, Kadrey v. Meta, authors including Richard Kadrey, Sarah Silverman, and Ta-Nehisi Coates have alleged that Meta violated their intellectual property rights by using their e-books to train models, and that the company removed the copyright information from those e-books to hide the alleged infringement. Meta, meanwhile, has claimed not only that its training qualifies as fair use, but that the case should be dismissed because the authors lack standing to sue. Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria allowed the case to move forward, although he dismissed part of it. In his ruling, Chhabria wrote that the allegation of copyright infringement is “obviously a concrete injury sufficient for standing” and that the authors have also “adequately alleged that Meta intentionally removed CMI [copyright management information] to conceal copyright infringement.” The courts are weighing a number of AI copyright lawsuits at the moment, includingThe New York Times’ suit against OpenAI.

While Trumppaused his tariffincreases for 90 days for various countries — setting the rate at 10% for now — China’s wasraised to 145%, which includes the previous 20% levy. In the letter, published Thursday, these founders urged Trump and Congress to back off the tariff increases, at least until small businesses can find affordable supply chain alternatives. Short of that, they want exemptions for small businesses. The letter was written by Allison Luvera, founder of Juliet Wine, a startup that sells upscale boxed wine direct to consumers. Luvera tells TechCrunch that she faces a surprise $200,000 bill, annually, because she’s buying a key packaging component from overseas and has no U.S. alternative. The letter documents a few other such problems, such as a home-cleaning brand that must source its refillable pouches from overseas for lack of immediate U.S. options. Tariffs threaten to increase the costs of that bit of packaging by 80%. The group of 38 say their businesses generate $800 million annually, employ thousands, and source supplies from both domestic and international manufacturers. They point out that tariffs land more heavily on small businesses. “Unlike large corporations, small businesses lack the leverage to renegotiate supply chain contracts, the margins to absorb steep cost increases, or the capital required to rapidly reconfigure global supply chains,” Luvera wrote. This group wants other small business owners — and anyone else concerned about the economic impact — to help them lobby Congress. They’re asking for a small business assessment — so the government knows the impact. Ideally, they would like small businesses to be exempt from such tariff increases. Failing that, they are lobbying for “grants, tax incentives, or technical assistance” in helping U.S. small businesses solve their supply chain pain caused by Trump’s trade policies. Among the signatories is designer Rebecca Minkoff and Alison Wyatt of the Female Founder Collective. Others include: Emily Doyle and Mei Kwok of Dune Suncare and Yanghee Paik of Rael.

As of Friday morning, there is a 90-day pause on “reciprocal” tariffs placed on most countries. However, 10% base tariffs remain and President Trump has ratcheted up tariffs against China to about 145%. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives slashed his price targets forAppleandTeslabecause tariffs threaten todisrupt both businesses. However, they’re hardly the only U.S. companies expected to feel the pain — and then decide whether to pass that along to customers. The pause on higher tariffs placed on goods imported from Mexico and Canada provides relief to the transportation sector. However, the sector, particularly any EV companies using LFP (lithium iron phosphate) batteries, are highly exposed thanks to the outsized tariffs placed on China imports. We’ll be following the tariffs issue closely, the effects of which won’t bear out for months.

Welp, I have to admit I did not see this deal coming. I’m talking aboutLucid Motorsbuying upsome ofNikola’s assets out of bankruptcy. Yes, Nikola founder and former CEO Trevor Milton, who was convicted of securities fraud and recently pardoned by President Trump,wanted those assets. Milton was met with a frosty reception. But Lucid was the winner, after committing around $30 million in cash and non-cash considerations in exchange for the factory, Nikola’s lease on its Phoenix headquarters, and “certain machinery, equipment and inventory,” according to a filing.

An additional €3 million in debt financing is currently being raised. Nuro, the California-based autonomous vehicle startup,secured $106 millionin a Series E round. The raise, which was a down round, brings Nuro’s total funding raised to $2.2 billion and its valuation to $6 billion. That’s a drop from the $8.6 billion post-money valuation Nuro secured after its $600 million Series D in 2021. Backers in this round are mostly existing institutional investors, including T.

No objections had been filed to the transaction, and Delaware bankruptcy judge Thomas Horan verbally approved it without hesitation. Until, that is, a lawyer piped up on the Zoom call toward the end of the hearing. The lawyer said his client “has some concerns” about the way the auction process was run. Those could be addressed at a later date, he said, but he stressed he didn’t want his client’s silence to “be held against us in the future.” The lawyer was representing ISSO LLC, an entity that Nikola’s founder Trevor Milton has been using to evaluate a bid for his former company’s assets. As part of that process, he was already barred by Nikola from touring its Arizona factory — a decision that Judge Horanstood by last week. While the approval of the sale to Lucid was breezy, the late appearance by Milton’s representative was an ominous sign that he is not done poking at his former company. Fresh off apardonfrom President Donald Trump, which helped him avoid serving a four-year prison sentence, it’s possible that Milton could try to fight a $168 million arbitration award he was ordered to pay Nikola last year. That arbitration award remains a key component of Nikola’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy case. Ahead of the bankruptcy, Nikola was able to settle a class action lawsuit by shareholders related to the false claims Milton made while serving as CEO of the company. But it was able to do so by promising to distribute that arbitration award to those shareholders. Nikola also still has some assets it hopes to sell following the Lucid transaction. Lucid purchased the Coolidge, Arizona, factory and the Phoenix headquarters lease, plus manufacturing equipment. It will also hire 300 or so Nikola employees. But Nikola is still holding on to its inventory of hydrogen-powered big rigs and other assorted equipment. Joshua Morris, a lawyer for Nikola, said in the hearing he was not surprised ISSO and Milton “would want to try and taint these proceedings.” “This is a pattern of behavior that we’ve seen over and over,” Morris said. “We believe these are baseless assertions. When asked for any evidence or any specificity, none was provided. We think Your Honor should view these with a jaundiced eye.” Morris went on to say that he believes Milton’s participation in the sale process appears to be “an attempt to continue to harm the company for a benefit that I can’t quite ascertain.” He added that Milton may be casting a pall on the sale process in hopes of impacting that arbitration award. “Perhaps the play is to render [Nikola] desperate for support cash so that the committee [of unsecured creditors] forces the debtor to attempt or accept some low-ball settlement proposal,” he said. “We just know that we believe we ran the sale process with an openness and involved all parties.” The lawyers left things there and let the hearing come to a close. A spokesperson for Milton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Boston, Massachusetts-based company has raised a $14 million seed round from Eclipse, Riot, and Impatient Ventures. The startup was founded in 2024 by former members of the U.S. Navy, leaders of Amazon Robotics, and iRobot. Blue Water Autonomy joins an ever-growing list of startups that are taking advantage of a splurge in defense investment. Defense tech funding set anew record in 2024, led by Anduril’s $1.5 billion Series F round and Saronic — another autonomous maritime startup that notched a $175 million Series B. The startup says it has developed a full-stack autonomy suite and concept ship designs in “under a year.” It’s already salt-water testing a 100-ton autonomous test vessel just outside of Boston, a spokesperson for the company told TechCrunch. The seed funding will help Blue Water Autonomy expand its engineering team and accelerate testing, according to arelease. “No other company is tackling this problem at the ship level like Blue Water,” Seth Winterroth, a partner at Eclipse, said in a statement. “The team is a rare combination of roboticists and Navy veterans that positions them to be a critical partner to the Navy, the entire Department of Defense, and will have a major impact on the maritime industry.” Topics Sr. Reporter, Transportation Hacked documents reveal guide to serving Elon Musk on private jets OpenAI will soon phase out GPT-4 from ChatGPT Lucid Motors wins bankruptcy auction for Nikola’s Arizona factory and other assets Fintech founder charged with fraud after ‘AI’ shopping app found to be powered by humans in the Philippines Mira Murati’s AI startup is reportedly aiming for a massive $2B seed round The US Secretary of Education referred to AI as ‘A1,’ like the steak sauce WhatsApp introduces new features across chats, calls, and channels © 2025 Yahoo.",

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us A group of ex-OpenAI employees on Friday filed aproposed amicus briefin support of Elon Musk in his lawsuit against OpenAI, opposing OpenAI’s planned conversion from a nonprofit to a for-profit corporation. The brief, filed by Harvard law professor and Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig, names 12 former OpenAI employees: Steven Adler, Rosemary Campbell, Neil Chowdhury, Jacob Hilton, Daniel Kokotajlo, Gretchen Krueger, Todor Markov, Richard Ngo, Girish Sastry, William Saunders, Carrol Wainwright, and Jeffrey Wu. It makes the case that, if OpenAI’s non-profit ceded control of the organization’s business operations, it would “fundamentally violate its mission.” Several of the ex-staffers have spoken out against OpenAI’s practices publicly before. Kruegerhas called on the companyto improve its accountability and transparency, while Kokotajlo and Saunders previously warned that OpenAI is in a“reckless” race for AI dominance. Wainwrighthas saidthat OpenAI “should not [be trusted] when it promises to do the right thing later.” In a statement, an OpenAI spokesperson said that OpenAI’s nonprofit “isn’t going anywhere” and that the organization’s mission “will remain the same.” “Our board has been very clear,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. “We’re turning our existing for-profit arm into a public benefit corporation (PBC) — the same structure as other AI labs like Anthropic — where some of these former employees now work — and [Musk’s AI startup] xAI.” OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit in 2015, but it converted to a “capped-profit” in 2019, and is now trying to restructure once more into a PBC. When it transitioned to a capped-profit, OpenAI retained its nonprofit wing, which currently has a controlling stake in the organization’s corporate arm. Musk’s suit against OpenAI accuses the startup of abandoning its nonprofit mission, which aimed to ensure its AI research benefits all humanity. Musk had sought a preliminary injunction tohalt OpenAI’s conversion. A federal judgedenied the request, but permitted the case to go to a jury trial in spring 2026. According to the ex-OpenAI employees’ brief, OpenAI’s present structure — a nonprofit controlling a group of other subsidiaries — is a “crucial part” of its overall strategy and “critical” to the organization’s mission. Restructuring that removes the nonprofit’s controlling role would not only contradict OpenAI’s mission and charter commitments, but would also “breach the trust of employees, donors, and other stakeholders who joined and supported the organization based on these commitments,” asserts the brief. “OpenAI committed to several key principles for executing on [its] mission in their charter document,” the brief reads. “These commitments were taken extremely seriously within the company and were repeatedly communicated and treated internally as being binding. The court should recognize that maintaining the nonprofit’s governance is essential to preserving OpenAI’s unique structure, which was designed to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits humanity rather than serving narrow financial interests.” Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is broadly understood to mean AI that can complete any task a human can. According to the brief, OpenAI often used its structure as a recruitment tool — and repeatedly assured staff that the nonprofit control was “critical” in executing its mission. The brief recounts an OpenAI all-hands meeting toward the end of 2020 during which OpenAI CEO Sam Altman allegedly stressed that the nonprofits’ governance and oversight were “paramount” in “guaranteeing that safety and broad societal benefits were prioritized over short-term financial gains.” “In recruiting conversations with candidates, it was common to cite OpenAI’s unique governance structure as a critical differentiating factor between OpenAI and competitors such as Google or Anthropic and an important reason they should consider joining the company,” reads the brief. “This same reason was also often used to persuade employees who were considering leaving for competitors to stay at OpenAI — including some of us.” The brief warns that, should OpenAI be allowed to convert to a for-profit, it might be incentivized to “[cut] corners” on safety work and develop powerful AI “concentrated among its shareholders.” A for-profit OpenAI would have little reason to abide by the “merge and assist” clause in OpenAI’s current charter, which pledges that OpenAI will stop competing with and assist any “value-aligned, safety-conscious” project that achieves AGI before it does, asserts the brief. The ex-OpenAI employees, some of whom were research and policy leaders at the company, join a growing cohort voicing strong opposition to OpenAI’s transition. Earlier this week, a group of organizations, including nonprofits and labor groups like the California Teamsters, petitioned California Attorney General Rob Bonta to stop OpenAI from becoming a for-profit. They claimed the company has “failed to protect its charitable assets” and is actively “subverting its charitable mission to advance safe artificial intelligence.” Encode, a nonprofit organization that co-sponsored California’sill-fatedSB 1047AI safety legislation,cited similar concerns in an amicus brieffiled in December. OpenAI has said that its conversionwould preserve its nonprofit armand infuse it with resources to be spent on “charitable initiatives” in sectors such as healthcare, education, and science. In exchange for its controlling stake in OpenAI’s enterprise, the nonprofitwould reportedly stand to reap billions of dollars. “We’re actually getting ready to build the best-equipped nonprofit the world has ever seen — we’re not converting it away,” the companywrote in a series of posts on Xon Wednesday. The stakes are high for OpenAI, which needs to complete its for-profit conversion by the end of this year or next or risk relinquishing some of the capital it has raised in recent months,according toreports.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us ChatGPT became the world’s most downloaded app in March, excluding games, topping the usual contenders for the No. 1 spot, Instagram and TikTok. This is the first time the app has topped the monthly download charts and ChatGPT’s biggest month ever. According to new data, ChatGPT’s installs jumped 28% from February to March to reach 46 million new downloads during March, app intelligence providerAppfiguresrecently reported. That put the app slightly ahead of Instagram, which fell to the No. 2 position. TikTok followed at No. 3. Perhaps helping to drive installs,ChatGPTsaw some notable upgrades in March, including thefirst major upgrade to its image-generation capabilitiesin over a year. This led toa viral moment for ChatGPT in late Marchand early April as users discovered they could generate images and memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the popular Japanese animation studio behind movies like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” OpenAI alsoremoved some safeguardsaround content moderation policies for images in March and upgraded ChatGPT’sAI voice feature. Appfigures noted that ChatGPT’s installs have grown 148% year-over-year when comparing the first quarter of 2021 to Q1 2025. However, the firm speculates that new features weren’t the main driver behind this month’s growth for the popular chatbot. “It’s starting to feel like ChatGPT is becoming a verb, a lot like how Google did in the 2000s, to the point where many don’t think ‘AI’ but rather ‘ChatGPT,’” said Appfigures founder and CEO Ariel Michaeli. “So when there’s excitement about AI — even about competition like Grok, Manus AI, orDeepSeek— many who are not swimming in this topic come for AI but really download ChatGPT.” Because of ChatGPT’s brand recognition, it may be harder for other AI chatbots to take off. That’s partly whyAnthropic’s Claudehas poorer performance on this front than ChatGPT. It’s also whyGrokcould do better than other ChatGPT rivals — not necessarily because it’s better, but because it has someone famous to market it with Elon Musk, and a large platform for distribution with X. Instagram, meanwhile, had previously held the No. 2 spot across both the Apple App Store and Google Play in bothJanuaryandFebruaryof this year, while TikTok remained No. 1. To some extent, TikTok’s download growth earlier this year was driven by concerns over apotential U.S. ban, as consumers rushed to download the app in case it disappeared from the app stores. Now, that ban is on hold as President Trumpaims to cut a dealwith China, where TikTok parent ByteDance is based, to keep the app available to U.S. users. Ahead of this, Instagram had regularly been beating out TikTok for the No. 1 position across global app stores, having been the No. 1 (non-game) app throughout 2024. Instagram’s popularity in the U.S. market has been growing, remaining a fave among U.S. teens. For instance, anew survey of U.S. teensby Piper Sandler released this week found that Instagram is the most-used social app, with 87% monthly usage, compared with 79% for TikTok and 72% for Snapchat. In March, other social apps, including those from Meta, rounded out the top charts, with Facebook and WhatsApp filling out the top five, and others like CapCut, Telegram, Snapchat, and Meta’s Threads in the top 10, alongside Temu. In total, the top 10 apps were downloaded a collective 339 million times in March, higher thanFebruary’s299 million.

Recent findings from the beta version of the YouTube app, firstreported by Android Authority, suggest that the platform is developing a feature to help users stop the endless scrolling through Shorts. YouTube confirmed to TechCrunch that, while this feature is not currently being publicly tested, it is “exploring this for the future,” a company spokesperson said. The code indicates the daily timer allows users to set a specific number of hours. Once the allotted time runs out, Shorts will pause, making it unavailable for the remainder of the day. However, there’s also mention of viewers still being able to see “individual Shorts,” meaning it doesn’t block access to all short videos entirely. YouTube already has a “Take a Break” reminder that users can enable for regular-length videos on the platform. YouTube’s exploration into theanti-doomscrolling areafollows a growing trend among users who are downloading apps dedicated to limiting their screen time. There are even devices, such asthis fob, that temporarily lock certain apps on users’ phones, highlighting the increasing concern about social media addiction. Tech giants such as Apple andGooglealso provide tools for users looking to manage their doomscrolling habits.

Inan April 8 post on X, the fintech giant’s CEO said the company has a customer join for the first 30 minutes of the meeting, which is attended by about 40 leaders “from across Stripe.” “Even though we already have a lot of customer feedback mechanisms, it somehow always spurs new thoughts and investigations,” he wrote. It’s an interesting strategy from Stripe, which was founded in 2010 and is considered to be the highest-valued private fintech in the world (itsmost recent valuation was $91.5 billion). Over the years, startups have complained anecdotally that Stripe is more focused on its larger customers than the smaller ones it set out to serve. But the company must be doing something right.  Stripe’sannual letterin February penned by Collison noted that payment volume in 2024 grew to $1.4trillion, up 38% on the year before. Stripe also added in the letter that it is now used by half of the Fortune 100 companies, underscoring how it has catapulted from a startup working with other startups into a major enterprise player. In the post on X, Collison responded tothe Cloudflare CTO’s questionof when his company would get an invite with a, “Would love to have you guys…will reach out.” To the point of smaller businesses feeling neglected, one investorwrote: “Hi Patrick – you know I admire@Stripe– but you should pay attention to the extent things have degraded for the indie community using Stripe. I messaged support a week ago – no reply, things are super complicated. There’s more stuff, but it’s a mess.” Many praised the move, with oneusernoting: “Love this. Keeps the culture focused on what matters and helps reconciles (sic) reality.” And, naturally, some Stripe customers used the X post to post their complaints (hereandhere).

The DPC will investigate how X processes personal data “comprised” in publicly accessible posts by European users for the purposes of training generative AI models,according to a Reuters report.

    "title": "Parallel Systems is building autonomous electric rail for short-distance freight",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The business of moving goods in the United States is dominated by trucks, which handle about two-thirds of the20.2 billion tons of freightthat’s transported annually.Parallel Systemsfounder and CEO, Matt Soule, wants to change that by putting a modern autonomous and electric twist on the centuries-old railroad system. The Los Angeles-based company is building battery-powered autonomous freight technology that works with existing freight cars and integrates with existing train control software. Soule’s pitch: Parallel’s system makes it less expensive for companies to use rail — not trucks — for short-distance deliveries. Rail has been traditionally underutilized because trains are typically powered by large and expensive locomotives that pull hundreds of freight cars at a time over long distances, Soule explained to TechCrunch. Businesses often turn to trucks for moving freight shorter distances. Parallel Systems developed a system that allows train cars to attach and detach autonomously. This means companies can use Parallel’s tech for a variety of different delivery sizes and humans don’t have to manually connect and disconnect the cars — a dangerous process. Parallel’s tech also allows freight cars to brake significantly quicker than existing trains, Soule added. “We’re using a different physical architecture to accomplish truck competitive economics at small scale rather than big scale,” Soule said. “The vehicle itself is compatible with existing rail infrastructure. It is designed and being demonstrated to operate alongside traditional rail operations. We’re not proposing to replace existing freight trains with this.” Parallel recently was approved by the Federal Railroad Administration to start piloting the tech in Georgia. This program will allow the company to test its tech-enabled trains along a 160-mile stretch between the Port of Savannah in Savannah, Georgia, and multiple distribution sites in the state. Parallel also recently raised a $38 million Series B round led by Anthos Capital with participation from Collaborative Fund, Congruent Ventures, and Riot Ventures, among others. This brings Parallel’s total funding to more than $100 million. The fresh capital will be put toward commercialization with the company hoping to host its initial commercial launch in 2026. Sophie Bakalar, a partner at Collaborative Fund, told TechCrunch that while Parallel doesn’t neatly fit into its consumer-leaning generalist thesis, the firm was intrigued by the company after getting introduced through an existing founder in their portfolio. While Collaborative Fund doesn’t typically invest in this area, shipping and the movement of goods does have a big impact on the consumer companies Collab is usually backing, said Bakalar, adding that it’s hard to pass up a good opportunity — even if it is off-thesis. “I think this team is really uniquely positioned to solve this problem,” Bakalar said. “Just not many folks are going to be able to do it. I think it is a team that has a founder-product fit. It is a massive market and a massive challenge.” Soule doesn’t have a background in rail, specifically. However, he does have a history of working in regulated transportation. He spent 20 years in aerospace, 13 of which were at SpaceX. “We were constantly developing new technologies,” Soule said. “I worked in avionics, which is electronics and software that controls the rocket and got incredibly curious about how all these technologies could benefit other types of industries that have maybe not seen as much innovation.” He launched the company in 2020 and now, five years later, Parallel has built out the technology and is focused on commercialization. While getting companies to change their shipping and distribution strategies could be a large feat, demand for different solutions is there, Soule said. He added that they have had interest from across the globe but plan to focus on the U.S. and Australia for now. This news also comes as the U.S. hangs intariff limbo. If tariffs do end up going through, Bakalar predicts it could stir up more demand for companies like Parallel as companies will likely be looking to cut costs in any way. “This is like a generational innovation in terms of freight and you don’t see a lot of change in the freight industry,” Soule said. “But this is hitting on points that matter.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Hacked documents reveal guide to serving Elon Musk on private jets OpenAI will soon phase out GPT-4 from ChatGPT Lucid Motors wins bankruptcy auction for Nikola’s Arizona factory and other assets Fintech founder charged with fraud after ‘AI’ shopping app found to be powered by humans in the Philippines Mira Murati’s AI startup is reportedly aiming for a massive $2B seed round The US Secretary of Education referred to AI as ‘A1,’ like the steak sauce WhatsApp introduces new features across chats, calls, and channels © 2025 Yahoo.",

Apparently Musk isn’t “interested in conserving fuel” because he “wants to fly as quickly and as direct” as possible. Other inclinations are not surprising at all, like the note to staff not to offer him technical help. “Mr. Musk considers himself self-sufficient and does not need help with technology — if he does, he will ask.” And then there’s the relatable stuff, like his dislike of unexpected Wi-Fi outages and his penchant to take a nap, even on day trips.

That fixation defined a new category of product, the smart thermostat, which is now serving as a beachhead for other companies’ smart home ambitions, even as Google lets Nest whither on the vine,killing productsthat wereonce coreto the company. “Nest is not necessarily doing everything that I set them out to do years ago,” Rogers told TechCrunch. “It’s one of the things when you sell a company.” But Rogers hasn’t been able to shake his obsession with HVAC. “I’ve been thinking about HVAC for a really long time — longer than most,” Rogers said with a chuckle. “And the opportunity is really great. The opportunity to drive efficiency, comfort, better quality of life — those things are all true.” Rogers’ optimism, coupled with his seemingly inexhaustible energy, are what led him to serve as an informal advisor toQuilt, the heat pump startup, even as he waslaunching his own new food waste startup,Mill, and running an investment, philanthropy, and activism organization,Incite, with his wife. “I had a lot going on starting Mill,” Rogers said. Now, with Rogers happy where Mill is at, he said he has time to “go deeper with a company.” In this case, that means joining Quilt as an independent board member. Rogers met Quilt’s co-founder and CEO, Paul Lambert, a few years ago, just before the company raisedits seed round. Since then, they’ve been in near constant communication. “We talked like almost every week, for years,” Rogers said. “Sometimes Paul’s co-founder, Matt, would give me a call from their factory or from a supplier with, ‘Hey, what do you think about X? Give me some advice.’ At some point, it’s good to formalize.” With Rogers taking a board seat, it’s even more likely that Quilt will pick up where Nest left off. The company has already focused heavily onproduct design and user experience. “We’re really trying to do the Nest playbook,” Lambert said. “The world is getting hotter and it is getting richer,” he said. “And as a world gets hotter, people need more cooling, and a heat pump is an AC. And when the world gets richer, people buy more cooling. It’s one of the most dependable things they consume as soon as they have more disposable income.” “Those macro trends are all true,” Rogers agreed. “It’s good to work with a team that’s carrying the torch.” Topics Senior Reporter, Climate Hacked documents reveal guide to serving Elon Musk on private jets OpenAI will soon phase out GPT-4 from ChatGPT Lucid Motors wins bankruptcy auction for Nikola’s Arizona factory and other assets Fintech founder charged with fraud after ‘AI’ shopping app found to be powered by humans in the Philippines Mira Murati’s AI startup is reportedly aiming for a massive $2B seed round The US Secretary of Education referred to AI as ‘A1,’ like the steak sauce WhatsApp introduces new features across chats, calls, and channels © 2025 Yahoo.",

The investment indicates that Spotify is eager for more non-English titles in its limited library as it tries to compete with major players like Audible in the$8.7 billion global audiobooks market. Adoption has been particularly slow in France and the Netherlands, which is why Spotify is starting with these languages. According to the company, less than 3% of French-language books are currently available in audio format, with only 20,000 audiobooks in France compared to about 750,000 physical titles. In the Netherlands, around 15,000 Dutch audiobooks are available out of a physical library of 209,000 titles. The companylaunchedits audiobook service in France and the Benelux region this past October. Spotify believes the slow adoption can likely be attributed to high production costs, which may deter publishers from converting their written works into audio formats.

    "title": "PM aims to pass emergency law to 'take control' of British Steel plant",
    "article_text": "Parliament will be recalled for a rare Saturday sitting to pass an emergency law aimed at saving British Steel's Scunthorpe plant from imminent closure. Sir Keir Starmer said the legislation would allow ministers to \"take control\" of the Lincolnshire site and stop its Chinese owner from closing its blast furnaces. The move opens the door to a full nationalisation of the company at a later stage, with the prime minister saying \"all options\" remained on the table. Talks have been taking place this week to keep production going at the firm, after owners Jingye said its blast furnaces were \"no longer financially sustainable\". MPs and peers are currently on their Easter break and were not due to return until 22 April, but both will now go back to Westminster for the hastily convened sitting. Parliament sat on both Saturday and Sunday on the outbreak of World War Two in 1939. And there have been only five occasions since then when it sat on a Saturday, showing the importance the government is placing on the law. Speaking at Downing Street on Friday, Sir Keir said the government wanted to pass the legislation in a single day, adding the future of the company \"hangs in the balance\". He said steelmaking was \"essential for our future\" and that he would always \"act in the national interest to protect British jobs and British workers\". \"Jobs, investment, growth, our economic and national security are all on the line,\" the prime minister said. The BBC understands from a senior government source the emergency legislation being voted on in Parliament on Saturday would not give ministers the power to nationalise British Steel - another bill would be needed to do that. Chinese company Jingye, which bought British Steel in 2020, says it has invested more than £1.2bn in the company to maintain operations, but has been suffering financial losses of around £700,000 a day. The business department said the new law would give the government powers to order raw materials to keep the site's two running blast furnaces going, with supplies otherwise due to run out in the coming weeks. It added it would also allow ministers to direct the company's board and workforce, and ensure anyone at the plant \"who takes steps to keep it running, against the orders of the Chinese ownership\" can be reinstated if they are sacked. The company announced plans last month to shed jobs at the Scunthorpe site, which employs 2,700 people, blaming \"highly challenging\" market conditions, tariffs and costs associated with lower-carbon production techniques. The government has offered £500m of support to partly fund a switch from blast furnaces to more energy efficient electric arc furnaces. But the offer has been rejected by the company. Earlier this week, the governmentoffered to buy the coking coalto keep the blast furnaces running until a longer-term solution to saving the plant could be found, but was unable to get the company to agree to this in tense negotiations. The business secretary is thought to have lost confidence in the company's Chinese owners, with a government source saying they are \"no longer trustworthy partners\". The move to take control of the company has been welcomed by unions representing employees at the site, with Unite saying it would grant workers a \"reprieve\" while a longer-term solution is worked out. \"Ministers could not have allowed a foundation industry to go under,\" added general secretary Sharon Graham. The GMB union said the government's move looked like the \"first step\" towards nationalisation, which it supported as the \"only way to save the UK steel industry\". Steelworkers' union Community said the government could not allow the UK to become the only country in the G7 group of advanced economies \"without primary steelmaking capacity\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the government of having \"bungled\" the negotiations with British Steel. \"They must have seen this coming for a while,\" she added. \"Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when Parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of Parliament.\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the government's plan was just a \"short-term sticking plaster\". He added that his party would try to amend the emergency legislation to nationalise British Steel immediately, calling public ownership \"the only option we have to save this vital strategic asset\". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said \"nothing should be off the table in this matter of national security\" and added that the recall of Parliament should be seen as \"an opportunity to come forward with a serious plan for the sustainable future of domestic steel production\". The Green Party of England and Wales said it backed nationalisation as the \"only sure way to secure this strategically important sector\". Parliament was last recalled from a scheduled break in August 2021 to discuss the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. The Falkland Islands invasion in 1982 and the proposed Brexit deal in 2019 are two other occasions that have merited recalls. The most recent sitting Saturday was 10 September 2022, when the House of Lords reconvened to pay tribute to the late Queen Elizabeth II. The House of Commons has been recalled 34 times since 1948.",

    "title": "Everyone's jumping on the AI doll trend - but what are the concerns?",
    "article_text": "When scrolling through social media, you may have recently seen friends and family appearing in miniature. It's part of a new trend where people use generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to re-package themselves - literally - as pocket-sized dolls and action figures. It has taken off online, with brands and influencers dabbling in creating their mini-me. But some are urging people to steer clear of the seemingly innocent trend, saying fear of missing out shouldn't override concerns about AI's energy and data use. It may sound complicated, but the process is simple. People upload a picture of themselves to a tool like ChatGPT, along with written prompts that explain how they want the final picture to look. These instructions are really important. They tell the AI tool everything it is meant to generate, from the items a person wants to appear with to the kind of packaging they should be in - which includes mimicking the box and font of popular toys like Barbie. Many online will then personalise it further with their name, job and clothing choices. Though it does not always work, and many have also shared some of the amusing mistakes the tools made, where the action dolls look nothing like them. Like other generative AI tools, image generators are also prone to making things up, and may make assumptions about how someone should look. And it's not just regular people using it - the trend has been seized upon by a wealth of brands online including beauty company Mario Badescu and even Royal Mail. Trends come and go - but by their very nature can make people feel compelled to take part to avoid missing out. \"Generative AI makes it easier and quicker for people to create and jump on trends,\" says Jasmine Enberg, principal social media analyst at eMarketer. She said the technology had made it quicker and easier to make online content, which may have the unexpected effect of quickening the pace at which other social media users get annoyed by it. But she believe AI-driven trends will become a more regular appearance on our feeds \"as the tech becomes a more regular part of our digital lives\". But while its light-hearted nature may have drawn people to it, the trend has drawn criticism from some concerned about its environmental impact. Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London told the BBC ChatGPT is \"burning through energy\", and the data centres used to power it consume more electricity in a year than 117 countries. \"We have a joke in my house that every time we create one of these AI memes, it kills a tree,\" said Lance Ulanoff, US editor of TechRadar,in an article about the trend. \"That's hyperbole, of course, but it's safe to say that AI content generation is not without costs, and perhaps we should be thinking about it and using it differently.\" People have also highlighted concerns copyrighted data may have been used to create the technology which generates images without paying for it. \"ChatGPT Barbie represents a triple threat to our privacy, our culture and our planet,\" said Ms Neff. \"While the personalisation might feel nice, these systems are putting brands and characters into a blender with no responsibility for the slop that emerges.\" And Jo Bromilow, director of social and influencer at PR and creative agency MSL UK, asks: \"is a cute, funny result really worth it?\" \"If we're going to really use AI properly, we have to set guardrails around how we use it conscientiously,\" she said. By Zoe Kleinman, BBC technology editor I started by finding a suggested prompt online - a list of instructions to enter into the AI tool in order for it to generate the image. You have to upload your own selfie with your prompt and you also have to be very specific about what you want, including a list of which accessories you'd like included and what colour you want the box to be. When it came to providing my job title, my first attempt was declined because I included BBC News and was told this violated content policy - I think because currently the BBC does not allow ChatGPT to use its output. Once you do get an image you're likely to want to tweak it further; my first attempt was too cartoon-like. The following, more realistic version made me look considerably older than I am, then too child-like, and I gave up in the end trying to get it to use my actual eye-colour, which kept defaulting back to blue (mine are a blend of hazel and green). It took a couple of minutes to generate each version and overall the process was slower than I would have liked, potentially because of its popularity. It did start to feel like a lot of work for a passing trend, and it isn't perfect - my doll  is expanding out far beneath the supposed packaging.

    "title": "As an Israeli hostage turns 48, his wife waits for blue ticks on her messages",
    "article_text": "When Omri Miran finally opens his WhatsApp account, he's going to receive a torrent of messages. Photos of his daughters. Late night musings from his wife, Lishay, as she lies in bed. Snapshots from an Israeli family life that's gone on for 18 painful months without him. Lishay started sending the messages three weeks after Hamas gunmen violently snatched Omri from their home in Kibbutz Nahal Oz, on 7 October 2023. She calls the chat Notes to Omri. She's lost count of the number of messages she's sent. \"My love, there are so many people you'll need to meet when you come back,\" she wrote at the end of October 2023. \"Amazing people who are helping me. Strangers who have become as close as can be.\" Three-and-a-half months later, she posted a message from the couple's eldest daughter. \"Roni just said goodnight to you at the window like every night. She says you don't hear her and she doesn't see you… You're really missing from her life and it's getting harder for her to deal with your absence.\" Friday was Omri's birthday. His second in captivity. As he turns 48, somewhere in the tunnels of Gaza, Lishay will be writing again, with tales of two daughters who were still babies when he last saw them. Released hostages say Omri was seen alive last July. Lishay's belief in her husband's survival seems unshakeable, but this is the toughest time of the year. Not just Omri's birthday, but also the eve of Pesach (Passover), when Jews celebrate the Biblical story of Exodus, in which Moses led their ancestors out of slavery in Egypt. \"You know, Pesach is the holiday of freedom,\" Lishay says when we meet in a park near Tel Aviv's Hostages Square. \"I don't feel free. I don't think anyone in Israel can feel free.\" In the square itself, Omri's birthday was marked on Friday. The posters calling for his release once listed the hostage's age as 46. Then 47. Danny, Omri's father, crossed out both, and wrote 48. Nearby, preparations were well under way for a symbolic Passover Seder, or ritual feast. A long table was being set, with places for each of the remaining 59 hostages still in Gaza (of whom 24 are believed to be alive). The square is full of symbols: a mock-up of a Gaza tunnel, tents to represent the Nova music festival where hundreds were killed. Along with a merchandise stall to support the families and a \"virtual reality hostage experience\", it's all part of a collective effort to keep the plight of the missing in the public eye and maintain political pressure on the Israeli government. Lishay and her daughters have yet to return to the house where family life was blown apart in a few traumatic hours, 18 months ago. But Lishay says she goes back to Nahal Oz from time to time to commune with her husband. The kibbutz is just 700m from the border with Gaza. It's as close as she can get to Omri. \"I can feel him over there,\" she says. \"I can speak with him.\" After a ceasefire came into effect in mid-January, the border was quiet. Lishay allowed herself to hope, even though she knew Omri's age meant that he would not be among the first to be freed. But the ceasefire ended after just two months. Now the border area - which Israelis call \"the Gaza pocket\" - echoes once more to the sounds of war, reigniting the deepest fears of all hostage families. \"I was terrified,\" she says of her most recent trip. Lishay is careful not to condemn her government, as some hostage families have. But she says that when she realised the war had resumed, she was \"really angry\". When Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Hungary's Viktor Orban last week, he posted that the two men had discussed \"the Hungarian hostage\", a reference to Omri's dual Israel-Hungarian citizenship. For Lishay, it stung. \"I was really, really hard to see this,\" she says. \"Omri has a name. He's not just a hostage.\" In a Passover message delivered on Friday, Netanyahu once again promised the families that hostages would return and Israel's enemies would be defeated. Recent days have seen talk of another ceasefire deal, but it doesn't feel imminent. \"The last time that it happened,\" Lishay says, referring to the first ceasefire deal in November 2023, \"we waited more than a year for another agreement. So now we are going to wait one year more? They can't survive over there.\" For now, it seems her WhatsApp messages to Omri are destined to remain unopened. But that doesn't stop her looking for the grey ticks to turn blue. \"I know someday it'll happen.\" Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in March for his role in pro-Palestinian protests at  Columbia University. \"No state... can be exempt from the obligation not to commit war crimes, not to commit genocide, not to commit ethnic cleansing,\" Mirjana Spoljaric tells the BBC. Mahnoud Khalil's lawyer has accused the government of silencing speech it did not agree with. The mother of a Palestinian killed in an IDF attack on emergency vehicles tells the BBC of her loss. Students, staff, and parents alike are traumatised by what has happened and the destruction that surrounds them.",

    "title": "Sunny and warm UK weather to fade over weekend",
    "article_text": "It has been been dry, sunny and warm since the start of the month for many of us but change is on the way this weekend. Temperatures have been well above the April average this week. Thursday was the warmest day of the year so far in Scotland and Northern Ireland with 23C (73F ) recorded in Aboyne and 22C (72F) in Castlederg. On Friday, the warmth spread further south and Wales recorded its joint highest temperature of the year so far with 22.4C at Usk in Monmouthshire. You will have noticed too some huge temperature swings between day and night. In Aboyne in Aberdeenshire on Thursday there was a temperature difference of 26C. This is known as the diurnal range. It is not rare in spring to have a large diurnal range but it is unusual just how dry and sunny it has been lately. Some spots across southern England haven't seen any appreciable rainfall since 23 March. April has been particularly sunny. The first 10 days have seen over 100 hours in most places. Some spots have seen 80-85% of the monthly average sunshine already even though we are only a third of the way through the month. It is not just April that has been sunny and dry. March was the sunniest on record for England and the third sunniest for the UK as a whole. Records began in 1910. In terms of rainfall, only Scotland recorded more than half the monthly average. Tinajo in Lanzarote on 3 April 2025 when hurricane force winds and heavy rain from Storm Nuria battered the Canaries. Earlier this week Storm Olivier brought more rain and Tenerife South Airport recorded its wettest April day on record. High pressure has been dominating our weather keeping us dry and settled. These large areas of high pressure have blocked weather systems arriving from the west. It has resulted in the jet stream, which normally propels wind and rain towards us being locked in place for an extended period towards the north of the UK. The meandering jet stream across the UK has also been responsible for sending low pressure systems towards the Canaries and Iberia which by contrast have seen some stormy weather. Blue sky and sunshine on Friday afternoon in Harrogate, North Yorkshire Over the weekend, high pressure will pull away towards the east. This will allow weather fronts to approach from the west. By Saturday morning, there will be cloud and outbreaks of rain across the far south-west of England. This rain will then move north-eastwards across Wales, Northern Ireland and into north-west England through the afternoon. Despite a bright start, the western half of the UK will turn rather cloudy. The best of the sunshine and the warmest conditions will hang on across the far south-east of England which could still see highs of 22C (72F). On Saturday night, the cloud and rain will push eastwards across the UK and Sunday will see areas of lingering cloud, sunny spells and showers. It will feel fresher for all with highs of 11-18C. While a lot of the rain will be light and patchy and some places will escape it altogether, this weekend heralds a return to more typical April conditions. Rather than the wall-to-wall sunshine of late, there will be cloud,  fresh south-westerly winds and some more appreciable, much-needed rainfall for the parched ground at the start of the new week. May 2020 was the sunniest calendar month in the UK on record since records began in 1910. It coincided with lockdown. Does a dry, sunny warm spring lead to a wet summer? The weather historian, Philip Eden, has claimed there is a link but most experts are far more cautious. Remember lockdown exercise in the sunshine? The spring of 2020 was the sunniest on record in the UK with May 2020 the sunniest calendar month on record since records began in 1910. The following summer was, albeit circumstantially, wetter, duller and slightly warmer than average. However, while May 2024 was the warmest on record since records began in 1884, the month before, April, was dull and wet and this led to a cooler than average summer with rainfall and sunshine about average. Our BBC Weatherlonger rangeforecast suggests that there is the chance of a short cold spell in May so temperatures for spring as a whole could level out and fall closer to average. Rainfall amounts should be near to below average overall, with April likely to be the driest month. While many parents and children will be pleased to have caught at least a week of school holiday sunshine, the following week looms with no prospect of more sunny and warm April weather. It is set to stay changeable and unsettled with showers and longer spells of rain at times through to the Easter bank holiday weekend. Temperatures will be more or less the seasonal average in the low to the mid teens in Celsius.

    "article_text": "An XL Bully believed to be the same dog which escaped when marksmen opened fire on it last week has been found and put down, police have said. Armed police in Sheffield had attempted to shoot the dog on 3 April after it became \"aggressive\" while officers were investigating reports of a gun being fired at a property in Daniel Hill Street in Hillfoot, but it then fled the scene. Police said that a dog found on Banks Hill Road at about 13:20 BST on Friday was thought to be the same animal and, on the advice of a vet, due to the nature of its injuries, it was decided it should be put down. A force spokesperson said: \"We have informed the dog's owner and the dog has been disclaimed by her.\" The dog's escape last weekled to a city-wide hunt, with officers urging people not to approach it, but to call 999 immediately as it had \"the ability to show aggression and cause harm\". On Tuesday, South Yorkshire Police said forensic testing of blood at the scene where officers had attempted to shoot the doghad confirmed that it had been injured in the incident. Ch Supt Jamie Henderson said: \"I would like to thank the public for remaining vigilant when this animal was loose.\" Five people had been arrested in connection with the initial firearms incident, and two men had since been charged with firearms offences, according to South Yorkshire Police. Ch Supt Henderson said: \"We are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the reported firearms discharge on 3 April.\" Anyone who saw what happened, or who had information which could help the investigation, was asked to contact police.

    "title": "Elton celebrates 'extraordinary' 10th number one album",
    "article_text": "Sir Elton John says he is \"blown away\" after scoring the 10th UK number one album of his career. Who Believes In Angels?, a collaboration with US country star Brandi Carlile, has topped the charts 52 years after the star's first number one. \"It seems quite extraordinary that my career has gone on so long,\" Sir Elton told the BBC. \"It always feels good to top a chart, no matter where it is. And with this album, I'm especially thrilled because I think it's the finest album I've done for a long time.\" Written and recorded over three weeks in late 2023, Who Believes In Angels? has received rave reviews from critics, who have called it \"a gutsy, flamboyant tearjerker\" and a \"late-career high\". But the album had a difficult gestation, which was captured in a warts-and-all documentary posted on YouTube. Sir Elton was seen slamming down his headphones, shouting at his collaborators, ripping up song lyrics and threatening to quit. The star was \"nervous\" and \"irritable\", partly because he was recovering from a hip replacement, he said, but also because he was working in a new way - writing live in the studio with Carlile, producer Andrew Watt and long-term lyricist Bernie Taupin. \"It was an enormous challenge, getting those four people together,\" he told the BBC. \"And the challenge really was at my feet. \"I was very nervous [because] I wanted the album to stand a certain way, but you can't always guarantee it will. \"I think my nerves and my insecurities and my doubt led to a few bad behaviour moments, which was just about frustrations within myself.\" Once they had recorded the opening track, The Rose of Laura Nyro, \"everything fell into place\", Sir Elton said. \"In two and a half weeks, we recorded 14 songs and finished them.\" The album's release was delayed last year after aneye infection left the star with vision difficulties. Last week, he told the Times hecould no longer watch his sons playing rugby. With the album finally released, there has been particular praise for the single Swing For The Fences, which Carlile conceived as rallying call for the LGBTQ community. \"I'm a gay woman, Elton's a gay man and we both have families, and our dreams have come true,\"she told the NME. \"I was thinking, wouldn't it be cool to write an anthem for young gay kids out there that calls them into a bigger, more elegant, more fabulous life? Just like, 'Go, go! Don't let anything hold you back!'\" \"It's a tough time out there for LGBTQ+ people,\" Sir Elton told BBC News. \"At the moment when Brandi wrote this lyric, she wanted to say, 'Listen, fight for yourself. Be proud of yourself who you are, never be ashamed of who you are, and you will win through.'\" In the UK, the album sold more than 15,000 copies in its first two days and was the week's best-seller on vinyl. Sir Elton has now drawn level with Abba, Queen, Kylie Minogue and Michael Jackson on the list of artists with the most UK number one albums. The Beatles and Robbie Williams share the top spot, with 15 number ones apiece. The other new entry in this week's Top 10 came from Cambridge indie band Black Country, New Road, whose third album Forever Howlong debuted at number three. The band's first release since the departure of frontman Isaac Wood, it trades itchy, off-centre guitar riffs for a more soothing, baroque-pop sound, with lyrics that focus on friendship and camaraderie. It was the week's biggest-seller in independent record shops, according to the Official Charts Company. In the singles chart, Alex Warren's Ordinary remained in pole position for a fourth week, with Chappell Roan's Pink Pony Club at number two. Ed Sheeran had the highest new entry at number three with his comeback single Azizam. ThePersian-flavoured trackis the star's 42nd Top 10 hit in the UK - but it's the first time since the start of his career that the lead single from an album has failed to enter the chart number one. BBC Radio Humberside catches up with Calum Scott 10 years after he burst on to the music scene. Berry was the sitcom's last surviving main cast member, and also had two top 10 hit singles. Chloe Qisha's 21st Century Cool Girl blew up after it was covered by US singer Kelly Clarkson. The rapper was accused of repeatedly beating and assaulting a woman who said she was his assistant. The Watford-based rock and roll band has made it to the Britain’s Got Talent live semi-finals.",

Veteran Englishman Rose, whose only previous major title came at the 2013 US Open, carded four birdies and three bogeys in a one-under 71 to set the clubhouse target at eight under. McIlroy hit a superb six-under 66 - the lowest round of the day - to move two behind his European Ryder Cup team-mate and alongside Canada'sCorey Conners. In between them is American superstarBryson DeChambeauon seven under. Defending championScottie Schefflertook 71 shots in a rollercoaster round, putting him on five under in a group alongside England'sTyrrell Hatton,Ireland'sShane Lowryand American debutantMatt McCarty. Norway'sViktor Hovland,Denmark'sRasmus Hojgaardand Australia'sJason Dayare four under after 36 holes. \"If [winning the Masters] was a secret recipe, you'd know it by now,\" said Rose. \"The leaderboard is stacking up with world-class players. \"So you're going to have to play great golf, and you're going to have to go out there and want it and go for it and get after it. It's as simple as that.\" Masters tee-times for round three at Augusta National The Masters 2025 round two recap 'I needed to pee' - Masters debutant takes relief in Rae's Creek Rose has put together a stellar career, in which he has secured 25 professional wins, topped the world rankings and spearheaded Ryder Cup success - but fallen agonisingly short at Augusta on several occasions. Without a tournament victory since February 2023, and a catalogue of missed cuts since, few would have backed Rose to be in such a strong position at the halfway stage. Finding consistency throughout recent seasons has been difficult. But, as he did when coming through qualifying to finish second at last year's Open Championship, and in finishing joint sixth at last year's US PGA Championship, Rose has demonstrated again at Augusta National that he retains the hunger and heart to challenge for the biggest prizes. It is a testament to his quality, experience and nous around one of golf's most testing courses that he goes into the weekend with a fighting chance of victory. \"I think my good is good. I feel like I'm showing much more quality this year in my game than I have done the past couple years,\" said Rose. Rose was the overnight leader after a majestic opening 65 where he threatened to challenge the course record of 63. Failing to back up strong starts at the iconic venue has been a common theme for the former world number one, however. Rose's putter was red hot on the opening day, leading the strokes gained on the green by a substantial margin, and enabling him to open up a three-shot lead. From tee to green he was always not as precise, however, and that continued on Friday as his short game helped keep him ahead of the chasing pack. \"It was a decent day. My wedge kept me in a good spot,\" he added. This video can not be played McIlroy stuns Augusta with superb eagle on 13th Before this week's tournament, McIlroy discussed his pride at showing \"resilience from setbacks\" in his career. This was another example of his ability to bounce back, having spoiled what had been a serene opening roundwith a pair of late double bogeyson Thursday. The mistakes on the 15th and 17th holes - which left him seven shots adrift of Rose - felt like a terminal blow to his chances of finally landing the Green Jacket. Only two men in history have come from that far behind after 18 holes to win - Nick Faldo in 1990 and Tiger Woods in 2005. Then again, this is McIlroy. A player who rarely does anything conventionally and is a magnet for drama. Like he has done several times in the past at Augusta, he showed indomitable spirit to play himself back into contention on Friday. \"I had to keep reminding myself that I played really well [in round one] and I wasn't going to let two bad holes dictate the rest of the tournament for me,\" McIlroy told BBC Sport NI. \"I had a chat with (sports psychologist) Bob Rotella [on Friday morning] and we talked about patience, letting the score come to you.\" This video can not be played 'Discipline and patience' - Watch McIlroy on his second round 66 at the Masters McIlroy made a fast start with a birdie on the par-five second, despite needing to chip out from behind a tree with his second shot. While he was unable to make any further headway on the first nine, the four-time major champion reignited his challenge after the turn. Back-to-back birdies on 10 and 11 encouraged McIlroy before a stunning eagle on the par-five 13th - having knocked a risk-reward long iron out of the pinestraw on to the green - accelerated his recovery. More creative craft saw him to recover from another wayward drive on 14, hitting another iron out of the pinestraw and through hooded branches to escape with a par. Redemption came at 15 in the form of another birdie before he safely negotiated the final three holes without dropping a shot. This year, unlike others, his revival is not too late. \"I've done too many times round here where I've tried to chase too early and shot myself in the foot,\" added McIlroy. \"So it was a really good display of discipline and patience and I feel like that was rewarded.\" This video can not be played 'That's something else!' - Scheffler chips in after finding bushes After opening with a bogey-free 68, world number one Scheffler looked primed to further build on a solid start in his usual unflappable manner. Initially that was the case as the 28-year-old American, playing among the later starters in a blustery wind, marshalled the more difficult conditions with a two-under 34 on the first nine. Then, he became uncharacteristically erratic after the turn. Three birdies - including a fortunate two on the 12th after his tee shot bounced back into play off the bushes behind the green - were outweighed by four bogeys. \"It was challenging on the back nine, so I took advantage of my opportunities, and hopefully I'll clean up the card a little bit on Saturday,\" said the two-time champion, who also won in 2022. LIV golfer Hatton, still searching for his first major victory, knocked in six birdies on a course which he has infamously had a fiery relationship with. However, they were tempered by four bogeys - including on the 17th where he lipped out an 18-inch par putt. \"Tapping in there and hitting a little mark - all of a sudden you look stupid,\" said the 33-year-old Englishman. \"When you hit a decent putt from a foot, you expect it to go in.\" Langer received a standing ovation from the patrons and a warm embrace from Augusta National chairman Fred Ridley as he left the 18th green Two-time champion Bernhard Langer's Masters farewell did not have a dream ending as he fell agonisingly short of the cut on his 41st and final appearance. The 67-year-old German, who won in 1985 and 1993, grimaced as a par putt on the 18th slipped past the hole and left him unclear whether he had done enough to make the weekend. But his three-over total of 147 left him on the wrong side of the cut line - which was two over par. \"Coming up 18 was mixed emotions because I was still inside the cut line, and even when I made bogey, I wasn't sure I'm totally out of there or not,\" Langer said. Langer, who has decided to stop playing because he thinks the course is \"too long\" for him now, received an emotional standing ovation when he walked off for what proved to be the final time. \"I have so many wonderful memories of playing this golf course,\" he said. \"I fell in love with it immediately when I played my first round here, and was fortunate to win twice, and come back here for many, many years.

    "title": "From Dubai to Lidl: How one woman's pregnancy craving launched a craze",
    "article_text": "While on holiday in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) last week, there was only one mission on my mind - getting my hands on the viral \"Dubai chocolate\" bar. If you're on TikTok, you will have seen the bar, which combines the flavours of chocolate, pistachio and tahini with filo pastry, and is inspired by the Arab dessert Knafeh. The original, called Can't Get Knafeh of It, by FIX Chocolatier, has been sold exclusively in the UAE since 2022. It become so popular on social media that it's only on sale for two hours a day and often sells out within minutes. But now imitations, known by the nickname \"Dubai chocolate\", have hit UK supermarkets including Waitrose, Lidl and Morrisons, with some supermarketslimiting the number of barscustomers are allowed to buy. Yezen Alani, who co-owns FIX with his wife Sarah Hamouda, told the BBC the global attention Dubai chocolate was getting was \"flattering and humbling\". The FIX chocolate bar was first imagined by Hamouda in 2021, who craved the flavours while she was pregnant. Alani and Hamouda started developing the bar a year later, running the business alongside their corporate jobs. \"Sarah and I were brought up in the UK and we moved to Dubai 10 years ago, so we've got Western and Arab roots. \"We wanted to create flavours that were inspired by that,\" Alani says. Part of the appeal of the chocolate is its exclusivity - you can only order it using a food delivery app, rather than walking into a shop or grabbing it at the supermarket. It costs around £15 per bar and can only be bought during specific hours of the day to ensure the company can fulfil all their orders. I also saw similar bars sold in many shops in the region, dubbed \"Dubai chocolate\" and adorned with pictures of pistachios and filo pastry. Alani says the \"copycat\" bars are \"very frustrating because people are trying knockoffs, which damages our brand\". One of the reasons for the bar's surge in popularity has been social media - with a viral videoby TikTok user Maria Veherafrom 2023 being cited as one of the main reasons for its rise to prominence. It shows Vehera trying the Knafeh bar for the first time - along with several others made by the same chocolatier - and has been liked nearly seven million times. The way the bar looks is made for social media -  from the attractive orange and green spots on top of the smooth milk chocolate to the crunch sound it makes when you break off a piece. Chocolate combined with pistachio isn't new but the real standout element is the crunchy nature of the filling, with the filo pastry adding a texture and thickness to the bar. Since the Can't Get Knafeh of It bar is only available in one country, other brands have started to sell their versions in the UK, including Swiss chocolate manufacturer Lindt whose Dubai chocolate is being sold for £10 in supermarkets. Since stocking the bar, Waitrose says they've had to introduce a two-bar limit for customersin order to regulate stock levels. Another version has also been sold by Home Bargains, while supermarket Lidl has its own version for £4.99 and is also limiting purchase numbers. One influencerdocumented how the bar been kept behind tillsfor this reason. Having tried the Lindt bar and a couple of other versions being sold in corner shops, there is quite a contrast. The FIX chocolate is billed as a \"dessert bar\" and needs to be kept in the fridge, with a short expiry date like many dairy items. This isn't the case for the others, which have been designed to have a longer shelf life. You can also see the difference in taste and texture - the original bar is almost double the width of the Lindt bar, which is more aligned to the size and shape of a standard chocolate bar. When Alani and Hamouda first started out, they employed one person to fulfil around six to seven orders a day. But since growing in popularity, primarily thanks to TikTok, their business now employs 20 people, who fulfil 500 orders a day. One big talking point has been the price of the product, which is £15 per bar. \"It's all handmade, every single design is done by hand,\" Alani says. \"We use premium ingredients and the process is not like making a Cadbury's bar - you've got the baking, moulding the chocolate to the design and with the filling itself, even the pistachios are hand-picked and processed\". Speakingto Arabian Business last year,Hamouda said: \"My mother used to make Knafeh, and that's something I wanted to capture my own way. \"Knafeh was the first flavour we perfected.

    "title": "Australia's looming election brings housing crisis into focus",
    "article_text": "Buying or renting a homehas become unaffordablefor the average Australian, driven by a perfect storm of astronomical house prices, relentless rental increases and a lack of social housing. With less than a month until the federal election, housing remains among the top issues for voters, and the country's two major parties – theLabor Party and the Liberal-National Coalition- have both pledged to tackle the crisis in a range of ways. Australians are already struggling under cost-of-living pressures and bracing for the effects of Donald Trump's global tariff war. And it remains to be seen whether either party will sway voters with their promise of restoring the Australian dream. Simply put, Australia has not been building enough homes to meet the demands of its rapidly growing population, creating a scarcity that makes any available home more expensive to buy or rent. Compounding the issue are Australia's restrictive planning laws, which prevent homes being built where most people want to live, such as in major cities. Red tape means that popular metropolitan areas like Melbourne and Sydney are far less dense than comparably sized cities around the world. The steady decline of public housing and ballooning waitlists have made matters worse, tipping people into homelessness or overcrowded living conditions. Climate change has also made many areas increasingly unliveable, with natural disasters such as bushfires and severe storms destroying large swathes of properties. Meanwhile, decades of government policies have commercialised property ownership. So the ideal of owning a home, once seen as a right in Australia, has turned into an investment opportunity. In short: it depends where you live. Sydney is currently the second least affordable city in the world to buy a property, according to a 2023 Demographia International Housing Affordability survey. The latest data from property analytics company CoreLogic shows the average Sydney home costs almost A$1.2m (£570,294, $742,026). Across the nation's capital cities, the combined average house price sits at just over A$900,000. House prices in Australia overall have also jumped 39.1% in the last five years - and wages have failed to keep up. It now takes the average prospective homeowner around 10 years to save the 20% deposit usually required to buy an average home, according to a 2024 State of the Housing System report. The rental market has provided little relief, with rents increasing by 36.1% nationally since the onset of Covid - an equivalent rise of A$171 per week. Sydney topped the charts with a median weekly rent of A$773, according to CoreLogic's latest rental review. Perth came in second with average rents at A$695 per week, followed by Canberra at A$667 per week. Immigration and foreign property purchases are often cited as causes for Australia's housing crisis. But experts say that they are not significant contributors  statistically. Many people who move to Australia are temporary migrants, such as international students who live in dedicated student accommodation rather than entering the housing market, according to Michael Fotheringham, head of the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute. \"The impact [of migrants] on the housing market is not as profound as some commentators have suggested,\" Mr Fotheringham tells the BBC. Foreign purchases of homes, meanwhile, is \"a very small issue\" with not much meaningful impact on housing strain, says Brendan Coates, from the Grattan Institute public policy think tank. The latest data released by the Australian Taxation Office supports this, with homes purchased by foreign buyers in 2022-23 representing less than one percent of all sales. \"It's already very difficult for foreigners to purchase homes under existing foreign investment rules. They are subject to a wide range of taxes, particularly in some states,\" Mr Coates explains. Labor and the Coalition have both promised to invest in building more homes – with Labor offering 1.2 million by 2029, and the Coalition vowing to unlock 500,000. Labor announced a A$33bn housing investment plan in their latest budget, which pledges to help first-time homebuyers purchase properties with smaller deposits through shared-equity loans. They have also promised to create more social housing and subsidies to help low-to-moderate-income earners own and rent more affordably. Central to the Coalition's housing affordability policy is cutting migration, reducing the number of international students and implementing a two-year ban on foreign investment in existing properties. Additionally, they have promised a A$5bn boost to infrastructure to support local councils by paying for water, power and sewerage at housing development sites. The Greens' policies, meanwhile, have focused on alleviating pressures on renters by calling for national rent freezes and caps. They have also said that in the event of a minority government, they will be pushing to reform tax incentives for investors. In short, experts say that while both Labor and the Coalition's policies are steps in the right direction, neither are sufficient to solve the housing problem. \"A combination of both parties' platforms would be better than what we're seeing from either side individually,\" Mr Coates tells the BBC. A 2025 State of the Land report by the Urban Development Institute of Australia says the federal government will fail to meet its target of 1.2 million new homes by 2029 – falling short by almost 400,000. The Coalition's focus on reducing immigration, meanwhile, will only make housing marginally cheaper while making Australia poorer in the long-term, according to Mr Coates. The cuts to migration will mean fewer skilled migrants, he explains, and the loss of revenue from those migrants will result in higher taxes for Australians. Decades of underinvestment in social housing also means demand in that area is massively outstripping supply - which at 4% of housing stock is significantly lower than many other countries, according to Mr Fotheringham. There's also concern about grants for first homebuyers, which drive prices up further. While commending the fact that these issues are finally being treated seriously, Mr Fotheringham believes it will take years to drag Australia out of a housing crisis that has been building for decades. \"We've been sleepwalking into this as a nation for quite some time,\" he says. \"[Now] the nation is paying attention, the political class is paying attention.\" Additional reporting and video by Kellie Highet in Sydney It is the latest repatriation of First Nations remains by London's Natural History Museum.

    "title": "Why Beijing is not backing down on tariffs",
    "article_text": "In response to why Beijing is not backing down to Donald Trump on tariffs, the answer is that it doesn't have to. China's leaders would say that they are not inclined to cave in to a bully – something its government has repeatedly labelled the Trump administration as – but it also has a capacity to do this way beyond any other country on Earth. Before the tariff war kicked in, China did have a massive volume of sales to the US but, to put it into context, this only amounted to 2% of its GDP. That said, the Communist Party would clearly prefer not to be locked in a trade war with the US at a time when it has been struggling to fix its own considerable economic headaches, after years of a real estate crisis, overblown regional debt and persistent youth unemployment. However, despite this, the government has told its people that it is in a strong position to resist the attacks from the US. It also knows its own tariffs are clearly going to hurt US exporters as well. Trump has been bragging to his supporters that it would be easy to force China into submission by simply hitting the country with tariffs, but this has proven to be misleading in the extreme. Beijing is not going to surrender. China's leader Xi Jinping told the visiting Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Friday that his country and the European Union should \"jointly resist the unilateral bullying practices\" of the Trump administration. Sanchez, in turn, said that China's trade tensions with the US should not impede its cooperation with Europe. Their meeting took place in the Chinese capital in the hours before Beijing again increased its tariffs on goods from the US - though it has said it will not respond to further US tariff increases. Next week Xi will visit Malaysia, Vietnam and Cambodia. These are all countries which have been hit hard by Trump's tariffs. His ministers have been meeting counterparts from South Africa, Saudi Arabia and India, talking up greater trade co-operation. In addition, China and the EU are reportedly in talks about potentially removing European tariffs on Chinese cars, to be replaced by a minimum price instead, to rein in a new round of dumping. In short, wherever you look, you can see that China has options. And analysts have said that these mutual tariff increases by the two superpowers are now becoming almost meaningless, as they've already passed the point of cutting out much of the trade between them. So, the tit-for-tat tariff increases in both directions have become more like symbolism. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning has, over the past two days, posted images of Chairman Mao on social media, including a clip during the Korean War when he told the US that \"no matter how long this war lasts we will never yield\". Above this, she posted her own comments, saying: \"We are Chinese. We are not afraid of provocations. We won't back down.\" When the Chinese government wheels out Chairman Mao, you know they're getting serious. The US envoy holds a third round of talks with the Russian president as agreement on a truce remains elusive. Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in March for his role in pro-Palestinian protests at  Columbia University. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem found the conditions in both countries no longer merited US protections, a statement says. The ruling potentially paves the way for an early release for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life sentences for killing their parents. The government has said Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported in error, but has resisted returning him to the US.",

    "title": "The Scots magician who inspired the great Houdini",
    "article_text": "Magician John Henry Anderson died in 1874, the same year Harry Houdini was born - yet despite the two never meeting, Anderson was reputedly among the legendary escapologist's greatest inspirations. Anderson - who was born in 1814 in Aberdeenshire's Kincardine O'Neil area - is thought to have been among the first magicians to pull a live rabbit out of a top hat. He became known as \"The Great Wizard of the North\" as his status grew around the world. After Anderson's death, famed illusionist Houdini travelled to Aberdeen, visited his fellow entertainer's grave, and even started to pay for its upkeep. As the 100th anniversary of the Aberdeen Magical Society approaches, Anderson's story is being retold for a new generation. Aberdeen and the north east of Scotland are famed for such things as the oil and gas industry, the Northern Lights, and the humble local food delicacy the buttery. The area's links to the world of magic, however, are far less well known. John Henry Anderson became one of the biggest names in the entertainment world in the mid 19th Century. As a boy, he had joined a travelling theatre company. It is not known who introduced him to magic or indeed taught him. But as his expertise grew he ultimately took his act to audiences around the world. Dave Goulding is a magic historian, escapologist, and Aberdeen Magical Society's vice-president. \"He was the most famous variety act in the UK for a while,\" he told BBC Scotland News of Anderson. \"He took magic off the streets and legitimised it.\" Anderson opened a theatre in Glasgow, but it was later destroyed by fire. He would then travel as far as Australia in the 1860s, and even performed for Queen Victoria. Anderson was seen as a confident self-publicist. \"He realised more people were getting literate, which was then good for publicity,\" Dave said. \"He used to do daft things, such as using reverse moulds on butter to leave beautiful designs.\" Anderson died the same year Houdini was born, but Dave said Houdini was inspired by him \"through his reputation\" in the years that followed. Dave explained: \"He was a great showman. \"This was an idea Houdini liked - a lot of his tricks were for publicity, he was selling his shows.\" Anderson died at the age of 60. Harry Houdini - his professional name - was born as Erik Weisz in Budapest in 1874. He found fame thanks to his extraordinary escapes. These included freeing himself from chains, ropes, and straitjackets under water. His name is still renowned to this day, far beyond just magic circles. Last year's Glastonbury music festival headliner Dua Lipa had a recent track titled Houdini. It features the lyric: \"Catch me or I go Houdini\". In the early 1900s, Houdini made his one and only visit to Aberdeen to perform. While in the so-called Granite City, he took the chance to visit John Henry Anderson's grave in St Nicholas Kirkyard, and was photographed next to it. He decided to fund its upkeep. Houdini died in 1926 at the age of 52. The grave in Aberdeen still stands to this day. Dave Goulding said Anderson's grave is far from forgotten. \"I give it a tidy now and again,\" he said. \"We get American magicians coming over and they want to see Anderson's grave, as he is still known. \"Magicians know each other throughout the world.\" Aberdeen Magical Society was founded in 1926, coincidentally the same year Houdini died. With its centenary approaching next year, special events are being planned, including an exhibition. Thesocietyis appealing for historic magic artefacts that it could borrow and feature. \"Aberdeen and the north east are home to many magic luminaries that are known the world over,\" Dave said. \"As well as highlighting the celebrities, we want to make sure the upcoming exhibition tells the story of our society and its members, from 1926 to the present day. \"If anyone has any posters, programmes or other artefacts relating to the society, we would love to see them.\" Steven Johnson died after being attacked by Derek Pearson in Aberdeen city centre. Jayden Wallace allegedly threw paint at Aberdeen Mosque and Islamic Centre and smashed a window. The Right Reverend Anne Dyer returned to work after suspension and says it is time to move forward. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) said the work would create at least 300 skilled jobs. The railway line between Aberdeen and Dyce has been closed as it is unsafe to run trains under the bridge.",

    "title": "Funny or 'anti-social'? Minecraft Movie director reacts to audience response",
    "article_text": "The Minecraft Movie's director says he has been \"laughing my brains out\" at the trend for audience members shouting out, jumping up and down, and in some cases throwing popcorn in the air during screenings. \"It's way too funny,\"Jared Hess told the New York Timesabout fans' exuberant reactions to the film, some of which have been widely shared. The UK Cinema Association this weeknoted the \"exceptional\" crowd responseto the movie and its characters, but some cinemas have warned that \"anti-social behaviour\" like loud screaming, clapping and shouting \"will not be tolerated\". \"It's been a total blast,\" Hess said. \"I'm just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.\" Based on one of the world's best-selling video games, the film tells the story of four misfits pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld - the place where all players start in Minecraft. Despite underwhelming critics' reviews, the film, which boasts a star-studded cast including Jason Momoa, Jack Black and Jennifer Coolidge, exceeded expectations by making $300m (£233m) globally at the box office on its opening weekend. In the film, Momoa's character Garrett Garrison has to battle a baby zombie riding a chicken on the way to finding the orb that can take him back to the real world. Hess and Black thought it would be funny if Black's character Steve announced everything that happens to him intensely, hence the \"Chicken jockey!\" meme taking off. \"Jack says it with such passion,\" said Hess. \"Everything that comes out of his mouth in the film is spoken with such authority and seriousness, like this is the most important thing anybody has ever heard in their life. \"I think people just love the craziness of it.\" With many young fans joining in, the UK Cinema Association's chief executive Phil Clapp told the BBC this week that most of the behaviour had so far been good-natured. He said it was \"seemingly driven by the desire of young people to share their experiences on social media\". But he did ask \"those taking part to be mindful of the enjoyment of other cinema-goers\". A cinema in Staffordshire banned under-18sfrom attending evening showings without an adult after rowdy behaviour at other screenings went viral on social media, whileanother picturehouse in Oxfordshire warned customers to behave. Hess has been buoyed by the overall reaction, however, describing it as \"a true party\". \"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies - that's what it's all about,\" he said. \"That's why we do it. \"I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening.\" Asked whether he approved of throwing popcorn, he replied: \"No-one's going to get hurt from popcorn. \"Look, when I go to the movies with my kids, it's like a popcorn massacre that happens and they're not throwing anything, but it ends up on the ground regardless.\" Some videos of fan reactions have even shown police being called to cinemas. \"It's weird when you're having too much fun and the cops get called,\"Hess told Entertainment Weekly. \"It's funny because I think it's just literally cheering and throwing popcorn, which is so funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn. \"Yeah, it's hilarious. I've seen so many funny videos. It's great, especially when people are climbing on their friends' shoulders and standing up and cheering for those moments. It's like this crazy anticipation. \"But, man, I'm just glad people are making memories with their friends and families.\" It seems the fictional Devon town of Shipton Abbott is becoming a more dangerous place to live. The cast of Alex Garland's film Warfare on how a tough bootcamp taught them to play a US army unit. Her directorial debut will be shown at the festival, as will the Wes Anderson movie she stars in.

    "title": "Wildfire home scare has owners worried about future",
    "article_text": "A couple who watched in fear as a wildfire raced down a mountainside towards their home have said they worry the threat could get worse with climate change. Fire crews prevented the flames from reaching Alison and Ian Jones' house backing onto the mountain above Treorchy in Rhondda Cynon Taf last month, but the close call has left them wondering how bad it could get. \"The fires in Los Angeles and Spain have been horrendous,\" Ian said. \"We're not on that scale, but who knows what's coming?\" Prof Stefan Doerr, head of Swansea University's Centre for Wildfire Research (CWR), said milder weather in the coming decades means \"more fires and longer fire seasons\". A mild winter allowing for more foliage growth followed by spring droughts has made this year particularly bad for wildfires, he added. Firefighters have had to hold back raging wildfires from properties across Wales this week, with one Ceredigion councillordescribing firefighters as being \"on their knees\". Mr Jones said they were \"concerned every year\" because of mountain fires coming down to the edge of Treorchy, but a blaze on 21 March \"got a little bit close to the house\". His biggest fear, he said, was for the safety of the firefighters. \"They put their lives on the line every time they go up there,\" said Mr Jones, who decided to fell a tree close his roofafter the fire. \"I don't know where the solution is, but we've been here 20-odd years and we have had fires [in the area] every year.\" His wife Alison, who was home alone when the flames came close, said she has trust in the system. \"Most of the firemen know the area so well and they know how to manage it.\" Wildfires also make crews less able respond to a property fire or a road crash. But the workload and danger for fires crews seems to be getting worse. With no major wildfires in Wales last year, Prof Doerr said the fields and mountains have had \"a lot of vegetation growth\". Together with the spring drought it \"makes things pretty bad\" this year, he added. Under the current climate change models for Wales, milder winters will mean more foliage to burn, followed by worsening spring droughts. \"Both are likely to become more extreme and these will make it more likely that we'll have more fires and longer fire seasons,\" he said. Prof Doerr said afire risk website, developed with South Wales Fire and Rescue Service, lets people check conditions in their area. But people are more worried about the impact of fires on wildlife than themselves, according to aCWR survey. \"People tend to be complacent because they think the fire service has things under control,\" said Rhigos photographer Garan Thomas. The 27-year-old said he feared a big fire could spread to properties because Rhigos is surrounded by fields. \"My house backs on a rugby pitch and a farm is close, so who is to say the fires wouldn't get in the back garden?\" Smoke from aRhigos mountain firehung over the town for more than a week in 2023. \"You wonder if there's enough [firefighting] equipment for this and if South Wales fire service is big enough to cope,\" he said. This fire season is different, Mr Thomas added, with fires starting in places not seen before. \"Everyone expects a field or a mountain fire, but the frequency of them this year and the different locations is a bit concerning.\" Farmers have been setting controlled fires in the late winter and spring for generations, said Sian Jones, 64, from Crymych in Pembrokeshire. \"When the mountains are plastered in gorse you have cases like California with people going for a picnic and chucking glass and then you've got a problem,\" she said. She said controlling the gorse is crucial to avoid wildfires. \"Nothing for me is more beautiful that seeing the controlled fires,\" she added. But one such fire this year in the Preseli Hills, near the village of Brynberian, got out of control in high winds. In the south Wales valleys most of the hills above towns like Treorchy are managed by Natural Resources Wales (NRW), not farmers. NRW said the majority of land it manages in the area is forest plantations. \"Most of these fires begin on open ground and can quickly spread into forests, where fuel loads increase the intensity and impact of the fire,\" a spokesperson said. \"In the south Wales valleys, we've developed wildfire risk management plans for our high-risk areas and take practical action, such as putting in fuel breaks where vegetation is removed to slow down or stop the spread of wildfires.” NRW said climate change was a \"key factor\" in the increasing risk of wildfires. \"We are adapting our fire risk management to respond to this – but partnership and public support are essential,\" it said. The fire services, local authorities, public services boards and community groups work to \"assess and reduce wildfire risk through prevention, response, and education,\" NRW added. Butterflies, birds, insects and lizards are among wildlife negatively affected by fires. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has urged the public to \"act responsibly\" in the dry weather NI's chief fire officer says staff are facing \"extremely challenging and exhausting conditions\". Drone footage shows the extent of the wildfire which began blazing in the hills above Cumbernauld on Thursday night. The latest fire at Rimrose Valley Country Park in Sefton is thought to be the ninth within a month.",

    "title": "Disabled staff may lose jobs as government owes businesses thousands, BBC told",
    "article_text": "Businesses employing disabled people say they are owed hundreds of thousands of pounds by the government, and fear they may have to let staff go. Under the Access to Work scheme, companies and employees can apply for grants to help support disabled people in the workplace. But businesses have told the BBC there are backlogs and huge payment delays leaving them out of pocket. One company told the BBC it is owed nearly £200,000 by the Access to Work scheme and is worried it may have to close. Another said it had already been forced to shut down in part due to problems with the programme. Access to Work was highlighted by ministers as a way of boosting the job prospects of disabled people when the government announced multi-billion pound welfare cuts last month. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said they had recently introduced a \"streamlined claims process\" to make swifter payments to businesses. The programme can pay individuals with disabilities and the businesses that employ them for the extra costs associated with being in work.  It covers a broad range of support, from paying for taxis to powered wheelchairs. Yateley Industries is a near 90-year-old charity in Hampshire that employs almost 60 people, most of whom have disabilities, in a range of packaging jobs. It says it is owed £186,000 by the Access to Work scheme. \"It's an existential threat to us,\" says chief executive, Sheldon McMullan.  \"If we don't get it, we could potentially close this magical place forever, and that would be a tragedy for the local community and for the government's agenda more broadly.\" Yateley Industries is part of a nationwide forum of dozens of supported businesses -   companies specialising in employing disabled people. Mr McMullan says many others are affected by the backlog. \"The annoying thing is that it's money that's been granted to us,\" he adds.  \"We have the paperwork saying this is what each person's been awarded, but the claim system is not set up for us to draw down the money effectively.\" Businesses say that as well as poor internal processes at the Department for Work and Pensions, there has also been a large increase in the bureaucracy associated with Access to Work in recent months, with many more forms having to be filled in and then posted – not uploaded or emailed – to the DWP. \"Until ministers realise that they've got this wrong, they're in danger of pushing so many disabled people out of the workplace,\" says Steven McGurk, president of the trade union, Community Union. \"Its very bureaucratic, very difficult to claim - it's the biggest threat to disabled people's employment.\" In Newton Abbott in Devon, a cafe that employed people with learning disabilities shut last month. Its founders say new restrictions and problems with Access to Work contributed to the closure. Sarah Thorp, who set up the No Limits cafe, said the scheme had in recent months started to refuse funding for people who wanted to get some work experience. The decision came despite the local Job Centre recommending the individuals to the cafe.  The change left the business with a shortfall of £800 a week. \"In the last 18 months, we've got 20 people into paid employment, all with disabilities,\" she says. \"When the issues around work experience changed in the last few months, we had to turn people down because we could not fund the support. It just seems really counter-intuitive when all the rhetoric is around getting disabled adults into work.\" When the government unveiled cuts and restrictions to disability benefits last month, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, name-checked the Access to Work scheme as a programme that could help those who will lose out to get a job. As well as businesses being able to claim, disabled people themselves can apply for help under the scheme. They are also suffering delays and backlogs; in October, there were 55,000 outstanding applications, according to the DWP. Some claimants are waiting more than six months to be assessed, with people writing on social media that the delays have resulted in them losing job offers. The Department for Work and Pensions says it prioritises those who are newly offered a job. Lucy Earle, 31, is a social media executive for a museum. She has various disabilities and conditions, including agonising pain in her feet that means she needs to use a wheelchair. It took six months for her claim to be looked at by Access to Work, and then she was assigned a wheelchair that wasn't suitable and left her upper body in pain. \"The last few weeks, I haven't been into work because I can't manage the pain of either using the wheelchair that isn't built for me, or being on my feet and not going very far.\" She credits the Access to Work scheme with helping her stay in employment, but feels they are refusing reasonable requests. \"They're saying that the benefits are being cut so we can push more people into work, but then also Access to Work is having all these problems.\" Steve Darling MP, the Lib Dem Work and Pensions spokesperson, says that while the principles behind Access to Work are excellent, \"individuals and businesses are often covering significant sums from their own savings while waiting for payments from Access to Work, which risks pushing people into debt, or businesses even closing down. This is unacceptable.\" Minister for Social Security and Disability, Sir Stephen Timms, said in February that Access to Work, established in 1994, \"was not in a good shape at the moment.\" Spending on the programme increased by 41% in 2023/24 to £257.8m. \"What we will need to do…is make some fairly significant reforms to Access to Work, look at whether employers can do more. There is quite a big issue here and the current style of Access to Work is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term,\" he said. \"We have to come up with something better and more effective, given the current very high level of demand.\" In a statement, the Department for Work and Pensions said: \"Last month we introduced a new streamlined claims process to ensure outstanding payments are made swiftly to businesses. \"We also continue to work with employers to explore how the Access to Work Plus claims process could be made easier for their employees and so people with high in-work support needs can thrive in employment.\" Graham Watts, who was visiting a Wetherspoon pub, says he felt embarrassed and uncomfortable.

    "title": "Michael Gove gets peerage in Rishi Sunak's resignation honours list",
    "article_text": "Michael Gove is among several ex-Conservative ministers to be given a seat in the House of Lords in Rishi Sunak's resignation honours list. The former housing and education secretary served in the cabinets of four prime ministers but stood down as an MP before last July's general election. Meanwhile, former Chancellor Jeremy Hunt and former Foreign Secretary James Cleverly have been awarded knighthoods. Outside of politics,England fast bowler James Andersonand filmmaker Matthew Vaughn have also been given knighthoods. Now editor of the Spectator magazine, Gove was MP for Surrey Heath for nearly 20 years. A key ally of Sunak, Gove was appointed his secretary of state for levelling up, housing and communities in October 2022, a role he also held under Boris Johnson. Other cabinet roles he has held include environment secretary, justice secretary and education secretary. A leading figure in the Brexit campaign alongside Johnson, the pair had a fraught relationship. In 2016 Gove derailed his friend's leadership hopes by running against him. Later, in the dying days of Johnson's premiership he was sacked after urging the PM to resign. Sir Jeremy was brought in by Liz Truss as chancellor after she sacked Kwasi Kwarteng following her disastrous mini-Budget. His moves to scrap almost all the tax cuts his predecessor had promised helped to calm financial markets. He continued the role under Sunak but returned to the backbenches when Kemi Badenoch took over as Conservative leader. The MP for Godalming and Ash, who first joined the Commons in 2005, has also served as culture secretary in the run-up to the 2012 London Olympics, foreign secretary and health secretary. Cleverly held the role of foreign secretary under Truss and Sunak, before moving to home secretary. He ruled out serving in the shadow cabinet of Sunak's successor, after he was unexpectedly knocked out of the leadership contest before the final round. The other Conservative figures knighted are former Defence Secretary Grant Shapps and former Work and Pensions Secretary Mel Stride, who currently serves as Badenoch's shadow chancellor. Former International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell, who was first elected in 1987, has been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George. Others to be honoured include former Northern Ireland Secretary and Brexit campaigner Theresa Villiers, who is made a dame. Former Chief Whip Simon Hart and former Scottish Secretary Sir Alister Jack, who stepped down as MPs ahead of last summer's general election, are among those to get peerages. Sir Alister served as Scottish secretary from 2019 until he stood down, later receiving a knighthood in Sunak's previous round of honours in July 2024. During the election campaign, he was the most senior politicianto be caught up in the row over government insiders gambling on the date of the poll. The former MP for Dumfries and  Galloway admitted placing three bets but has previously said he did not breach any rules and has not been investigated by the Gambling Commission. Hart spent nearly two years as Sunak's chief whip, responsible for party discipline and ensuring MPs vote with the government. The publication of his parliamentary diaries last month, which included stories of an MP being trapped in a brothel and politicians demanding knighthoods, caused a stir in Westminster and were criticised by some Tories for revealing the secrets of his time in government. Also joining the House of Lords are former Transport Secretary Mark Harper, former Attorney General Victoria Prentis, former Conservative Party chief executive Stephen Massey and Eleanor Shawcross, who ran Sunak's policy unit in Downing Street. Meanwhile, it was confirmed former Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman has been given a peerage,after being nominated by Badenoch. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the honours were \"rewards for the failure of a dreadful Conservative government that was rightly kicked out of office\". The resignation honours list is a tradition that gives outgoing prime ministers the opportunity to nominate people for honours – often key allies, donors and staff. Members of the House of Lords are unelected and scrutinise the work of government. They receive a daily tax-free allowance of £361 plus travel expenses. Most are nominated by party leaders and are vetted by the House of Lords Appointments Commission. Legislation to remove the remaining 92 hereditary peers from the House of Lords is currently making its way through Parliament. When he was in opposition, Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted to abolish the House of Lords and replace it with an elected chamber. However, this pledge was then watered down, with Labour's manifesto only promising to consult on proposals for an alternative second chamber. In December, Sir Keir awarded 30 new peerages, including a string of ex-MPs and his former chief of staff Sue Gray. The former prime minister has handed out 36 honours, including to well-known ex-ministers and former advisors. Parents in England are now entitled to 15 hours a week of free childcare for their two-year-olds. Conservative Sir Alister Jack - who bet on the election date - is set to be given a seat in the Lords. Her peerage is yet to be formally announced but a Conservative source says she will be a \"huge asset\" in Parliament. Watch: Don't call civil servants 'pen-pushers', says Sue Gray",

    "title": "Spanish couple killed in helicopter crash were corporate aristocracy",
    "article_text": "The five Spanish passengers who died in a helicopter crash in the Hudson River were all part of a globetrotting family which had made its mark in the corporate world as well as having close ties to one of Europe's biggest football clubs. Agustín Escobar and Mercè Camprubí Montal died with their three children, reported to be aged four, five and 11. The pilot of the helicopter also died. The parents both worked for Siemens and the company sent its condolences, saying: \"We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustín Escobar and his family died.\" The five were taking a sightseeing ride over New York when the aircraft crashed. Although the family were based in the Catalan city of Barcelona, Mr Escobar was originally from the industrial town of Puertollano in southern Spain. He had recently taken up the post of CEO of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, following a two-year stint as president and CEO of the German technology firm in Spain. Mrs Camprubí Montal, a Barcelona native, also held a senior post at Siemens. She had been a global commercialisation manager with the company for just over three years at the time of her death. She came from an influential family in the city known for textile manufacturing as well as its association with FC Barcelona, one of the biggest teams in world football. Her great-grandfather, Agustí Montal Galobart, was president of the football club in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Her grandfather, Agustí Montal Costa, was also president, a tenure fondly remembered by fans for the arrival of the legendary Dutch player Johan Cruyff at the club in 1973. Last year, Mrs Camprubí Montal's brother, Joan, emerged as a contender to compete for the presidency of FC Barcelona, although in recent weeks his candidacy has faded. The careers of Mr Escobar and Mrs Camprubí Montal saw them travel extensively. Recent posts by Mr Escobar on LinkedIn detail trips to the UK and India, and he described himself as being \"passionate\" about developing high-performing teams to \"positively transform people and organisations\". A 27-year career at Siemens had taken him to postings in Latin America and the United States. Juan Ignacio Díaz, a former colleague at Siemens, described him as \"above all, a family man\" in comments published by news site El Economista. \"He was a loving, fun father, a really great guy.\" Emiliano García-Page, president of the Castilla-La Mancha region, of which Mr Escobar was a native, said he was \"deeply upset\" by news of the deaths. Mr Escobar, he said, had been named a \"favourite son\" of the region. According to Mrs Camprubí Montal's CV, she had been at Siemens for 16 years, also with postings in the United States and Latin America, before moving to the company's energy arm in 2018. \"I thrive in collaborative environments where I can leverage my international perspective,\" she wrote on her LinkedIn profile. The US envoy holds a third round of talks with the Russian president as agreement on a truce remains elusive. Mahmoud Khalil was arrested in March for his role in pro-Palestinian protests at  Columbia University. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem found the conditions in both countries no longer merited US protections, a statement says. The ruling potentially paves the way for an early release for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life sentences for killing their parents. The government has said Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported in error, but has resisted returning him to the US.",

    "title": "Ukraine allies pledge €21bn in fresh military aid",
    "article_text": "Ukraine's European allies have pledged €21bn ($24bn; £18bn) in a new tranche of military support for Kyiv in what they described as \"a critical year\" for the war. More than half of this - €11bn in aid over four years - is coming from Germany. British Defence Minister John Healey said the pledges would send a strong signal to Moscow. The announcement came as members of the Ukraine Defence Contact Group met at Nato's headquarters in Brussels to pledge air defences, missiles and other gear as Europe sought to fill the gap left by the changed priorities of the US under Donald Trump. Europe's defence ministers said they saw no sign of an end to the war, despite Trump's promise of a ceasefire. Support announced on Friday also includes a £450m ($590m) package from the UK and Norway to fund radar systems, anti-tank mines, vehicle repairs and hundreds of thousands of drones for Ukraine. The money is part of a British pledge of £4.5bn made earlier this year. Air defence was a priority in Brussels. Healey said Russian forces had dropped 10,000 glide bombs on Ukraine in the first three months of this year, as well as launching 100 one-way attack drones a day. \"In our calculations, 70% to 80% of battlefield casualties are now caused and inflicted by drones,\" the UK defence secretary said. The German aid package meanwhile has a significant focus on artillery. Boris Pistorius said Germany would send 100,000 rounds of artillery ammunition, 25 infantry fighting vehicles, 15 battle tanks, 100 ground surveillance radars and 120 Man-Portable Air Defense Systems. Berlin will also send four IRIS-T air defence systems with 300 missiles to Kyiv. \"Ukraine needs a strong military and only then can the negotiation process lead to a just and lasting peace,\" the German defence minister told reporters in Brussels. Defence ministers from 50 nations gathered in Brussels for the 27th gathering of the UDCG. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth joined the meeting remotely, telling allies that America appreciated their work. Pistorius said Hegseth's decision was a matter of \"schedules\" rather than \"priorities\", and that the \"most important fact was that he took part\". Other leaders also joined remotely, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Kyiv's defence minister Rustem Umerov, who was in Brussels, thanked Europe for \"taking over the lead on security assistance\" for his country. He also said Hegseth's attendance \"means that the US is continuing its security assistance and is beside us\". Healey, Pistorius and Umerov all accused Russia of dragging its feet over a ceasefire. Healey said it had been more than a month since Russia rejected a US-backed peace settlement. Pistorius said Russia was still not interested in peace. Talks in Europe took place as US special envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia, once more, to press the Kremlin to accept a truce. Witkoff met Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg on Fridayas Donald Trump urged the Russian president to \"get moving\" on a ceasefire in Ukraine. Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin and Witkoff would discuss the Ukraine war, but one should not expect any \"breakthroughs\". On the ground in Ukraine, Russia's defence ministry said on Thursday that its forces had captured the village of Zhuravka, in Ukraine's northern border region of Sumy. Ukrainian officials are yet to confirm this. Earlier this week, President Zelensky said as many as 67,000 Russian soldiers were positioned north of the border of the Sumy region, in preparation for an attack on the city of Sumy. The US envoy holds a third round of talks with the Russian president as agreement on a truce remains elusive. The Russian-American citizen was released in a prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington. The package includes funding for radar systems, anti-tank mines and hundreds of thousands of drones. Russian-American Ksenia Karelina was released by Moscow in return for the freeing of Russian-German Arthur Petrov. The Duke of Sussex visits an orthopaedic clinic in the western city of Lviv.",

    "title": "Global breakthrough to tackle shipping emissions",
    "article_text": "Countries have agreed a global deal to tackle shipping emissions, after nearly ten years of negotiations. The agreement covers the vast majority of the world's commercial shipping and means that starting in 2028, ship owners will have to use increasingly cleaner fuels or face fines. The deal was nearly derailed after Saudi Arabia forced a last minute vote and the US pulled out of talks in London – but it eventually passed on Friday. Small island states and environmental groups were angry that a blanket tax was not  agreed to and called the deal \"unfit for purpose\". Shipping accounts foraround 3% of global emissions. But unlike many other sectors it has struggled to reduce its carbon footprint over the last decade and is reliant on fossil fuels like diesel. But the agreement means it is now the first industry in the world with internationally mandated targets to reduce emissions. The agreement was passed at the UN's International Maritime Organisation (IMO) meeting. It will require owners of large international vessels to increase their use of less carbon intensive fuels or face a penalty of up to $380 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions they emit from burning fuel. Although the final agreement was passed, it had to be put to a vote - an unusual move for UN bodies that usually agree measures by consensus. The vote was requested by Saudi Arabia, who did not support the agreement, and this position was shared by a dozen other oil-producing nations, including Russia. Although they opposed the proposal, they will be bound to implement it because they are members of the IMO. There have been moves to improve the efficiency of ships, but emissions have continued to increase in line with global trade - 90% of which is carried by ships. The most effective measure would be to switch ships away from fossil fuels to green fuels, but that would be very expensive. \"There is no fuel as cheap as diesel that ships use today because when we take crude oil out of the ground, we take out all the nice bits, that's the kerosene for aviation, diesel and petrol for cars,\" said Faig Abbasov, programme director for maritime transport at think tank Transport and Environment. \"Whatever is left at the bottom, that's what ships burn. So no fuel will be as cheap as this because not much energy goes into its production,\" he said. In comparison, the most environmentally friendly fuels like e-kerosene and ammonia are created from initially splitting water atoms to obtain hydrogen, which is a very energy-intensive and costly process. Figures vary depending on the fuel type butthe World Economic Forum estimatesthat these green fuels are 3-4 times more expensive to produce. \"There's still a huge cost gap between the fossil fuels and the zero emission fuels and we need to close this gap. So you need carrots and sticks and in shipping the stick is not that big yet to use sustainable fuels,\" said Refke Gunnewijk, program manager for sustainable transport at the Port of Rotterdam. Some island states also abstained and said the deal was a watered down version of what they hoped for. An earlier proposal to apply a blanket carbon tax or levy - which would have been a world first - was dropped. \"Let us be clear about who has abandoned 1.5°C. Saudi Arabia, the US and fossil fuel allies pushed down the numbers to an untenable level and blocked progress at every turn,\" said Ralph Regenvanu, minister of energy and climate change for Vanuatu. Their disappointment was shared by environmental groups. \"This week, IMO member states squandered a golden opportunity for the global shipping sector to show the world how it can turn the tide on catastrophic climate heating, putting their own goals out of reach\", said Delaine McCullough, president of the Clean Shipping Coalition. It is estimated that the agreement could achieve an 8% reduction in emissions for the sector by 2030, according to the maritime consultancy UMAS. This would be short of the IMO's target agreed two years ago to cut emissions by 20% by the end of the decade. But China and Brazil had previously raised concerns that a levy could result in a significant price increase for basic goods like food. Both countries backed the final deal. Jesse Fahnestock, director of decarbonisation at the Global Maritime Forum, said that the deal was a compromise. \"It is a difficult set of decisions, but it is the first regulation of its kind and that is to be celebrated,\" he said. Fahnestock added it was unclear if the penalties were enough to close the cost gap between the fuel types. \"You may have incentivised shipowners to prepare a bit for the future fuels but whether the signal is strong enough to get the billions of dollars of investment into the production facilities for these fuels - I don't think these regulations will overcome that. I think more will need to be done,\" he said. Any money raised from the penalties will be put into a \"Net Zero\" fund, with money spent on scaling up greener fuels and supporting developing countries. It is this \"redistribution\" that prompted the US delegation to pull out of the talks on Tuesday night. A letter was sent by the US to all countries at the IMO negotiations saying any levy would cause inflation and if it was passed then \"reciprocal measures\" would be taken. Although the US move was at odds with its long-held position at the IMO, it was in keeping with President Trump's push back on climate action seen over the last few months - such as withdrawing the US from the Paris Climate Agreement. But industry and country delegates appeared unperturbed when speaking to the BBC on Wednesday and continued with negotiations. The US only flags 178 cargo ships that represent 0.57% of worldwide commercial shipping tonnage. So if it took the decision not to implement the new proposals it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the funds raised. Now the committee have agreed the measure, it is expected to be formally adopted in October.

    "title": "Why Salah turned down '£500m Saudi move' for Liverpool stay",
    "article_text": "Salah has signed a two-year contract extension with Liverpool Mohamed Salah is staying at Liverpool, bringing one of the season's key storylines to a conclusion. At times, though, it seemed in doubt. So what happened behind the scenes? Was there a Â£500m offer from Saudi Arabia and how did the Egypt forward go from being unsure of his future to expressing delight atsigning a dealthat lasts until he turns 34? Senior football correspondent Sami Mokbel reportsâ¦ When Salah set the cat among the pigeons about his future in November by saying he was'more out than in', he wasn't being disingenuous. Yet it was also not misleading to say theEgyptian always wanted to stay at Liverpool. The two stances weren't necessarily mutually exclusive. It has always been Salah's ambition to extend his eight-year stay at Anfield â and news today of his new two-year contract will bring the 32-year-old's tenure at the club to a decade, should he see out the duration of the terms. But the conditions â for both Salah and Liverpool â had to be right. Thankfully for the club's supporters a middle ground was finally reached. Sources close to the situation indicated a breakthrough in talks between Salah, his representative Ramy Abbas Issa and Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes was reached at the end of March, with the formalities of the deal concluded earlier this week. Indeed, in an interview with BBC Sport, left-back Andy Robertson revealed he only found out about Salah's new contract on Thursday. 'Perfect marriage goes on - Liverpool and Salah need each other' Salah signs new two-year deal with Liverpool 'Liverpool's future is bright with new Salah deal' This video can not be played Are Liverpool taking a gamble with Mohamed Salah? Salah is not taking a pay cut to stay at Liverpool - and will earn close to Â£400,000-per-week. The two-year contract offers him a level of security players of his age are not often afforded. Liverpool have pushed the boat out, but haven't done so on a whim. Salah is a special case. Replacing their talismanic attacker, who has made 54 goal contributions already this season, would be vastly difficult and, more pertinently, an expensive task. Identifying a Salah replacement would be hard enough, but finding the sort of money to pull off such a deal would enter a higher plane of difficulty. What appears to be Trent Alexander-Arnold's pending move to Real Madrid, when his contract expires this summer, would have provided Liverpool with greater financial leeway in their efforts to assemble financial packages to keep Salah and Virgil van Dijk, with the Dutchman expected to sign a new deal in the coming days. Yet, while money is always a factor when it comes to contractual negotiations, it wasn't the determining consideration for a footballer at the peak of his powers. This video can not be played 'Oh my goodness!' - Salah's best Premier League Liverpool goals If money was Salah's determining consideration, he'd have left Liverpool for the Saudi Pro League who, until as recently as last week, still believed they could attract him to the Middle East. The financial lure of a move to Saudi Arabia was clear. The 'homecoming' of one of the greatest and recognisable Arab footballers - and the synergy, and earning power, for all parties was inescapable. Indeed, sources have told BBC Sport that Salah was in line to earn at least Â£500m in Saudi â an eye-popping figure, although still short of the 1bn euros (Â£859m) Real Madrid forward Vinicius Jr was reportedly offered. It was said the option of exploring a Saudi move was first raised with Salah last February - and that door will likely remain open in the future. But, right now, the forward has put sporting ambition ahead of his wallet. Salah's a player at the top of his game - those close to the frontman believe he has at least another three years at the highest level. The evidence suggests as much. His physique is optimum and his levels of professionalism are obsessive. Salah believes he still has more to accomplish in European football too, starting, of course, with winning Liverpool's 20th league title this season. He has ambitions on winning the Ballon d'Or too, with fifth his highest placing in both 2019 and 2022. Salah also wants to win the Champions League again, and ensure Liverpool remain at the pinnacle of English football. Interestingly, it is said another one of the key factors in his decision to re-sign was a desire to compete among the elite to help prepare for Egypt's forthcoming World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations campaigns. It's the sporting challenge that has driven his decision for Salah, although the fact his wife Magi and daughters Makka and Kayan are enjoying life on Merseyside has also been described as a key factor too.

    "article_text": "James Anderson played 188 Tests for England between 2003 and 2024 England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker James Anderson is to be given a knighthood for services to cricket. Anderson, 42, retired from Test cricket last summer with 704 wickets, making him the most successful pace bowler in the format. He made his first appearance for England in a one-day international against Australia in December 2002 before his Test debut in May 2003. Anderson went on to play 188 Tests, 194 ODIs and 19 T20 internationals for England during an international career which spanned over two decades. The Lancashire player has been given the knighthood in former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak'sresignation honours list- the only sportsperson to be given an award. England and Wales Cricket Board chair Richard Thompson said it was \"a really well-deserved honour\" for an \"England legend\" who has \"given so much to our sport\". \"Jimmy's career has been marked by extraordinary achievements, not least in winning the Ashes four times and becoming England's all-time leading wicket-taker,\" he added. \"His skill, determination, and sportsmanship have inspired millions of cricketers and fans alike, in England and around the world. \"This is fitting recognition for a true world great who has given so much to the game on and off the field.\" Anderson's decision to retire from international duty came after England coach Brendon McCullum and captain Ben Stokes decided they want to build an attack for the future. He was given an emotional farewell in the first Test against West Indies at Lord's last July and then immediately joined the England backroom team as a fast-bowling mentor. He no longer has a formal coaching role with England and could still work with the squad during the summer, although he said his priority is to continue his playing career for Lancashire. Anderson has not played since he retired from international cricket but has signed a deal to play for the Red Rose county this summer. Burnley-born Anderson said at the start of the month he was not ruling outplaying for up to three more years. Mark Chilton, Lancashire's director of cricket performance, said they were \"incredibly proud\" of Anderson. \"His contribution to the game of cricket, spanning across three decades, has been immense and he is extremely deserving of this honour,\" he added on the club website. \"His knighthood is testament to the commitment and dedication he has shown to England and to Lancashire, and he has always represented the game of cricket with distinction throughout his career.\" Anderson is currently out with a calf injury picked up during pre-season training which has ruled him out of the first block of County Championship matches. He made his Lancashire debut in white-ball cricket in 2000, before making his red-ball debut in 2002. He has taken 1,114 first-class wickets, 358 in List A cricket and 41 in T20s.

The Irish side ran in eight unanswered tries in a ruthless display as they completely outclassed the United Rugby Championship holders. Scores from Max Deegan, James Lowe, Tommy O'Brien, Hugo Keenan and a penalty try put the hosts in complete control at 33-0 up at the break. Garry Ringrose and Dan Sheehan crossed and Deegan added his second try as Leinster fired another resounding statement of intent to become kings of Europe again. Leinster will face the winner of Northampton Saints versus Castres in Dublin in the last four. Leinster hammer Glasgow to make Champions Cup semis - as it happened Nankivell starts & Bielle-Biarrey back for Bordeaux Furbank back on bench as Saints name unchanged XV The home side were on top from early on and thought they had struck first when Jordie Barrett crashed over, but the try was ruled out after the TMO spotted a knock-on from Ringrose in the build-up. It merely delayed the inevitable as, a few minutes later, some sharp handling created space for Deegan to dive over in the corner. Kyle Rowe looked ready to hit back for Glasgow with a break up the touchline until Barrett tracked back to sweep up his kick through and snuff out the danger. Warriors hopes suffered a double-blow when Adam Hastings was penalised for a deliberate knock-on to prevent Ringrose running in for a try. Yellow card for Hastings, penalty try awarded, and a mountain to climb for Warriors. The home side were ramping it up and made their numerical advantage count by whipping the ball wide to send Lowe over on one wing, then O'Brien over on the other. At 26-0, the contest was effectively over with barely half an hour on the clock. The blue shirts were coming in waves and Glasgow could not escape. Sam Prendergast slipped a deft little kick in behind the Warriors defence for Keenan to score. Half-time came as welcome respite for the beleaguered Warriors, but Leinster kept their foot on the throat, Ringrose bursting through the midfield to score. It was all too easy and Josh van der Flier popped a basketball pass over the top for substitute Sheehan to go over for try number seven. Glasgow's evening went from bad to worse when Matt Fagerson departed with a nasty looking leg injury. Leinster were in no mood to show any sympathy and a lovely chip from substitute Ross Byrne landed into the grateful arms of Deegan to go over for his second try of the evening and round off a powerful, clinical display. After defeats in the past three consecutive finals, Leinster are desperate to get their hands on the Champions Cup. On this evidence, they will take some stopping. Leinster head coach Leo Cullen:\"There is a good desire there at the moment. We had a great day last week at Croke Park, a six-day turnaround and the guys added freshness. \"We're into the next round and Ulster are here next week in the URC. The group is hungry and motivated at the moment and that's what we want to see.\" Glasgow head coach Franco Smith: \"It was the first time we've been completely bullied in every part of the game. \"As coaches, we just keep on telling the players that we need to improve, there is more required, there is a difference between club and international level. \"You play a team like this, you realise that, you understand the work that still needs to be done - may that be in the gym or on the field with decision making, the pressure, how you manage the game when you start losing the contact part of it.\" Leinster:Keenan, T O'Brien, Ringrose, Barrett, Lowe, Prendergast, Gibson-Park, Healy, Kelleher, Furlong, J McCarthy, Snyman, Deegan, van der Flier, Conan.

The 37-year-old Maria is a tricky player, full of drop shots and slices that wrongfoot her opponents, and Boulter could not find a way through in the early exchanges. Two double faults in one game saw Boulter go a double break down and the experienced Maria capitalised, serving out the first set and going 30-0 up against serve in the opening game of the second. However, Boulter clawed her way to a hold and began to look more settled. Her groundstrokes began to find the lines and, after the two exchanged breaks, back-to-back punishing returns of serve gave the Briton the crucial advantage. Boulter forced a decider and barely looked back, reeling off 10 of the last 11 games and dictating the play with her impressive forehand. \"I just kept believing in myself,\" said the 28-year-old. \"It was hard to come out against someone who has played so well on clay and Tatjana made it difficult for me at the beginning. \"I am very proud of myself for how I came back.\" This video can not be played 'She's really in full flow now!' Britain's Kartal wins point with brilliant drop shot Kartal watched GB's triumph against France in last year's qualifiers from afar, having spent three months out with a health issue. However, she has risen up the rankings in the past 12 months, clinching her first WTA title on the way. A good mover on the clay surface, she played confidently in a first set that saw seven breaks of serve in 10 games, adjusting well to Niemeier's pace. Kartal served for the opener at 5-3 but was broken, before two double faults from Niemeier handed the Briton the set. Germany's Niemeier, heavily beaten against the Netherlands and struggling for form, covered her face with her towel at the end of the set as she became visibly upset. Kartal reeled off five games in a row to lead by a set and a break, redirecting the German's pace around the court, before serving out victory. \"I'm super proud of that debut match,\" said Kartal. \"It is obviously nerve-wracking when you're the first match on, but I'm proud of my performance.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Coup leader favourite in presidential race as Gabon goes to the polls",
    "article_text": "An estimated 1 million Gabonese citizens head to the polls on Saturday to vote in the country’s first presidential election since an August 2023 coup ended the 55-year Bongo family dynasty. For Brice Nguema, the junta leader turned civilian head of state, it could be a chance to cement his democratic credentials. Last November, 860,000 registered voters approved a referendum for a new constitution with two seven-year presidential terms and an amnesty for participants in theremoval of Ali Bongo, who had succeeded his father in 2009. Officials are yet to release data on the updated voters’ register but previously said they expected an additional 300,000 new registrations, including from those who have recently come of age. Observer missions are already in place, including that of an eight-person Commonwealth team led by Danny Faure, a former president of Seychelles. Four independents are in the race for president but analysts say the favourite is Nguema. Since coming to power, 50-year-old Nguema has styled himself as an anti-corruption crusader who had to resort to a coup to end an unpopular family dynasty, despite also being a cousin to Bongo. In October 2023, he made headlines for reportedly refusing to draw a salary for the presidency. Those announcements drew plaudits in the oil-rich central African state where a third of the 2.3 million people live in poverty. “Gabonese tell themselves that someone who works with this much ardour is trying to transform things,” Joseph Tonda, a sociologist at Omar Bongo University in Libreville, told Reuters news agency earlier this month. But like his cousin, Nguema has maintained close ties with France even in the face of high anti-French sentiments in the region. And a 2020 investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) revealed multimillion-dollar assets abroad, believed to be the proceeds of embezzlement during his time in the presidential guard. His closest challenger is the ex-prime minister Alain Claude Bilie By Nze, who was in government until the coup. Nze, who has campaigned as a pragmatic veteran seeking to create jobs and reduce the size of government, has also tried to dissociate himself from the old guard. Other candidates include the former tax official Joseph Lapensée Essingone and Stéphane Germain Iloko, previously a member of the former ruling Gabonese Democratic party (PDG). The coup, one of a string of military takeovers in west and central Africa between 2020 and 2023, was well received in Gabon, with many citizens trooping to the streets of Port Gentil and Libreville, its two biggest cities. But there are concerns that Nguema may also be using the same Bongo playbook of muzzling dissent. In particular, the Union for Democracy and Social Integration (UDIS) party – once allied with the former ruling party – has accused the administration of targeting its exiled leader, Hervé Patrick Opiangah, who is the subject of a criminal investigation for alleged incest and undermining state security. Opiangah, 54, a former mining minister, has proclaimed his innocence and filed a complaint with the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights. Edmond Ngadi, a UDIS spokesperson who has called the matter a “state conspiracy”, said Opiangah was being targeted for mobilising for people to vote no during the 16 November referendum. “This is a blatant violation of human rights … he is a Gabonese citizen who simply asks to return to his country safely to be able to secure his family, secure his businesses and also participate in the life of his country,” Ngadi said.",

    "title": "Zimbabwe starts compensating white farmers 25 years after land seizures",
    "article_text": "Zimbabwe has started to make compensation payments to white former farm owners, 25 years after Robert Mugabe’s government began confiscating land. The government paid $3.1m (£2.3m) to a “first batch” of 378 farms, the ministry of finance said in astatementon Wednesday, the first payout under a 2020 agreement to pay $3.5bn in compensation. The remainder of the $311m due to this group of farmers will be paid in US dollar-denominated treasury bonds with two- to 10-year maturities and interest of 2%. That is much lower than the current yield on a two-year US treasury bond of about 3.8%. Zimbabwe’s finance minister, Mthuli Ncube, said: “The payments will continue. We are very serious about this.” Mugabe’s governmentseized more than 4,000mostly white-owned farms,often violently, from about the year 2000 to redistribute to black people in what it claimed was restitution for the dispossession of British colonial rule. However, Mugabe and his croniestook nearly 40%of the 14m hectares (about 35m acres) confiscated for themselves, according to a 2010investigation by a local news outlet, ZimOnline. Agricultural production, which had accounted for 40% of exports,plungedand the economy collapsed, with hyperinflation reaching a staggering500bn%in 2008. Zimbabwe cannot borrow from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund as it has been in arrears since 2000 and 2001, respectively. Governmentdebtwas$21bn late last year, about half of which was arrears and penalties. The compensation payments to the displaced farmers are one of the requirements of international lenders to start a debt restructuring process with Zimbabwe, including a new IMF programme. Andrew Pascoe, who signed the 2020 compensation deal while head of the Commercial Farmers’ Union, confirmed the first payments had been received on 24 March and thanked Zimbabwe’s government, in comments included in the ministry of finance statement. He said: “We are extremely grateful.” However, Tony Hawkins, a retired University of Zimbabwe economics professor, called the payments a “publicity stunt”, noting that the US could block an IMF programme. A US law “restricts US support for multilateral financing to Zimbabwe until Zimbabwe makes concrete governance and economic reforms”, according to theUS state department. Of using government bonds to pay farmers, Hawkins said: “We continue to accumulate arrears because we are unable to service our foreign debt, so we can’t really afford to take on new debt commitments … It’s derisory, the more you look at it.” About 1,000 former farmers had signed up for compensation, said Harry Orphanides, one of Pascoe’s co-negotiators. He said: “Look, it’s not a perfect deal. But there was no other alternative.”",

    "article_text": "NorthernIndiahas been experiencing early extreme heat this week as temperatures topped 40C (104F), including in the capital, New Delhi. Hot weather across the north-west of the country peaked on Tuesday as Barmer, a city in the state of Rajasthan, reached 46.4C – more than 6C above the average maximum in April. New Delhi rose to 40.3C on Wednesday, surpassing 40C for the first time this year. Farther south, Jaipur exceeded 40C for five consecutive days from Sunday, with a maximum temperature of 43C recorded on Wednesday, almost 5C above the average April high. The Indian meteorology bureau said last week that most parts of the country would experience an intense heatwave this summer, with two to four more such days than normal. The extreme early heat this week triggered severe thunderstorms across Bihar, including in Patna. At least 19 people have died in the past two days amid frequent lightning, significant hail and strong winds. There was extensive damage to crops – including wheat, mango and lychee – weeks before the harvest. Stormy conditions are likely to persist across Bihar until Saturday, owing to a low-pressure system over the west-central Bay of Bengal. Meanwhile, parts of eastAfricaare experiencing higher-than-average temperatures, which could approach the April record. InMali, the national meteorological agency issued an extreme weather warning covering the entire country from Wednesday to Sunday. Maximum temperatures are expected to reach 40-47C for at least three consecutive days. This is comparable to average temperatures during the height of summer in June and July, whereas April averages tend to be 38-40C. People have been advised to stay indoors during the hottest hours, wear light-coloured clothing, eat foods with high quantities of liquid and drink plenty of water.",

    "title": "Bobi Wine to run for president in Uganda’s 2026 election ‘if I am still alive and not in jail’",
    "article_text": "The musician turned opposition leader Bobi Wine has said he will stand again against Uganda’s authoritarian leader, Yoweri Museveni, in next year’s presidential elections. Despite being jailed,attacked, shot, and facing threats of violence, including from Museveni’s son, Wine said he felt he had little choice but to try to advance the hope for change that was energising Ugandans, especially the young. “We cannot just give the election to General Museveni,” he said, in an interview with the Guardian. Theleader of the National Unity Platform(NUP) party, Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu,said he expected the January 2026 election, in which Museveni has said he will stand for what would be his seventh term in office, to be bloody. But, with80% of the Ugandan populationunder the age of 35, Wine believes change can come. “Young people are so hopeful because they see the possibility,” he said. “Ultimately the good will of the people is what is important for this election and for our campaign. They know if you are not given freedom, you don’t have a life. “I think I stir a lot of hope because I don’t shut my big mouth, and that’s a big challenge to the regime.” Museveni, now in his eighties, has held power inUgandasince 1986, one of the world’s longest standing national leaders. In 2021, Africa Elections Watch observers saidthe electionwas conducted with “irregularities”, while the US state department called it “fundamentally flawed”. During that campaign,Wine was imprisonedand faced attacks and death threats. “I am worried about what is ahead, of course,” said Wine. “Thinking about how brutal it is going to be, it’s going to be terrible. We are already seeing signs it will be more brutal. Last month, we had a byelection and one of my MPs died. Died after being tortured by the regime. Journalists were very badly beaten and observers from the US embassy had to leave the field.” Among the enemies Wine and his NUP party have made is Museveni’s son, 50-year-old Muhoozi Kainerugaba. He was made chief of defence forces by his father and is also chair of the Patriotic League of Uganda, which lobbies heavily for him to succeed the presidency. Kainerugaba has made vicious public threats to Wine on his social media accounts, including saying he was keeping a bullet specially for him. “More reason to stand up,” said Wine. “I am convinced that if the world stands firm with us, 2026 could be a turning point. If the world leaders do not stand on the side of oppression, but help; if they criticise and distance themselves from the absence of human rights and democracy. “I get the feeling right now that the international community is more concerned with diplomacy rather than democracy; more concerned with business than rights and freedom.” Asked about the impact of Donald Trump’s populist presidency on Uganda,including the huge aid cutsand disinterest in peacekeeping or humanitarian concerns, he said: “We are now in a situation where there is less concern for Africa. If lifesaving aid is cut then how will aid for democracy fare? “Aid cuts are going to impact Uganda very negatively. But also much aid is diverted to support this corrupt regime. The aid that was helping in the health sector is not there any more, so we are going to have less medicines and more bullets,” he said. “We have always been asking for targeted sanctions on those in the regime and asking the US not to send their taxpayers’ money to be spent on things that can be used against our people. The guns that kill our people are American guns. The soldiers who torture our people are trained in America. “So we want America and other world powers not to be partners in crime, but to call out General Museveni for the absence of human rights. “I believe foreign aid, in many ways, is lost in patronage and corruption, only to have the burden of repayment on next generations. The aid we need is in sticking to values. If we have a good democracy and human rights, that will bring leaders who will stamp down on corruption. “We lose two-thirds of our annual revenue to corruption – 10tn Ugandan shillings ($2.5bn) stolen every year. That figure comes from the inspector general of government, so it could be more. He could be giving us a low figure. Whichever way, it is huge,” he said. “Our debt burden is heavy, it will take us 97 years to pay back and of course we have new predators. But I believe it is fixable. We have human resources, we have a young, energised population. We are endowed with natural wealth and resources. If corruption is stamped out, we can make every sector work that could rise us from poverty and indebtedness.” Wine’s wife, the author Barbie Itungo Kyagulanyi, was a linchpin in Wine’s first parliamentary campaign in 2017 and joined him on the presidential campaign trail in 2020 with her own manifesto for women’s rights. Their struggle was documented in theOscar-nominated film Bobi Wine: The People’s President, which was released after the 2021 campaign. Kyagulanyi washeld under an illegal house arrestwith her husband in 2021. But she is “energised” for 2026 he says. “Those who are fighting for freedom, I’m afraid they don’t decide [to do it], they don’t apply. It happens to them,” he said. “For me, I would like to be making music not risking my life, but there is no choice. “While I am here speaking to you, I don’t know if I’ll be in jail next week. If I am still alive and not in jail by the end of this year, then I’m going to run for presidency, again.”",

    "title": "Homeland security apparently used British man’s tattoo to identify alleged gang members",
    "article_text": "A British man was shocked to discover that a photo of histattoowas included in a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to identify alleged members of a notoriousVenezuelancriminal gang, Tren de Aragua (TdA). Earlier this week, 44-year-old Pete Belton, who lives in theEnglishcounty ofDerbyshire,told the BBCthat he was stunned to find a photo of his forearm tattoo featured in aDHS documentamong nine images of tattoos intended to assist in “detecting and identifying” TdA members. Belton, who says he has no connection to the Venezuelan group, expressed his disbelief, telling the BBC: “I’m just an average middle-aged man from Derbyshire.” The DHS document notes that open source material “has depicted TdA members with a combination of the below tattoos”. Among them appears to be Belton’s tattoo, which depicts a clock face with the date and time of his daughter’s birth, as well as other tattoos which include stars, skulls, the Michael Jordan “jump man” basketball logo, crowns and guns. TheBBCreported that it conducted reverse image searches for some of the tattoos depicted, and discovered that several of the images first appeared on tattoo websites with no obvious connections to TdA or any other gangs. They traced the image of Belton’s tattoo to an Instagram post from nearly a decade ago by a Nottingham-based UK tattoo artist. Belton said that initially he found it a “bit strange” and a “bit funny” that his tattoo was in the document, but now he is worried about a planned family trip to Miami in August with his wife and daughter, and that it might turn into a “six month all-inclusive holiday to Guantánamo”, he said. “In my head I’m thinking if I’m working in border force and I saw me walking through I’d think ‘hey-up we’ve got one, he’s the one in the document’,” he told the BBC. The DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. The same image of Belton’s tattoo also seemingly appears in a reportby the Texas department of public safety(DPS) about TdA activity. The DPS also did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Since taking office, the Trump administration has deportedhundreds of individualsit alleges to be members of TdA, sending them to a notorious prison in El Salvadorwithout evena court hearing. But in recent weeks, questions regarding theaccuracy of these gang allegations have intensified, with lawyers arguing that some of the deportees weremisidentifiedas a result of their tattoos. Lawyers representing one man say that he was deported over acrown tattoo, which he says is inspired by the Real Madrid football team logo. In another case, lawyers representing a makeup artist say he was deported after officials deemed his crowntattoos proof that he was a memberof TdA.

    "title": "Mexico to send water to Texas farmers as US treaty threat grows",
    "article_text": "Mexicowill make an immediate water delivery toTexasfarmers to help make up its shortfall under a treaty that has strained US relations and prompted tariff threats byDonald Trump, said Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, on Friday. Mexico is looking for alternatives to comply with the 81-year-old water-sharing treaty with the US, Sheinbaum said in her regular news conference. A proposal had already been sent to US officials, she said. Mexico’s failure to keep up with its water deliveries hassparked a diplomatic spat with its largest trading partner. A day earlier, Trump said he would escalate consequences, including tariffs or sanctions on Mexico. Texas Republicans have also publicly accused Mexico of flagrantly ignoring the treaty, harming farmers who depend on the water deliveries. “ForTexasfarmers who are requesting water, there will be an immediate delivery of a certain number of millions of cubic meters that can be provided according to the water availability in the Rio Grande,” Sheinbaum said. Under the 1944 treaty that outlines water sharing between the two countries through a network of interconnected dams and reservoirs, Mexico must send 1.75m acre-feet of water to the US from the Rio Grande every five years. An acre-foot of water is enough to fill about half an Olympic swimming pool. The treaty’s current five-year cycle is up in October, but Mexico has sent less than 30% of the required water, according to data from the International Boundary andWaterCommission. Sheinbaum has said Mexico is complying with the treaty based on water availability, pointing to drought conditions that have sapped Mexico’s supply. She expects an agreement in the coming days, she said on Friday, and did not see further conflict. The treaty was “fair”, she added. Mexican officials were scrambling to come up with a plan to increase the amount of water sent to the United States because of growing concern that Trump could drag the dispute into trade negotiations. Mexico’s federal government may clash with northern Mexican states that closely guard their water supply if it looks to enforce a controversial amendment inserted into the treaty last year that empowers federal officials to take extra water to comply with obligations, sources told Reuters.",

    "title": "US stock markets rally as White House says there is ‘great optimism’ in the economy – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed. You can read our latest full report and explainer here: After a tumultuous week, US stock markets just closed for the week on a high note. The Dow went up 600 points today, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 1.8% and 2%, respectively. Over this week, all three indexes rose substantially, largely afterDonald Trumppaused many of his tariffs. This week: The Dow went up 6%, or over 2,300 points. The S&P 500 jumped 8.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq topped 11.6%. It’s a huge rally after volatile drops in the market, but it’s unclear how long the upswings will last, particularly because the markets have proven so sensitive to the uncertainty around Trump’s policies. Here’s a quick overview of everything that’s happened today: Stock markets around the world continued to climb after Donald Trump delayed the harshest of his tariffs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index closed over 11% up for the week after a rollercoaster week. But there are many new indicators that the US economy remains on shaky ground: the US dollar index slipped to a three-year low, US treasury yield climbed up and consumer expectations on inflation rose to its highest level in four decades. China announced that it is placing a 125% tariff on American imports, in retaliation for the 145% tariff Trump placed on Chinese imports. The White House said that there is “great optimism in this economy”, despite the volatility seen in the stock market and said that Trump’s tariffs are a “proven economic formula” that will bring countries to the negotiation table. After a tumultuous week, US stock markets just closed for the week on a high note. The Dow went up 600 points today, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up 1.8% and 2%, respectively. Over this week, all three indexes rose substantially, largely afterDonald Trumppaused many of his tariffs. This week: The Dow went up 6%, or over 2,300 points. The S&P 500 jumped 8.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq topped 11.6%. It’s a huge rally after volatile drops in the market, but it’s unclear how long the upswings will last, particularly because the markets have proven so sensitive to the uncertainty around Trump’s policies. Some small businesses are expressing their frustrations over Donald Trump’s tariffs by adding a tariff surcharge onto their products, to make clear that the price increases they’re seeing are due to Donald Trump’s tariffs. “We think transparency is the way to go here and I am giving Trump full credit his decision to add this tariff to all US consumers,” wrote Ryan Babenzian, the CEO of Jolie Skin Co, which sells shower heads that filters water, onLinkedin. The company will add a “Trump Liberation Tariff” charge onto their products next week. It’s reminiscent of when restaurants, in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, addedsurchargesto bills to offset costs used to manage the virus. “Given all the uncertainty around tariffs and worries about when and by how much prices will go up, shoppers could welcome the transparency of line item tariff surcharges, and they’ll become normalized as more brands adopt them,” Sky Canaves, an analyst at EMarketer, Inc, toldBloomberg. US Customs and Border Control (CBP) is the federal agency responsible for collecting tariffs when imported goods arrive at the US border. But importers say that a glitch in the system has meant that they have not started paying tariffs yet, despiteDonald Trumpsaying that the tariffs, particularly the 145% tariffs on China, are already in place. According toCNBC, the glitch comes from CBP currently not being able to tell which ships are exempted from the tariffs, because they were “on the water” before the tariffs went into effect, and those that were shipped out after the tariffs. “Social media posts are not law,” Jarred Varaelli, a vice president at Savino Del Bene, a logistics firm. “With the constant changes to the regulations, all customs brokers in our industry have a difficult task ahead of them.” CBP told CNBC that they will issue an update once the issue is resolved, which means the agency is likely still working out exactly how to carry out the tariffs that are still in place. Boston Federal Reserve CEO Susan Collins, and a member of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) which sets interest rates, told theFinancial Timesthat the Fed “would absolutely be prepared” to stabilize the economy amid volatility. “We have had to deploy, quite quickly, various tools,” she said. “We would absolutely be prepared to do that as needed.” But while the Fed would typically cut interest rates, making borrowing money cheaper and encouraging economic activity, to deal with large fluctuations in the market, Collins said that emergency rate cuts are likely not in the Fed’s future because of the risk of higher inflation. Collins said that it’s likely that inflation could push above 3% this year. Yesterday,inflationin March was revealed to be 2.4%, a 0.4% drop from February. Let’s dive in for a second into the University of Michigan consumer sentimentsurveythat was released today. Typically, the survey is released at the end of each month, but a special report was released to capture sentiment around Donald Trump’s trade war escalations. And things aren’t looking so good. Consumer sentiment has been falling for the last four months, dropping 30% since December 2024. The number of consumers who expect unemployment to rise over the next year is the highest it’s been since the 2008 recession. And inflation expectations for the year ahead soared in a matter of weeks: from 5% in March to 6.7% by early April. “Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,” said survey director Joanne Hsu in a statement. For context, inflation expectations in April last year was 3.2%, and consumer sentiment was measured at 77.2, compared to 50.8 at the beginning of this month. It will be interesting to see how this drop in consumer sentiment will relate to voter sentiment in the future. Trump’sapproval ratingshave dropped across the board since his “liberation day” tariff announcement April 2, but only time can tell whether consumer and voter sentiments will rise after Trump’s pause on the reciprocal tariffs. What’s happening with the US treasury bond market is a pretty big deal. Treasury bond yieldsrose on Friday, a sign of further instability in what’s supposed to be a very safe financial asset to hold. The benchmark is the 10-year treasury bond, the yield of which rose to 4.6% today, over half a percentage point since last week. This is a big deal because the yield on treasury bonds are closely tied with the cost of other loans, like mortgages or car loans. So if the yield rises, loans like mortgages are likely to go up as well. That overall leads to a contractionary economic environment – less people are buying homes and investing money in general. Yield rates also point to inflation expectations.Bloombergsays this is the largest surge in the yield rate since the 1980s, when inflation peaked to 14%. Minneapolis Federal Reserve president Neel Kashkari explained it toCNBCon Friday: “If the trade deficit is going down, it could be that investors are saying, ‘Okay, America no longer is the most attractive place in the world to invest’, and then you would expect to see bond yields go up.” So the fact that bond yields are going up – and the dollar is depreciating, and the stock market is making historical fluctuations – points to some serious instability in the economy. The White House held its daily press briefing this afternoon, fielding questions about tariffs and the economy. The overall sentiment: “There is great optimism in this economy”. “This is a proven economic formula,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. It’s a line the White House continues to repeat even as volatility in the stock market appears to have rattled investors. Answering a question about US bonds, which is supposed to be one of the world’s most stable assets, and how they’re decreasing in value, Leavitt said that treasury secretary Scott Bessent is “keeping a very close eye on the bond market”. Leavitt maintained that Trump’s tariff negotiations have so far been a success, saying that “15 offers are on the table” and the White House has heard from over 75 countries over deals. Even when it comes toChina, which slapped a 125% tariff on American exports, Leavitt said that Trump is “optimistic”, though could not give any details on how a deal with China could be made. US stocks are picking up as we enter midday trading: The Dow is up 400 points. The S&P 500 is up 1.2% Nasdaq is up 1.3% It’s unclear if this upswing will last into this afternoon. It’s a slight turnaround from this morning, as stocks went down on news that consumer sentiment and inflation expectations cratered in April. The University of Michigan just released theresultsof a new consumer sentiment survey that shows consumers in April expect the inflation rate to climb to 6.7% – the highest expected level in over four decades. Falling consumer sentiment is a bad sign for the economy, as it typically means that people will be spending less, especially if they anticipate prices climbing, which could slow down the overall economy. Donald Trump’s tariff war has spooked stock markets and heightened fears of a recession in the US and Europe. But neither factor appears to have been what motivated the president’s sudden volte face this week, when he paused most of his “liberation day” border taxes for 90 days. The fact Trump could not ignore was a mass sell-off by investors of US government bonds. But what exactly are bonds, how are they traded – and why are they so central to the current crisis? Ministers should focus on rebuilding bridges with the EU, UK Labour politicians have said after a senior adviser to Donald Trumpdownplayed the prospect of a breakthrough with the US. MPs said the government should “prioritise our trading relationship with the EU” and “get a sugar-rush of growth” instead of banking on the prospect of preferential treatment from Washington. Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all UK exports this month, with several other markets, including the EU, facing steeper rates. After financial markets plummeted, the US presidentannounced a temporary reprieveon Wednesday, slashing tariffs on almost all other countries to his baseline of 10%. Car, steel and aluminium imports continue to face a higher tariff of 25%. The government is in advanced negotiations with the US overa trade dealto secure more favourable arrangements for the UK. However Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to Trump, told CNBC on Thursday that any deal that would persuade the president to go below 10% would need to be “extraordinary”. Asked if she was losing confidence in the prospect of a US trade deal, Rachel Reeves told reporters on Friday that “we continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States”. Several senior SenateDemocratshave written a letter asking the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to investigate whetherDonald Trumpviolated securities laws and engaged in insider trading and market manipulation while switching course on hisglobal tariffs. “We urge the SEC to investigate whether the tariff announcements, which caused the market crash and subsequent partial recovery, enriched administration insiders and friends at the expense of the American public and whether any insiders, including the president’s family, had prior knowledge of the tariff pause that they abused to make stock trades ahead of the president’s announcement,” said theletter, led by Massachusetts senator and former presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. Early Wednesday, Trump announced onsocial media: “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” The post was written at a time of severely volatile market trends and US indices down. Hours after his post, the US president abruptly announced a 90-day pause on many tariffs. The move sent the US’s S&P 500 back upseveral percentage pointsin just minutes. Wednesday ended up marking the best day for the S&P 500 since the recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. The letter was also signed by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, finance committee ranking member Ron Wyden, the Arizona senators Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, and California’s Adam Schiff. In the global fallout fromDonald Trump’s “liberation day”tariff announcement, it appears nowhere is safe. Crashing share prices, a sell-off in bonds and currency chaos erasing trillions of dollars of wealth in a matter of days. On Friday the dollar fell by more than 1% relative to a basket of other currencies to reach its lowest level in three years, compounding an almost 10% slide since the start of the year. In the space of a week, it has lost about 3 cents against the pound and 4 cents against the euro. Even afterthe president’s partial U-turn– freezing tariffs at 10% on all US imports except those from China for 90 days – markets swung from relief rally to fresh rout, as investors questioned the once unthinkable: could the US dollar be losing its unassailable safe haven status? “The damage has been done,” said George Saravelos, the head of foreign exchange research at Deutsche Bank. “The market is re-assessing the structural attractiveness of the dollar as the world’s global reserve currency and is undergoing a process of rapid de-dollarisation.”",

    "title": "Trump insists tariff war is ‘doing really well’ as recession fears mount",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpinsisted his trade war with much of the world was “doing really well” despite mounting fears of recession and as Beijing hit back and again hikedtariffson US exports toChina. As the US president said his aggressivetariffsstrategy was “moving along quickly”, a closely watched economic survey revealed that US consumer expectations for price growth had soared to a four-decade high. The White House maintains that the US economy is on the verge of a “golden age”, however, and that dozens of countries – now facing a US tariff of 10% after Trump shelved plans to impose higher rates until July – are scrambling to make deals. “The phones have been ringing off the hook to make deals,” the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters on Friday. Beijingraised Chinese tariffs on US productsto 125% on Friday – the latest salvo of its escalating trade dispute with Washington – and accused Trump of “unilateral bullying and coercion”. “Even if the US continues to impose even higher tariffs, it would no longer have any economic significance, and would go down as a joke in the history of world economics,” the Chinese finance ministry said. Few investors were laughing. US government bonds – typically seen as one of the world’s safest financial assets – continued to be sold off, and were on course for their biggest weekly loss since 2019. The dollar also fell against a basket of currencies, and was down against the euro and the pound. Leading stock indices paused for breath on Friday after days of torrid trading. The FTSE 100 rose 0.6% in London. The S&P 500 increased 1.8% and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.6% in New York. The S&P 500 finished an extraordinarily volatile week for markets up 5.7%, its biggest weekly gain since November 2023. “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT” Some of Wall Street’s most influential figures were unconvinced. “I think we’re very close, if not in, a recession now,” Larry Fink, CEO of the investment giant BlackRock, told CNBC. Far from providing certainty, the 90-day pause on higher US tariffs on much of the world “means longer, more elevated uncertainty”, he added. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the US’s largest bank, said the world’s largest economy was facing “considerable turbulence” as a key measure of consumer confidence tumbled to its lowest level since the Covid-19 pandemic – and the second-lowest level on record. US consumer sentiment has dropped 11% to 50.8 this month, ahead the pause announced by Trump earlier this week, according to a regularly survey compiled by the University of Michigan. Expectations for inflation meanwhile surged, with respondents indicating they are bracing for prices to rise by 6.7% over the coming year – the survey’s highest year-ahead inflation expectation reading since 1981. “There is great optimism in this economy,” Leavitt claimed at the White House briefing when asked about the survey. “Trust in President Trump. He knows what he’s doing. This is a proven economic formula.” Trump won back the White House last November by pledging to rapidly bring down prices – something he has claimed, in recent weeks, is already happening. US inflation climbed at an annual rate of 2.4% last month, according to official data. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion “Consumers have spiralled from anxious to petrified,” observed Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He added, however, that a bipartisan divide – with Democrats growing more pessimistic, while Republicans become more upbeat – suggests that people are allowing their political views to cloud their economic confidence. The US’s top markets watchdog is facing demands from senior Democrats to launch an investigation intoalleged insider trading and market manipulationafter Trump declared on social media that it was “A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!” hours before announcingWednesday’s climbdown on tariffs. Days of erratic policymaking constructed a rollercoaster week for markets, with the S&P 500 dropping 12% in just four sessions, before surging back almost 10% in a single day after the administration pulled back from imposing higher tariffs on most countries, exceptChina, which is facing a 145% tariff on exports to the US. In a letter to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),Senate Democratsincluding Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer wrote: “It is unconscionable that as American families are concerned about their financial security during this economic crisis entirely manufactured by the President, insiders may have actively profited from the market volatility and potentially perpetrated financial fraud on the American public.” Tesla meanwhilestopped taking orders in Chinafor two models it previously imported from the US, as companies scramble to adapt to prohibitive tariffs imposed in Trump’s trade war.

    "article_text": "Tesla has stopped taking orders in China for two models it previously imported from the US, as companies scramble to adapt to prohibitive tariffs imposed in Donald Trump’s trade war. The manufacturer, run by Trump’s close allyElon Musk, removed “order now” buttons on its Chinese website for its Model S saloon and Model X sports utility vehicle. Tesla did not give any indication of why it had made the changes but it came after the rapid escalation of the trade war between the US and China. In tit-for-tat moves, Trump has raised total tariffs on China to 145%, while China responded on Friday byincreasing its levies on US exports to 125%. The border taxes make the goods trade between the two countries prohibitively expensive and mean cars imported from the US are now much less attractive inChinathan those produced locally. New orders for the two imported models were also no longer available on Tesla’s mini-program account on the Chinese social media app WeChat, Reuters reported. The “order now” buttons were replaced with “view available cars” for the Model S and Model X on the US carmaker’s website, with some remaining cars appearing to be available for Chinese buyers. Since 2020 Tesla has produced its Model 3 and Model Y cars in a large factory in Shanghai, giving it some insulation from the tariffs. However, the company is still likely to be heavily affected. Analysis by Nikkei Asia in 2023 suggested that about 40% of the companies supplying Tesla with battery materials were Chinese, although the carmaker has sought to source parts and materials from outside China as trade tensions between the US and China have increased. Musk has been a key player in the Trump administration, leading the “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, in its efforts to slash the US federal budget that have beendescribed as illegal by constitutional experts. Yet he has also appeared to criticise the tariffs, saying last week that there should be“zero tariffs” between the EU and US. That is a stark contradiction to the 10% tariffs imposed by Trump on every nation in the world for 90 days, with the threat of the return of even higher levies. Tesla last month warned the US government that tariffs could harm American companies, in a letter to the White House’s trade representative. The possible loss of orders would represent a significant financial blow to Tesla, at a time when it is already struggling withslumping demand, particularly in Europe. Although it is tricky to work out the motivations of buyers, analysts have said that Musk’sclose association with Trump has tarnished the brand, contributing to the sales slump. The company also has an ageing lineup of models that are struggling to compete with newer offerings, particularly from Chinese rivals such as BYD.

    "title": "China raises US tariffs to 125% as Xi invites EU to team up against Trump ‘bullying’",
    "article_text": "China has raised its tariffs on US products to 125% in the latest salvo of the trade dispute with Washington, just hours afterXi Jinpingsaid there were “no winners in a tariff war”. Xi made the comments during a meeting with the Spanish prime minister in which he invited the EU to work withChinato resist “bullying”, part of an apparent campaign to shore up other trading partners. The Chinese commerce ministry announced on Friday it was raising the 84% tariffs on all US imports to 125%, again saying that China was ready to “fight to the end”. The statement also suggested it may be Beijing’s last move in the tit-for-tat tariff rises as “at the current tariff level, there is no market acceptance for US goods exported to China”. “If the US continues to impose tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US, China will ignore it,” it said, flagging that there were other countermeasures to come. Some marketscontinued to tumbleon Friday, as the French president, Emmanuel Macron, described theUS president’s 90-day tariff pause– which sets most tariffs at 10% until July – as “fragile”. Asian indices followed Wall Street lower on Friday, with Japan’s Nikkei down nearly 5% and Hong Kong stocks heading towards the biggest weekly decline since 2008. Oil prices were also expected to drop for a second consecutive week. Chinese officials have been canvassing other trading partners about how to deal with the US tariffs, after the country was excluded from Trump’s 90-day pause of the steepest global tariffs. Instead the US president made consecutive increases to duties on Chinese imports, which are now 145%. On Friday, Xi welcomed Spain’sPedro Sánchez, after also talking to counterparts in Saudi Arabia and South Africa. According to the official Chinese summary of the talks, Xi said “there will be no winners in a tariff war, and going against the world will isolate oneself”, in an apparent reference to the US. “China and the EU should fulfil their international responsibilities, jointly maintain the trend of economic globalisation and the international trade environment, and jointly resist unilateral bullying, not only to safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests, but also to safeguard international fairness and justice, and to safeguard international rules and order,” the summary said the Chinese president told Sánchez. Spain said Sánchez told Xi his country favoured a more balanced relationship between the EU and China based on negotiations to resolve differences and cooperation in areas of common interest. Xi plans to travel to south-east Asia, including Vietnam and Cambodia, next week. Macronwrote on X early on Fridaythat Trump’s partial tariff suspension, pausing new rates on various countries that would have risen as high as 50%, “sends out a signal and leaves the door open for talks. But this pause is a fragile one.” He added: “This 90-day pause means 90 days of uncertainty for all our businesses, on both sides of the Atlantic and beyond.” Battered financial markets were given a brief reprieve on Wednesday when Trump decided to pause duties on dozens of countries. However, his escalating trade dispute with China, the world’s second-largest economy,has continued to fuel fears of recession and further retaliation. The US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, tried to assuage the fears of sceptics by telling a cabinet meeting on Thursday that more than 75 countries wanted to start trade negotiations, and Trump had expressed hope of a deal with China. But the uncertainty in the meantime extendedsome of the most volatile tradingsince the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. The US’s S&P 500 index ended 3.5% lower on Thursday and was now down about 15% from its all-time peak in February. Some analysts believe stocks have further to fall owing to the uncertainty surrounding the US tariff policy. Bessent shrugged off the renewed market sell-off on Thursday and predicted that striking deals with other countries would bring more certainty. The US and Vietnam agreed to begin formal trade talks after Bessent spoke to the Vietnamese deputy prime minister, Ho Duc Phoc, the White House said. The south-east Asian manufacturing hub is prepared to crack down on Chinese goods being shipped to the US via its territory in the hope of avoiding tariffs, Reuters reported on Friday. Taiwan’s president said his government would also be among the first batch of trading partners to enter negotiations. Taiwan, listed for a 32% tariff, has offered zero tariffs as a basis for talks. Japan’s prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba, has set up a taskforce led by a close aide that hopes to visit Washington next week, according to local media. While Trumpsuddenly paused his “reciprocal” tariffson other countries hours after they came into effect this week, he did not include China, instead increasing duties on Chinese imports as punishment for Beijing’s initial move to retaliate. Trump had imposed tariffs on Chinese goods of 145% since taking office, a White House official said. Meanwhile, Trump told reporters at the White House he thought the US could make a deal with China, but reiterated his argument that Beijing had “really taken advantage” of the US for a long time. “I’m sure that we’ll be able to get along very well,” the US president said, referring to Xi. “In a true sense, he’s been a friend of mine for a long period of time, and I think that we’ll end up working out something that’s very good for both countries.” Xi and Trump are not known to have spoken since before Trump’s inauguration. Beijing has said it has no intention of backing down to what it terms as Trump’s “bullying” with tariffs. “We will never sit idly by and watch while the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people are infringed, nor will we sit idly by as international economic and trade rules and the multilateral trading system are undermined,” the Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, said on Thursday. As well as retaliatory tariffs, Beijing has restricted imports of Hollywood films, and put 18 US companies on trade restriction lists. The commerce ministry said China’s door was open to dialogue but this must be based on mutual respect. The US tariff pause does not apply to duties paid by Canada and Mexico, whose goods are still subject to 25% fentanyl-related tariffs unless they comply with the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement’s rules of origin. With trade hostilities persisting among the top three US trade partners, Goldman Sachs estimates the probability of a recession at 45%. Even with the rollback, the overall average import duty rate imposed by the US is the highest in more than a century, according to Yale University researchers. It also did little to soothe business leaders’ worries about the fallout from Trump’s trade dispute and its chaotic implementation: soaring costs, falling orders and snarled supply chains. One reprieve came, however, when the EU said it wouldpause its first counter-tariffs.",

    "title": "Will global climate action be a casualty of Trump’s tariffs?",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump’s upending of the global economy has raised fears that climate action could emerge as a casualty of the trade war. In the week that has followed“liberation day”, economic experts have warned that the swathe of tariffs could trigger a global economic recession, with far-reaching consequences for investors – including those behind the green energy projects needed to meet climate goals. Fears of a prolonged global recession have also tanked oil and gas prices, making it cheaper to pollute and more difficult to justify investment in clean alternatives such as electric vehicles and low-carbon heating to financially hard-hit households. But chief among the concerns is Trump’s decision tolevel his most aggressive trade tariffs against China– the world’s largest manufacturer of clean energy technologies – which threatens to throttle green investment in the US, the world’s second-largest carbon-emitter. The US is expected to lag farther behind the rest of the world in developing clean power technologies by cutting off its access to cheap, clean energy tech developed in China. This is a fresh blow to green energy developers in the US, still reeling from the Trump administration’svow to roll back the Biden era’s green incentives. Leslie Abrahams, a deputy director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington DC, said the tariffs would probably hinder the rollout of clean energy in the US and push the country to the margins of the global market. Specifically, they are expected to drive up the price of developing clean power, because to date the US has been heavily reliant on importing clean power technologies. “And not just imports of the final goods. Even the manufacturing that we do in the United States relies on imported components,” she said. The US government’s goal to develop its manufacturing base by opening new factories could make these components available domestically, but it is likely to take time. It will also come at considerable cost, because the materials typically imported to build these factories – cement, steel, aluminium – will be subject to tariffs too, Abrahams said. “At the same time there are broader,global economic implicationsthat might make it difficult to access inexpensive capital to build,” she added. Investors who had previously shown an interest in the US under the green-friendly Biden administration are likely to balk at the aggressively anti-green messages from the White House. Abrahams said this would mean a weaker appetite for investment in rolling out green projects across the US, and in the research and development of early-stage clean technologies of the future. This is likely to have long-term implications for the US position in the global green energy market, meaning it will “cede some of our potential market share abroad”, Abrahams added. Instead, countries likeChinaare likely to divert sales of their clean energy tech away from the US to other countries eager to develop green energy, Abrahams said. “So on the one hand, that should help to accelerate adoption of clean energy in those countries, which is good for emissions, but for the US, that is future market share that we’re ceding,” she said. It’s important to distinguish between the US and the rest of the world, according to Kingsmill Bond, a strategist for the energy thinktank Ember. “The more the US cuts itself off from the rest of the world, the more the rest of the world will get on with things and the US will be left behind. This is a tragedy for the clean energy industry in the US, but for everyone else there are opportunities,” he said. Analysis by the climate campaign group 350.org has found that despite rising costs and falling green investment in the US, Trump’s trade war will not affect the energy transition and renewables trade globally. It said the US was already “merely a footnote, not a global player” in the race to end the use of fossil fuels. Only 4% of China’s clean tech exports go to the US, it said, in a trade sector where sales volume grew by about 30% last year. “Trump’s tariffs won’t slow the global energy transition – they’ll only hurt ordinary people, particularly Americans,” said Andreas Sieber, an associate director at 350.org. “The transition to renewables is unstoppable, with or without him. His latest move does little to impact the booming clean energy market but will isolate the US and drive up costs for American consumers.” One senior executive at a big European renewable energy company said developers were likely to press on with existing US projects but in future would probablyinvest in other markets. “So we won’t be doing less, we’ll just be going somewhere else,” said the executive, who asked not to be named. “There is no shortage of demand for clean energy projects globally, so we’re not scaling back our ambitions. And excluding the US could make stretched supply chains easier to manage.” Countries likely to benefit from the fresh attention of renewable energy investors include burgeoning markets in south-east Asia, where fossil fuel reliance remains high and demand for energy is rocketing. Australia and Brazil have also emerged as countries that stand to gain. “In times like these, countries will be increasingly on the hunt for domestic solutions,” Bond said. “And that means clean energy and local supply chains. There are always climate reasons to go green, but there are national security reasons now too.” The challenge for governments hoping to seize the opportunity provided by the US green retreat will be to assure rattled investors that they offer a safe place to invest in the climate agenda. Dhara Vyas, the chief executive ofEnergyUK, the UK industry’s trade body, said: “Certainty has always been the thing that investors say they need. The UK is seen as a stable country with a stable government, but now more than ever we need to double down on giving certainty to investors.” “Investors do like certainty,” Bond agreed. “But they also like growth and opportunity, so that’s why there is some confidence that they will continue to deploy capital in the sector.” Although the green investment slowdown may be largely limited to the US, this still poses concerns for global climate progress, according to Marina Domingues, the head of new energies for the consultancy Rystad Energy. “The US is a huge emitter country. So everything the US does still really matters to the global energy transition and how we account for CO2,” she said. The US is the second most polluting country in the world, behind China, which produces almost three times its carbon emissions. But the US’s green retreat comes at a time when the country was planning to substantially increase its domestic energy demand. After years of relatively steady energy demand, Rystad predicts a 10% growth in US electricity consumption from a boom in AI datacentres alone. The economy is also likely to require more energy to power an increase in domestic manufacturing as imports from China dwindle. In the absence of a growing energy industry, this is likely to come from fossil fuels, meaning growing climate emissions. The US is expected to make use of its abundance of shale gas, but it is planning to use more coal in the future too. In the same week that Trump set out his tariffs, he signed four executive orders aimed at preventing the US from phasing out coal, in what climate campaigners at 350.org described as an “abuse of power”. Anne Jellema, the group’s executive director, said: “President Trump’s latest attempt to force-feed coal to the US is a dangerous fantasy that endangers our health, our economy and our future.”",

    "article_text": "Prosecutors inTaiwancharged, for the first time, a Chinese ship captain with intentionallydamaging undersea cablesoff the island in February, after a rise in sea cable malfunctions alarmed Taiwan officials amid tensions with China. Prosecutors say the man was captain of the Chinese-crewed Hong Tai 58, registered in Togo, which Taiwanese authorities detained after suspecting the ship had dropped anchor near an undersea cable off southwesternTaiwan, allegedly damaging it. The prosecutors’ office in the southern Taiwanese city of Tainan said they had charged the ship’s Chinese captain, whom they identified only by his family name, Wang, with being responsible for the alleged damage to the cable. Wang has said he is innocent, but refused to provide details of the ship’s owner and “had a bad attitude”, the prosecutors alleged in a statement. Seven other Chinese nationals detained at the same time will not be charged and will be transported toChina, prosecutors said, adding that the case was the island’s first prosecution relating to damage to sea cables. Reuters was not able to determine the ship’s ownership or immediately locate a lawyer representing the captain. China’s Taiwan Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has previously accused Taiwan of “manipulating” possible Chinese involvement in the case, saying it was casting aspersions before the facts were clear. Taiwan has reportedfive cases of sea cable malfunctionsthis year, compared with three each in 2024 and 2023, according to its digital ministry. Taiwan’s coastguard has in recent months stepped up efforts to protect its sea cables, including monitoring a “blacklist” of close to 100 China-linked ships registered to a country other than that of its owner near Taiwan, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters. Taiwan said in January it suspected a China-linked ship of damaging an undersea cable off its northern coast. The shipowner denied the accusations. Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has repeatedly complained about“grey zone” Chinese activities around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation, such as balloon overflights and sand dredging. Taipei was alarmed after another Chinese-linked ship was suspected of damaging a different cable this year, prompting the navy and other agencies to step up efforts to protect the undersea communication links, which are vital to the island’s connections to the rest of the world. Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing’s sovereignty claims, has pointed to similarities between what it has experienced anddamage to undersea cables in the Baltic Seafollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.",

    "title": "Revealed: nearly 2m hectares of koala habitat bulldozed since 2011 – despite political promises to protect species",
    "article_text": "Nearly 2m hectares of forests suitable for endangered koalas have been destroyed since the iconic species was declared a threatened species in 2011, according to analysis for Guardian Australia. The scale of habitat destruction in Queensland andNew South Wales– states in which the koala is formally recognised as being at risk of extinction – has continued despite political promises it would be protected. Analysis by the AustralianConservationFoundation using state and federal government data found 1,964,200 hectares of koala habitat were cleared between 2012 and 2021, the latest year for which there was complete data. The total amount of destroyed forest and bush covered an area larger than greater Sydney, taking in the Blue Mountains, the Illawarra, the southern highlands and the Goulburn and Shoalhaven regions. It is more than 10 times larger than the area the NSW government is assessing for a possible “great koala national park”. But most of the cleared area – 81% – was inQueensland. About three-quarters of the lost forest is estimated to have been cleared for agriculture, to create cattle pasture and crop fields. The analysis found 13% was removed by the forestry industry and 5% for development of infrastructure, including mining. Just 4% was likely due to natural causes, such as bushfire and drought. Nearly all of the forest destruction occurred on a small scale that did not require consideration under federal environment law. Less than 2% of it was approved by the federal environment minister. Get Guardian Australia environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as an email Campaigners say it shows the national Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act – which the Albanese government promised to rewrite in this term before delaying its plans indefinitely – is deeply flawed. Darcie Carruthers, an Australian Conservation Foundation nature campaigner, said: “It beggars belief that with nearly 2m hectares of potential koala habitat gone in just a decade, the federal government would continue to approve projects that bulldoze koalas’ homes. But that’s exactly what’s happening.” A separate analysis by the foundation found that almost 3,000 hectares of potential koala habitat were approved for clearing in 2024. Carruthers said the outsized contribution of the beef industry towards habitat loss showed “the food system can do much more for koalas”. “There are solutions to make sure people, farms, koalas and the forests we all depend on can all thrive,” she said. Gemma Plesman, a senior campaigner atGreenpeaceAustralia Pacific, said the data showed the “complete failure” of federal environment laws to protect “Australia’s most iconic” endangered species. “Every year koalas lose more of their home – mostly driven by beef production – and neither of our major parties have been able to stop the destruction,” she said. Koalas in Queensland, NSW and the Australian Capita Territory were formally listed as being vulnerable to extinction in 2012. In 2022 the threat level was raised to endangered after scientists concluded that numbers were likely to have dropped by half over the previous 20 years. Sign up toClear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis after newsletter promotion A more recent national project to better estimate the number of koalas suggested there are between 95,000 and 238,000 in the states where the species is considered endangered and between 129,000 and 286,000 in Victoria and South Australia. The species faces a host of threats in addition to losing its habitat, including the climate crisis and disease. Dr Christine Hosking, a conservation scientist at the University of Queensland who has researched how the climate emergency will shrink the koala’s habitat, said the threat was “playing out now in real time”. “Areas of New South Wales and Queensland have seen big reductions [in koala numbers] and that’s been down to protracted droughts and heatwaves,” she said. “Koala’s can’t thermoregulate above about 37C and we now get successive days above that [as well as] days over 40C in a row. They simply can’t survive.” Hosking’s research shows that as temperatures rise the koala’s habitat in Queensland and NSW contracts eastward, pushing them into already developed areas where they face other risks such as vehicles and dog attacks. AUniversity of Sydney studyin February on one of the country’s few chlamydia-free koala populations – located in south-western Sydney – found urban development had effectively isolated the population, leading to high levels of in-breeding that made the species more susceptible to disease. “We’re losing koalas for complex reasons,” Hosking said. “Habitat loss is the No 1 threat because they’re so limited in what they can eat, but then you have roads, urbanisation, chlamydia and, of course, climate change.” Prof Mathew Crowther, a conservation biologist and koala ecologist at the University of Sydney, said the marsupial’s specialised diet – eucalyptus leaves – put it in conflict with humans. Eucalyptus trees that grow on flatter, more fertile soils generally produce leaves higher in nutrients and lower in toxins. But those flat, fertile soils are where humans like to settle and grow food. “Koalas and people want the same kind of land,” Crowther said. He said national parks tended to be in more rugged country, which was not the koala’s preferred habitat. Many live outside national parks on private land. “We need to make sure there’s enough habitat that is linked together, we need to make sure regrowth and plantings are allowed to happen and we have to give incentives for landholders,” he said.",

    "title": "Liberal candidate co-authored inquiry submission suggesting Hazaras not persecuted for ethnicity in Afghanistan",
    "article_text": "The Liberal candidate for Bruce co-authored a parliamentary submission suggesting the Hazara community inAfghanistanwas not persecuted on the basis of its ethnicity, contradicting the Australian government and drawing rebuke from international human rights groups. Zahid Safi co-authored a submission to a 2021 parliamentary inquiry into Australia’s involvement in the Afghanistan war, which incorrectly cited a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report to allege Hazara “warlords” had “cut the breasts of women” and watched “live delivery of pregnant women” during the early 1990s. The 2005 HRW report does not mention these acts. The allegations led members of the Hazara community, which has a significant presence in the electorate of Bruce, to lodge their own dissenting submissions to the inquiry, alleging the claims relied on “racist tropes” and sought to erase the “well-documented persecution of an entire ethnic group”. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Safi did not directly comment on those allegations when contacted by Guardian Australia, instead stating he was “a staunch advocate for freedom of religion or belief for all individuals worldwide”. “As someone who fled the country because of war, I know everyone under the Taliban suffered, and my advocacy for human rights is shaped by those experiences,” Safi said. The Senate submission co-authored by Safi said, in reference to conflict in Afghanistan, “that victims of war are not based on ethnicity”. “The victims of war are targeted based on ideology,” the joint submission said. “This means, whoever opposes the Taliban and their ideology, is perceived as the Taliban’s enemy. Therefore, their perceived animosity is not based on ethnic division.” A 2022 briefing paper on Afghanistan, prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, states the Hazara community are an ethnic group that represents an estimated 10-20% of the country’s population. It states the Hazara face “a high risk of harassment and violence (…) on the basis of their ethnicity and sectarian affiliation”. The department notes the Hazara community has been historically persecuted, noting it was subjected to “the worst single recorded massacre in the country’s recent history” in August 1998, when the Taliban, a predominantly Pashtun organisation, “massacred at least 2,000 Hazaras”. The submission co-authored by Safi also expressed frustration that other ethnic groups from Afghanistan had allegedly been “sidelined” by the Australian government and media, due to an alleged prioritisation of the Hazara community. “Pashtuns have had the most casualties compared to others and this needs to be acknowledged by the Australian government as the 20 years’ war existed mostly in the Pashtun provinces,” the submission stated. Thousands of Hazaras who fled Afghanistan after persecution from the Taliban in the 1990s settled in Melbourne’s south-eastern suburbs, within the federal electorate of Bruce. The electorate is also home to other Afghan ethnic groups. Safi said: “A full and fair reading of my submission makes clear that I advocated for every single living individual at risk from the national atrocity and humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan under the Taliban.” Guardian Australia has spoken to other co-authors of the report who stand by its claims. Bruce is held by the incumbent Labor MP, Julian Hill. A margin of 6.6% at the 2022 election has been reduced to 5.3% after a redistribution. . Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The submission has been criticised by HRW’s Afghanistan researcher, Fereshta Abbasi, who accused the authors of misrepresenting a report by the organisation to imply brutal violence in Kabul between 1992 and 1995 was conducted exclusively by Hazaras. “Among these atrocities were those carried out by ethnically Pashtun militia forces and ethnically Hazara militia forces against civilians of these respective ethnic groups, in tit-for-tat kidnappings, rapes and killings,” Abbasi said. “Attributing them exclusively towards Hazaras is misleading. It is our finding that these attacks were in fact based on ethnicity – in that the victims were targeted because of their ethnicity.” A dissenting submission made by members of the Hazara community, who asked for the Senate to withhold their names, said the submission co-authored by Safi had “the effect of amplifying racist tropes”. “It highlights the actions of a few actors in a past civil war, drawing attention to ethnicity to imply the guilt of entire ethnic groups, or to imply that people who belong to ethnic groups other than Pashtun are violent in nature,” the dissenting submission said. A separate dissenting report by two academics specialising in Afghanistan at La Trobe University and Deakin University, along with solicitors and PhD candidates, accused the submission of containing “a series of factually incorrect statements and racist prejudices”. “Instead of acknowledging the historical and current persecution of the Hazaras, and the significant risks faced by Hazaras in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime; the authors deliberately blame the Hazaras for the general violence and human rights abuses that were perpetrated during several phases of the war in Afghanistan,” the academics and lawyers said.",

    "title": "It’s week two of Peter Dutton’s campaign and (almost) everything is tightly scripted",
    "article_text": "“Who won the election?” 12-year-old Sammy asksPeter Dutton, leaning through the window of the passenger seat where the opposition leader sits. The Coalition leader has just finished his last pit stop in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs for the day: a petrol station. By this point, he’s been to six of them in the last seven days – mostly cleared of regular punters – selling his party’s promise to bring down petrol costs by about $14 per car a week. Economic analystsput that estimate a lot lower– about $7.56. “Are you related to Albanese?” Sammy asks, peppering Dutton with questions he can’t duck and weave from like in a regular press conference. Sammy’s unexpected intervention at a Caulfield petrol station lasts just two minutes – and is a rare moment in an otherwise scrupulously controlled federal election campaign. Before Sammy wandered through the tangle of cameramen with their lenses on Dutton, the only people attending the seven-minute bowser visit were politicians, their staffers, media and the petrol station staff, who were informed of the impending visit. The meticulous planning is a regular feature of the modern Australian election but 2025 marks another change in how tightly scripted every handshake, smile, wave and petrol fill up has been. The Australian federal policewarned in Marchthreats against elected officials have continued to rise. In the first days of both major parties’ campaigns, protesters crashed press conferences, masquerading as media and capturing headlines about their causes. For those in the press pack, these interventions add colour and movement to the day’s story – a welcome addition for media trying to attract attention from a public typically uninterested or disillusioned by the political news cycle. But for politicians and protective personnel, these breaches demonstrate how quickly threats can become disasters if the intruders have violent intentions. While the threat might be very real, further locking down a politician’s visit results in an even more sanitised campaign. Australia is a fortnight into a five-week election campaign and there’s seldom a glimpse in the nightly news of leaders having unvetted public interactions, let alone on social media. For two men vying to become leaders of the Australian people, neither have spent very much time with them – those outside the political class anyway. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter While a public street walk was already a rarity in previous elections, it’s now a national security risk. Both the public and the media are worse off for it, but politicians are too. When public trust in democratic institutions is at an all-time low, genuine engagement with the public, without all the smoke and mirrors, is crucial. On Friday, Dutton denied there had been any changes this election campaign because of security concerns. “It hasn’t stopped me from doing anything, and it won’t on this campaign,” he said. “I think this is an opportunity to speak to the Australian people, to see as many people as humanly possible, and we’ll continue that over the course of the campaign.” Back in Dutton’s camp, the mood and strategy has shifted. After a train wreck opening campaign week, the former policeman turned property investor turned MP is taking back control. At the start of the week, theCoalitionannounced a spectacular about-face on its working from home policy, worried it was further bleeding votes from women. It also sought to put to bed some of the confusion around its promise to sack 41,000 public servants. While many questions still remain about how the opposition would actually achieve the target with no forced redundancies, the opposition at least ruled out immediate mass cuts in Canberra. On Tuesday, after Dutton apologised for the misstep – something the former Coalition prime minister often refrains from – the opposition leader was back in charge. Dutton muzzled the press pack in a way Albanese has often struggled to achieve. Instead of pitting travelling journalists against each other in order to get Dutton’s attention during press conferences, the opposition leader has prioritised order. In three press conferences between Wednesday and Friday, Dutton methodically gave each journalist a question in order of where they were standing. The result meant media didn’t scream over one another to get their questions in. It also gave Dutton time to respond to each answer and disrupted any control the press pack might have tried to gain over a politician only wanting to deliver speaking points, not answers. In a staid, scripted election campaign, press conferences can offer the only windows into a politician’s mindset, or sometimes the cracks in their facade. It’s not about the media gaining a scalp, but showing the unpolished parts of a person hellbent on being a perfect specimen for voters. The whole script for election campaigns should be thrown out, but that’s unlikely to happen, given the major parties enjoy the political conventions that benefit them. And it’s unclear what an election campaign without the major political parties controlling them could even look like. In the absence of difficult press conferences and leaders visiting real voters in real scenarios, it is more challenging for the Australian public to determine which leader makes the most sense for them. Personal safety and control is paramount for those who want to lead, but it can only lead to worse outcomes for democratic institutions if it comes at the cost of genuine engagement. And genuine engagement should not be defined by campaign managers and political party strategists.",

    "title": "Ten days after ‘liberation day’, many Australians are still wondering: what just happened to global markets?",
    "article_text": "By the time Australians woke Wednesday morning, 3 April, the world had changed. In a single stroke of his pen, a former reality TV star, property mogul and now second-term president of the most powerful country in the world had undone a century of US trade liberalisation. As global financial markets shed trillions in dollars of value, Australians compulsivelycheck their superannuation balancesto see how much damage Donald Trump’s trade war is inflicting on their retirement savings. Even the treasurer is losing sleep. “I do wake up in the middle of the night and read the Wall Street Journal updates on the American market, I confess to that,” Jim Chalmers told ABC radio on Friday morning. Somehow along the way, we had once again been lulled into taking Trump seriously, but not literally. Instead, as the CBA’s chief economist, Luke Yeaman, said in the wake of an historic week, “the era of trade liberalisation, free market reforms, deregulation and fiscal discipline – the Washington Consensus – is officially dead and buried”. On 2 April in Washington DC – or “liberation day”, as Trump calls it – the president unveiled a plan to put tariffs of 10% on imported goods from countries around the world. That was bad enough, but there was worse to come. Every country which sold more to the US than it bought (that is, who had a trade surplus with the US) would be further punished with a “reciprocal tariff”, that came into effect on 9 April. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter The higher tariffs were crudely formulated based on the size of America’s trade deficit. It was an amateurish approach, roundly condemned by economists and trade experts. It led to perverse outcomes such asobscure and unpopulated islands being whacked with trade sanctions. Australia, which has a trade deficit with the US (we buy more stuff than we sell), escaped with the relatively low – in a world of vastly changed expectations – tariff rate of 10%. Others were less fortunate. Goods from the EU were hit with an import duty of 20%, and Japanese goods 24%. China was hit with tariffs of 34% – which came on top of the 20% existing rate. China imposed its own tariffs of 84% on US imported goods – andagain to 125% on Friday. By then, in a series of tit-for-tat retaliations, America’s tariff on Chinese goods had reached an unbelievable 145% – raising the prospect that trade between the world’s two economic giants will simply disappear. Australia ships less than 5% of the total value of exports to the US. Experts say we should be shielded from the fallout from a global trade war – a recession is not on the cards – but we are not immune. The Reserve Bank is expected to cut rates when it next meets on 19-20, even as the RBA governor, Michele Bullock,pushes back against calls for more aggressive policy easing. Instead, economists say the US will be the biggest loser from its trade aggression. Tariffs are a tax on imports and will raise the prices of goods for everyday Americans, costing an average of $US4,700 in 2024, according to estimates by The Budget Lab. Americans will be paying 64% more for clothing in the short run, while prices for electric equipment will be 46% higher, and car prices 12% higher. As was widely reported, JP Morgan said there was a 60% chance the trade shock would drive the US into recession. Trump assured the world that “I know what the hell I’m doing”, but investors around the world were panicking. And within 12 hours of the reciprocal tariffs coming into effect on 9 April, Trump had reversed course. He paused them for 90 days (with the notable exception of China), which he said would give countries the chance to come and do a deal. But what really changed Trump’s mind? On 2 April, Trump declared that his tariffs would “make American wealthy again”. But a week later, when the higher duties came into effect, it was clear that Americans were suddenly and substantially less wealthy. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Major Wall Street stocks, such as Apple, started trading like unstable penny stocks, shedding billions of dollars in value in the immediate aftermath over concerns their entire production model would unravel. Some traders described it as “obliteration day”. Global markets, including in Australia, followed the US lead and a tumultuous period ensued. By 8 April, shares on Wall Street had plummeted by 12% over four tempestuous days of trading. If the US share market is, as economist Justin Wolfers calls it, “a bet on the future of the American economy”, then things were looking grim indeed. The chief investment officer at Sydney-headquartered Opal Capital Management, Omkar Joshi, said the uncertainty is unnerving. “No one really knows what’s going to happen next, there’s so much headline risk,” Joshi said. Those headlines were coming from Trump himself, as his posts on his Truth Social platform sparked dramatic market moves. “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT,” Trump wrote on Wednesday morning, 9 April, US time. Hours later, Trump announced the pause. The US’ chief benchmark, the S&P 500, closed up 9.5% that day, gaining about US$4tn, regaining more than two-thirds of the value it had lost over the previous four trading days. It was one of the biggest rises since the second world war. Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 caught some of the exuberance, closing up 4.5% to record its strongest trading day since the pandemic. Days earlier it had also recorded itssteepest one-day fallsince the pandemic. The Australian dollar, which threatened to plunge below US59c earlier this week, hadspiked above US62c on Friday. Despite the rebound, after eight days of chaotic trading, the S&P/ASX 200 was down about 4%, taking the benchmark back to levels reached mid last year. “Equities probably do go lower from here, but you’re also going to see some massive rallies along the way. It’s not just going to be one way down or one way up,” Oshi says. Meanwhile, something curious is happening outside equities. Traders have also been selling the American dollar, a counterintuitive move given money tends to flow into the greenback during volatile times. AMP’s chief economist, Shane Oliver, says the panic in the bond market reflected investors losing faith in American assets as the ultimate safe port of call in a storm. “It has an echo of Liz Truss,” Oliver says, referring to when a meltdown in British bonds forced the former UK prime ministerto cancel plans for major tax cuts. “But it’s not just that. I don’t think Truss destroyed confidence in [her] government like Trump has [in his].” It was this spectre of a bond market revolt – or in other words, the threat to a hugely indebted country from a big rise in borrowing costs – that eventually appeared to convince Trump to press pause on his reciprocal tariffs. Asked to explain, Trump told reporters: “Well, I thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line”. “They were getting yippy, you know, they were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid.” But with the US president determined to reshape the global trading system, whatever the cost, the yips are here to stay.",

    "title": "Pilot of crashed New York helicopter was reportedly low on fuel and headed back to helipad",
    "article_text": "The pilot of a sightseeinghelicopter that crashedintoNew York’s Hudson River on Thursday killing all six people onboard reportedly sent a radio message moments earlier saying he was low on fuel and was heading back to the helipad, its operators said on Friday. Michael Roth, the chief executive of New York Helicopter Tours, described how the pilot never made it back to the downtown Manhattan heliport it took off from about 16 minutes previously on its sixth flight of the day,the Telegraph reported. “He called in that he was landing and that he needed fuel, and it should have taken him about three minutes to arrive, but 20 minutes later, he didn’t arrive,” Roth told the UK outlet. However, he does not know exactly why the chopper came down. As well as the pilot, the crash killed five members of a Spanish family. The victims were identified as Agustín Escobar, an executive of the technology company Siemens, his wife, Mercè Camprubí, who was celebrating her 40th birthday, and their three children, aged 10, eight and four, according to Eric Adams, the New York mayor. The middle child would have celebrated their ninth birthday on Friday, Adams said. Steven Fulop, the Jersey City mayor, said a relative was arriving from Spain on Friday to take home the family members’ remains. The pilot has not yet been officially named, and the firm did not immediately respond to a request from the Guardian for comment. But a report on Friday afternoon fromthe Gothamistidentified the pilot as Sean Johnson, a 36-year-old veteran of the Navy Seals who had recently moved to New York City to continue his aviation career, according to family members and his Facebook profile. Johnson’s wife, Kathryn, told the outlet that after his military career he took on a variety of jobs, including on a TV show and as a bodyguard for celebrities – but that through it all, Johnson “always wanted to fly”, Kathryn said that she was struggling to process news of his death. “ It’s just hard right now,” she said. Divers returned to the river early on Friday morning to salvage sections of the helicopter. Fulop said “major parts” of the Bell 206 chopper broke apart in midair and plunged into the water. Videos posted on social media captured large chunks of the helicopter, including rotor blades spinning independently of the fuselage, falling from the sky and splashing into the river on Thursday afternoon, not long after the tourist flight had taken off from a popular heliport at the tip of Manhattan. Other footage showed the aircraft mostly submerged, upside down in the water, and rescue vehicles crowding the streets in New Jersey as emergency workers raced in. The Hudson River divides the west side of Manhattan from New Jersey and flows into New York harbor past the Statue of Liberty. The weather on Thursday afternoon featured gray skies, light winds and cold rain. On Friday, witnesses spoke of the shocking moments shortly after 3pm when the sightseeing helicopter, operated by New York Helicopter Tours, broke into pieces about 16 minutes into flight. “I heard very loud sounds, I thought it had to be gunshots, it was that level loud,” Dani Horbiak toldABC’s Good Morning America. “When I looked out my window I saw a helicopter falling into pieces. It all happened in seconds.” Another witness, Bruce Wall, said he also saw the helicopter breaking up in flight. “I heard some crackling, looked up, and I just see a plane falling apart,” he said. “The tail broke off and the plane tumbled into the water with the propeller still in the air.” Sean Duffy, the US transportation secretary, said officials from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were on site and leading the investigation, and that the aircraft was not being monitored by air traffic controllers on the ground at the time it crashed. Tributes were paid in Spain to Escobar, 49, chief executive of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility, and his family, who were enjoying a sightseeing excursion of New York City. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, posted to X on Friday: “We have had devastating news about the helicopter accident in the Hudson River. “Five Spaniards from the same family, three of them children, lost their lives along with the pilot. It’s an unimaginable tragedy. I share the pain of the victims’ loved ones in this heartbreaking moment.” Spain’s transport minister, Óscar Puente, said : “Reading with horror that the victims of the awful helicopter accident in the US were Agustín Escobar and his family. I met him over the past year in his capacity at Siemens Spain. He was a charming, hard-working and talented person.” The German industrial conglomerate Siemens confirmed that Escobar worked for the company as head of rail infrastructure at its mobility division. “We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustín Escobar and his family lost their lives,” Siemens said in a statement. Camprubí, Escobar’s wife, was a global manager at an energy technology company. Fulop said in apost to Xon Friday that Escobar was in New York for work, and his family joined him for some leisure time. “I’m sharing this because life moves quick and we don’t always think about the fact it is unpredictable and extremely fragile,” he wrote. “The husband was here for a business trip and the family flew out to extend the trip a couple days in NYC. They were celebrating the mom’s 40th birthday with the tourist helicopter flight.” Jessica Tisch, the New York City police commissioner, said most of the passengers were already dead when they were removed from the water, but two were taken to a nearby hospital, where they died soon after. Tisch said the helicopter took off from a downtown helicopter pad at about 3pm and flew north over the Hudson. It turned south when it reached the George Washington Bridge and crashed minutes later, hitting the water upside down and sinking near Lower Manhattan about 3.15pm, just off Hoboken, New Jersey. Justin Green, an aviation lawyer and former Marine Corps helicopter pilot, told the AP: “There’s no indication they had any control over the craft. No pilot could have prevented that accident once they lost the lifts. It’s like a rock falling to the ground.” Green added that videos of the crash suggest a “catastrophic mechanical failure” and it is possible the helicopter’s main rotors struck the tail boom, breaking it apart and causing the cabin to free fall. The agency said at least 38 people had died in helicopter accidents in New York City since 1977. A collision between a plane and a tourist helicopter over the Hudson in 2009 killed nine people, and five died in 2018 when a charter helicopter offering “open door” flights went down into the East River.",

    "title": "Labour MPs urge ministers to focus on rebuilding trading relationship with EU",
    "article_text": "Ministers should focus on rebuilding bridges with the EU, Labour politicians have said, after a senior adviser to Donald Trumpdownplayed the prospectof a breakthrough with the US. MPs said the government should “prioritise our trading relationship with the EU” and “get a sugar rush of growth” instead of banking on the prospect of preferential treatment from Washington. Trump imposed 10% tariffs on all UK exports this month, with several other markets, including the EU, facing steeper rates. After financial markets plummeted, the US presidentannounced a temporary reprieveon Wednesday, reducing tariffs on almost all other countries to his baseline of 10%. Car, steel and aluminium imports continue to face a higher tariff of 25%. The government is in advanced negotiations with the US overa trade dealto secure more favourable arrangements for the UK. However, Kevin Hassett, an economic adviser to Trump, told CNBC on Thursday that any deal that would persuade the president to go below 10% would need to be “extraordinary”. Asked if she was losing confidence in the prospect of a US trade deal, Rachel Reeves told reporters on Friday: “We continue to engage with our counterparts in the United States.” She added: “At the same time, we also want to improve trading relations with other countries around the world. It’s why I hosted the Indian finance minister in London this week as part of our economic and financial dialogue, and to try and secure a free trade and investment treaty with India. It’s also why we are having a summit with the European Union in May to improve our trading relations.” The Guardian reported this week that the government had told businesses a free trade deal with India was 90% complete. Ministers are also putting stock in building economic ties with China, with the trade minister Douglas Alexander travelling to Beijing this week for talks. Liam Byrne, theLabourchair of the Commons business and trade committee, called for a “big, ambitious reset” with the EU and said it would “deliver an economic uplift bigger than the hit we are going to take from tariffs”. He said: “We need to prioritise our trading relationship with the EU because it is big and close … There is a real frustration in Brussels about the UK not being clearer in what it wants in the reset. This is in the EU’s interest, the UK’s interest, and the urgency of the situation demands that we crack on with this.” Stella Creasy, a Labour MP and chair of the Labour Movement for Europe, said: “Get the deal with Europe. Stop talking about red lines. We have shown we can work with Europe on defence security and our economies are intertwined … we do five times as much trade with Europe as with America. “At the moment, we have tariff-free trade with Europe but we have a massive drop in trade because of all the paperwork. There are many ways we could negotiate to remove those barriers and get a sugar rush of growth from improving trading with our neighbours.” Harriet Harman, the former cabinet minister and Labour peer, said ministers needed to address “the elephant in the room, which is that Trump is wrong on this, we don’t agree with him”. Speaking to Sky News’ Electoral Dysfunction podcast, Harman said that when the USput tariffs on imported steel in 2002, Tony Blair “did say this is unacceptable, this is wrong, it’s unjustified, it is breaching the World Trade Organization rules”. “He was able to say we do not believe this is how you should be within the world organisation and Bush has got it wrong,” she added. “I think it feels as if there’s a kind of restricted vocabulary amongst ministers at the moment where they are speaking in code. “I think the story needs to be told to the country that this is a really difficult problem and Trump has caused it and he is wrong to do this, but we will be OK with this government,” Harman said. Hassett told CNBC this week: “Everybody expects that the 10% baseline tariff is going to be the baseline. It is going to take some kind of extraordinary deal for the president to go below there.” Starmeradmitted on Thursdaythat he had not spoken to Trump since the tariffs were introduced.",

Speaking at a meeting of theUkraine defence contact groupin Brussels, the British defence secretary, John Healey, said the Russian president had rejected a 30-day pause in fighting proposed a month ago by Donald Trump. Healey said: “Putin said he wanted peace, but he rejected a full ceasefire. His forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike.” The UK and Germany jointly convened Friday’s Ramstein meeting, which was attended by more than 40 countries but not the US. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s defence secretary, joined by video instead. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, played down the Trump administration’s absence. He conceded that peace “appears to be out of reach in the immediate future” and said Ukraine was at the “epicentre of a broader conflict”. “It is between freedom and oppression, between the recognition of global standards and aggressive imperialism, between democracy and authoritarianism,” Pistorius said, adding that military support for Ukraine would continue. The US’s attempts to bring about a quick end to the war have so far not succeeded. Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, held talks on Friday with Putin’s investment aide, Kirill Dmitriev, in St Petersburg. This followed avisit last weekby Dmitriev to Washington. Witkoff was also due to meet Putin, as the Kremlin cautioned that no breakthroughs and “nothing momentous” should be expected. In conversations with the White House,Russiahas refused to make concessions. Moscow demands control over four Ukrainian regions, the removal of Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s pro-western government and a ban on Nato membership for Ukraine. It also wants the lifting of sanctions. Trump issued a rare warning to Putin before the meeting on his social media platform, Truth Social. “Russia has to get moving. Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!” he wrote. Trump has previously said he is“pissed off” by Putin’s failure to stop fightingbut he has not taken any serious measures to put pressure on Russia’s president. In interviews, Witkoff has parroted Kremlin talking points, telling the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that Russian-occupied Ukrainian regions had voted to join Moscow. The US envoy to Ukraine, Gen Keith Kellogg, appeared to echo such suggestions in an interview with the Times on Friday, in which he said that a demilitarised zone between Ukrainian and Russian forces could be established along the existing frontline. He also said that British and French troops could adopt zones of control in the west of the country as part of a “reassurance force”. “You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two, when you had a Russian zone, a French zone, and a British zone, a US zone,” he said. Since Ukraine agreed to a US ceasefire last month, Russia has dramaticallyescalatedits aerial bombing campaign. This week it launched a big military push in the Sumy and Kharkiv regions, seizing several border villages. There is speculation Russia is trying to grab as much territory as possible by 9 May, the day Russia celebrates its victory during the second world war, and before a possible peace deal. Estonia’s defence minister, Hanno Pevkur, said: “This is why we need to speed up the deliveries as quickly as we can.” Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Addressing the Brussels meeting by video, Zelenskyy urged his allies to provide new Patriot air defence systems. This week a Russian ballistic missilehit a playgroundin the city of Kryvyi Rih, where Zelenskyy grew up, killing nine children and 11 adults. “Our priority is air defence. Patriots that remained unused in storage with our partners should be protecting lives,” Zelenskyysaid, adding that 10 more were urgently needed. Speaking at apress conferenceafter the Ramstein meeting, Pistorius said Germany had already given four Patriot systems to Kyiv and was waiting for more to be delivered. He said a global search was under way. “We will buy anything we can get,” he said. Germany will provide four Iris-T air defence systems as well as 15 Leopard 1 tanks, more reconnaissance drones and 100,000 artillery rounds, he added. Other governments announced fresh contributions. Healey said the UK and Norway would supply radar systems, anti-tank mines and “hundreds of thousands of drones” as part of a $560m defence package, on top of £4.5bn committed by Downing Street this year. The figure includes the repair of military vehicles damaged on the battlefield. Friday’s meeting did not clarify how many countries were ready to send troops to Ukraine as part of a “coalition of the willing”. Speaking to the BBC, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, said: “Different member states have different opinions”. Discussions were still taking place, she added. The UK, France and Baltic nations have said they will put boots on the ground in the event of a peace settlement. AFP reported that six nations had signed up. Healey said planning for a so-called reassurance force was “real, substantial and well-advanced”. It envisages foreign soldiers being deployed away from the 1,000km-long frontline and boosting existing Ukrainian ground forces, he suggested. Russia has categorically rejected the idea. Sweden’s defence minister, Pål Jonson, said Stockholm needed answers to “a number of questions” before it could make a commitment. “It’s helpful if there’s a clarity of what that mission would entail, and what do we do – if we are peacekeeping, deterrence or reassurance,” he said. The UK has said the US military “backstop” – meaning comprehensive air cover – is essential for any mission to work. The Trump administration, however, has ruled this out and has indicated that Ukraine’s future security needs are now Europe’s problem. The Biden administration set up the Ukraine defence contact group after Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion and chaired meetings. In February the US relinquished this leadership role, handing it over to London and Berlin. Hegseth said the Trump administration had priorities elsewhere – in Asia and on America’s own borders.",

US envoySteve WitkoffvisitsRussiatoday, where his is expected to meet Russian presidentVladimir Putin(14:27). The meeting comes amid growing impatience over Russia’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire and peace talks over Ukraine, with US president Donald Trump saying “Russia has to get moving” (16:10). Ukrainian defence ministerRustem Umerovwarned Russia was ramping up its military production and has shown no will for peace (12:55). His comments came on the day as western allies mobilised over€21bn in new military aid to Ukraine, including from the UK and Germany. But German defence ministerBoris Pistoriusstressed that “given Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future.” British defence secretaryJohn Healeystrongly pushed back on EU foreign policy chiefKaja Kallas’sapparent criticism that there was a lack of clarity on the Coalition of the Willing’s plans for the reassurance force in Ukraine (9:39), saying the planning was “real, substantial, well advanced,” and the EU was not a part of it (12:59).

Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war - A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!! … and if you wondered what presidentDonald Trumpthinks of his tariffs policy, here’s his take, as published on Truth Social just now: We aredoing really wellon our TARIFF POLICY. Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly. DJT If you want to know what the markets think – theNew York Stock Exchange has just openedfor trading – our business live blog is here: TheEU will not rip up its tech rulesin an attemptto reach a trade deal with Donald Trump, the bloc’s most senior official on digital policy has said. Henna Virkkunen,the European Commission vice-president responsible for tech sovereignty, indicatedthe EU was not going to compromise on its digital rulebookto reach an agreement on trade with the US – a key demand of Trump administration officials. “We are very committed to our rules when it comes to the digital world,” Virkkunen said in an interview with European newspapers, including the Guardian. “We want to make sure that our digital environment in theEuropean Union… that it is fair and it’s safe and it’s also democratic.” Read in full: We’re just getting new lines fromthe Kremlin, confirming that US presidentDonald Trump’senvoySteve Witkoffwho landed in Moscow a few hours ago will meet Russian presidentVladimir Putin. In reports carried by Reuters from Russian agencies, Ria and Interfax, the Kremlin is also quoted as sayingthe pair will talk about Ukraineand“may discuss Putin’s meeting with Trump”. But also a caveat that “Witkoff’s visit to Russiacannot be called momentous,no breakthroughs should be expected.” Elsewhere, Spain’s prime minister,Pedro Sánchez,has offered his condolences to friends and relatives of a Spanish familywho died in New York on Thursday after their sightseeing helicopter crashed in the Hudson River, killing all onboard including the pilot. It emerged on Friday that the victims wereAgustín Escobar, his wife,Mercè Camprubí, and their three children, who were 11, five and four. The identity of the pilot has not yet been made public. The sightseeing helicopter broke apart in midair and crashed upside down into the Hudson between Manhattan and the New Jersey waterfront shortly after 3pm local time, leading to a huge response from emergency crews. Umerovgets asked aboutWitkoff’strip to Russia, but sidesteps the question, as he says he only just heard about it, and he hopes to hear from US counterparts on this later. And that concludes the press conference. Pistoriusgets also asked ifGermanycould provide morePatriotair defence systems toUkraine, but he says that is not an option at that moment as it is waiting on deliveries of these systems itself. Asked about it, Germany’sPistoriusplays down the significance of US defence secretaryPete Hegseth’sparticipation via a video call, and not in person. He says “it is a matter of schedules,” as Hegseth only returned to the US from other grips, and said that some other ministers were not physically here for the same reason. “The most important fact was that he took part,” he said. He says: “And in the near future, in the weeks to come, we will see what’s going to happen with the US participation, with the US support. I am not able to … look in the crystal ball. We wait and see. … We take on more responsibility as Europeans and Nato as Europeans, together with UK.” Ukraine’sUmerovsupports him speaking along the same lines. UK defence secretaryJohn Healeystrongly pushed back on EU foreign policy chiefKaja Kallas’sapparent criticism that there was a lack of clarity on the Coalition of the Willing’s plans for the reassurance force in Ukraine (9:39). Asked about it, he says: Our planning is indeed for the Coalition of the Willing, [it is] real, substantial, well advanced.The European Union is not part of that planning. Ukrainian defence ministerRustem Umerovsays he informed other ministers that “Russia is ramping up its production … and does not show any evidence [it is] willing to have peace.” He thanks allied countries for their continuing help, stressing the particularly urgent need for more air defence systems. UK defence secretaryJohn Healeysays today’s discussions led toover €21bn in fresh military aid commitments from allied countries, “a record boost in military funding forUkraine.” He adds the UK also continues its support, with the total of £4.5bn to be spent on military support for Ukraine this year. Healey joins Pistorius in calling out Putin’s continuing aggression: Today is one month to the day in which Russia rejected president Trump’s peace settlement. Putin said he wanted peace, but he rejected a full ceasefire. Putin said he wanted peace, but he continues to drag his feet and delay negotiations. Putin said he wanted peace, but his forces continue to fire on Ukraine, military and civilian targets alike. Speaking about the current situation, German defence ministersPistorius– who is expected to retain his job in the next coalition government – says that: “Given Russia’s ongoing aggression against Ukraine, we must concede peace in Ukraine appears to be out of reach in the immediate future.” He adds: “We will ensure that Ukraine continues to benefit from our joint military support. Russia needs to understand that Ukraine is able to go on fighting, and we will support it.” Germany’sPistoriuscondemns Russia for “continuing its attacks againstUkraine,” as he says Moscow “is still not yet interested in peace.” “Ukraine needs a strong military, and only then can the negotiation process lead to a just and lasting peace,” he says. German,BritishandUkrainiandefence ministers are giving a press conference after today’s meeting of theUkraineDefence Contact Group now. I will bring you they key lines here. Separately, speaking at a press conference in Warsaw, EU economy commissionerValdis Dombrovskisspoke about the US tariffs, saying that: The nature of these rapidly moving developments make it difficult to assess their impact on the EU’s economic outlook. But what is clear and what also ministers in today’s meeting agreed on is that the impact of the tariffs, it will be the US itself that will be first and most hit by the tariffs. He said that early model simulations indicated the US GDP would be reduced by 0.8 to 1.4% until 2027, with the EU’s growth hit much lower, at 0.2%. “These model simulations do not account for additional loss of investor and business confidence in the US economy, which could further the negative GDP impact,” he added. He said: “So let me make it clear, Europe did not start this confrontation, and Europe does not want this confrontation. Tariffs go against the political and economic logic of deep and longstanding transatlantic trading partnership, … so from commission side, will continue to closely monitor financial developments in a days and weeks ahead. We’re ready to negotiate a mutually acceptable outcome while defending our economic interests so there is no need to continue to hurt the US own and our economy.” We’re getting an update on US envoySteve Witkoff’svisit to Moscow, with TASS news agency reporting he met withVladimir Putin’sinternational cooperation envoyKirill Dmitriev. I will bring you more on their conversation if and when we have it. EU trade commissionerMaroš Šefčovičwill go to Washington on Sunday, a commission spokesperson told the Irish broadcaster RTÉ. Olof Gill told RTÉ radio: The trade commissioner is gong to Washington to try and sign deals. That is what we are focused on.",

    "title": "Head of US military base in Greenland fired after JD Vance visit",
    "article_text": "The head of theUS militarybase in Greenland has been fired for criticising Washington’s agenda for the Arctic island after JD Vance visited two weeks ago. Col Susannah Meyers, who had served as commander of thePituffik space basesince July, was removed amid reports she had distanced herself and the base from the US vice-president’scriticism of Denmarkand its oversight of the territory. Greenland has its own government but is also part of the kingdom of Denmark, which previously ruled it as a colony and continues to control its foreign and defence policies. Donald Trump has repeatedly said he wants to acquire the island and has not ruled out military or economic force to do so. The US Space Force said in a statement on Thursday night that Meyers had been removed from the position of commander on Thursday due to a “loss of confidence” in her ability to lead. “Commanders are expected to adhere to the highest standards of conduct, especially as it relates to remaining nonpartisan in the performance of their duties,” it added. The statement did not expand further, but the US websiteMilitary.comsaid Meyers sent an email to all personnel at Pituffik on 31 March “seemingly aimed at generating unity among the airmen and guardians, as well as the Canadians, Danes and Greenlanders who work there, following Vance’s appearance”. Vance visited the base on 28 March in a trip that was substantially changed at the last minute amid increasingly strained relations between the US, Greenland andDenmark. During the visit he told troops that the US had to gain control of the Arctic island to stop the threat of China and Russia. He also criticised Denmark, which he said had “not done a good job by the people of Greenland”. Originally, the delegation had been planned to be led by his wife, the second lady, Usha Vance, who had been scheduled to visit the capital, Nuuk, and a dog sled race in Sisimiut. But after outrage over the timing after the election – the new coalition government had yet to be sworn in – the plans were changed. The vice-president said during a press conference at the base: “Our message to Denmark is very simple: you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have underinvested in the people of Greenland and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful land mass.” In her email Meyers wrote: “I do not presume to understand current politics, but what I do know is the concerns of the US administration discussed by vice-president Vance on Friday are not reflective of Pituffik space base.” The Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on X: “Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated at the Department of Defence.” Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Trump has said the US needs control of Greenland for national and international security. The US Space Force said Meyers had been replaced with Col Shawn Lee. Meyers appears to be the latest in aTrump administrationpurge of high-ranking military officers and commanders. Others include Air Force Gen Tim Haugh, the director of the National Security Agency, and V Adm Shoshana Chatfield, who served with Nato. Joe Kasper, the chief of staff at the US department of defence, said: “Civilian control of the military is a bedrock principle of our armed forces. Actions to undermine the chain of command or to subvert President Trump’s agenda will not be tolerated at the defence department.” The Danish defence department declined to comment. The Pituffik space base has been contacted for comment.",

    "article_text": "A Polish woman who had her application to remain in the UK rejected because she mistakenly filled in a form online instead of on paper has been granted permission to stay in Britain after a change of mind by theHome Office. Elzbieta Olszewska, 80, had been living alone in her flat in Warsaw before arriving in the UK last September. Her only child, Michal Olszewski, 52, an aeronautical engineer and dual British-Polish citizen, who lives in Lincoln with his wife, had been travelling regularly to the Polish capital to support his mother. As his mother had become increasingly frail he wanted her to move to the UK so he and his wife could care for her properly. Olszewska arrived in the UK last year on a six-month visitor visa. Shortly afterwards, an application containing the correct information was made online for her to live permanently in Britain with her son and his wife. On 25 March, the Home Office responded, informing the family: “Unfortunately your application is not valid and we are unable to accept it … The required application process for someone applying as a family member of a relevant naturalised British citizen is to use the appropriate paper form. “Your application was made online. There is no right of appeal in respect of an invalid application.” Owing to the delay in Home Office officials informing Olszewska that the wrong form had been completed, her visitor visa had expired and she had become an overstayer. The letter warned her that the consequences of staying in Britain unlawfully included being detained, fined and imprisoned, along with being removed and banned from returning to the UK. After the Guardian highlighted the case, the Home Office emailed the correct form to print and post back to them – and within days it approved the application, granting five years pre-settled status under the EU settlement scheme. A very different letter was sent by the Home Office this time, stating: ‘I am pleased to inform you …” and confirming the right to work, use the NHS and study in the UK. The case received widespread attention in the UK and inPoland. One elderly British man even offered to marry Olszewska. He said he was not looking for a relationship but wanted to make the offer as a gesture of Polish-British friendship.

    "article_text": "Israel’s military is organising hiking tours for civilians in newly occupied Syrian territory during the Passover holiday, local media has reported. The twice-daily tours in the contestedGolan Heightswill run for a week beginning this Sunday. Tickets sold out almost immediately. Under a military escort in bulletproof buses, small groups will travel up to 2.5km into Syrian territory that was off limits until the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) seized the Golan buffer zone afterthe fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in December. Israel has occupied the Golan Heights since 1967 and now controls hundreds more square kilometres of Syrian land. The itinerary includes the Syrian side of Mount Hermon, which overlooks Damascus, and Lebanon’s Shebaa Farms at the foot of the mountain. The Israeli-occupied strip of Lebanese land, reputedly the site of God’s covenant with Abraham, has been a flashpoint for violence between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah for decades. Visitors will also be able to hike and swim in the Ruqqad river valley which flows into the Yarmouk on the border with Jordan, and see parts of the abandoned Ottoman Hejaz railway, which used to connect the empire’s capital in Istanbul to Haifa, Nablus and holy sites in present day Saudi Arabia. The trips have been organised by the IDF’s 210th Division, the Golan regional council, the Keshet Yehonatan religious education centre, the environmentalist Golan Field School and the Israel nature and parks authority, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported. The tours are part of a wider initiative, “Returning to a Safer North”, after the end of last year’s Israel-Hezbollah war, which was part of the regional fallout ignited by Hamas’s October 2023 attack on Israel and the ensuing war in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military said: “It’s important for us to restore heritage and tourism to the region and to tell the story of the battles fought during the war.” Tourists sign up at their own risk and the trips may be cancelled at short notice if there are security issues. In response to questions from Israeli newspaper Haaretz, the IDF said that the tour was “inside Israel”, rather than Syria, although the visits take place in the Golan Heights demilitarised buffer zone, internationally recognised as Syrian territory. The IDF began a heavy bombing campaign across Syriatargeting the regime’s weapons stockpiles shortly after Assad fled the country, while ground troops advanced in violation of a 1974 agreement. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, has demanded that forces belonging to Syria’s new Islamist-led transitional government stay away from the border area and that the IDF remain until an alternative arrangement can be found. Given demand, organisers have said that they hope the security situation will permit additional tours to Syria after Passover.",

    "article_text": "A history teacher has said she was arrested and blocked from seeing her daughters after she confiscated their iPads. Vanessa Brown, 50, described her “unspeakable devastation and trauma” after spending seven-and-a-half hours in a cell on 26 March after a claim that she had stolen two iPads. She was later released with bail conditions that barred her from speaking to anyone connected to the investigation – including her children – until the case was dropped. Brown told LBCshe had taken the iPads to encourage her daughters to focus on their schoolwork. Surrey police tracked the devices to Brown’s mother’s house in Cobham, Surrey, and later accepted the devices belonged to her children and she was “entitled” to confiscate them. “I find it quite traumatic even talking about this now,” Brown said. “At no point did [the officers] think to themselves, ‘Oh, this is a little bit of an overreaction for a moment, confiscating temporarily her [own] iPads and popping over to her mum’s to have a coffee’. It was just a complete overreaction.” She added: “It was thoroughly unprofessional. They were speaking to my mother, who is in her 80s, like she was a criminal.” Surrey police said a search for the devices began after a man in his 40s reported the theft of two iPads to officers who attended an address in Cobham, following a report of a “concern for safety”. Ch Supt Aimee Ramm, Surrey police’s northern divisional commander, said: “This led officers to carry out further enquiries at a second address, where a 50-year-old woman from Cobham was questioned about the iPads and denied any knowledge of their whereabouts. “However, a tracking device on the iPads showed that they were at the address. Officers encouraged the woman to return the items and resolve the matter, however the woman did not cooperate and therefore she was arrested on suspicion of theft. A search was then carried out using post-arrest powers and the iPads were located. “During this time, officers called South East Coast ambulance to attend the address following a further concern for safety.” Brown told LBC she was taken to Staines police station, where she was searched and had fingerprints and custody shots taken, before being placed in a cell. She said she was not able to return to her mother’s home until almost 12 hours after police first arrived, and was left in a “catatonic state” as a result of the experience. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Brown also reported that officers pulled one of her daughters out of a class at school in relation to the matter. “They were able to send a police car with police officers to my children’s school, they were able to send another police car or two to arrest me … I know people are making reports of thefts, of assaults and very violent crimes in and around our neighbourhood – and they’re not getting a response for days. “I cannot get to the bottom of why [my arrest] was done in such a quick turnaround – maybe less than an hour. All these police cars and police officers going into address over a completely false report of a theft.” Surrey police said Brown was released on conditional bail while further enquiries were carried out to establish the ownership of the iPads. Ramm said: “The police bail conditions included not speaking to anyone connected to the investigation, including her daughters, while officers carried out their enquiries. “Following these enquiries, officers were able to verify that the iPads belonged to the woman’s children, and that she was entitled to confiscate these items from her own children. The case was therefore closed the following day with no further action being taken and the bail conditions which had been set were then no longer applicable. “Officers did attend the daughter’s school – however this was in relation to the initial concern for safety.”",

    "title": "Starmer steps in to seize control of British Steel with nationalisation likely",
    "article_text": "Keir Starmer is stepping in to seize control ofBritish Steelto stop its Chinese owner shutting the Scunthorpe plant in an unprecedented move that paves the way for likely nationalisation. The prime minister was granted a recall of parliament on Saturday, with MPs set to debate emergency laws that will give the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, the power to direct the company. When the legislation is passed, Reynolds will be able to order the company to buy the raw materials to keep two blast furnaces going at the plant and the taxpayer will take on the costs of the purchases. The company’s owner, Jingye, has said it is losing about £700,000 a day. The issue of nationalisation will be dealt with separately and is not certain to happen, but senior sources said it was the likely outcome and the government would look at potential private sector partners for a transfer of ownership and co-investment. The company declined to comment and it remains unclear how Jingye will respond to being directed by the UK government. Government sources said generous offers had been made to the Chinese company that any rational actor would have accepted, and that the UK was taking action to keep the furnaces going in order to continue talks about the next steps. Once they had been allowed to stop, the furnaces would be impossible to restart. Speaking on Friday, Starmer said the “future of British steel hangs in the balance” and he would not stand by while the last blast furnaces in the UK were closed, shutting an essential industry. The GMB union said the move looked like “the first step in the process” of nationalisation, saying it was the only way to save the UK steel industry. “The business secretary must be given huge praise for acting decisively to safeguard this vital industry and the thousands of jobs that rely on it,” the union said. A No 10 spokesperson said: “The prime minister has been clear, his government will always act in the national interest. All actions we take are in the name of British industry, British jobs and for British workers. “Tomorrow, parliament will be recalled to debate the steel industry (special measures) bill. The bill provides the government with the power to direct steel companies in England, which we will use to protect the Scunthorpe site. It enables the UK government to preserve capability and ensure public safety. It also ensures all options remain viable for the future of the plant and the livelihoods it supports. “We have been negotiating with British Steel’s owners in good faith ever since coming to office. We have always been clear there is a bright future for steel in the UK. All options remain on the table.” The Commons will sit at 11am, with MPs called back from Easter recess to discuss putting the assets under public control. The government will aim to get emergency legislation through the Commons and Lords in one day of sitting. Labour MPs have been told to tell their whips where they are and to make all efforts to return to Westminster to ensure the passage of the legislation. This week government sources said nationalising British Steel was not easy, and would be a measure of last resort. The last time parliament was recalled during recess was in 2021, whenAfghanistan had to be evacuatedduring the Taliban takeover. It is also the first recall of parliament on a Saturday since 1982. One MP said the move was “going down extremely badly” with colleagues who had been given no warning about the need to return to Westminster, when it had been known for weeks that British Steel was in trouble. Some opposition parties were also furious that other industrial plants in trouble had not been given the same treatment from the government. Plaid Cymru said “the people of Wales would not forget” that the steel plant at Port Talbot was allowed to close its blast furnaces and convert to electric arc production, while the SNP highlighted the different treatment for Grangemouth – Scotland’s only oil refinery, which could close. Government sources said those plants were facing different situations. The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said the government had “bungled” the negotiations with British Steel. “They must have seen this coming for a while,” she said. “Instead of addressing it earlier in the week when parliament was sitting, their incompetence has led to a last-minute recall of parliament.” British Steel makes the vast majority of UK rail track and the government has been seeking a deal to keep the plant open. The industry will be hit by a25% tariff on steel exportsto the US imposed by Donald Trump but the government has insisted British Steel’s problems are not related to this. Talks with Jingye’s chair, Li Ganpo, had dragged on for three days after the government offered to buy raw materials to keep the plant running for the next few weeks while trying to find a longer-term solution. Scunthorpe is the last remaining steelworks capable of making steel from iron ore and so is seen by some people as strategically important for the UK. However, Jingye last month said itplanned to close the plant’s two blast furnaces, putting 2,700 jobs at risk. It has since refused to pay for new raw materials, with coal and iron ore deliveries to Immingham port not yet paid for. The government had offered £500m in financial support to switch the blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces, but Jingye had requested much more. Talks this week are thought to have stalled when Jingye balked at the conditions attached to the offer to pay for new raw materials. The delays in reaching an agreement had caused increasing alarm among workers, who feared at least one blast furnace might be forced to close as soon as next week, leading to job losses.",

    "title": "Noel Clarke ‘precisely the man’ depicted in Guardian’s reporting, high court told",
    "article_text": "Noel Clarke has been shown to be “precisely the man” depicted in the Guardian’s articles accusing him of sexual misconduct, vindicating its journalism, the high court has heard. In closing submissions in the former Doctor Who actor’s libel claim against Guardian News and Media (GNM), Gavin Millar KC said Clarke had been forced to come up with an “elaborate conspiracy theory” to try to rebut the “overwhelming evidence” against him. “[The claimant] had long pinned his hopes on [the defendant’s] witnesses not attending trial,” said Millar in written submissions. “If they did, then [Clarke] had a problem: to explain how it was that (i) 28 individuals had been willing to file witness statements verified by statements of truth attesting to his misconduct, (ii) very many more had given evidence as sources … in the course of its journalistic investigation, and (iii) [the Guardian], a respected and trusted source of news reporting, could have come to publish the articles in issue if their accounts were untrue. “So [Clarke] needed to frame a conspiracy of malevolent liars who were able and willing not only to deceive the Guardian and now this court, and including people who recruited the Guardian to its ends, persuading it to publish their lies and – in the process – deceive its editor-in-chief, Ms [Katharine] Viner, into believing that it was in the public interest to publish them. This was a wholly unevidenced and inherently implausible case.” At Friday’s conclusion of the trial, which began on 7 March, Millar said that allegations made by Clarke about the motives of the Guardian’s witnesses and its journalists had been shown to be a “complete nonsense”. The conspiracy theory, he said, was “a case born of necessary invention”. Millar said Clarke had “a very clear motive to lie”. For Clarke, Philip Williams said that his client was the victim of an industry attempting to correct itself after the #MeToo movement. He highlighted the Benny Hill and Little Britain series and Carry On films as productions that would now be considered “inappropriate”. He said, in written submissions: “Mr Clarke, with his success despite his outsider status and as a clear product of that time, was simply a casualty of this purge. It represents illiterate historical revisionism and completely ignores any nuance or context.” He told the court: “The court will realise that the Guardian has manifestly failed to do its job properly. They approached the destruction of this man’s life with a cavalier, haphazard and negligent attitude which can only be described as competitive ignorance.” During the course of the trial, the Guardian argued two defences: that the allegations in the articles were true and that they were also in the public interest. The court heard from 28 “truth” witnesses who had been prepared to sign statements for the Guardian, included 21 “key witnesses” who said they had experienced misconduct by Clarke themselves or directly witnessed it. Millar said that their evidence supported the claims against Clarke, which were made up of several elements. They were that: Over 15 years, he used his power to prey on and harass female colleagues. He sometimes bullied female colleagues. He engaged in unwanted sexual contact, kissing, touching or groping. He engaged in sexually inappropriate behaviour and comments. He was involved in professional misconduct. He took and shared explicit pictures and videos without consent, including secretly filming a young actor’s naked audition. “The truth witnesses who gave evidence for [the Guardian] have all come up to proof. They have no reason at all to lie and every reason not to,” Millar said. In oral submissions, he told the court that Clarke’s position was that “every one of them is lying about something or, when he can’t remember, then they must be lying because he wouldn’t have said or done what they allege. It’s an extraordinary position to take … That high number [of witnesses] is against him. It’s inherently improbable.” Millar said that that witnesses were variously corroborated by other people and documentary evidence. For example, Jing Lusi messaged a friend a day or too after dinner with Clarke saying she had been “Me-Too-ed” at work, while Imogen*, who, as a “wide-eyed” 20-year-old, said she was propositioned over dinner by Clarke and found him “sexually threatening” wrote a contemporary, unpublished Tumblr post about her experience. Williams said in written submissions that the Guardian had sought to rely on a handful of people who “were plotting and carrying out their scheme from 2019 to bring about Mr Clarke’s downfall, based on vitriolic hatred, professional jealousy, classist snobbery and insidious racialised bias”. He told the court: “The alleged complainants, and the others involved in the campaign, were not acting independently.” As such, he said the court was “not confronted with 20-plus individual complainants, but an interlinked network”. The court heard that five of Clarke’s witnesses did not turn up and Millar said that excepting one, Clarke “could not produce a single witness to support or corroborate his version of events on the key factual issues”. He described Clarke’s witnesses as, bar his wife, “male friends of his who apparently attended trial out of loyalty to him”. Williams said some of Clarke’s potential witnesses had been “frightened off”, claiming that the actor’s former assistant, Gina Powell, and one of his accusers, had sought to “discredit” several with “flawed allegations” made against them. Several Guardian journalists gave evidence during the trial to argue the publication of the articles was in the public interest. In his written submissions, Millar said: “They have no reason at all to lie and every reason not to. And the evidence has shown overwhelmingly that [the Guardian’s] assessment that publication of the articles in issue was in the public interest was not only reasonable, it was correct.” One of the Guardian’s reporters, Lucy Osborne, was described by Millar as “an obviously truthful witness who, as with her colleagues, had impressive command of the detail of the investigation notwithstanding the passage of time”. Sirin Kale, her reporting colleague, and Paul Lewis, the Guardian’s investigations editor, were described as “considered, thoughtful and concerned to assist the court in understanding the work they undertook”. “They were careful witnesses who were conscious at the time of the significance and potential consequences of publication.” Williams’s written submissions on behalf of Clarke contained diagrams of what were described as “primary connections” and “secondary connections” between the actor’s accusers – connections which he said the Guardian should have been aware of. He said the claims against Clarke were “a stitch-up” and that this should have been apparent to the Guardian. Williams said the public interest defence should fail because there was “a lack of verification for some of these major issues that they could not have believed that the allegations were fit for publication”. Millar told the court that the claimant had raised “granular points” in relation to the evidence considered by reporters to try to undermine them. He also dismissed suggestions there were racial undertones to the investigation, saying there was “unsurprisingly no evidence whatsoever” to support the claim. He described the diagram showing purported links between the accusers as “childish” and said that attempts to substantiate the alleged conspiracy as consisting of “speculative questioning and attempts to fish for a case by asking about connections between witnesses and supposed sources”. He told the court: “This was a careful, and thorough, investigation conducted conscientiously by Guardian journalists who were aware of the potential pitfalls. “They received information from a wide range of sources with direct evidence of misconduct and in each case carefully considered and tested the information they were given, electing to publish only such information as they believed was credible. In testing those accounts they did all that could be reasonably expected of them. “They published the allegations accurately and in the case of every published allegation also set out [Clarke’]s response to the allegation. Their belief that publication of the articles was in the public interest cannot be faulted. It was plainly a reasonable belief.” In his written submissions, Millar said the evidence of Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, and her deputy, Owen Gibson, went unchallenged. “It must be accepted by [Clarke] that it was Ms Viner who took the decision that it was in the public interest to publish and she did so in good faith based on the factors she sets out in her evidence.” Clarke variously accused his accusers of lying, embellishing incidents and having axes to grind. Williams said: “Complainants were ‘carefully curated’, and encouraged to cooperate with one another in order to create and embellish their complaints.” But he also denied that incidents described by witnesses amounted to sexual misconduct. In contrast to the evidence given by witnesses, Williams described some of the incidents as nothing more than “tapping of a leg for practical purposes, bad taste jokes, unbefitting banter, consensual sex and photographs, and purported threats to silence”. He said: “Mr Clarke was classified as a ‘serial abuser’ – rhetorically, what is the abuse? … Out of this of sea of insinuations and innuendoes, trying to identify actual instances of sexual harassment (which attain the threshold of s.26 of the Equality Act) or sexual assault is akin to finding needles in a haystack.” Making a point about changing standards over time, Williams also said: “The lens of 20 years ago is not the lens of today.” But Millar said rather than admitting fault, Clarke had “made unpersuasive but revealing efforts to normalise and/or excuse conduct that most people would find – and would have found whether 10 or 20 years ago – offensive and unacceptable”. He said the evidence had “shown [Clarke] to be precisely the man depicted in … [the] articles, who has brought this case to trial on an entirely false basis”. Millar referred disparagingly to Clarke’s suggestion that one of his accusers had been motived to perjure herself because of her belief in “women’s rights”. He said Clarke “was an unreliable witness whose evidence on the factual issues should not be believed”. As an example, he cited Clarke’s response to allegations made by one woman that she experienced unwanted sexual touching by Clarke during the filming of a sex scene. Millar said that key aspects of Clarke’s evidence “were admitted by him to be false”, including that he had supported himself on his left leg throughout the scene when the film shows his hips right up against the woman’s. “All these misstatements contributed to a false narrative of the shooting of the scene,” Millar said. He told the high court that Clarke had produced “worthless evidence”. “The evidence which the court has heard shows overwhelmingly that [Clarke’s] case must fail,” Millar told the court. “[The Guardian’s] investigative journalism, and the witnesses who gave evidence of their knowledge of [Clarke’s] extensive misconduct, have been vindicated.” The judge, Mrs Justice Steyn, will give her judgment at a later date. *Not their real name",

    "title": "Starmer aiming to ‘pass emergency legislation in one day’ to save British Steel – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed, you can read more on this storyhere The government will “pass emergency legislation in one day” to protect the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe, Starmer said. Speaking in Downing Street, the Prime Minister said: We will act with urgency. Now, we should be clear this situation and our response is unique. While it is true that we are facing a new era of global instability, our concerns about this plant and negotiations to protect it have been running for years. This moment could have happened at any time, but it has happened now, and I will not stand by. There is no time to waste. So we are recalling Parliament tomorrow for a Saturday sitting. We will pass emergency legislation in one day to give the Business Secretary the powers to do everything possible to stop the closure of these blast furnaces. And as I have said, we will keep all options on the table. For the second time today, we’re closing this blog. Here’s a round-up of the day’s main developments: Keir Starmer is stepping in to seize control ofBritish Steelto stop its Chinese owner shutting the Scunthorpe plant in an unprecedented move that paves the way for likely nationalisation The prime minister was granted a recall of parliament on Saturday, with MPs set to debate emergency laws that will give the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, the power to direct the company The government is aiming to “pass emergency legislation in one day”, Starmer said, with the Lords also being recalled Meanwhile,Michael Gove is among seven new appointeesto the House of Lords by Rishi Sunak in his resignation honours list. James Cleverly, Jeremy Hunt, Mel Stride and Grant Shapps are among those receiving knighthoods Rachel Reeves has said that the government needs to go “further and faster on delivering growth that is felt by families up and down the country” after February’s GDP figures showedan unexpected growth of 0.5%, and January’s figures were revised up slightly Thanks for reading. Blast furnaces have been making steel in Britain for 300 years, ever since they helped start the Industrial Revolution. This weekend, parliament will sit for the first Saturday in decades as it tries to keep the last two furnaces running for a bit longer. Keir Starmer has recalled MPs to discuss emergency powers to direct steel companies, including British Steel’s Scunthorpe steelworks, to “preserve capability and ensure public safety”. The move would be short of nationalisation, but it would give the government more influence on the steel industry than at any point since Margaret Thatcher. The government is scrambling to save Scunthorpe after its Chinese owner, Jingye Steel Group, last month said it was considering closing it, with thelikely loss of 2,700 jobs. Starmer and the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, hope to keep the plant running for the next few weeks while they work out the longer-term plan, with nationalisation one option. British Steel is facing a crisis within a crisis: in the short term – the next week or so – it needs materials, including iron pellets and coking coal, or else it faces the prospect of the furnaces cooling beyond easy or affordable recovery. Customers would flee, making job losses inevitable. People with knowledge of this week’s talks between the UK government and Jingye said it appeared that the government had run out of patience with the Chinese company’s negotiating. The government had offered to buy the raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running in the short term but that offer was not taken up. Parliament may be able to avert the short-term crisis on Saturday. Kemi Badenoch has saidLabour“bungled” negotiations over British Steel and are now “scrambling for a solution” that will come at a big cost to taxpayers. The Conservative leader said: The Labour government have landed themselves in a steel crisis entirely of their own making. They’ve made poor decisions and let the unions dictate their actions. As business secretary, I negotiated a modernisation plan with British Steel to limit job losses and keep the plant running, including introducing an electric arc furnace in Teesside, similar to what we did with Tata at Port Talbot steelworks. However, the union-led Labour Government have bungled the negotiations, insisting on a Scunthorpe-only deal that the company has deemed unviable. Keir Starmer should have seen this coming. She added: Now the British public can see the Government scrambling for a solution to a problem they created and could have resolved months ago. It is inevitable that it’s going to cost taxpayers a lot of money. The Green Party has said it will support nationalising British Steel in tomorrow’s vote. Green MP Ellie Chowns said nationalisation was “the only sure way to secure this strategically important sector so vital to national security and British jobs”. She added: Public ownership of key sectors like steel, water, energy and transport has always been Green Party policy. And where it is in the public interest to have public ownership of a key strategic industry, which appears to be the case with Scunthorpe Steelworks, Greens are in full support. Taking British Steel into public ownership provides the opportunity to help drive the green industrial revolution, supporting Scunthorpe Steelworks to make the transition from blast furnaces to electric arcs, which are cheaper and far better for the environment to run. Supporting decarbonisation of steel will further enable the UK to produce the green steel necessary to transition to a green economy, such as wind turbines and trains. Business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has now issued a statement on British Steel. It doesn’t add much to what Starmer said earlier. Reynolds, like the PM, emphasises the strategic importance of being able produce steel in the UK. He said: We will always do what is necessary to keep Britain secure at home and strong abroad. We are doing what previous governments have failed to, acting in the national interest to help secure UK steelmaking for the future We negotiated with British Steel’s owners in good faith ever since coming to office. We made a generous offer of support to the company and I am deeply disappointed that we have been forced to take these measures, but Jingye have not been forthright throughout this process, and left us no choice but to act. We’re in a new and changing world where it’s never been more important to support our security and build our resilience, so that we can have strength abroad and renewal at home, and that’s what this government has done. The Unite union has welcomed Starmer’s comments, saying that beginning the process of nationalisation is “absolutely the right thing to do”. Here is general secretary Sharon Graham’s full statement: I am pleased that the government has listened to representations by Unite and other steel unions over the future of British Steel. Ministers could not have allowed a foundation industry to go under with the loss of more than 3,000 jobs and key skills. It is absolutely the right thing to do to begin the process of nationalisation. Discussions have been positive and whilst a longer-term plan needs to be developed, this gives workers the reprieve we have been asking for. It is essential that Scunthorpe receives the relevant infrastructure and kit to allow it to thrive as a modern steel producer long into the future. Unite is also urging the government to consider making steel an area of critical national infrastructure and ensure that UK steel is used on all infrastructure projects. This move is needed to back the British steel industry as a whole. It is also vital that the government tackles the issue of industrial energy costs. If you’re wondering why the Scunthorpe steelworks is of such importance for the UK, my colleagues Rowena Mason, Eleni CoureaandJasper Jolly say this in their report: Scunthorpe is the last remaining steelworks capable of making steel from iron ore and so is seen by some people as strategically important for the UK. However, Jingye last month said itplanned to close the plant’s two blast furnaces, putting 2,700 jobs at risk. It has since refused to pay for new raw materials, with coal and iron ore deliveries to Immingham port not yet paid for. The government had offered £500m in financial support to switch the blast furnaces to cleaner electric arc furnaces, but Jingye had requested much more. Talks this week are thought to have stalled when Jingye balked at the conditions attached to the offer to pay for new raw materials. The delays in reaching an agreement had caused increasing alarm among workers, who feared at least one blast furnace might be forced to close as soon as next week, leading to job losses. We’ve got a bit more from the PM, who said government plans to take control of the British Steel plant in Scunthorpe aims to “preserve all viable options” for the operation. Asked to clarify whether the emergency legislation to be debated in the Commons and Lords on Saturday amounts to nationalisation, or as a precursor to nationalisation, Starmer said: Well, what we’re doing tomorrow is passing legislation to take control of the plant and to preserve all viable options. It doesn’t mean all options are on the table, but it means all options remain viable. But the step we’re taking tomorrow is the step of taking control, because it’s necessary now to do that. He added: Obviously, negotiations will be going on for some time, but now is the time to take this action, to take control of the plant. He did not directly answer when asked about the costs of the plan to secure Scunthorpe, nor why a similar plan was not presented to save the Port Talbot steelworks. The last time parliament was recalled during recess was in 2021, whenAfghanistan had to be evacuatedduring the Taliban takeover. It is also the first recall of parliament on a Saturday since 1982. Just ahead of Starmer’s press conference, No 10 said the bill up for debate tomorrow “provides the government with the power to direct steel companies in England, which we will use to protect the Scunthorpe site”. Here’s the full statement: The prime minister has been clear, his government will always act in the national interest. All actions we take are in the name of British industry, British jobs and for British workers. Tomorrow, parliament will be recalled to debate the Steel Industry (Special Measures) bill. The bill provides the government with the power to direct steel companies in England, which we will use to protect the Scunthorpe site. It enables the UK government to preserve capability and ensure public safety. It also ensures all options remain viable for the future of the plant and the livelihoods it supports. We have been negotiating with British Steel’s owners in good faith ever since coming to office. We have always been clear there is a bright future for steel in the UK. All options remain on the table.",

The government had offered to buy the raw materials to keep the blast furnaces running in the short term but that offer was not taken up. Parliament may be able to avert the short-term crisis on Saturday. Union leaders representing steelworkers said they were relieved that the government appeared to be moving towards public ownership. Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, a former Scunthorpe steelworker and national officer for the GMB union, said nationalisation was “the only way to save the UK steel industry”, and that the ability to direct the company’s actions was “the first step in that process”. Yet even nationalisation will not deliver Scunthorpe’s workers from the bigger questions over its long-term future. Jingye had rejected a £500m offer of support to switch to electric arc furnaces – to match aid given to Tata Steel at Port Talbot, south Wales – but Scunthorpe will need to make the switch if it is to have a future in a world of net zero carbon emissions. The struggling Scunthorpe plant has passed between many owners since theprivatisation of the UK steel industry in 1988. Its Indian former owner Tata Steel sold it to the private equity firm Greybull Capital in 2016, only for Greybull to exit in 2019. Jingye stepped in with a deal hurriedly agreed under Boris Johnson’s premiership to buy the plant out of insolvency. Jingye’s timing appears to have been unfortunate. Since it took over, British Steel has lost a cumulative £350m, according to accounts up to the end of 2023. The company was not helped by the turbulence of the coronavirus crisis and a global glut as the vast Chinese industry, producer of more than half the world’s steel, tried to find buyers. That was before Donald Trump’s tariffs added to the turmoil, making exports to the US more expensive and threatening a global recession. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion It is not an auspicious environment for the Labour government to undertake a major nationalisation. So the steel industry has been reassured that Labour has so far appeared committed to a manifesto pledge to invest £2.5bn in the sector, which has surviveddeep cuts to spending on international aidandbenefits. That commitment will be tested to its limit if Labour decides to take ownership of a steelworks that is losing money and needs hundreds of millions of pounds of investment. But the chance to guide a nationalised UK steel industry into the decarbonisation revolution will also have its attractions.",

    "article_text": "A judge has decided theresentencing hearings for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of murdering their parents, can continue despite a newLos Angelesdistrict attorney opposing their release after 30 years behind bars. The brothers appeared in court over Zoom on Friday for the proceedings. They were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole at ages 18 and 21 after being convicted of murdering their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills home in 1989. While the defense argued they acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance. George Gascón, the progressive former Los Angeles county district attorney, had sought to have the brothers resentenced to 50 years to life, which would have made them immediately eligible for release underCalifornialaw because they committed the crime when they were younger than 26. Despite losing reelection to tough-on-crime candidate Nathan Hochman in November, Gascón’s effort has succeeded. Hochman submitted a motion to withdraw Gascón’s request, saying he did not support the brothers’ resentencing because they had not confessed to lies they told as the case unfolded about why they killed their parents and did not “fully recognize, acknowledge, and accept complete responsibility” for their crime. The Menendez brothers’ resentencing hearings are scheduled for 17 and 18 April.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trumpshows no signs of easing his assault on climate science as plans of more sweeping cuts to key US research centers surfaced on Friday. The administration is planning to slash budgets at both the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (Noaa) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), according to internal budget documents, taking aim specifically at programs used to study impacts from theclimate crisis. Craig McLean, a longtime director of the office of oceanic and atmospheric research (OAR) who retired in 2022, told the Guardian that the cuts were draconian and would “compromise the safety, economic competitiveness, and security of the American people”. If the plan is approved by Congress, funding for OAR would be eviscerated –cut from $485m to $171m– dismantling an important part of the agency’s mission. All budgets for climate, weather and ocean laboratories would be drained, according to the document reviewed by the Guardian, which states: “At this funding level, OAR is eliminated as a line office.” “The elimination of Noaa’s research line office and all of its research capabilities is a crushing blow to the ability of our country to protect our citizens and also to lead the world,” said the former Noaa administrator Rick Spinrad, adding that the document included “an extraordinarily devastating set of recommendations”. The proposal would also cut more than $324m from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), instructing the agency to align its work with administration priorities to “unleash American energy”. Species-recovery grants, habitat conservation and restoration, and the interjurisdictional fisheries grant program, which supports coordinated management and research with the states, would all lose funding. The document also outlines a plan to move the NMFS under the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Noaa is facing a $1.3bn cut to overall operations and research, with various programs on the chopping block, and the National Ocean Service would be cut in half. Science done outside the agency would also be undermined with cuts to Noaa’s climate research grants program, which provides roughly $70m a year. “It’s a really disturbing and concerning development – but I would say it is not all that surprising,” Spinrad said of the plans outlined in the document, noting that there have been many indications the administration would take steps such as these. “But it also has an element of randomness associated with it,” he added. “There are specific programs called out, the reasons for which are absolutely not clear.” The fallout from cuts this deep, should Congress adopt the president’s plan, would be felt in communities around the world, and in far-ranging sectors, from agriculture to emergency management. “By making a complete divestiture in science and in our research enterprise, we are basically saying we are not interested in improving our quality of life or our economy,” Spinrad said. The administration also outlined plans to severely defund research at Nasa, the country’s space agency. The agency is slated for a 20% overall budget loss, but deeper cuts would be directed at programs overseeing planetary science, earth science and astrophysics research,accordingto Ars Technica,which first on Trump’s planswhen agency officials were briefed last month. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Now documents have been issued to back up those plans, halving funding for science atNasa. The plan for Nasa would also scrap a series of missions, including some that the federal government has already poured billions of taxpayer dollars into. The Nancy Grace Roman space telescope, which could offer glimpses into distant galaxies after its scheduled launch next year, is among them, along with the Mars Sample Return and the Davinci mission to Venus. The GoddardSpaceFlight Center in Maryland, which employs roughly 10,000 people, would also be closed. “This is an extinction-level event for Nasa science,” Casey Dreier, chief of space policy for the Planetary Society, told the Washington Post. “It needlessly terminates functional, productive science missions and cancels new missions currently being built, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars in the process. This is neither efficient nor smart budgeting.” Still not set in stone, these “passback” documents are a part of how the government goes about budgeting. They are issued by the White House to federal agencies before the discretionary budget is released and are seen as a guidance on presidential priorities. The numbers aren’t final and could be changed, and Congress will also have to act on the plans to finalize them. Spinrad is confident that many legislators won’t support the cuts. “Many of the actions put forward by [the White House’s office of management and budget] are in direct contradiction to congressional intent,” he said. “Zeroing out programs that Congress has worked hard to authorize over the years – that’s a clarion call to specific members and sponsors.” There’s also likely to be strong pushback from the public and from industries that rely on the tools and services made possible by the country’s scientists. But the drastic degree of these cuts also shows the administration’s position on climate science and its determination to hamper US research, experts say. That alone is enough to cause concern. “This proposal will cost lives,” McLean said of the document if it is enacted. “When a room full of doctors tell you that it’s cancer, firing the doctors does not cure you.”",

    "title": "Mikal Mahdi killed by firing squad as South Carolina pushes execution spree",
    "article_text": "A prison firing squad inSouth CarolinaexecutedMikal Mahdion Friday, the second recentdeath row killingin the state by authorized gunfire. Mahdi, 42, was shot dead by corrections employees inside the execution chamber, where authorities have carried out a rapid spree of killings asSouth Carolinaaggressively revives capital punishment. Mahdi was sentenced to death for the 2004 killing of James Myers, a 56-year-old off-duty public safety officer. His attorneys fought in recent days to block the execution, arguing he had suffered significant abuse and torture in his childhood and was denied a fair trial, but the state courts and US supreme court rejected the final petitions. South Carolina’s Republican governor, Henry McMaster, announced minutes before Mahdi’s execution that he would not be commuting Mahdi’s sentence. No governor in the state hasgranted clemencyto a death row defendant in the last 50 years of the modern death penalty era. The state resumed executions last year after a 13-year pause caused by its inability to procure lethal injection supplies. Officials now direct people on death row to choose their method of killing – either electric chair, lethal injection and firing squad. Mahdi’s lawyers said he selected the “lesser of three evils” and opted to be shot instead of “burned and mutilated in the electric chair, or suffering a lingering death on the lethal injection gurney”. The state’s firing squad protocols called for Mahdi to be strapped to a chair and shot by three prison employees aiming at a bullseye placed on the chest. Mahdigave no final statementand did not look toward the witnesses in the room, which included his lawyer. Mahdi cried out when he was shot, his arms flexed, and he groaned two more times roughly 45 seconds after the bullets were fired, according to an Associated Pressreporter, who served as a media witness. His breaths continued for roughly 80 seconds before he appeared to take a final gasp. He was pronounced dead around 6.05 pm, less than four minutes after he was shot. “Mikal Mahdi was a smart, creative, intellectually curious person who could have done so much more with his life. He just never got the chance,” his lawyer, David Weiss, said in a statement on Friday evening. “Tonight, the state of South Carolina executed him by firing squad – a horrifying act that belongs in the darkest chapters of history, not in a civilized society … We love Mikal and will miss him deeply.” Unlike the state’sfirst executionlast year of a man whopresented evidence of his innocencein his final days, Mahdi’s lawyers have not disputed his conviction or the facts of his case. His attorneys argued his constitutional rights were violated and that he should not have been sentenced to death, documenting an upbringing of violence and neglect in a US supreme court petition. Some of Mahdi’s earliest memories were of his father abusing his mother, who fled when he was four, and by age nine he was suicidal and briefly committed to a psychiatric facility. He did not get further treatment, and was homeschooled by his father who embraced conspiracy theories, the petition said. Mahdi entered the prison system as a young teen. Between ages 14 and 21, Mahdi spent an estimated total of 8,000 hours in solitary confinement while incarcerated, enduring prolonged isolation in conditions now widely regarded as torture, his attorneys said. At age 21, two months after a release from prison, he committed a series of violent crimes, including robbing a convenience store, fatally shooting the clerk, fleeing police and breaking into a shed at Myers’s home and killing him. Mahdi pleaded guilty, but his trial lawyers failed to properly advocate for him at sentencing, his attorneys argued. While prosecutors called 28 witnesses, Mahdi’s attorneys at the time called two individuals, only one of whom offered minimal testimony on his history of trauma. The judge did not learn about instances of extreme violence committed by his father, Mahdi’s severe mental health crises at a young age, or that he had spent the vast majority of his teenage years imprisoned without getting necessary treatment, often languishing in solitary, his lawyers said. After Mahdi’s trial counsels presented “barely half an hour” of “mitigating evidence”, the judge sentenced him to death, saying Mahdi lacked “humanity” and that it didn’t seem as if his “turbulent and transient childhood … contributed in any significant way” to the crimes. The South Carolina’s attorney general’s office argued Mahdi had exhausted his appeals and that his claims of ineffectual counsel had already been litigated. “Mikal died in full view of the system that failed him at every turn – from childhood to his final breath … Mikal’s life was a testament to systemic neglect, and his death was its final, cruel punctuation mark,” said Weiss, an assistant federal public defender. “We condemn the violence done to him as a child, as an adolescent in prison, and as an adult. Mikal’s story of abuse and neglect by the state is sadly not unique – but for the state to condemn a man who they broke as a child is not only a tragedy, it’s a collective failure of empathy by our society and by our entire system of justice.” On death row, Mahdi had spent time reading history and nonfiction and trying to learn Spanish by watching Telemundo, Weisstold the Guardianin an earlier interview. In his final days, he had also asked to have his organs donated after his death, but his attorneys were told healthcare protocols would bar the donations. Anti-death penalty advocates held vigils this week calling for McMaster to grant clemency, and two of Mahdi’selementary school teachersalso publicly urged for his life to be spared. Mahdi is the 12th person executedthis yearso far. His killing comes one month after South Carolina shot dead 67-year-old Brad Sigmon, who was the first personexecuted by firing squadin the US in 15 years. There have only been three other firing squad executions under the contemporary death penalty,all in Utah, but Idaho recentlypasseda law to make shooting theprimary execution methodin the state. Last month, Louisiana carried out a rare executionusing nitrogen gas, an experimental method banned under state law foreuthanizing dogs and cats. South Carolina has executed five people in the last seven months and continues to face scrutiny over thesecrecy of its methodsand thebrutal conditionsmen face on death row.",

    "article_text": "Immigrationofficials attempted to enter twoLos Angeleselementary schools this week, but were turned away by school administrators. The incident appears to be theTrump administration’s first attempt to enter the city’s public schools since amending regulations to allow immigration agents to enter “sensitive areas” such as schools. At a Thursday press conference, theLos Angelesunified school district superintendent, Alberto Carvalho, confirmed that agents from the Department of Homeland Security were seeking five students in first through sixth grades. Officials attempted to enter two south Los Angeles schools, Lillian Street elementary and Russell elementary, but were turned away after the schools’ principals asked to see their identification. Los Angeles Unified is asanctuary districtand does not cooperate with federal immigration agencies. The news comes as the Trump administration has escalatedits attacks against international studentsandramped up effortsto deport undocumented and documented immigrants alike. In January, homeland security rescinded Biden administration guidelines preventing its agents from entering “sensitive areas” including schools and churches. “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest,” former acting homeland security secretary Benjamine Huffman said ina statementannouncing the new policy. “The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.” In response, LA Unified began distributing “Know Your Rights” cards to students and the school police department issueda statementsaying it would not “assist or engage in immigration compliance checks, immigration enforcement activity, or ICE-related task force operations”. “I’m still mystified as to how a first-, second-, third-, fourth- or sixth-grader would pose any type of risk to the national security of our nation,” Carvalho said. “Schools are places for learning.Schoolsare places for understanding. Schools are places for instruction. Schools are not places of fear.” The superintendent told reporters that the immigration agents who arrived at the Los Angeles elementary schools said they wanted to see the “students to determine their well-being” as unaccompanied minors, and that they had received authorization to speak with students from their caretakers. He added that the district later spoke with the students’ caretakers and learned that was untrue. “DHS is leading efforts to conduct welfare checks on these children to ensure that they are safe and not being exploited, abused, and sex trafficked,” the homeland security department said in a statement toFox 11 Los Angeles. “Unlike the previous administration, President Trump and Secretary Noem take the responsibility to protect children seriously and will continue to work with federal law enforcement to reunite children with their families. In less than 70 days, Secretary Noem and Secretary Kennedy have already reunited nearly 5,000 unaccompanied children with a relative or safe guardian.” Carvalho contested that, and said as an educator who entered the United States without authorization at the age of 17 himself, he felt “beyond my professional responsibility, a moral responsibility to protect these students”. The incident has drawn attention from congressional lawmakers, including Pasadena Democrat Judy Chu. “I’m absolutely incensed that DHS agents would try to enter elementary schools this week, and I’m so grateful to the brave LAUSD administrators who denied them entry. These are children who should be learning to read and write, not cowering in fear of being ripped away from their homes,” she said. “I’m concerned parents may keep their children home rather than risk sending them to school. As Angelenos, we must lock arms together in moments like these to protect kids from deportation squads and protect schools from Trump’s campaign of terror.”",

    "title": "US House panel drops inquiry into Northwestern’s law school clinics",
    "article_text": "TheUS Houseeducation and workforce committee withdrew an investigation into Northwestern University’s law school clinics after professors there sued and alleged that the inquiry violated their constitutional free speech rights. The professors secured what amounted to a legal victory for them on Thursday, when the House committee withdrew its investigative requests with respect to the university and its law school’s Bluhm Legal Clinic program on Thursday. Citing reports of antisemitism on campus, House committee members had sought budget and personnel records overclaimsthat the university was using “taxpayer-supported institutional resources for troubling purposes”. The mention of reported antisemitism on campus was contained in a 27 March letter that the committee sent to justify the investigation and was addressed to Northwestern University’s chairperson, Peter Barris, as well as its president, Michael Schill. “The Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic at Northwestern’s Pritzker School of Law (Northwestern Law) is providing free legal representation in a civil suit to the organizers of an anti-Israel blockade of highway traffic to Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport,” the House committee’s letter said. “This blockade resulted in the arrest of 40 participants. The fact that Northwestern, a university supported by billions in federal funds, would dedicate its resources to support this illegal, antisemitic conduct raises serious questions.” The letter also alluded to “broader concerns about the institutionalization of leftwing political activism at Northwestern Law”, adding that the school’s Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic, led by the law professor Sheila Bedi, was using “Northwestern’s name and resources to engage in progressive-left political advocacy”. According to the letter, the House committee demanded that the university provide all written policies, procedures and guidance related to the function of the law school’s legal clinics, a detailed budget for the Bluhm Legal Clinic, and a list of its sources of funding. The committee also demanded the university turn over a list of all the Community Justice and Civil Rights Clinic’s payments to people or groups not employed by Northwestern and any of its clinics and centers since 2020. In addition, the committee asked to review all hiring materials and performance reviews for Bedi. In response, Bedi and a fellow law professor, Lynn Cohn, sued the committee, asserting that its investigation violated their and their clients’ constitutional rights to free speech and due process, among others. The committee subsequently withdrew its request – a move that a Thursday press release from the Center for Constitutional Rights described as a “victory for academic freedom, the rule of law, and bedrock constitutional principles”. In a statement accompanying the press release, Bedi said: “I filed this suit to defend my clients’ rights to representation, my students’ rights to learn, and my right to teach. But today’s decision won’t stop the federal government’s attacks on universities and the legal profession. “Educators and institutions must stand united to protect our students, our communities, and each other … We teach, we advocate, and we stand with communities demanding justice. That’s why Congress is targeting us.” Echoing similar sentiments, Cohn said: “Uniting to support the fundamental rights of all people can still be done even in these turbulent times. We hope others will join this effort – this legal challenge is far from over. Clinical legal educators won’t back down. We will keep doing what we do best: centering students, defending our clients, and standing firm in defense of justice and the rule of law.” Donald Trump’s administration on Tuesdayfroze$790m for Northwestern University as part of the president’s increasing crackdowns on students and faculty members across US colleges who have expressed their opposition toward Israel’s deadly war on Gaza. In response to the federal crackdowns, more than 1,000 faculty members, alumni, students and attorneys have signed letters expressing their support for Northwestern University. One letter signed by hundreds of alumni in part said they were troubled “that the federal government would target legal scholars who have dedicated their careers to upholding constitutional liberties”, WWTWreports.",

    "title": "‘Extremely troubling’: Judge questions why US cannot locate deported man",
    "article_text": "A United States federal judge has called it “extremely troubling” that the administration of President Donald Trump failed to comply with her court order to provide details on the status of a Maryland resident illegally deported to El Salvador. At a tense hearing on Friday, US District Judge Paula Xinis demanded that the administration identify the whereabouts of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to El Salvador on March 15. She also required daily updates on the administration’s efforts to secure his return. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant, had lived in Maryland under a court order protecting him from deportation since 2019. He had been in the US since 2011, after he said he fled gangs who were pursuing him for recruitment in his home country. His wife and child are American citizens. But on March 12, he was stopped and detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who questioned him about alleged gang affiliations. He was deported on March 15 on one of three high-profile deportation flights to El Salvador that also included alleged Venezuelan gang members — in violation of the 2019 court order. Abrego Garcia’s family sued to challenge the legality of his deportation, and on April 4, Xinis ordered the administration to “facilitate and effectuate” his return. The Trump administration challenged that order at the Supreme Court, which upheld Xinis’s order but said the term “effectuate” was unclear and may exceed the court’s authority. The Supreme Court also ordered the Trump administration to take measures to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and detail the steps it has taken — and will take — to return him to the US. Xinis repeatedly pressed a government lawyer on Friday for answers about what it had done to get Abrego Garcia back. “Where is he and under whose authority?” Xinis asked. “I’m not asking for state secrets,” she added. “All I know is that he’s not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador, and now I’m asking a very simple question: Where is he?” “I’m not sure what to take from the fact that the Supreme Court has spoken quite clearly, and yet I can’t get an answer today about what you’ve done, if anything, in the past.” Drew Ensign, a lawyer with the US Department of Justice, said the government would comply with the Supreme Court’s ruling. He repeated what the administration had said in court filings: that it would provide the required information by the end of Tuesday next week, once it had evaluated the Supreme Court ruling. “We simply believe that the court’s deadlines are impracticable, but that is not to say that the government is not intending to comply with the Supreme Court’s order,” Ensign said. Xinis ordered Ensign to provide her with daily updates, even if only to say that the government intends to comply with the Supreme Court’s order, but the administration believes her deadlines were unrealistic. The Supreme Court’s ruling also said the lower court should clarify its order “with due regard for deference” to the executive branch of government. The administration said in a court filing earlier on Friday that it was “unreasonable and impracticable” to say what its next steps are before they are properly agreed upon and vetted. “Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review,” the government’s filing said. But Abrego Garcia’s lawyers questioned the Trump administration’s motives for the delay. In their own filing on Friday, they alleged that “the government continues to delay, obfuscate, and flout court orders, while a man’s life and safety is at risk.” Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said the ordeal has been an “emotional rollercoaster” for their family and the entire community. “I am anxiously waiting for Kilmar to be here in my arms and in our home, putting our children to bed, knowing this nightmare is almost at its end. I will continue fighting until my husband is home,” she said. The case highlights the administration’s tensions with federal courts. Several have blocked Trump policies, and judges have expressed frustration with the administration’s efforts to avoid complying with court orders. In Abrego Garcia’s case, the Trump administration has remained adamant that its deportation was warranted. In a filing on April 7 to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department stated that, while Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador through “administrative error”, his actual removal from the United States “was not error”. The error, department lawyers wrote, was in removing him specifically to El Salvador despite the deportation protection order.",

    "article_text": "Who:Manchester City vs Crystal PalaceWhat:English Premier LeagueWhere:Etihad Stadium, Manchester, United KingdomWhen:Saturday at 12:30pm (11:40 GMT) FollowAl Jazeera Sport‘s live text and photo commentary stream. Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said Jack Grealish and Phil Foden “don’t feel good” after they suffered abuse in separate incidents during last weekend’s 0-0 draw at local rivals Manchester United. A man has been charged with assault after Grealish was allegedly slapped by a supporter as he left the field. Guardiola was outspoken in his criticism of fans after the game for an offensive chant about Foden’s mother during the match. “If you take a look around, you will realise we are not on the right path,” said Guardiola on Friday as City prepared for their Premier League clash with Crystal Palace. “They [Foden and Grealish] don’t feel good, but we move forward. “It is happening everywhere. It’s a crazy world, right? Everything happens all around the world, not just in sport. Nobody is away from that. “I know it’s happened sometimes in our club, but it’s not a problem about United, a specific club, or specific department in world football. It happens everywhere.” At this stage of the season, City are used to battling for the Premier League title, but this time, they find themselves down in sixth and scrapping just to qualify for next season’s Champions League. There was some good news for Guardiola this week with confirmation that a top-five finish will be enough to reach the Champions League thanks to the strong performance of English sides in the European competition. Just six points separate Nottingham Forest in third from Aston Villa in seventh. City’s quest is not helped by a lengthy injury list that contains Ballon d’Or winner Rodri, top scorer Erling Haaland, plus key defenders John Stones, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake. “We didn’t have the squad all season, but we adapt,” added Guardiola. “You can see it as a problem or a challenge. You could see the position as a disaster, but it could be worse. “I’m really satisfied for the way we’ve handled it.” The weekend 👋pic.twitter.com/eS9NOILrX4 — Premier League (@premierleague)April 11, 2025 City’s match against Palace gives the defending English champions the chance to climb into fourth before Chelsea and Newcastle are in action on Sunday. “[Palace] is a team who have been in incredible, top form in the last two months, and they have always been difficult,” added Guardiola. “I admire the manager, the way they play, the talent and the physicality they have, but, at the same time, I’m optimistic to finish well this season.” With 33-year-old Belgian playmaker Kevin De Bruyne leaving City at the end of the season after 10 highly successful years, the club are expected to do some transfer business in the close-season window, but Guardiola was tight-lipped about their plans. “I don’t know what will happen [in the summer],” he said. “Of course the club is working, but we won’t have 45 players in the squad. It’s not sustainable for the emotion of the team. “Except Kevin, they all have a contract, and we will see how they behave, how we are. We’re going to see.” Rodri, Erling Haaland, John Stones, Manuel Akanji and Nathan Ake remain sidelined as long-term absentees. City have no other short-term doubts. Marc Guehi and Eddie Nketiah are suspended following red cards against Brighton in the Eagles’ last match. Maxence Lacroix and Chris Richards are both expected to line up in defence, while Chadi Riad and Cheick Doucoure remain long-term absentees.",

    "title": "US consumer sentiment tumbles as trade war fears grow",
    "article_text": "United States consumer sentiment plunged in April, marking the fourth month in a row of declines – widely seen as a pointed reaction toPresident Donald Trump’s escalating trade wars, which have fuelled concerns over potential job losses and rising inflation. Thepreliminary reading of the University of Michigan’sclosely watched consumer sentiment index, released Friday, fell 11 percent in March to 50.8 percent, the lowest since the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past year, sentiment tumbled 34 percent. The decline was “pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation”, Survey of Consumers director Joanne Hsu said in a public statement. The share of respondentsexpecting unemployment to risein the coming months increased for the fifth straight month and is now the highest since 2009, during the Great Recession. While consumer sentiment is not always a reliable indicator of the overall economy, it has at times reflected shifting vibes in how the public feels about presidential leadership. Sentiment among Republicans has dropped 6 percent over the past month as Trump teased, then rolled out a series of aggressive tariffs, only to institute a 90-day pause of some import taxes Wednesday. “Interestingly, President Trump appears to be getting much of the blame for much of the deterioration in sentiment with 67 percent of respondents saying the government is doing a ‘poor job’ on fighting inflation and unemployment,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING told The Associated Press (AP) news agency. “Only 18 percent say it is doing a ‘good job’.” Asked at Friday’s news briefing about the falling consumer sentiment, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt advised that the public should trust in Trump as he executes his tariffs plan. “As he said, this is going to be a period of transition,” she said. “He wants consumers to trust in him, and they should trust in him.” The result of the trade war drama so far is a baseline tariff on most countries of 10 percent, with imports from China getting taxed at a combined 145 percent. Goods from Canada and Mexico face tariffs of up to 25 percent, while imported autos, steel and aluminium are taxed at that same rate. China retaliated Wednesday with a 125 percent tariff on US goods. The Trump administration has suggested that it will cut new trade agreements with more than 75 nations over a span of 90 days. “We are doing really well on our TARIFF POLICY,” Trump said Friday on his social media site Truth Social. “Very exciting for America, and the World!!! It is moving along quickly.” Eroding American confidence has also surfaced in the financial markets. Investors are selling off US debt. The interest rate on the 10-year US Treasury note was 4.51 percent in Friday afternoon trading, up from roughly 4 percent at the start of the week. That suggests more economic instability ahead. On Friday, the dollar slumped to a three-year low against the euro. Larry Fink, CEO of the investment firm BlackRock, told the financial news network CNBC that the US economy is on the cusp of a downturn, if not already there. “I think we’re very close, if not in a recession now,” Fink said. The University of Michigan sentiment survey found that people now expect long-term inflation to reach 4.4 percent, up from 4.1 percent last month, a move that may be of particular concern for the US Federal Reserve. The Fed pays close attention to inflation expectations because they can become self-fulfilling. If people expect prices to rise, they often take steps that can push up prices, such as accelerating purchases or seeking higher wages. It’s a sign that most of the public views as a blip this week showing that consumer inflation declined in March to an annual rate of 2.4 percent. Most economists believe that, given the intensifying trade wars, inflation is likely to be reignited. Americans’ inflation expectations over the next five years are now at the highest since 1991, according to Capital Economics, a forecasting firm. “Households appear to have come to the same conclusion as markets: The tariffs will do lasting damage to the US economy,” Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics, said in an email to the AP. Consumer sentiment remains sharply divided by party, with the index for Democrats at 34.1 and Republicans at 81.9. Yet both recorded steep drops in April. Sentiment among independents plunged to 46.8 from 55.7 and is sharply below its post-election peak of 70.2. The April reading among independents is now lower than it was at any point during Joe Biden’s presidency. Those inflation expectations have now jumped for several months. At a news conference last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the University of Michigan’s inflation expectations measure was an “outlier”. Market-based measures of inflation expectations, based on inflation-adjusted Treasury securities, have remained low, near the Fed’s 2 percent target.

    "title": "US judge rules pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported",
    "article_text": "A United States immigration judge has ruled that the deportation case against Mahmoud Khalil can proceed, a month after the Columbia University graduate student was detained over his involvement inpro-Palestine protests. Judge Jamee Comans made the determination on Friday at the end of a nearly two-hour hearing in the US state of Louisiana, saying the government had “established by clear and convincing evidence that he is removable”. Khalil – a US permanent resident – can appeal the decision. “Mahmoud was subject to a charade of due process, a flagrant violation of his right to a fair hearing and a weaponization of immigration law to suppress dissent,” one of his lawyers, Marc Van Der Hout, said in a statement after the hearing. “This is not over, and our fight continues,” he added. Khalil’s case has drawn widespread scrutiny asrights advocates accusePresident Donald Trump’s administration of cracking down on free speech and pro-Palestine activism under the guise of fighting anti-Semitism. The administration is trying to deport Khalil under a rarely used provision of an immigration law that gives the secretary of state the power to remove any non-citizen whose presence in the US is deemed to have “adverse foreign policy consequences”. The government has not charged Khalil with a crime. In a two-page letter submitted to the court and Khalil’s lawyers, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that the 30-year-old should be removed for his role in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States”. Rubio’s letter did not accuse Khalil of breaking any laws, but he said that his department can revoke an immigrant’s legal status even where their beliefs, associations or statements are “otherwise lawful”. Khalil’s supporters say he engaged inpeaceful protestsagainst Columbia University’s ties to the Israeli military as part of the wave of campus demonstrations that swept the country last year amid Israel’s Gaza war. Baher Azmy, the legal director of the Center for Constitutional Rights and another one of Khalil’s lawyers, told reporters on Thursday that Rubio’s letter “is a sort of tacky, Soviet-style diktat that’s equal parts empty and chilling”. Reporting from outside the court in Jena, Louisiana on Friday, Al Jazeera’s Shihab Rattansi said Khalil addressed the court during the hearing. “He said nothing is more important than due process and fundamental fairness [and] neither of these principles were present” in his case, Rattansi reported. Khalil has been held by the government since March 8, when he was arrested late at night by immigration enforcement agents in front of his pregnant wife, who is a US citizen. He was then transferred to two different facilities without his family or lawyers being notified. In a statement read out during a news conference outside the court in Louisiana on Friday afternoon, Khalil’s support team said the judge’s ruling was “as unjust as it is alarming”. “Despite the government’s failure to prove that Mahmoud broke any law, the court has decided that lawful permanent residents can have their status revoked for pro-Palestine advocacy,” the team said. “This is a blatant violation of the First Amendment [of the US Constitution] and a dangerous precedent for anyone who believes in free speech and political expression.” In another statement read out by activists, Noor Abdalla,Khalil’s wife, said the court’s decision was “a devastating blow”. “No person should be deemed removable from their home for speaking out against the killing of Palestinian families, doctors and journalists,” said Abdalla, referring toIsrael’s Gaza war. Comans, the Louisiana immigration judge, gave Khalil’s legal team until April 23 to seek a waiver. But the judge’s decision is not the final say over whether Khalil will be deported. In a separate case in New Jersey federal court, US District Judge Michael Farbiarz has blocked deportation while he considers Khalil’s claim that his arrest was made in violation of the US Constitution’s First Amendment protections for freedom of speech. Over the past several weeks, US immigration authorities have also cracked down on severalinternational studentswho have taken part in pro-Palestinian protests or spoken out in defence of Palestinians in Gaza.",

    "title": "Italy sends 40 asylum seekers awaiting deportation to Albania",
    "article_text": "Italy has sent 40 asylum seekers awaitingdeportationto Albania, where they will be held in Italian-run detention centres until they are repatriated to their home countries. The two facilities were opened last October as processing centres for potential asylum seekers intercepted at sea, in an experimental scheme closely watched by the rest of the European Union. But in an attempt to salvage a costly programme beset by legal challenges, the Italian government decided in late March that they would now primarily serve as repatriation facilities to hold migrants due to be sent back to their home countries. On Friday, 40 men of various nationalities arrived on board an Italian navy ship in the northern port of Shengjin, according to Italian media. From there, they will betransferredto a nearby centre in Gjader, a former military base surrounded by a high fence under camera surveillance. It is not clear how long they will remain in Albania. Under Italian law, asylum seekers whose residence claims have not been successful can be detained for up to 18 months while awaiting deportation. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni had signed a deal with her Albanian counterpart Edi Rama to open the two Italian-run centres in Albania in November 2023. But the Albania deportation scheme had been put on hold after Italian courts repeatedly annulled the transfer of sea migrants, forcing the government to bring them to Italy to assess their legal situation. Facing criticism from the opposition over the legal confusion, Meloni’s conservative coalition last month decided to use Albania instead as a staging post for people whose asylum bids have already been turned down. Stopping the boats was also a promise of Meloni and her far-right Brothers of Italy party when they came first in a 2022 election. Italy has a poor record on the repatriation of irregular immigrants. In 2023, just more than 4,000 were forcibly sent home, roughly a third of the number returned by France and Germany, official data show. Many more simply ignored their expulsion orders, either staying in Italy or heading to another European country. Meloni originally hoped that the two Albanian camps would be able to process some 36,000 male asylum applicants per year from a government list of safe countries, with the idea of swiftly repatriating them after the likely rejection of their requests. The government still hopes to revert to its original plan and is waiting on a ruling from the European Union’s Court of Justice, which could compel Italian judges to process new asylum seekers sent to Albania.",

But economists are warning of negative consequences for American households and businesses. Georgetown University professor Michael Strain, who heads economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, tells host Steve Clemons that “the risk of recession is very, very real.” Trump believes that the tariffs will stimulate the US economy and bring jobs back after decades of outsourcing, Strain argues, but the opposite is more likely: costs will rise, manufacturing will decrease, and Trump’s approval rating will go down.",

    "title": "UN agrees deal on shipping emissions despite US threats",
    "article_text": "Countries at the United Nations shipping agency have struck a deal on a global fuel emissions standard for the maritime sector, which will impose an emissions fee on ships that breach it and reward vessels burning cleaner fuels. The United States pulled out of the climate talks at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London this week, urging other countries to do the same and threatening to impose “reciprocal measures” against anyfeescharged to US ships. Despite that, other nations have approved the CO2-cutting measures to help meet the IMO’s target to cut net emissions from international shipping by 20 percent by 2030 and eliminate them by 2050. A majority of countries at the IMO voted on Friday to approve a scheme that from 2028 will charge ships a penalty of $380 per metric tonne on every extra tonne of CO2-equivalent they emit above a fixed emissions threshold, plus a penalty of $100 a tonne on emissions above a stricter emissions limit. The deal is expected to generate up to $40bn in fees from 2030, some of which will go towards making expensive zero-emission fuels more affordable. The talks have exposed deep rifts between governments over how fast to push the maritime sector to cut its environmental effect. A proposal for a stronger carbon levy on all shipping emissions, backed by climate-vulnerable Pacific countries – which abstained in Friday’s vote – plus the European Union and the UK, was dropped after opposition from several countries, including China, Brazil and Saudi Arabia, delegates told the Reuters news agency. Vanuatu’s climate minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said countries had “failed to support a set of measures that would have gotten the shipping industry onto a 1.5°C pathway”. Industry group the International Chamber of Shipping welcomed the deal, which it said would require a huge scale-up of such fuels. “We are pleased that governments have understood the need to catalyse and support investment in zero emission fuels,” ICS said in a statement. In 2030, the main emissions limit will require ships to cut the emissions intensity of their fuel by 8 percent compared with a 2008 baseline, while the stricter standard will demand a 21 percent reduction. By 2035, the main standard will cut fuel emissions by 30 percent, versus 43 percent for the stricter standard. Ships that reduce emissions to below the stricter limit will be rewarded with credits that they can sell to non-compliant vessels. “This is a groundbreaking moment for the shipping industry, which should signal a turning of the tide on greenhouse gases from global shipping,” Mark Lutes, senior adviser at the NGO World Wildlife Fund for Nature, said in a statement. “However, key aspects of this agreement fall short of what is needed and risk blowing the transition off course,” he added. The carbon pricing measure must now be formally adopted at an IMO assembly in October.",

    "article_text": "Osasuna have had their appeal dismissed over Barcelona fielding defender Inigo Martinez in their LaLiga match last month after he sat out Spain’s game through injury. Osasunafiled the appeal with the Spanish football federation(RFEF), stating Barca should not have fielded Martinez over a technicality after he withdrew from the Spain squad for their Nations League games due to a swollen knee. Martinez then played the full 90 minutes inBarcelona’s 3-0 winin the rescheduled game on March 27, four days after Spain’s match. The original fixture on March 8 was postponed after the death of Barcelona’s club doctor. Osasuna’s appeal was based on a belief that Barca violated Article 5 of Annex I of the FIFA Regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players. This states that a player who does not join or leaves his national team for medical reasons may not play matches for his club during the five calendar days following the end of the international period. Osasuna said they were informed of the appeal’s dismissal, and the reasoning behind the decision. “The RFEF, by allowing the players to leave the training camp without imposing any type of limitation on them, as well as subsequently issuing the certificate of dismissal, is implicitly expressing its desire not to apply said prohibitive rule,” the ruling said. Osasuna disagree, saying there was no reference to not applying the restriction, either in the RFEF’s public statement or in communications to the clubs, and say they would file an appeal with the Appeal Committee. Both clubs had appeals for the fixture to be postponed rejected.",

    "title": "Sorry, America, tariffs won’t bring jobs back",
    "article_text": "At a White House dinner back in 2011, Steve Jobs was asked by President Obama what it would take to build iPhones in the United States. Jobs knew where this was going. “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” he replied. Supply chains and ecosystems that sustain manufacturing of hi-tech products like the iPhone take years to get going. The skills, capabilities and relationships that are involved take even longer to develop. Factories cannot simply be picked up from one place and transplanted into another. President Trump decided to try, anyway. On “Liberation Day”, he announced sweeping tariffs, which were not reciprocal but based on the idea of balancing trade deficits.This has thrown the economy into turmoil and sent markets plunging – under pressure mainly from Wall Street, he delayed the higher tariffs for 90 days but ratcheted them up for China.Markets recovered somewhat but the uncertainty remains and might even have done some permanent damage already by being baked into the cost of capital. Much analysis since the announcement about tariffs has focused on the formula used to calculate them, and the flawed understanding of economics that the new policy is based on. The formula for tariffs certainly does not measure what the president thinks it measures. Nor does it make sense for America to make everything itself. There are things that we buy in our individual lives without expecting the seller to buy something from us. And if a country tries to build everything, it cannot specialise. This means a decline in productivity and the country becoming less competitive in many areas that it would like to dominate. Ceteris Paribus, imposing blanket tariffs will do more harm than good, but it is worth understanding the reason behind it. It is not that America is being “ripped off” by other countries. America’s competitiveness problem is rooted in the globalisation of production. More specifically, in the case of America, it is the “China syndrome” or the China Shock, terms coined by David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson in their 2013paper. As a result of a flood of imports from China, an estimated two to three million US manufacturing jobs were lost between 1999 and 2011. Many more have been lost since then. Some areas, especially where industries competed head-on with China – in the Midwest and South – were hit hard. These job losses were not offset by new jobs in the same regions, with the affected communities experiencing lower wages, higher unemployment and increases in opioid addiction, social instability, and political polarisation. Even workers outside manufacturing saw wage stagnation, especially those without college degrees, as the labour market became more competitive and bargaining power weakened. Promises that displaced workers could “learn to code” or move to tech jobs often failed. Many workers couldn’t easily retrain or relocate, especially older ones or those in distressed communities. With globalisation, Wall Street has benefitted, but not Main Street. It is not just low-value-added products, however. America’s trade balance in advanced technology products is also negative. In 2024, it incurred adeficitof nearly $300 bn in that category. America has been borrowing to finance deficits and to continue consuming. This strategy is fundamentally unsustainable and something has to change. Is imposition of tariffs on the whole world the answer to America’s competitiveness problems? It depends upon what America is trying to achieve through that. Is it leverage? Unfettered access to foreign markets? Or bringing all the jobs that it has outsourced over the years back? On leverage, America might be able to cut some deals, but at the expense of American people’s purchasing power. It might also be able to get countries to lower some barriers to American exports, but I doubt that will save GM or Ford. And as for bringing jobs back, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is now saying factories that return to the United States will be run mostly by robots! Strongarming countries and companies into investing in America will only go so far. Transferring ecosystems around particular products takes many years. If America’s objective is to get its dominance in innovation, development and manufacturing back, slashing research funding across the board does not make sense, either. Going after university research eliminates the “commons” that all American corporations benefit from. It’s an own goal. If the idea is to reverse the outsourcing corporations rely upon to generate wealth for investors, that’s like putting toothpaste back into the tube. How long is Trump willing to persist? Pressure is already mounting from powerful actors and fault lines are appearing within the Republican Party. China’s tit-for-tat stance is not helping. Tariffs are not likely to work for Trump, and persisting with this strategy and raising inflation will not do him any favours in the midterms, but the problem of Wall Street v Main Street will only get worse, and someone, whether Trump or his successors, will need to address it.

    "title": "Trump’s tariffs: A simple illustrated guide to 15 economic terms to know",
    "article_text": "Throughout the past few weeks, United States President Donald Trump has announced a series of tariff policies, with shifting statements that have led to growing concerns about global economic instability. With Trump’s tariffs affecting nearly every country, many terms have been thrown around to describe the potential results. From trade wars to stock market drops, this article explains, in simple terms with illustrations, what these key terms mean, including those that may become more important in the coming months. Tariffs are simply taxes imposed at the border by one country on the goods of a foreign country. They are usually aimed to protect local businesses from foreign competition. A trade war occurs when, for example, two countries dispute trade practices and one country places extra tariffs on goods from another that it believes is engaging in unfair trade practices. The other country retaliates with tariffs and this tit-for-tat continues, thus escalating into a trade war. It’s like an economic tug-of-war where both sides keep pulling harder instead of finding a way to agree. A good example is the US-China trade war, which has been in effect since 2018 when the US first placed tariffs on Chinese goods. More recently, the tit-for-tat between Washington and Beijing has seen tariffs on China rise to 145 percent. A trade deficit occurs when a country buys (imports) more goods than it sells (exports), meaning the demand for foreign goods is greater than the supply of its own products. For example, the US has a trade deficit with China because it buys more goods from China, like electronics and clothing, than it sells to it. Atrade surplusis the opposite. This happens when a country sells more goods than it buys. For example, the US has a trade surplus with The Netherlands because it sells more goods, like machinery and agricultural products, to the Netherlands than it buys from it. Subsidies are financial support or money given by the government to help local businesses or industries, making their products cheaper or more competitive. For example, following Trump’s 25 percent tariff on all foreign automobiles and auto parts, South Korea announced emergency support for its auto sector by raising electric vehicles subsidies to boost demand. The stock market is a place where shares of companies and other financial instruments are bought and sold. For example, if you buy Amazon shares, you’re owning part of the company, and the stock’s value can go up or down, meaning you can make or lose money. An index is a way to measure how a group of stocks is performing. In the US, three of the biggest indices are: The Fed (short for the Federal Reserve) is the central bank of the United States. It helps control the country’s money supply, sets interest rates, and tries to keep the economy stable – more on these later. Interest rates are the cost of borrowing money, usually expressed as a percentage. For example, when the Fed raises interest rates, borrowing money becomes more expensive, and when it lowers rates, borrowing money becomes cheaper. Interest rates go up when central banks want to slow inflation or cool down an overheating economy. Inflation measures how quickly the price of things rises over time. This means that money doesn’t buy as much as it used to. For example, if a sandwich cost $2.50 a year ago and now the same sandwich costs $3.00 then the inflation rate for the sandwich is 20 percent. Inflation can occur when demand for a product is higher than supply, or when it costs more to make the product. It can also occur if there’s too much money in the economy, like when a country prints more cash. The Fed tries to keep inflation steady. If prices rise too fast, it can hurt the economy by making goods and services too expensive. The Fed changes interest rates to help keep prices under control. The exchange rate is the value of one country’s money compared to another’s. For example, one US dollar will get you about 0.90 euros. Exchange rates are important because they affect the cost of buying and selling goods between countries. A strong currency makes imports cheaper and exports more expensive, while a weak currency makes exports cheaper and imports more expensive. The rates also affect travel, investments and global business. Market trends are the general direction in which prices or markets are moving over time – going up, down, or staying stable. They help investors and businesses understand what’s happening in the economy. Economists use terms like “bull” and “bear” market to refer to these trends. Economists often use a formula based on the S&P 500 to determine if we’re in a bull or bear market, with a 20 percent change from the last high as the key threshold. Debt is the money a government owes to another, usually with the agreement to pay it back later with interest. For example, if the US needs money for things like healthcare or defence, it might borrow from China by selling US Treasury bonds. A bond is like a loan where you lend money in exchange for interest and repayment later. China buys these bonds, lending money to the US, which promises to pay it back with interest over time. This lets the US get the money quickly without raising taxes or cutting spending. ​As of March 2025, the US national debt stands at approximately $36.56 trillion. This substantial debt level has raised concerns about the nation’s fiscal health and its ability to manage future financial obligations. Trade agreements are deals between countries that make it easier to buy and sell goods. For example: GDP is the total value of all goods and services produced within a country over a specific period, usually a year or a quarter. It is used to measure the size and health of a country’s economy. A recession is when the economy becomes weaker for a period of time. A recession is typically identified when a country’s GDP declines for two consecutive quarters (six months). During a recession, several things usually happen: Since 1950, the US has had 11recessions. Trade policies refer to government policies that govern the exchange of goods and services between countries. Broadly speaking, there are two opposing views on how countries should engage in global trade.",

    "article_text": "Tottenham boss Ange Postecoglou said a leak of information from inside the club is making his job more difficult as the Australian closes in on finding the source of the problem. Injury news has regularly found its way onto social media in advance of Spurs’ games during a troubled second season for Postecoglou. BeforeThursday’s 1-1 Europa League quarterfinal, first-leg draw against Eintracht Frankfurt, Wilson Odobert’s absence from the starting lineup was leaked long before the team was officially announced. “There is no doubt we’ve got a leak inside the club,” Postecoglou said on Friday. “Someone continues to leak out information and they have all year. I don’t know why as it just makes our job even more difficult. It doesn’t help us as you don’t want to give the opposition a helping hand. “We’ve narrowed it down. I’ve got a fair idea where it’s coming from. We will deal with it. “It certainly doesn’t help us on game days. It’s sometimes half-truths and sometimes more. You’d like to think that everyone within our camp is working with us rather than against us.” Tottenham’s lengthy injury list has played a major role in their disappointing Premier League season. Spurs sit 14th with seven games to play and are on course to miss out on the top 10 for the first time since the 2007/08 campaign. Postecoglou’s future at the club next season appears to solely depend on winning the Europa League and ending a 17-year wait for silverware. With that in mind, he is expected to make changes for Sunday’s trip to Wolves with one eye on the second leg in Frankfurt on Thursday. “We’ll need a big game, a big performance on Sunday, so having some fresh legs will help,” he added. “But also looking into next Thursday, it’s not about resting guys or managing guys, it’s also about having guys ready. It could go to 120 minutes and we’ll need people ready to go, so with a combination of those factors, we’ll make some changes.”",

    "title": "United States is no longer a safe destination for international students",
    "article_text": "One cannot underestimate the precarity that orders the lives of international students in the United States. I remember making my maiden journey from Kolkata to upstate New York as an international student to pursue an undergraduate degree at a small liberal arts college. This was back in 2003 when the US-led so-called “war on terror” was in full swing. The US had invaded Iraq only a few months before my arrival in New York. Be it the on-campus jingoism inspired by America’s battle against the “Axis of Evil” that left little room for critical assessments of US foreign policy in the classroom, the “random” airport security checks at airports or the near-consistent racism and Islamophobia on the American airwaves – it was soon painfully apparent to me that someone who “looked like me” didn’t belong in the “Land of the Free”. In the years since, things hardly got any better for international students making their way to America. They remained untrustworthy and unwelcome outsiders in the eyes of many Americans, and the sense of precarity surrounding their lives persisted. Under Trump 2.0, however, this sense of precarity has reached unprecedented levels. In fact, these days the US appears to be not only unwelcoming, it is a blatantly unsafe destination for international students. Trump has made the lives of international students much more difficult than before. This did not come as a surprise, as he had promised to do just that on the campaign trail, well over a year ago. Besides claiming that universities and various accreditation bodies were dominated by Marxists and radical leftists, he made his particular hatred for Palestine solidarity activists on campus well-known. He declared that, if re-elected, he would revoke the student visas of “radical, anti-American and anti-Semitic foreigners” participating in pro-Palestinian protests on US college campuses as early as October 2023. After his return to the White House, he made targeting pro-Palestine international students and faculty a priority. One of his highest-profile targets wasMahmoud Khalil,a Columbia University graduate. Khalil, who was on the front lines of Columbia’s pro-Palestine protests as a negotiator between the student protesters and university leadership, is a green card holder. However, the Trump administration is pushing to deport him, claiming that he was engaging in pro-Hamas, un-American activities. Khalil was abducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers from his home in New York in front of his pregnant American wife in early March, and has been held at a detention facility in Louisiana for over a month. In a similar case, Tufts University PhD student and Turkish citizenRumeysa Ozturkwas abducted by masked, plain-clothed officers in Boston. She, too, was transferred to the detention facility in Louisiana. Her crime? Co-authoring anop-edin Tufts Daily calling for her university to divest from Israel. Indian citizen and Georgetown University postdoctoral scholarBadar Khan Surihas also been targeted for deportation and is faced with an uncertain future at an ICE detention facility in Texas. Suri didn’t even participate in any Palestine solidarity protests. His crime seems to be that he is the son-in-law of a former adviser to the Hamas government in Gaza, Ahmed Yousef. Yousef, however, left the position in the political wing of Hamas more than a decade ago and hascalledthe group’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 “a terrible error”. Then there is the case of Cornell University PhD candidateMomodou Taal, a dual citizen of the United Kingdom and Gambia. He participated in Palestine solidarity protests and was called upon by immigration authorities to surrender. After going into hiding for two and half weeks in fear for his personal safety, Taal decided to leave the US. These few high-profile cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The Trump administration has revoked the visas of hundreds ofinternational studentsfor their pro-Palestine activism and social media posts. As of April 10, more than 600 international students in over 100 colleges and universities across the country are believed to have been affected. And there seems to be no end in sight. TheDepartment of Homeland Securityhas begun screening the social media accounts of non-citizens and says it will deny visas and green cards to all individuals it deems as having participated in pro-Palestine activism or, as the Trump administration deems it, “anti-Semitic activities”. America’s leading universities, meanwhile, appear more than willing to capitulate to Trump’s demands, and are throwing their international students to the wolves, to stay on the good books of the administration and keep federal funding. Columbia University, for instance, quickly caved when the Trump administration decided to withhold $400m infederal fundingdue to the university’s supposed inaction during the Palestine solidarity protests. Despite sitting on anendowmentvalued at just under $15bn, Columbia’s leadership responded to Trump’s funding threats by overhauling the university’s protest policies and introducing new security measures that would swiftly crack down on any possible return of Palestine solidarity encampments and protests on the campus. The Trump administration also demanded that Columbia’s Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies Department be placed on academic receivership for five years. Typically,academic receivershipinvolves internal processes and measures implemented by the university leadership to bring a dysfunctional department or programme “back on track”. Seemingly agreeing to Trump’s demands, the university appointed a new senior vice provost to oversee the department. Harvard University – another institution with a massive endowment – facedsimilar demandsfrom the Trump administration in return for federal funding. Specifically, its leadership was asked to make “necessary changes” to “address bias, improve viewpoint diversity and end ideological capture” in “programs and departments that fuel antisemitic harassment”. Unlike in the case of Columbia, there was no mention of specific programmes or departments. But it would seem that the Harvard leadership knew what Trump meant. Harvard’s interim dean of social sciences David M Cutler dismissed the leadership of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies. He justified his decision by claiming that there was “a lack of balance and multiple viewpoints in the Center’s programming on Palestine”. Harvard also severed its ties with the Palestinian Birzeit University in the occupied West Bank. The ways in which the leaders of America’s elite universities capitulated to Trump’s demands demonstrated clearly that these institutions no longer view broadening the intellect and vision of future generations as their primary purpose. Indeed, they proved that these universities are no longer independent institutions of higher education committed to the betterment of humanity’s collective future, but merelybusinessesthat provide a product (ie, a college degree) to a paying client (ie, the student). It is therefore not at all surprising that university leaders decided to abandon international students to their fates when they made the calculation that these students are costing the “business” more money (in federal funding) than they personally contribute in tuition fees. The Trump administration’s attacks on foreign students over pro-Palestinian activism came alongside a simultaneous crackdown on Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which had made American universities a bit more welcoming to foreign students from marginalised and minority backgrounds over the years. Taken together, these policies swiftly turned American campuses into hostile environments for foreign students, especially for those hailing from the Global South. In view of all of this, it would seem that the lives of international students in the US have become simply too precarious to bear. There is no guarantee that the Trump administration’s crackdown would remain limited to pro-Palestinian speech and protests. A precedent has been set. Every international student in America today must accept that they may be abducted, detained and deported at any moment for attending a protest, writing an article or expressing a view that upsets the White House or its allies. They can even be detained and threatened with deportation due to the past employment of a relative. There seems to be no meaningful legal recourse or political respite in sight. Future international students would therefore be prudent to wonder: is a higher education in the United States worth the risk?

    "title": "Syria’s al-Sharaa extends deadline for investigation into coastal killings",
    "article_text": "Syria’s interim PresidentAhmed al-Sharaahas extended the deadline for a committee to produce a report into the killings of hundreds of civilians on the country’s western coast last month. Hundreds ofAlawite civilians were killedin apparent retribution after fighting broke out between government forces and armed groups loyal to former President Bashar al-Assad, who belongs to the Alawite religious sect. On March 9, al-Sharaa tasked a fact-finding committee with producing a report within 30 days that would help determine the perpetrators and hold them to account. In a decree published late on Thursday, the Syrian president said the committee had requested more time to complete its work and that he would grant it a non-renewable three-month extension. The sectarian violence prompted fears of a renewed civil war just months afteral-Assad was toppledin December by opposition fighters led by al-Sharaa. The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR) said in a preliminary report last month that 803 people were extrajudicially killed between March 6 and 10 in attacks that were primarily carried out in the Latakia, Tartous and Hama governorates. At least 39 children and 49 women were among those killed, SNHR said. In a report published on April 3, Amnesty International said its probe into the killings concluded that at least 32 of more than 100 people killed in Baniyas, a coastal town in Tartous governorate, were deliberately targeted on sectarian grounds. Amnesty said witnesses told the rights group that “armed men asked people if they were Alawite before threatening or killing them and, in some cases, appeared to blame them for violations committed by the former government.” Diana Semaan, a Syria researcher at Amnesty, told the Reuters news agency that the fact-finding committee should be given “adequate time, access and resources to carry out a thorough investigation”. “What is crucial is that the work of the fact-finding committee is transparent and includes any new violations against minorities in the coastal area and other parts of Syria,” she said. But others expressed concern, including Alawite residents of the coastal province of Latakia, where much ofthe violence took place. Firas, a 43-year-old Alawite who only gave his first name out of fear of retribution, told Reuters that the extension was an attempt to “stall and buy more time” and that he felt little hope the committee’s work would lead to real accountability. In a statement on Friday, the committee’s spokesperson, Yasser Farhan, said it recorded 41 sites where killings took place, each forming the basis for a separate case and requiring more time to gather evidence. He said some areas remained inaccessible due to time constraints, but that residents had cooperated, despite threats from pro-Assad remnants.",

    "title": "New York sightseeing helicopter crashes in Hudson River: What we know",
    "article_text": "United States authorities are investigating a deadly helicopter crash in New York City that killed six people. Thesightseeing helicoptercrashed into the Hudson River on Thursday, killing a family of Spanish tourists, including three children, and the pilot. Here is what we know about the incident so far. The helicopter crashed at approximately 3:15pm EDT (19:15 GMT) on Thursday. It went down in the river between Newport, Jersey City and the lower Manhattan area in New York City. The aircraft had taken off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport at 2:59pm (18:59 GMT) and radar data showed it flew north along the Manhattan skyline and then back south towards the Statue of Liberty. Video of the incident appeared to show the helicopter breaking apart midair and plunging into the Hudson River. The river is a busy shipping channel and as deep as 60 metres (200 feet) at points. Witnesses reported seeing debris fall before the crash, and parts of the wreckage were later seen protruding from the water. The helicopter was a Bell 206L – a small, single-engine aircraft often used for short trips and tours. Thousands have been manufactured over the years. It was initially developed for the US Army before being adapted for other uses such as sightseeing, TV news stations, and police. The helicopter had a valid safety certificate until 2029. At the time of the crash, it was being used by New York Helicopters for sightseeing rides. Reports from US media outlets say it had already flown five times earlier that day. All six people on board died in the crash. The victims included a family of five from Barcelona, Spain, who were visiting New York City. US media reports named the family as Agustin Escobar, chief executive officer of rail infrastructure at Siemens Mobility; his wife, Merce Camprubi Montal; and their three children, aged 4, 5, and 11. Escobar had worked at Siemens for more than 27 years, while Montal worked as global commercialisation manager at Siemens Energy, according to their LinkedIn profiles. The pilot, a 36-year-old US citizen employed by New York Helicopters, also died. Four of the victims were pronounced dead at the scene, and two died later in the hospital. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are investigating the helicopter’s exact number of flights, maintenance records and operational history as they seek to determine the cause of the crash. Video shared on social media appeared to show that the helicopter broke apart while it was still in the air. One of the main blades and the tail rotor – which helps keep the helicopter stable – appear to have come off mid-flight. Emergency response teams from New York and New Jersey quickly mobilised following the crash. Recovery teams retrieved some of the wreckage using a floating crane just after 8pm on Thursday (00:00 GMT on Friday). The NTSB has secured the debris for forensic analysis, and further details are expected in a preliminary report within the next few weeks. Meanwhile, New York Helicopters has suspended operations pending the outcome of the investigation. No timeline has been provided for when services might resume. New York City Mayor Eric Adams expressed condolences in a news briefing on Thursday. “Our hearts go out to the families of those who were onboard,” he said. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called it an “unimaginable tragedy” and extended sympathies to the families affected. Siemens also released a statement mourning the loss of Escobar and his family. “We are deeply saddened by the tragic helicopter crash in which Agustin Escobar and his family lost their lives. Our heartfelt condolences go out to all their loved ones,” Siemens said in a statement. Michael Roth, CEO of New York Helicopter Tours, told the New York Post he was “devastated” by the incident and had “no clue” how it happened. “This is horrific,” Roth said. “But you gotta remember something, these are machines and they break.”",

    "article_text": "It’s been almost a month since Israel broke the ceasefire agreement with Hamas, launching daily strikes across Gaza that have killed more than 1,100 Palestinians. Humanitarian aid has also been blocked from entering the area by Israel for more than a month, deepening the crisis. Humanitarian workers have also been directly targeted.

    "article_text": "The Trump administration has escalated US air attacks in Yemen against the Houthis. According to Yemen’s Health Ministry, these near-daily raids have killed dozens, including civilians in residential areas. While the Biden administration had already carried out a series of attacks, the Trump administration is significantly ramping up its military response. The Houthis had launched multiple attacks on shipping in the Red Sea since November 23, 2023. They claim their actions are a way to express solidarity with the Palestinians and condemn Israel’s war on Gaza. Humanitarian conditions in Yemen had already deteriorated due to its 10-year civil war between the Iran-allied Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition. This conflict has reached an impasse in recent years. So could Trump’s escalating attacks enflame regional tensions?

    "title": "US envoy Witkoff meets Putin in Russia for Ukraine war talks",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump’s special envoySteve Witkoffhas met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg to discuss the war in Ukraine. Trump has been pressing Moscow and Kyiv to agree on a ceasefire deal but has failed to extract any major concessions from the Kremlin, despite several rounds of talks between Russian and US officials. On Friday, Putin was shown on state TV greeting Witkoff in Saint Petersburg’s presidential library at the start of the negotiations, and state news agencies later said their talks lasted more than four hours. The Kremlin said the meeting “focused on various aspects of the Ukrainian settlement”, without elaborating. Earlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov had said Putin and Witkoff might discuss the possibility of the Russian leader meeting Trump face-to-face. Putin and Trump have spoken by phone but have yet to meet in person since the US leader returned to the White House in January for a second four-year term. Witkoff has emerged as a key figure in the on-off rapprochement between Moscow and Washington amid talk on the Russian side of potential joint investments in the Arctic and in Russian rare earth minerals. The Izvestia news outlet earlier released a video of him leaving a hotel in the city, accompanied by Kirill Dmitriev, Putin’s investment envoy. Dmitriev also called the talks on Friday productive, according to Russian state news agency TASS. The talks come as US efforts to secure a ceasefire deal to end the Ukraine war havestalled amid negotiationson the conditions to end the conflict. Last month, Putin rejected a joint US-Ukrainian proposal for a complete and unconditional ceasefire. While Russia and Ukraine agreed to haltattacks on energyinfrastructure in March, both sides have accused each other of continuing attacks. At the end of March, Trump said he was “very angry” and “p****d off” after Putin criticised the credibility of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s leadership. In an interview with NBC News, Trump also threatened tariffs on Russian oil “if Russia and I are unable to make a deal on stopping the bloodshed in Ukraine, and if I think it was Russia’s fault”. On Friday morning, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that “Russia has to get moving. “Too many people ere [sic] DYING, thousands a week, in a terrible and senseless war – A war that should have never happened, and wouldn’t have happened, if I were President!!!” he said. Speaking to Al Jazeera from the Russian capital Moscow, correspondent Yulia Shapovalova said the dialogue between Washington and Moscow continues. “Peskov admitted that the settlement itself was a very complicated issue. But still, he said the meeting was a good opportunity for Russia to make its position heard,” she said. “The message from the US president to Russia, brought by Steve Witkoff, is quite clear: It’s a ceasefire in Ukraine,” Shapovalova said. “But analysts believe that Putin is not quite interested in showing Russia’s readiness for a ceasefire as Russia slowly but steadily is moving forward on the Ukrainian fronts.” She added that Russia’s demands also remain unchanged. It is opposed to the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), wants a reduced US presence in Europe, and has called for security guarantees and noninterference in its internal affairs. “Having said that, we can see now that oil prices are going down on the market, which may mean that Russia won’t be able to wage this war in the long run,” Shapovalova said. US and Russian officials also held talks on Thursday in Turkiye. Both sides said they had made progress towards normalising the work of their diplomatic missions. That same day, Russia freed Russian AmericanKsenia Karelinafrom prison in exchange for the suspected tech smuggler Arthur Petrov. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the prisoner exchanges helped build “trust, which is much needed” between the two sides after ties deteriorated under Biden.",

    "article_text": "The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. byAlex Heath For a while, it looked like President Donald Trump was going to have Big Tech’s back. Now, the tech industry is collateral damage in his global trade war. On Thursday, European Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyenfloated the ideaof placing “a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services” if tariff negotiations with the US go south. This would be the opposite outcome that tech CEOs likeMark Zuckerbergwere hoping for when they threw their support behind the new administration. To someone like Zuckerberg, Trump was supposed to be the strong-armed leader to bring the overbearing EU to heel. Instead, the rhetoric between the US and EU is ratcheting up just weeks before the EU isalready set to fineMeta (and Apple) for violating its Digital Markets Act. While certainly more of a self-inflicted wound,Elon Musk’spopularity in the US has “inverted as his support for President Trump has increased,”Nate Silverwrote this week. Tesla’s stock price, meanwhile. has lost over a third of its value this year, and, thanks to tariffs,the company has removedthe option to buy new, US-made vehicles in China. As Ipredicted last week, TikTok is particularly screwed by Trump’s extra-aggressive China tariffs, which the country has promised to“fight to the end.”Even as it’s still business as usual for TikTok’s rank and file, the app’s fate in the US feels increasingly precarious. When asked this week about the extended deadline to reach a TikTok deal in the US, aspokesperson for China’s commerce ministry saidthe government “opposes practices that ignore the laws of the market economy, plunder by force, and damage the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises.” “There’s not going to be much dialogue until that’s resolved,” one of TikTok’s aspiring bidders, AppLovin CEOAdam Foroughi, said this week of the tariffs. The situation is such a mess that the US stock market tanking also “drowned out the ability to infer feedback” from shareholders about AppLovin’s bid, ForoughitoldBloomberg. If anything, this week is a reminder that the tech industry has grown so large and influential that its leading companies are tools for leverage between countries. In times of relative peace, that influence can be beneficial for Big Tech. When things get hostile, Big Tech is put in the crosshairs.

It can apparently let you search for things to watch based on your mood. byJay Peters Netflix is starting to test search that’s powered by OpenAI,according toBloomberg. The new search engine will let users “look for shows using far more specific terms, including the subscriber’s mood, for example, the company said,” per the report. This OpenAI-powered search will also allow users to make queries that “go well beyond genres or actors’ names.” The feature, which is opt in, is already available for some users to try in Australia and New Zealand on iOS. Netflix spokesperson MoMo Zhou confirmed toThe VergethatBloomberg’sstory is accurate. Zhou says that the test will expand to the US “in the coming weeks and months” and that there aren’t currently plans for the feature outside of iOS. “It’s early days for the feature and we’re really in a learn and listen phase for this beta,” Zhou says. OpenAI didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. In an interview on theDecoderpodcastlast year,The Verge’seditor-in-chief, Nilay Patel, asked Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters about how the company was thinking about AI. Here was part of his response: We have a long history of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in our recommender systems. We’ve been doing that for 20-some years.

    "article_text": "Whether you want a battery that lasts for days or the best deal, we’ve got some recs for your next iPhone. Whether you want a battery that lasts for days or the best deal, we’ve got some recs for your next iPhone. byAllison Johnson If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The wait is over — kind of. Apple’s iPhone 16 series is out, including thekindaaffordable 16E, and its much-hyped Apple Intelligence has arrived courtesy of iOS 18.1. But if you’re expecting a new kind of iPhone experience, well, I have some bad news for you. TheAI features introduced in iOS 18.1andmorerecentupdates,including the writing tools and ChatGPT integration, are standard fare at this point. And although Siri has a new coat of paint, it’s basically the same old Siri. Apple has promised much more, but the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to be a slow burn that lasts well into 2025. Which is all to say that if you don’t have any complaints with how your current phone is working, you definitely shouldn’t rush out and get a new one just for Apple Intelligence. There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless. The most expensive, souped-up iPhone isn’t automatically the best one for everyone. What I look for is a happy medium — features that will satisfy most people at the best price. Sometimes, that’s last year’s model. Battery performance can vary by a significant margin between current iPhone models, mostly down to the size of the phone. Everyone wants a phone that can last a full day, and these recommendations reflect that. One size does not fit all. Some people like a small phone, others want the biggest screen money can buy. This list includes iPhones for people in both camps. That’s actually the gist of our phone buying philosophy: hang on to the one you’ve got. If you’re not the type of person to get excited about a new camera button, updated photo processing options, or incremental performance upgrades, then there’s no reason to run out and buy an iPhone 16. But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone 11 or 12 (or you’re concerned about a price increase as a result of thecurrent tariff situation), then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains this year, especially in the basic iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, without even considering AI. And if Apple Intelligence turns out to be something special eventually, well, you’ll be ready for it. 8 Verge Score Reliable camera with versatile photographic stylesHandy new Action ButtonMore RAM and a current-gen chipset Standard refresh rate screenCamera Control is a mixed bag Screen:6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 OLED, 60Hz refresh rate /Processor:A18Cameras:48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:Not advertised /Charging:27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 Apple’s basic iPhone enjoyed a significant hardware boost this time around, playing an overdue game of catch-up to the Pro series. The iPhone 16 includes the Action Button from last year’s Pro models — handy if there’s an app in your life you want to access at the touch of a button — and the new Camera Control. So if buttons are anything to go by, this phone istwo betterthan last year’s model. There’s more going on under the hood, too. The A18 chipset is in the same generation as the processor on the Pro models, which hasn’t been the case for the past couple of years. That bodes well for the 16 series staying on the same update schedule. And there’s extra RAM in this year’s base model, which can only be a good thing. The iPhone 16 became a much more interesting camera this time around, too. The Camera Control offers a quick way to launch the camera app and adjust settings like exposure compensation. But there’s also a new set of Photographic Style filters this time around, with options to adjust contrast, brightness, and undertones to dial in your preferred rendering of skin tones. You’ll get better low-light performance by stepping up to the 16 Pro models, and other cool tricks like 4K recording at 120 fps. But even without all that, it’s the most customizable camera Apple has offered yet. Outside of camera performance, there are two major drawbacks to picking the regular 16 over a Pro model: no zoom lens, and no ProMotion screen. Only the Pro has a dedicated 5x lens, which is handy for creative framing. And the standard 60Hz screen on the iPhone 16 will likely only bother you if you’re used to a smoother 120Hz display, though it’s annoying on principle that Apple keeps this feature to its Pro phones when virtually every other high-end phone has one. 8 Verge Score New tone control in camera lets you dial back HDR processingWho doesn’t love a physical shutter button?Your video director friends will spend hours gleefully taking 4K120 video portraits of people at street festivals Camera Control button is a little fiddlyDefault photo processing is more aggressive than everThe most incremental of incremental upgrades over the iPhone 15 Pro Screen:6.3-inch, 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate /Processor:A18 ProCameras:48-megapixel f/1.8 with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:Not advertised /Charging:27W wired, 25W MagSafe wireless, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 The iPhone 16 Pro gets a small but meaningful upgrade this time around: a bump up to a 5x zoom, which on the 15 series was reserved for the Pro Max. And while the change from a 3x to 5x zoom doesn’t look that impressive on paper, it goes a long way to making the smaller 16 Pro feel like an equal to the 16 Pro Max. For once, you don’t need to get the biggest phone to get the best phone. The 16 Pro is roughly the same size as the 15 Pro, but it has a bigger screen: 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches. There’s also the new Camera Control, an upgraded 48-megapixel ultrawide on board, and naturally, a new chipset that — naturally — supports Apple Intelligence. There’s nothing here that makes the 16 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. Still, plenty of people will want the latest device with all the bells and whistles, and the 16 Pro represents an opportunity to get all of those features without having to buy the biggest phone. 8 Verge Score Reliable camera with versatile photographic stylesHandy new action buttonMore RAM and a current-gen chipsetBig screen for big screen fans Standard refresh rate screenCamera control is a mixed bag Screen:6.7-inch Super Retina OLED /Processor:A18Cameras:48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:Not advertised /Charging:27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 The thing about a big phone is that it has a big battery. And while that’s easy enough to understand, it still feels surprising how much more performance you can eke out of the iPhone 16 Plus’ battery. It’ll stretch well into a second day of use, and even if you’re conditioned to charge your phone every night, you’ll be amazed how much you have left in the tank at the end of each day. It’s a solid antidote to battery anxiety. Naturally, the 16 Plus’ big-ness comes with another bonus: a bigger screen. The benefits are obvious here, too. But something that stands out to me when I use the phone is just how light it feels for its size, especially if you’re comparing it to the 16 Pro Max. If you like a big display but don’t need all of the weight of the Max — metaphorically and physically speaking — then the Plus is the way to go. 7 Verge Score Reliable performanceGood, if limited, camera systemIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy No MagSafe$599 feels like $100 too muchNo ultrawide Screen:6.1-inch Super Retina XDR /Processor:A18Cameras:48MP Fusionwith 1x and 2x optical zoom, 12-megapixel selfie/Battery:Not advertised /Charging:20-watt wired,7.5W Qi, no MagSafe/Weather-resistance rating:IP68 This recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing. There’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it has basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation given that it’s very much a work-in-progress. The 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn into something useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones. Apple still sellsthe iPhone 15new, cutting the price down to $699 with the introduction of the 16 series. There’s a strong argument for buying a 15 rather than the 16E if you don’t care about Apple Intelligence; the 15 Pro runs Apple Intelligence while the regular 15 doesn’t. Compared to the 16E, the iPhone 15 includes MagSafe, the Dynamic Island, an ultra wideband chip for precise item tracking, and an ultrawide camera.

The patch, set to be the game’s last major update, was originally announcedin November 2024, so it’s been a long time coming (though Larian has beenstress testing itahead of the official launch). The 12 new subclasses mean that each of the game’s main classes — Bard, Barbarian, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Fighter, Monk, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock and Wizard — will be getting an additional subclass. You can see the full list of new subclasses inthis November post from Larian. With crossplay, you’ll be able to play multiplayer with your friends no matter what platform they’re on.

    "article_text": "Louisiana inmates seeking parole are discovering that their fate will be decided not by humans – but by an algorithm. Louisiana inmates seeking parole are discovering that their fate will be decided not by humans – but by an algorithm. byTina Nguyen Anew report fromProPublicapublished Thursday showed how the Louisiana government is using TIGER (Targeted Interventions to Greater Enhance Re-entry), a computer program developed by Louisiana State University to prevent recidivism, to approve or deny parole applications based on a score calculating their risk of returning to prison. Though the algorithm was initially designed to be used as a tool to help rehabilitate inmates by taking their background into account, a TIGER score – which uses data from an inmate’s time before prison, such as work history, criminal convictions, and age at first arrest – is now the sole measure of one’s eligibility. In interviews, several prisoners revealed that their scheduled parole hearings had been abruptly canceled after their TIGER score determined that they were at “moderate risk” of returning to prison. There is no factor in a TIGER score that takes into account an inmate’s behavior in prison or attempts at rehab – a score that criminal justice activists argue penalizes one’s racial and demographic background. (According to current state Department of Corrections data, half of Louisiana’s prison population of roughly 13,000 would automatically fall in the moderate or high risk categories.) One included Calvin Alexander, a 70-year-old partially blind man in a wheelchair, who had been in prison for 20 years, but had spent his time in drug rehab, anger management therapy, and professional skills development, and had a clean disciplinary record. “People in jail have … lost hope in being able to do anything to reduce their time,” he toldProPublica. Parole via algorithm is not just legal in Louisiana, but a deliberate element in Republican Governor Jeff Landry’s crusade against parole. Last year, he signed alaweliminating parole for all prisoners who committed a crime after August 1st, 2024, making Louisiana the first state to eliminate parole in 24 years. A subsequent lawdecreedthat currently-incarcerated prisoners would only be eligible for parole if the algorithm determined they were “low risk”.

The new feature was demonstratedin a videoposted on the company’s Creator Insider channel this week. In the video, the host, Lauren, shows a new tab in the Creator Music beta section on YouTube called “Music assistant” where you can enter a prompt like “give me uplifting and motivational music for a workout montage.” The tool then generates several tracks you can review and download so you can add them to your video editor. Lauren says it’s gradually rolling Music assistant out for users who have access to Creator Music. Music assistant is one of several AI music-generating tools out there. Companies likeStability AIhave a diffusion model that can make background audio for projects, andMeta’s open-source AudioCraftand MusicGen models can synthesize sounds and media using prompts, too. YouTube has also experimented with AI music in other ways. It built a music remixer that lets you “restyle” popular songs to add to your Shorts.

TheDoomplusDoom IIWill It Run Edition, available in Switch, Xbox, PS5, and PC versions, will be available for preorder starting on Friday, April 18th, 2025 at 10:00AM ET. It’s being limited to just 666 units, naturally, at a price of $666.66. When asked if the steep but fitting price tag would be affected by tariffs, Alex Verrey, an LRG spokesperson, toldThe Vergein an email that “I do not believe there are any plans at this time to change the pricing due to tariffs.” Although a $29.99 Standard Edition and a $99.99 Big Box Edition will also be available, the Will It Run Edition includes an assortment of extra games, levels, gameplay upgrades, and add-ons that could justify the expensive collection forDoom’s biggest fans. But it’s the other accessories that will be its biggest selling point. In addition to theDoom-playing box, the Will It Run Edition includes four hours of the game’s soundtrack on four cassette tapes (despite audio CDs existing long before the originalDoomlaunched), a three-inch Cacodemon figurine that floats atop a magnetic base, and a pack of random trading cards. But the pièce de résistance is aDoom-playing handheld shaped like a Cacodemon with several of its teeth doubling as controller buttons. Let’s hope LRG decides to sell that on its own one day.

OpenAI has the public hooked again, from Ghibli portraits to Barbie boxes. byJess Weatherbed ChatGPT’s latest image generator had anexplosive debutthanks to theviral Studio Ghibli art trend, and LinkedIn users have now jumped on a new gimmick: turning yourself into a toy. There are several flavors of the trend being shared.The “AI Action Figure” variantappears to have gained the most traction, in which a person generates a plastic version of themselves in a blister pack, alongside various accessories — typically a laptop, a book, and a coffee cup, which is fitting given LinkedIn is largely driving this trend. Other versions try to specifically emulate recognizable branding, such as the “Barbie Box Challenge.” While the trend started on LinkedIn, it’s since started to leak over to other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. It hasn’t taken off to anywhere near the extent that the Ghibli art craze did, however, which is still outperforming every AI Barbie/action figure/doll term I could think of in Google’s Search rankings. The Ghibli art style trend also attracted some online backlash from creatives and fans of the animation studio over ethical, environmental, and copyright concerns, but that hasn’t popped up to the same extent — yet, at least — with this latest viral bandwagon. The common theme across every AI-generated figurine is that ChatGPT is typically the only AI image generator mentioned. The text-to-image update was so popular at launch last month that OpenAI had tolimit image generationandpush back access to free ChatGPTaccounts to prevent its servers from being overloaded. This action figure trend may be far smaller than the Ghibli images that preceded it, but it sets another precedent for ChatGPT being the AI service that lures in everyday joes. Most of this new semi-viral trend is contained within LinkedIn, shared by marketers and wannabe thought leaders with very little engagement to show for it. A few notable brands likeMac CosmeticsandNYX Cosmeticshave jumped on board, but recognizable stars and influencers don’t seem interested in joining in. The closest thing to a “famous person” I’ve seen to try it out isMarjorie Taylor Greene. Make of that what you will.

Now that Samsung has launched its2025 lineup, including the high-endFrame Pro, we’re starting to see steep discounts land on the 2024 models. Right now, for example,Samsung’s 85-inchFrame TV— its largest Frame TV to date — has dropped to around $2,498 ($1,800 off) atAmazon,Best Buy, andSamsung’s online storefront. Other sizes are on sale at Amazon as well, with the 43- and 75-inch configurations going for$797.99 ($200 off)and$1,997.99 ($1,000 off), respectively. Samsung’s Frame TV remains one of the most unique models on the market, even ifHisenseandTCLboth launched competing models last year. The 4K QLED can showcase artwork on an anti-glare matte panel when idle, which gives it a canvas-like appearance. The Frame is more than just eye candy, though, as it offers a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, support for several streaming apps, and compatibility with Alexa and Google Assistant. It also boasts HDMI 2.1 support, though it’s still better for streaming shows and movies than it is for gaming. There are some features you’ll only find in the 2025 models and the Pro, however, like a faster 144Hz refresh rate. Plus, only the Frame Pro comes with a Neo QLED Mini-LED panel and a Wireless One Connect Box, which drastically minimizes cable clutter so only the power cord is visible. But if all you want is a cool TV that looks like a piece of wall art and offers good specs, the last-gen model is still a great choice.

    "title": "South of Midnight is a game worth hollerin’ about",
    "article_text": "South of Midnight pays homage to Black and Southern culture in a way no other game has before. byAsh Parrish Black folks are loud. We laugh loud, we love loud, we protest loud. But when we really want to show our approval, we get quiet first. When we laugh at something funny, likereallylaugh, it sounds like a thin wheeze before sound bursts forth like a storm. And within seconds of startingSouth of Midnight, as I walked around the protagonist Hazel’s home and seeing a piece of art that was an obvious and deliberate homage to the painter Annie Lee’sBlue Monday, I wordlessly put my Steam Deck down and took a quiet lap around my living room before I startedshouting. South of Midnightis the latest title from Compulsion Games, a Canadian studio best known for makingWe Happy Few. It follows Hazel, a young woman who must rescue her mother after a hurricane sweeps their home away. Along her journey, she comes into her powers as a Weaver, or guardians who can see the strands that connect all life in what’s known as the Grand Tapestry and can repair it when those strands get knotted by pain and trauma. The game is an action platformer. Hazel progresses by using her Weaver abilities to heal the blighted landscape and defeat enemies called haints – a Southern term used to describe ghosts or monsters. She’s aided on her quest by Crouton, her childhood stuffed toy come to life by powerful magic. He can take over enemies’ bodies, cause them to fight on Hazel’s side, and can squeeze into places she’s too big to reach. I love when a piece of media talks to me as a Black person. A TV show, cartoon, or even a video game will have tiny visual references or phrases that are like a secret code. I see or hear them and know a Black person left this for me to find. What made mehollerabout South of Midnight was that its writers went for the deep cuts. They put in the kind of stuff you only know about if at least three of your four grandparents were American Black. Back in the day,everyoneon both sides of my family had Annie Lee artwork in the house. If it wasn’tBlue Monday, it wasSixty Pounds— which my mother had hanging above the window in our kitchen. What made mehollerabout South of Midnight was that its writers went for the deep cuts. That kind of acknowledgement is everywhere in the game. It’s in the way Hazel and her mother, Lacey, speak to each other, the words they use, and their intonation. Hazel mutters something disrespectful, and her mother immediately calls her out: “I thought you was grown.” It’s in the way Catfish, the magical and overly large catfish who guides Hazel on her quest, reminds me of my twoverycountry uncles.Earlier this year when I spoke to Ahmed Best, the voice and motion capture director for the game, he talked about how he wanted to ensure every aspect came across as authentic — right down to the way folks stood. I saw that come through in the way Hazel fans herselfjust soto keep the Mississippi heat at bay. Instead of standing straight up, she tilts her head to the side as she waves her hand the exact same way Memphis-born aunties do. The details were so small, but they accumulated in my heart like the waters behind a levee. Every time I discovered something new — like noticing one of the game’s chapter titles referenced Zora Neale Hurston’s novelTheir Eyes Were Watching God— the emotion would burst forth as a flood of tears. And it’s not just the narrative that pays homage to Black and Southern tradition and culture; the gameplay does, too. Instead ofthe much (and unfairly) maligned yellow paintused to denote a climbable surface,South of Midnightusesa very specific shade of blue— the color Black people in the South would use to paint their porches to keep evil spirits away. There was a moment when I saw blue butterflies hovering over a cliff surrounded by water that kills Hazel if she touches it. Knowing the game uses blue to show you where you can safely go, I took a leap of faith over the edge and found a secret power-up. The game spoke to me using the language of my ancestors, and I heard it. Once again, I hollered. As much asSouth of Midnightmade me yell, its combat did make me groan a little bit. Every combat encounter follows the same extremely basic formula. Enemies show up in an arena, you kill them, heal the wound causing the enemies to appear, repeat ad nauseam with particular emphasis on the nausea part. It’s so formulaic that combat feels vestigial, like it was put there as an afterthought to give players something else to do. Hazel’s abilities don’t feel particularly fun or interesting to use, and, honestly, the game doesn’t even need combat at all. The storytelling is so strong thatSouth of Midnightwould be just as compelling as a purely narrative experience with some light platforming action. Honestly, the game doesn’t even need combat at all In a lot of cases, in order for Black media to get widespread attention or critical acclaim, it must be centered on luridly depicting trauma. The opposite isn’t all that great either, wherein a piece of Black media overcorrects and completely refuses to acknowledge traumatic realities that inform our existence.South of Midnightdeftly straddles those two schools of thought in a pointed way that I’ve never seen before. South of Midnightsees me. It gets me. Its creators wanted to craft a love letter to a culture not often depicted in video games, and they did exactly that. At a time when my government is trying to do everything in its power toerase my people,their history, andtheir contributions to the US, I cannot overstate the power that lies in being seen — especially coming from a place like video games, which is often violently hostile if it bothers to acknowledge folks like me at all. This game came out right on time, right in the moment when a narrative like this was needed the most.South of Midnightis a loving and worshipful praise song of the culture and people it depicts that made it hard for me to stay quiet for long. South of Midnightis out now on Xbox, Xbox Game Pass, and Windows PC.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 11, 2025 / 7:53 PM EDT/ CBS Boston Talented musicians from across the country are coming together in Boston for a unique concert experience featuring artists with physical or mental disabilities. The musicians are part of theMusic Inclusion Ensemble, which was founded at Berklee College of Music in Boston. \"I have been playing violin for most of my life but as a blind violinist, I have often felt a bit at odds with the music scene around me,\" said violinist Julia LaGrand. The ensemble is now working to change that. \"It's really a celebration of how our differences come together to be able to create something beautiful,\" said co-founder Adrian Anantawan. Anantawan, a Berklee associate professor, has seen the ensemble grow from five musicians to more than 20 set to perform on April 12. \"When we're centering disability identity, it's not really an othering experience but really just a very specific universal lens into the human condition,\" said Anantawan. \"It's really a great step in the right direction of integrating disability fully into our culture,\" said co-founder Gaelynn Lea. \"Music is about creating and changing the landscape and thinking of new ways of doing things. So I think music is, like, the perfect medium for including people with disabilities and helping them to adapt because it just, like, that's what creation is...encouraging you and then also just working with you to make things possible.\" Connor Valcy, who has autism, is the main arranger and composer for the show. \"It's a big joy for the people to be around, to see not only their artistry but their passion for their own music,\" said Valcy. He said the audience can expect to hear, \"pop, country, there's going to be a lot of classical...it was really a joy getting to work on a lot of these pieces.\" Dr. Rhoda Bernard, who founded the Berklee Institute for Accessible Arts Education, said these types of performances are key to breaking stereotypes. \"Regardless of who you are, what your background is, how you engage with the world, how you make music. There's room for everybody in this concert,\" said Bernard. \"People have this idea that music only belongs to certain people who are so-called talented or who look or appear a certain way or who think or learn a certain way and that could not be further from the truth.\" LaGrand said she agrees. \"I think it sends a really powerful message about what disability allows us to do, the incredible variety that we have in this ensemble of genres of music and of ways of approaching music I think is really exciting.\" \"We're all sort of working together with our various forms of disabilities, sort of trying to minimize the negative impacts or weaknesses and to come together and maximize as many strengths as possible,\" said Anantawan. \"I think you walk away with the sense that there's this ability to just be in the space fully with who you are and feel welcome as an audience member and as a musician and hopefully that you leave feeling like if this is possible, we can't we do this every day?\" said Lea. The concert is at the Berklee Performance Center on April 12 at 7 p.m. Admission is free but you do need a ticket.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 11, 2025 / 7:51 PM EDT/ CBS Baltimore It's almost been ten years sinceFreddie Graydied, and an event in downtown Baltimore Friday aimed to not only remember him but also remember what needs to be done when it comes to ensuring fair policing. Still Rising 10 Years After Freddie Gray's Deathwas put on by the Gibson-Banks Center for Race and the Law, which is apart of the University of Maryland Francis King Carey School of Law. The attorney who represented Gray's family, a former deputy police commissioner, as well as representatives from a number of organizations, spoke at the event. No one at the event could believeten years had gone by. Attorney Billy Murphy represented Gray's family in all of the legal battles after his death. He said this time of year is always hard for Gray's family. According to Murphy, it's been particularly hard for Gray's twin sister, Fredericka Gray. \"She can hardly sleep. They were twins, they were born 14 minutes apart,\" Murphy explained. Murphy and other speakers noted that Freddie Gray's death did spark some needed change, like the consent decree and the implementation of a body camera program. Though everyone agreed, there's still a lot of work to be done. \"We are still not where we want to be in terms of public safety,\" said Gibson-Banks Center executive director Monique Dixon. \"We want to ensure that public safety is available to everyone, regardless of race, color, or national origin.\" Former Baltimore Police deputy commissioner Melvin Russell was in the heart of the unrest ten years ago. \"My heart was breaking for the city. It was breaking for two entities, which I was part of both: the community and the police,\" he said. Russell retired in 2019. He said while the consent decree is helpful, he argues it's taking too long to implement. Baltimore's consent decree has been in effect for eight years. The city and Baltimore Police are still trying toend oversightover two sections, which would be a first in its existence. There's a federal court hearing about that next week. \"Don't drag your feet, don't treat it like a cash cow, that's coming off the back of taxpayers mostly,\" Russell said. In his remarks, Murphy also took aim at President Trump's administration- particularly critical of the moves to end federal oversight of police. Murphy called the community to remember what it did after Gray's death and to do it again to bring change to a national level. \"This is gonna be a long, long fight,\" he said. \"We can't be fulfilled yet until we stop what's going on now across the country.\" © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

In 2017,Monica Sementillihad an enviable life — a luxurious house with a pool and a Porsche in the driveway — in a posh area of Los Angeles. But after spending almost seven years behind bars waiting through legal delays and COVID, she is scheduled to go on trial for the murder of her husband, celebrity hairdresser and beauty executiveFabio Sementilli. As \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller reports, it's a tangled story. Her defenders say Monica Sementilli is an innocent victim. But if you believe prosecutors, she's a criminal. Authorities describe a case of lust, greed, and murder. Whichever it is, the drama unfolded on Jan. 23, 2017. Elyse Bleuel: There were fire trucks outside of her house…and I was like, oh gosh … there was no police yet. It was just the first responders. Elyse Bleuel was a friend of Monica Simental's. \"48 Hours\" spoke with her in 2018. She says Monica texted her to come over the night Fabio was killed. Elyse Bleuel: it was her and her daughters … She just kept saying that \"he's gone, that I'm not a wife anymore\" … I just held her. I just held her. Elyse Bleuel: It was so painful, just the weeping…the not being able to breathe…she was beyond devastated… beyond devastated. Monica's husband, Fabio, was slumped over his chair by the pool. Michelle Miller: Had you seen the body? Had you seen? Elyse Bleuel: Didn't … Elyse Bleuel: I just wanted to be the best possible comfort. …  I didn't know how to comfort that. … she couldn't speak in complete sentences until like the fourth day. Detectives quickly learned the victim, Fabio Sementilli, had been a superstar in the beauty business. \"48 Hours\" spoke with those who knew him best in 2017. Fabio's sister, Mirella Rota Mirella Rota: He was a happy man. And he wanted everybody around him happy. Luigi Sementilli:The best way to describe my dad, really, is like a cup of coffee in the morning. Luigi Sementilli is Fabio's son from an earlier marriage. Luigi Sementilli: He gets you going … he lifts your spirits … he gets you determined to charge the mountain of life. Michelle Miller: Did your friends say, \"Hey Luigi, is that your dad?\" Luigi Sementilli: Absolutely, yeah. It was kind of a fun thing, you know. … It's hard to avoid him when you type in Sementilli on Google, it's very hard … in fact when you type in my name, Luigi Sementilli, the first thing that comes up is his profile! (laughs) Fabio and his sister Mirella began cutting hair in Toronto, Canada. That's where Fabio met Monica, a customer and makeup artist he married in 1997. Joe Mercurio: The wedding was incredible. Restauranteur Joe Mercurio grew up with Fabio. He was best man at Fabio's wedding to Monica. Joe Mercurio: We were dancing right to the very end. Mirella Rota: We saw their relationship as a love story. Fabio was also in love with his career — he and his sister Mirella were getting famous. In 2008, Fabio was promoted to an executive job at the beauty giant Wella and moved his family to L.A. Pete Castellano was Fabio's colleague. Pete Castellano: What happened was was the opportunity … to really allow the things that he wanted for his family to come to life by taking on a bigger role. He and Monica settled into a life most of us can only dream about. Michelle Miller: He drove a Porsche. Mirella Rota: Yeah. Michelle Miller: What man doesn't want a Porsche in Los Angeles? Mirella Rota: You're absolutely right. They were living the life and raising their two teenage daughters, Gessica and Isabella. FABIO SEMENTILLI (video): My own family unit is the most most dear to me. Then came that January day. It was late afternoon as he sat by the pool. Fabio was stabbed to death. His then-16-year-old daughter Isabella discovered his body. To investigators, the Sementilli case started out a mystery. But from early on, they had at least one intriguing clue. From a neighbor's security camera, they could see two figures in hoodies running close to the Sementilli's house at the time of the murder. A little while later, Fabio's Porsche was being driven away. Back then, Investigators didn't suspect Monica had anything to do with Fabio's death.  She wasn't even home at the time he was killed. Instead, they looked at those two hooded figures. At the time of Fabio's murder in 2017, L.A was plagued with break-ins from notorious teams of criminals. Michelle Miller(watching video of a knock-knock burglary): What do you call these guys? Det. William Dunn: Well, we call them the knock-knock burglars. Michelle Miller: So, this is LAPD footage? Det. William Dunn: Yeah. They know what they're doing, and they know what they want. Michelle Miller:  I mean... they're running wild! They were hitting homes of celebrities all over Los Angeles. It was 2017, and, for years, the homes of L.A. celebrities were targeted. LOCAL NEWS REPORT: At least seven celebrities had hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of jewelry taken. LOCAL NEWS REPORT: High-profile victims include $300,000 from former Lakers star Derek Fisher, $175,000 for Nikki Minaj…and $2 million from Alanis Morrissette's Brentwood home. Det. William Dunn | LAPD(watching surveillance video of a knock-knock burglary): They're moving just as quick as they can. Det. William Dunn: In and out in about three minutes ... they ransack a bedroom, find some jewelry and get out. William Dunn, a Los Angeles Police Department detective at the time, had hours of videotape of the knock-knock burglars in action all over wealthy Los Angeles neighborhoods, including one from a home just a few miles from Fabio's, months after his murder. Michelle Miller(watching surveillance video of a knock-knock burglary): They seem to know what to look for. Det. William Dunn: Right, they're looking for jewelry. They're looking for cash. Michelle Miller: Look at him! Det. William Dunn: Yeah, see he's checking clothes, he's feelin the clothes to see if somebody's put jewelry or cash in some of the pockets. Det. William Dunn: See? Now he's seeing that safe. Michelle Miller: Ah! Det. William Dunn: See, and now he gets – he tells his buddy. Hey, look at what we've found. Now look at how many seconds, and this is a real heavy safe. … but they're very determined … they put a lot of effort into it and it's so heavy he can't – he can't lift the thing. But look at how he's just gonna slide that thing out. Michelle Miller: So they got the safe, that's pay dirt, and off they go. Det. William Dunn: They're gone. Yup! You see? They're gone. To detectives, those two hooded figures recorded on a neighbor's surveillance camera near Fabio's house right around the time of his murder looked a lot like the knock-knock burglars. And the Sementilli home had its own cameras. Detectives hoped they would find even more video of those hooded figures on those tapes. There were four cameras outside the Sementilli house, but when police came to look for the video, it was gone! A DVR was in the garage, it stored all the surveillance. Whoever broke in must have taken it. Strangely, besides taking Fabio's Porsche, that black box was one of the only things stolen from the house, say investigators. Monica told them she thought some inexpensive jewelry and $11,000 in cash was possibly missing, but she wasn't sure. Detectives say the home safe hadn't been touched. Luigi Sementilli: The only thing I thought that was unusual was why didn't they take more?  Why didn't they take his watch? The suspected burglars left behind an $8,000 Rolex on Fabio's wrist. But within months, the knock-knock burglars began to fade as police suspects because the police were hanging on to a big secret. Nobody except investigators knew it at the time, but they discovered blood at the crime scene that did not belong to Fabio Sementilli. That meant detectives had DNA to work with. DNA that eventually led to a suspect. Capt. William Hayes| LAPD: We were able to develop forensic evidence … some of that was DNA, which identified Robert Baker. Robert Baker had been a racquetball league director at a Los Angeles gym, not far from Fabio's house. And Monica's friend, Elyse Bleuel, knew him. \"48 Hours\" spoke to her about him in 2018. Michelle Miller: How would you describe Rob Baker? Elyse Bleuel: He was cool. We all really liked him. Elyse Bleuel: He was one of those gym guys — you know, grrr! Bleuel played in his league. Elyse Bleuel:He was very alpha. He was a very alpha male. There was also kind of a sexual-ly thing about him. Michelle Miller: There was something sexual about him. What do you mean? Elyse Bleuel: You know how some guys just have just have this sexual kind of, I don't know, he was very manly … he was in shape, and he was kind of, you know, kept everything — he was in charge. He was also tangled up in the porn industry, even doing some acting. Bleuel didn't know much about Baker's background, but she did hear about his movie career from a friend who happened to spot him in an adult film. Elyse Bleuel: That's like the kind of gossip that … you just need to tell someone. Michelle Miller: Who did you tell? Elyse Bleuel: I told Monica. Monica was also in Robert Baker's racquetball league. Michelle Miller: What was her reaction? Elyse Bleuel: Well, it was pretty anticlimactic, I'll tell ya. Michelle Miller: Really? Elyse Bleuel: Yeah. 'cause a lotta times when we would have girl talk she'd get a little prude-y.  Like a little prude. What Bleuel didn't know was that Baker was also a registered sex offender. Capt. William Hayes: Robert Baker has a 1993 conviction out of a Long Beach case. It's for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor. Police say Baker served time for that offense against a teenage girl. For months, police watched Baker and they discovered two things. First, he was definitely not one of the knock-knock burglars, and second, he made thousands of calls and texts to of all people, Monica Sementilli. In fact, just days after Fabio's death, Monica held a wake in her backyard and Baker actually showed up. Michelle Miller: You did meet him? Mirella Rota: I did. Rota says she saw Monica hanging out with Baker. Mirella Rota: I saw her back … outside again, with a drink, smoking, and talking to this guy. … I found out that that was his name, Rob. And she introduced me to him. Luigi noticed him, too. Luigi Sementilli: Robert and Monica were in the corner talking to each other, sort of away from the party. And there was something else Luigi noticed about Baker. Luigi Sementilli: He had bandages on his hands. One guest even snapped pictures of Monica and Robert Baker together. If you look closely, you can just make out a bandage on Baker's finger. Police would later conclude Baker cut that finger when he killed Fabio. And that's how his blood was at the scene. Detectives visited Monica at home using what they called a \"ruse\" — telling her they were investigating the knock-knock burglars, when in fact they were investigating her and secretly following Monica and Baker. And according to authorities, it paid off. They say they found evidence that Monica and Baker were having an affair andconspired to kill Fabio. JUSTIN EISENBERG | LAPD Chief of Detectives [to reporters in June 2017]: Over the past several months, investigators have developed information and identified Robert Baker, 55 years old of Canoga Park and Monica Sementilli, 45 years old, of Woodland Hills, who is the wife of our homicide victim, as responsible for his murder. Mirella Rota: He said, \"We arrested Monica for the murder of your brother,and Robert Baker for the murder of your brother.\" And I was in shock. I'm like, \"They're — you sure?\" You know? I — I was in shock. Mary Fulginiti: According to the prosecution … these two were plotting and planning to kill Fabio so they could live their life together. Mary Fulginiti is a former federal prosecutor and a \"48 Hours\" consultant. Mary Fulginiti: It was a very complicated investigation. As authorities hustled Robert Baker and Monica Sementilli into court, they each pleaded \"not guilty.\" But almost six years later, Baker changed everything. Mary Fulginiti:  When he came to court that day, people were stunned. Monica Sementilli was being accused of cheating on Fabio with that racquetball coach Robert Baker and then—along with Baker— planning Fabio's murder. Elyse Bleuel: My instant and thorough and complete reaction was there's no effing way … I was there. She was decimated. After months of crying and grieving alongside Monica, Fabio's family couldn't believe it either. Mirella Rota: Twenty-some years of my life she was like a sister. She was a cool aunt to my kids … she was loveable … my whole family felt that way about her (crying). Then, in 2023, Baker skipped trial altogether and pleaded no contest. Mary Fulginiti:Robert Baker pleads no contest.  And that's in essence accepting responsibility for the murder. He's ultimately sentenced to life without parole. JUDGE RONALD COEN (in court): The maximum sentence in this case is life imprisonment without the possibility of parole plus one year. … You understand this? ROBERT BAKER: Yes, sir. But while Baker was accepting responsibility for Fabio's death, Monica wasn't. MIRELLA ROTA (in court) : What he and Monica did to my brother, Fabio, is unforgivable. But Monica's own daughters, Isabella and Gessica, supported their mom. GESSICA SEMENTILLI (in court): We will continue to stand by our mother as we have done for the last six years, and we will fight for her innocence. As Monica prepared to go to trial, her defense attorney Leonard Levine made a statement. LEONARD LEVINE: We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty pleas and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband. Monica's defense team wasn't answering questions before trial, so \"48 Hours\" asked New York-based defense attorney Julie Rendelman to review Monica's defense team's pre-trial motions. Julie Rendelman: There's no witnesses that we know of so far that are going to come forward and testify that she planned this murder. She says Monica's relationship with Baker doesn't prove anything. Michelle Miller: It seems to strengthen the DA's case that not only did she have an affair, but the person she was having the affair with is the killer. Julie Rendelman: I hear you, but the problem is — is that simply because an individual is having an affair, the — you cannot take the leap to get to an individual being responsible, um, for the death of their loved one, certainly not beyond a reasonable doubt. But the prosecution says the affair is key to establishing a conspiracy between Monica and Robert Baker — an alleged conspiracy detectives spent months tracking. Michelle Miller: How long was that investigation? Mary Fulginiti: Five months. Five to six months. While the DA also declined an interview before going to trial, former prosecutor Mary Fulginiti reviewed the case against Monica. Michelle Miller(outside the Sementilli's home): So, this is the scene of the crime? Mary Fulginiti: Yeah … You know, this is where the two joggers, you know, came according to the video from a neighbor, uh, running up here toward the house. Prosecutors say that first hooded figure — in the green sweatshirt— is Robert Baker. Michelle Miller: So, what about that accomplice? Mary Fulginiti: We don't know who that person is. … it's a mystery. Michelle Miller: What does this indictment say about Monica Sementilli? Mary Fulginiti: This indictment is a very detailed outline and timeline of the plot to kill Fabio Sementilli. Mary Fulginiti: Motive here is simple. I mean, this is love and money. This is one of the oldest crimes in the book where, you know, two lovers desperately wanting to be together, and they try to get rid of one of the spouses so they can be together for what? For financial benefit. … And that would mean the three quarters of a million life insurance policy, the house, 401ks. Police say the plan was to stage the scene to make it look like the work of the knock-knock burglars and throw police off their trail. And they believe Monica was deeply involved. Mary Fulginiti: They believe … she was the one that coordinated everything, the one that showed him, you know, where the house was, where the DVR was, so that he knew where to go to rip it out of the walls. How to get into the house. And that's not all. The prosecutor says six months before the murder, Monica forwarded an email sharing details of her home security system with Baker. Mary Fulginiti: She provided the password, the username, the log in credentials, as well as the user manual to Robert Baker, the same day that she received it from the surveillance company. And then there's the day of the murder. Prosecutors say Monica's behavior that day is a key element of her role in the conspiracy to kill Fabio. According to prosecutors, surveillance video shows Monica left home at 3:26 p.m. driving the family's black Ford F-150 pickup. Michelle Miller(standing in a Target parking lot): This is where she came, according to prosecutors, to establish her alibi? Mary Fulginiti:So, a lot happens in this parking lot. … she pulls in here in her Ford-150 pickup truck right in front of this store … stops for just a few minutes. Prosecutors say they have video where it appears an individual gets into Monica's truck. They say that person was Robert Baker. Monica then goes alone into the Target store and begins shopping. But as she leaves, prosecutors say this surveillance photo shows her fixated on her phone. They would tell a grand jury it appears she was streaming video from her home — a lot of it. So what was Monica Sementilli watching on her phone that afternoon at about the time her husband was being murdered? Mary Fulginiti. The phone records and data show that she's connecting to a unique IP address. … It happens to be the IP address of the house. And there's a large amount of data that's being consumed. And that large amount of data is consistent with video streaming, i.e, the surveillance video of the house. Surveillance video? According to the DA, it might have been video from her home security cameras. But could Monica have been watching the actual murder? Mary Fulginiti: No… The surveillance cameras in the house are — are facing outside, but they're not facing in the pool area, which was where Fabio was located at the time. So, they didn't actually capture the murder, but they would capture obviously who was coming and going. Monica could have been watching everything else, prosecutors say. Mary Fulginiti(with Miller in the Target parking lot): They're going to argue … she's watching the scene, the scene of the crime to see the comings and goings of when Baker and the accomplice are going into the house, when are they leaving the house so that she knows when she can leave here and go home. Prosecutors say while she is watching the feed, Baker and his accomplice were on the Sementilli property stalking Fabio. Mary Fulginiti: According to the prosecution, \"it was a very targeted attack that was done with the intent to kill.\" They also go on to say that \"he was stabbed in the neck, it cut his jugular vein, cut the carotid artery.\" And there's more evidence of the plot to kill Fabio. Prosecutors say Baker was planning a future with Monica. Mary Fulginiti: The DA says that about two months before the murder, Baker told a friend that he had been dating this woman for about a year, and that he sent a picture of that woman, and that woman was Monica. Mary Fulginiti: And then two months later Fabio was killed. Authorities also say Monica's behavior after the murder is suspect. She didn't move her teenage daughters out of the house or have her security system repaired. Mary Fulginiti: And the prosecutors argued that the reason why she had no concern, because she knew who the killer was, and she was with him. Mary Fulginiti: This is a woman who is pretending to be a grieving widow and making all these posts on social media. Mary Fulginiti: Who at the same time is carrying on a torrid love affair with the man who actually killed her husband. Prosecutors made explicit photos public in court filings. Some we can't show you. They say its evidence the secretive romance continued after Fabio's death. Mary Fulginiti:I mean, that's a double life. … The D.A. presented a photograph of Monica and — and Baker to the grand jury. And it was a photograph of Monica actually grabbing his crotch. … And this was one, uh, that was taken in Vegas. Michelle Miller: There was also this — this photo of a mirror. Mary Fulginiti: Right. … it was a photo of the back of Monica … with Mrs. Baker, uh, written lipstick on the mirror. Michelle Miller: The … lipstick and the mirror … What — what does that tell them? Mary Fulginiti: Again, this all goes to motive. I mean, Mrs. Baker … she wanted to be Mrs. Baker. But when detectives asked Monica about Robert Baker, prosecutors say she told them she wasn't even sure of his last name. They say she also told them she wasn't sure how to work the home security cameras. Mary Fulginiti: To quote the prosecution here, they say, \"She's a liar, she's a manipulator, she's a cheater. And everything that comes out of her mouth has to be taken with a large grain of salt large enough so that you could choke on it.\" Mary Fulginiti: If they can show that Monica lied about her lifestyle, about the affair, about a variety of other things, that they'll convince the jury that she's also lying about her involvement in this conspiracy to kill Fabio. And they say when she was later confronted about why Baker's blood was found in her house, she continued to lie. Mary Fulginiti:She comes up with some cockamamie story about, you know, playing racquetball with Baker and hitting him in the finger and that it was bleeding and there was a bloody towel and she had to bring it home and — and that's why his blood was at the house. But Fulginiti says one of the biggest pieces of evidence against Monica is what happened when police came up with a plan to secretly record the couple. It began when they pulled them over as they were driving. Mary Fulginiti:It's a ruse by the police. … They say that they think the car that they're in is stolen and they wanted to, you know, just check it out and you know, probably isn't and they handcuff them per protocol, put them into the police vehicle. But what they don't know is that vehicle's wired and that there's a van up the street with police in it listening to their every word. And it's at that point, Monica says, and I'm gonna quote here: \"Somebody must have talked. Somebody is doing this to us.\" And then she said, \"They must have something. They must have something.\" Mary Fulginiti: That's pretty damning evidence. … as a former prosecutor that is close to an admission to being involved in this conspiracy. According to detectives, Monica was also recorded telling her cellmate, \"He's not just my lover … he's my confidante … he's my everything.\" Detectives also intercepted letters Monica wrote to Baker from behind bars saying, \"I'm always amazed how we both know what the other is thinking. DESTINED!\" And \"I miss you so much my love!\" Mary Fulginiti: When you look at these pieces in the totality, it's going to put together a pretty perfect puzzle here. And the puzzle will paint this picture that Monica conspired with Baker, that he did not do it alone, that they did it together. But Monica's defenders say the case against her is flimsy, and they say Baker did it without her. Julie Rendelman: Robert Baker may have killed him because he wanted him out of the way. Maybe he did it because he hoped that by killing him, he would get Monica to himself. … That in and of itself does not establish that Monica was in on the murder. Monica Sementilli's defense is adamant she had absolutely nothing to do with Fabio's murder. Julie Rendelman: The defense's position is that there is no hard evidence, actually no evidence that establishes Monica Sementilli participated in conspiracy. And if you can't prove a conspiracy, you can't prove Monica's guilt says Rendelman. Michelle Miller: The sheer number of circumstances that seem to weave together— the parking lot meeting … the walking into the store and watching video that has streamed live from the home … the password being given to the killer … all of those things, the sum of them, wouldn't a jury believe is just too much of a coincidence? Julie Rendelman: Obviously, I can't answer for what the jury is gonna say. Um, the defense, I could promise you, is going to attempt to poke holes — holes in every single piece of evidence you just spoke about. Michelle Miller: So, let's go step-by-step … the sharing of that password for the surveillance video. Julie Rendelman: So, there is no question that she shared the password. But Rendelman says there's no connection between sharing that password and a murder plot. Julie Rendelman: There's absolutely no evidence between the six months that she shared it and the day he was killed, that establishes there was any plan in place between them whatsoever to have her husband killed, not a text, not an email, not a conversation with her best friend saying she's over her relationship. Julie Rendelman: The second issue is, there's absolutely no evidence that Robert Baker downloaded the app or ever even used the app. Michelle Miller: Let's talk about the actions in the parking lot the day of the murder. … someone appears to be getting into the car. Julie Rendelman:Keep a couple things in mind. One is from the defense's perspective … the video footage is so grainy that you can't make out who if anybody is getting into Monica Sementilli's car. And what about the allegation that she was watching video of the house as the murder took place? Michelle Miller:Once she went inside the Target — there was a point in time where she seemed fascinated, fixated on her phone. Julie Rendelman: Well, I'll tell you one thing. The prosecution doesn't know what she was watching on her phone. They cannot articulate nor will they ever be able to articulate what was going on in that phone. Michelle Miller: But it was being streamed from her home. Julie Rendelman: She could be watching a show, just like any one of us watched your show while we're walking along. Michelle Miller: The prosecution really digs in on Monica's character, the fact that she's having an affair. Julie Rendelman: Well, let me quote what the defense says in —in regards to that. \"The prosecutor's evidence of Ms. Sementilli's affair and specifically the sexist and lurid manner in which it was presented … was irrelevant, improper and unfairly prejudicial to Ms. Sementilli.\" Julie Rendelman: They go on and say, \"the sexual and romantic details of their affair were simply irrelevant to the question, whether they conspired to murder Fabio Sementilli.\" But then why lie to investigators — allegedly saying she was unsure of Robert Baker's last name? Julie Rendelman: The question becomes, why is she lying? Is she lying because she committed a murder or is she lying because she has been in a tryst with someone for quite a while and doesn't want the world to know particularly, law enforcement? Prosecutors did find it suspicious that on the night Fabio died, Monica was already inquiring about his life insurance. But Rendelman says it's not odd. Julie Rendelman: I understand, um, how it could look insensitive to start asking about a life insurance policy so soon after. But if you're, uh, an individual that is not financially sound, you have two girls at home, you have potentially a mortgage to pay, you have bills to pay, you are going to be worried about the financial security of your family. And come trial, says Rendelman, what may really help Monica is that she won't be tried with Baker.  The jury will not see the man who committed the actual murder at the defense table next to Monica.  And that could make the case harder for prosecutors, says Fulginiti. Mary Fulginiti: The fact that he's her lover and the killer, the one that the DNA's around the house, I mean that — there is a spillover effect. And that all would've, you know, potentially impacted, I think, the jury in this case. And he's no longer there. Michelle Miller: Would you say it was his last gift to Monica? Mary Fulginiti: Yeah, I would 'cause there's absolutely no other reason for him actually to plead straight up, without any real plea bargain here, to life without the possibility of parole, except I guess his last murderous chivalrous act. But it seems Baker may have an even bigger impact on Monica's case.\"48 Hours\" went to see him in jail, and he told us Monica had nothing to do with the murder of Fabio and she never knew that he was Fabio's killer. Baker also told us that he's no longer in touch with Monica and he has not decided if he will testify. Another factor that could help Monica, says Rendelman, the daughters Monica shared with Fabio are standing behind their mother. Julie Rendelman: And so, there's an argument to be made that the jury is looking at the daughter saying, \"if they believe her after all this, shouldn't we?\" As for Monica herself, she's never spoken publicly – except at a memorial for her deceased husband. MONICA SEMENTILLI (video from Fabio's memorial):  How lucky am I to have lived the greatest love story of all time. A story that people only read about. A story that movies are made of.

    "title": "Did a California wife conspire with her ex-lover to kill her husband?",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 11, 2025 / 7:16 PM EDT/ CBS News Fabio Sementilliwas a superstar in the beauty business. He began cutting hair in Toronto, Canada, and eventually moved to Los Angeles when he was promoted to an executive position at Wella. He settled in a home in Woodland Hills with his wife Monica and their two teenage daughters. On Jan. 23, 2017, Fabio was in his backyard by the pool when two people broke into the home and stabbed him to death. According to prosecutors, the suspects staged the scene to look like a robbery gone wrong. But when Los Angeles Police Department detectives began investigating the murder, they said they found blood at the scene that didn't belong to Fabio. And they said they also found evidence that his wife was having an affair at the time. On the day Fabio was killed, prosecutors said a neighbor's security camera capturedMonica Sementillileaving home in her black Ford F-150 pickup truck. She was headed to Target where prosecutors said she was establishing her alibi. Before Monica entered the store, according to prosecutors, there is video where it appears an individual got into Monica's truck. Prosecutors said that person was Robert Baker, a local racquetball coach who Monica had been having an affair with for about a year prior to Fabio's murder. Monica's defense attorneys have disputed the prosecution's interpretation of the video from the parking lot. According to the district attorney, Monica then went alone into the Target store and began shopping. A neighbor's security camera captured two hooded figures jogging near Fabio's house right around the time of the murder. According to prosecutors, the person in the green hoodie was Baker. And prosecutors said that Baker and the unknown co-conspirator entered the Sementilli home and attacked Fabio from behind. They then staged the scene to look like robbery. At 4:32 p.m. on the day of Fabio's murder, Monica Sementilli was seen on surveillance video walking out of the Target store and, according to prosecutors, she was fixated on her phone and likely monitoring her home surveillance cameras remotely. Prosecutors also said that around the time of Fabio's murder, phone records showed that Monica's iPhone was connected to her home's IP address and her phone was consuming a large amount of data consistent with streaming live video. The prosecution stated in pre-trial motions that Monica was monitoring the comings and goings at her home so that Baker and the unknown accomplice could enter and kill Fabio \"without any interruption.\" But according to Monica's defense team, there is no evidence that can prove what exactly she was watching on her phone at that time. In court documents, the defense raised the possibility that Monica could have been remotely streaming a TV show. About 35 minutes after the hooded joggers were seen near the Sementilli home, at 4:53 p.m., Fabio's black Porsche was seen on the same neighbor's security camera being driven away. Prosecutors said this was Baker and his unknown co-conspirator leaving the crime scene. According to detectives, the Porsche was discovered two days after the murder parked about five miles away from the Sementilli home. Prosecutors also said Baker's blood was found inside the Porsche. Just one minute after the black Porsche is captured, Monica and Fabio's daughter Isabella's vehicle was captured on a security camera as she is returning home. Isabella, who was 16 years old at the time, discovered her father's body and called 911. A few minutes later, Monica arrived back home. As detectives began investigating Fabio's murder, they said they discovered DNA at the crime scene that belonged to Baker. His DNA was in the database because he was a registered sex offender. According to prosecutors, Baker cut his left index finger when he killed Fabio and that's why his blood was at the scene. According to the indictment, Investigators also learned that in the year leading up to Fabio's murder, Baker made thousands of calls and texts to Monica. In February 2017, an LAPD detective went to visit Monica at her home. Prosecutors said that when the investigator asked Monica about Baker, she told them she wasn't sure of his last name. For the next few months, investigators said they surveilled Monica and Baker's secretive romance and said the relationship continued after Fabio's murder. According to the district attorney, the couple took two trips to Las Vegas and a trip to Myrtle Beach together. LAPD detectives said they came up with aplan to secretly record Monica and Bakerwhile they were together. On June 14, 2017, Monica and Baker were pulled over in her Mustang under the guise of a traffic stop and were told that the car they were driving might have been stolen. According to the prosecution, the officers then handcuffed Monica and Baker and put them in the back seat of a police car, which was wired for sound so that they could be recorded. The detectives who had been investigating Monica and Baker for months said they were listening to them from a van parked nearby. And that's when investigators said Monica was recorded telling Baker, \"Somebody must have talked. Somebody is doing this to us.\" The couple was then taken to the LAPD Van Nuys Station where they were placed in separate cells and questioned by detectives about the murder of Fabio. Later that day, investigators said they told Monica that Baker's blood was found at the crime scene. According to detectives, Monica explained why Baker's blood would be inside her home. She told them that she \"cracked\" Baker on the finger with a racquet and he bled all over the racquetball court, so she gave him a towel and then brought that bloody towel home with her. The prosecution presented its case to a grand jury in August 2017. They described Monica's actions on the day her husband was killed in detail and said she was establishing her alibi for the time of the murder. The prosecutors also presented evidence that six months before Fabio's murder, Monica communicated with a security camera company to upgrade the system at her home. The upgrade allowed her to remotely access her surveillance cameras from her cellphone. According to the prosecution, Monica forwarded the log in credentials and user manual for her security system to Robert Baker on the same day it was upgraded. In the months following Fabio's murder, prosecutors said that while Monica was posting on social media that she was grieving her husband's death, she was also secretly spending time with Baker. Friends of Monica and Baker's testified that they went out on double dates and saw affectionate behavior between the two. At the conclusion of the hearing, Monica and Baker were indicted by the grand jury for murder and conspiracy. On Aug. 31, 2017, both Monica Sementilli and Robert Baker pleaded \"not guilty\" to the murder of Fabio Sementilli. On Jan. 3, 2018, Monica's defense team filed a motion to set aside the indictment against her. Among their arguments, they stated that during the grand jury hearing, the prosecution presented evidence of Monica's character that was irrelevant. The defense said, \"the evidence presented against Ms. Sementilli establishes that she was a woman having an affair that she wished to keep secret. Any additional allegation that she wanted to have her husband murdered, or stood to benefit from his murder, or orchestrated his murder with Mr. Baker, was based on pure speculation.\" The defense also stated that the prosecution presented no communication between Baker and Monica that was evidence of an agreement to murder Fabio. The defense also took issue with the surveillance footage in the parking lot that the prosecutors claimed to see Baker getting into Monica's truck. They stated in their motion that \"... the video quality is so grainy, and the focal point so distant, so as to be borderline unwatchable,\" and you cannot see an individual leave Monica's truck. On July 7, 2023,Baker changed his pleafrom \"not guilty\" to \"no contest.\" At his sentencing hearing, the judge explained to him that a \"no contest\" plea is essentially the same as a \"guilty\" plea and asked if he understood to which Baker replied, \"Yes, sir.\" Baker was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Monica's attorneys had previously attempted to have her case severed from Baker's, which the judge denied. By pleading \"no contest,\" Baker created a significant change in court proceedings going forward. Now, Monica will be tried separately, without Baker, for the murder of her husband, Fabio. \"48 Hours\" went to seeRobert Baker in jail, and said Monica had nothing to do with the murder of Fabio and she never knew that he was Fabio's killer. Baker also told \"48 Hours\"  that he's no longer in touch with Monica and he has not decided if he will testify at her trial. Afer two days of deliberations, the 10-man, two-woman jury found Monica Sementilliguilty of murder. The 53-year-old faced charges of murder and conspiracy for masterminding the crime, with special circumstances of murder for financial gain and murder while lying in wait. Jurors found all the charges to be true. © 2024 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.",

    "title": "Convicted killer says his lover had no part in murder of her husband",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 11, 2025 / 7:01 PM EDT/ CBS News CASE UPDATE: On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementilli, the wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli,guilty of murderfor his 2017 death in which he was beaten and stabbed in their Los Angeles home. It's an awkward moment sitting down with a murderer especially when you arrive unannounced. Robert Baker, 61, who pleaded no contestlast summer to the 2017 Los Angeles murder of famed hairstylist and beauty industry executive Fabio Sementilli, 49, approached the glass that separated us with a \"who are you?\" look on his face. As a producer for \"48 Hours\" who has followed the case since 2017, I made the trip to Los Angeles' North County Correctional Facility on March 2 to see if Baker would be willing to share information about the brutal crime and, perhaps, his alleged accompliceMonica Sementilli, 52. Monica was the wife of victimFabio Sementilli, and she was Baker's lover before they both landed in jail, nearly five months after the crime, accused ofconspiracy to commit murder. Their case is profiled by \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller in\"The Monica Sementilli Affair,\"now streaming on Paramount+. Baker seemed healthy and younger looking than the bedraggled figure I remembered from court. He had the fit and muscular appearance one might expect from a racquetball coach at the LA Fitness where he met Monica Sementilli, a mother of two teenage daughters living in a nearby, upscale L.A. neighborhood. Once I introduced myself, it was Baker who offered the initial icebreaker to our conversation, expressing surprise at the effort I had taken to find him in that remote jail in the mountain town of Castaic. Getting there can be a one-hour drive from L.A., and visitors are only permitted on Saturdays and Sundays. There are two separate intake areas to pass through, which involves a bus ride – not to mention security, where a reporter must leave pens, recorders and phones behind. So, the effort had paid off, it got the conversation started, and earned me credibility for finding him. These meetings can be difficult. The main issue is we are being recorded and the cops and prosecutors who put Baker away and have plans to put his former lover away listen, and presumably can and will use anything he says against him – or her – if possible. Nevertheless, our conversation moved along.  Baker had an easy wide smile with a gap between his front teeth. The phone receivers we each used had short cords so that kept us face to face, staring straight into each other's eyes, from about 20 inches apart through safety glass. Despite his reluctance to address most issues, deferring answers to \"when this is all over\" (meaning the end of Monica's upcoming trial which starts April 2), he was resolute about one point: Monica was not involved in the murder, as she is charged. \"Monica did not know.  She didn't know s***.  If she did find out, I would have been in here (jail) a lot sooner,\" he said. His claim was a bombshell.  Monica, who has already spent nearly six years in jail, did not conspire with him to kill her husband Fabio, he said. Despite what the prosecutor characterizes as overwhelming circumstantial evidence against Monica, there is no smoking gun connecting her to the conspiracy.  A fact her attorneys are banking on for a not guilty verdict at trial. I asked about his decision to plead no contest despite not getting a deal and accepting the sentence of life without parole. With his blood and DNA at the crime scene, having cut his finger stabbing Fabio to death, Baker had little chance to beat the charges. But even if his chances at trial were one in a million, most people take that shot. \"Why not you?\" I asked him. He seemed resigned to his fate but explained \"due process\" was the reason. Much of our conversation shifted to facial expressions, as he was clearly reluctant to be recorded saying certain things. I found myself unconsciously following his lead —   and at that moment, I gave him an exaggerated \"What does that mean?\" face. \"You think there's due process?\" he responded to my look, as if I was the naivest person on earth to have faith in the criminal justice system that snared him.  The phrase due process would serve as his unsatisfying default answer for many substantive questions. I asked if his plea was \"a gift\" for Monica, which he immediately scoffed at, seemingly taking offense, as if going down for life could be a gift. I pointed out, what he knew well, that for more than five years Monica's attorneys had tried many times to sever the cases against the lovebirds into separate trials, but the judge denied them at each turn.  So, I noted when Baker pleaded no contest, voilà,thanks to his decision, Monica got what she had been asking for, to stand trial alone.  He remained dismissive. I asked if he had met Monica in a Target parking lot two miles from the Sementilli home in the hours before the murder, as the prosecutor alleged, presumably to get the 'coast is clear' message from Monica to attack and kill Fabio. That allegation prompted an eyes wide open, lips pursed, \"no way\" expression as he shook his head back and forth. It never happened, according to him. He complained about that and other prosecution evidence. The fact that he and Monica used the encrypted apps WhatsApp and Viber to communicate between themselves, or that Monica shared her family's home security system's private log-in credentials with him. So what? he asked. I pointed out that while millions of Americans did use encrypted apps and accessed home security systems remotely, an objective person, say, a juror, might well find it suspicious that the lovers shared those prior to Fabio's murder. Baker remained indignant that those facts could be used against him or Monica. What about his Facebook messages with a friend where Baker said, \"No not yet living with her [Monica] but it's coming soon.\"  Once again, Baker shrugged that off, \"just a conversation between friends.\" That explanation put the incredulous \"Huh?\" look on my face. \"Just a conversation between friends,\" he repeated with a shrug and a \"that's all\" expression. He just did not seem to get the prosecutor's point that a conversation between friends is precisely what was so revealing, and potentially incriminating  particularly because he murdered Fabio soon after. I turned the conversation to his sentencing hearing where numerous family members assailed him for taking away Fabio, a man so loved by two daughters, a son, two sisters and an immense family and circle of friends. \"Heartbreaking,\" he repeated a few times, \"heartbreaking.\" Baker had cried during the hearing, perhaps when Monica's daughters testified. What they may have seen as crocodile tears decidedly did not make an impression on the devastated family members and friends. I asked if that emotion at the hearing meant he wanted to apologize to Fabio's family. He offered nothing in reply just repeating, \"heartbreaking.\"  \"I'm not the monster,\" he said, his voice trailing off before I could hear a finished thought. At that point, I had to interject, explaining that I had seen the autopsy report. Fabio had been viciously stabbed seven times, three separate wounds each deemed fatal as vital arteries were targeted. A beloved father, brother, son, friend, ambushed and slaughtered without a chance to defend himself. \"I know, I know,\" he said, dropping his head without meeting my eyes. He said only very recently had he seen the crime scene photos of Fabio – the gore and violence of the murder juxtaposed with the backdrop: Fabio's chair, where his family remembers him smoking cigars, \"Big Daddy\" baseball cap on his head, conducting business, and enjoying life in his favorite domain - the back patio. It was Fabio's then 16-year-old daughter who would find his body – too heavy as deadweight for her to even turn him over. Earlier in our conversation, Baker conceded that he had recently been meeting with Monica's defense attorneys. Ostensibly, they are sizing Baker up for the possibility that he might testify at Monica's trial and drop that aforementioned bombshell on the jurors: that Monica was not involved, that she had no knowledge, that she never suspected her lover as the killer. Baker told me he does not know whether he will testify or not. I asked if he wanted to testify \"for her?\" For the second time, he took offense. \"I would not do it for her,\" he said. \"It would be to tell the truth.\" The idea that he might testify was heralded by her defense lawyers as a case closer. \"We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty plea and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband,\" said veteran L.A. criminal defense attorney Leonard Levine after Baker's sentencing. Legal experts that \"48 Hours\" spoke to were more circumspect. They acknowledged the power of that potential testimony. They also pointed out a jury might be skeptical after a withering cross-examination and an exploration of Baker's background. Baker's testimony represented a risky proposition, they reasoned — likely too risky. Background was a question Baker raised. I responded that I was aware of his acting experience in the industry — the porn industry. Baker nodded his approval at my research. It seemed odd, as if — like so many people that reporters deal with in Hollywood — Baker was asserting, 'I was an actor you know,'rather than displaying unease with the courtroom optics of pornography. Our time was limited, so I chose not to raise his criminal background, a conviction for having sex with a minor, his teenage stepdaughter, who would marry him after his release from prison in the 1990s and enter the pornography world, doing movies with Baker. It seemed to be a tangent. Rather, I wanted to discuss the prosecution's claim that Monica was leading a double life after Fabio's murder.  Prosecutors alleged she was expressing an outward appearance through social media that she was deeply in grief over the loss of her husband, while police simultaneously, surreptitiously documented a secretive, fun-filled romance with Baker — the killer. Baker chose not to shrug off this accusation, insisting that Monica's grief over Fabio's murder was intense and sincere. As validation, he offered that the two were no longer in contact and that she cursed him with her parting words, \"Murderer motherf*****,\" yelled across a hallway in lock up. He was alleging that once Monica learned Baker was the killer, she dropped him, but he did not say when. Another bombshell, the claim that their relationship was now over, as court documents had revealed 2017 love letters signed \"your wifey… Monica Baker 'til death,\" sent in jail. When a sheriff's deputy suddenly appeared, Baker turned and left, ending our interview abruptly. Outside I waited for my bus next to a sign that read \"Beware of Mountain Lions, Do Not Leave Children Unattended.\"  Relishing the fresh, crisp, mountain air, I reflected on a lively, yet guarded, conversation that yielded glimpses of candor whether intentional or inadvertent from a murderer. © 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Jail love affair reveals evidence of murder conspiracy, prosecutors say",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 11, 2025 / 7:01 PM EDT/ CBS News CASE UPDATE: On April 11, 2025, a jury found Monica Sementilli, the wife of famed hairdresser Fabio Sementilli,guilty of murderfor his 2017 death in which he was beaten and stabbed in their Los Angeles home. WhenMonica Sementilli and Robert Bakerwere arrested andaccused of a murder conspiracyto kill Monica's husband,Fabio Sementilli, 49, their love affair continued in jail according to documents revealed in a \"48 Hours\" investigation of the case. Prosecutors allege their ongoing love affair behind bars, including recordings made during police sting operations, represent further evidence of a committed murder conspiracy between the lovebirds. \"It kind of hurts to not be touched or f***** or licked or loved by you,\" Monica, now 52, writes in one four-page letter to her codefendant. Baker, now 61, is blunt, recorded addressing Sementilli in lockup months after their arrest, \"I love you baby. I really do.\" On June 14, 2017, Baker and Monica were arrested and ultimately indicted for Fabio's murder and conspiracy to commit murder.Baker pleaded no contestin July 2023, accepting a life sentence without parole. Monica will stand trial alone in April; she has pleaded not guilty. Their case is profiled by \"48 Hours\" contributor Michelle Miller in\"The Monica Sementilli Affair\"now streaming on Paramount+. On the day of their arrest, according to a recording released by police, Monica tells a cellmate how much Baker means to her: \"He's not just my lover, he's my confidant, he's my everything.\" Police engaged in an elaborate series of sting operations to continue to investigate the alleged conspiracy between the defendants even while they were held in custody, \"48 Hours\" has discovered. Police alternately used standard and creative means to intercept or record the defendants' interactions and statements, all of which is being offered as evidence of conspiracy in Monica's upcoming trial. For instance, \"48 Hours\" has confirmed that the cellmate to whom Monica spoke when she was first detained was an undercover police officer posing as an inmate to catch Monica speaking candidly on surreptitious recordings. Police call these types of jailhouse setups where officers pose as inmates inside jail Perkins Operations, referring to the case law which guides how these in-jail, sting operations are conducted. In the course of our investigation, \"48 Hours\" has learned that police went to even greater lengths than using undercover officers inside cells to ensnare Monica and Baker. As the two defendants were brought to courtrooms for their initial pre-trial hearings, detectives made arrangements for them to be held in adjoining cells prior to the hearings. Waiting in nearby cells to be brought into the courtroom, Monica and Baker had an opportunity to speak directly to each other. On six different occasions, first at the Van Nuys Courthouse and then at the downtown Los Angeles criminal courthouse, interactions between Monica and Baker were recorded. Beyond the sting operations, detectives also intercepted jail letters, referred to by inmates as \"kites,\" and listened to recorded jail phone calls to establish facts about the enduring love affair between Monica and Baker. \"48 Hours\" has obtained copies of three different jail love letters written from Monica to Baker which we have learned police intercepted while Monica intended to pass them to Baker in courthouse holding cells. \"48 Hours\" has learned that the detectives discovered the letters in holding cells while Monica and Baker attended the hearings. The detectives hastily made copies before carefully returning them for the inmates to retrieve after the hearings so that the defendants were unaware the love letters had been intercepted and copied. Meanwhile, Monica's defense has repeatedly argued, \"the sexual and romantic details of their affair were simply irrelevant to the question whether they conspired to murder Fabio Sementilli.\" According to prosecutors the information gleaned from these operations establishes that the ongoing jailhouse love affair is further evidence of the murder conspiracy between the accused. \"In essence, the defendants have promised one another that neither will cooperate with law enforcement or testify against the other to save themselves. Rather, they have promised one another that neither will cooperate with law enforcement or testify against the other to save themselves,\" wrote Deputy District Attorney Beth Silverman. The unusual situation where the two inmates could speak to each other while detained was designed by law enforcement purposely to record conversations between the unwitting defendants. According to a 2021 motion filed by the prosecutor, the recordings and intercepted love letters are evidence of an ongoing \"secrecy pact\" between the accused. \"The defendants often communicated with one another using cryptic language, phrases and codes created in order to secretly communicate without law enforcement's knowledge,\" including, \"the phrases, 'OMM,' '9pm,' 'LOML,' and '100,'\" according to a prosecution filing. Prosecutors allege these coded phrases establish the defendants' love and commitment not only to each other, but also the \"conspiracy\" and \"secrecy pact\" between them. \"OMM,\" they allege, means \"On My Mind,\" while they say \"9pm\" is a reference to a secretive plan to break jail rules and set timing for a phone call where a third party will connect the two to speak directly. The prosecutors contend \"LOML\" is an \"acronym meaning 'Love of My Life' and '100' indicates their 100% commitment to one another.\" According to prosecutors, another significant phrase is the one written at the end of one of Monica's love letters, \"R or D,\" an alleged abbreviation for the phrase \"Ride or Die.\" Detectives found a drawing \"depicting a couple embracing one another wearing only underwear and ski masks while holding guns\" in Baker's cellphone \"entitled 'Ride or Die.'\" There is a statement above the drawing, \"A relationship where you both love, protect and spoil each other is the best.\" \"The phrase 'Ride or Die' was frequently used between the defendants as an expression of their commitment to one another and their secrecy pact. On several occasions defendants expressed that they would remain loyal to one another, and never 'talk' to law enforcement about their conspiracy; in their words, they would 'Ride or Die' for one another,\" the 2021 filing asserts. The two lovers took advantage of six rendezvous engineered by detectives, according to motions filed in court. Monica and Baker were recorded \"talking to one another and engaging in masturbation and other sex games,\" wrote the prosecutor. The judge has ruled the alleged sex games portions of these recordings will not be admissible. Nevertheless, these encounters purportedly reveal the passionate nature of their continuing relationship in jail. Baker confirmed the sex games during an exclusive jailhouse interview with \"48 Hours\" on March 2. That's what happens when you are stuck in here, he said, gesturing to the jail side of the glass from where he talked to a reporter over a phone. Once those encounters stopped, the jailhouse co-defendants and lovebirds found ways to break the rules and remain in contact, according to prosecutors. In that 2021 filing, prosecutors said \"over the course of the last four years, the defendants made hundreds of calls through third parties … This allows them to speak to one another.\" These phone recordings have been shared with the defense as discovery but have not been made public. In excerpts reviewed by \"48 Hours\" from two of the six recorded encounters, there is talk of marriage, and in her letters, Monica consistently refers to herself as \"Mrs. Baker,\" \"Monica Baker\" and \"your wifey.\" \"MB\" is a code prosecutors allege is an abbreviation of Monica Baker. \"The defendants have continued to refer to one another as husband and wife while in custody for murdering Sementilli's legitimate husband,\" wrote the prosecutor, who cites this as dedication, not only to each other, but also to their murder conspiracy. Before the grand jury, prosecutor Silverman argued that the lovers' commitment motivated the conspiracy, saying they were \"plotting to kill [Fabio] in order to collect his substantial life insurance monies and be able to live hopefully happily ever after.\" Monica's attorneys have repeatedly challenged the evidence of a love affair as irrelevant to proving evidence of a murder conspiracy. There is no doubt, however, that Monica and Baker's  commitment to their affair endured at least during the early months in jail, even for years according to the prosecutor. \"We will get married … You are the perfect wife for me. Beyond belief. My mind is like, I'm delirious,\" Baker says to Monica in a lockup recording. Similarly, she gushes to her lover as she ends a three-page-long letter, or \"kite,\" intercepted on Aug. 6, 2017, with \"Love your wifey… Monica Baker 'til death. R or D\" \"48 Hours\" has identified one comment relating to this alleged jailhouse marriage talk that may indicate a separate issue at play in the murder conspiracy allegations. During the grand jury hearings, prosecutor Silverman argued divorce was not an option for Monica, so the couple instead turned to murder. \"She's from an Italian family, which means Catholic. They don't believe in divorce, her family won't, it won't be easy for them to take it … So again this provides a motive,\" said Silverman. Monica's defense attorneys have challenged this testimony as flimsy and misinterpreted, insisting the prosecutor has not established that divorce troubled Monica. However, in one of the recorded conversations between Baker and Monica on Aug. 31, 2017, which police refer to as \"lockup overhears,\" Baker seems to make a stunning admission regarding Monica while they discuss their desire to get married. \"So, when you gonna tell them … when you … when you gonna tell them … how we gonna tell 'em we're gonna get married? How we gonna do this? Then you'll really be officially disowned for loving somebody,\" Baker says in a seeming reference to Monica getting disowned for their relationship. Monica responds, \"I don't know … I think we may need to wait … until the trial, and see what happens with that.\" Baker then says, \"I'm not the one that has the, difficulty you do.\" The transcript made public in the prosecutor's motion is only an incomplete excerpt of the conversation. Nevertheless, this portion of the jailhouse exchange recorded by the Los Angeles Police Department seems to establish that Monica being \"disowned\" over her love for Baker may have been an issue for the lovers. Furthermore, Baker seems to confirm it as a \"difficulty\" for Monica. It is a tantalizing piece of a conversation, raising a significant issue that will almost certainly come into play during her trial. Monica's defense attorneys \"are not commenting on any evidence until it is presented at trial,\" said veteran L.A. criminal defense attorney Leonard Levine. Although it is unclear if the two defendants remain in contact today, after six years of incarceration, evidence appears to demonstrate the stunning revelation they remained dedicated to a relationship in the months after their arrest, perhaps extending for years. These love letters, sex games and promises seem to have continued even after Monica learned that evidence implicated Baker as her husband's killer. In anexclusive jailhouse interview with \"48 Hours,\"Baker claimed that now the two are prevented from contacting each other.  He said, the last time they spoke, in a random encounter passing each other in lockup, she cursed him as a murderer. He did not indicate when this exchange occurred. Calling Baker a murderer would represent a significant turn in Monica's attitude, as evidenced through August 2017 in the jail letters and recordings. In his interview with \"48 Hours,\" Baker claimed that Monica took no part in a murder conspiracy and that he acted without her knowledge. Prosecutors dismiss the idea that Monica was not involved, detailing 56 overt acts which they argue constitute the conspiracy between the two lovers to murder the celebrity hairstylist turned beauty industry executive. Monica's defense attorneys intend to call Baker as a witness during Monica's trial. \"We are confident that Robert Baker's guilty plea and his truthful testimony will finally establish once and for all that Monica Sementilli had nothing to do with the planning or the murder of Fabio Sementilli, her husband,\" said Levine after Baker's sentencing. Whether or not Monica Sementilli's love affair with killer Robert Baker constitutes evidence of a criminal conspiracy or simply passionate infidelity will be at the heart of Fabio's wife's trial for his murder. Prosecutors plan to enter details of that love affair dating as far back as one year before the crime, continuing after Fabio's murder, and as revealed by \"48 Hours\"' investigation, even while the two were locked up awaiting trial. Greg Fisher is a development producer for \"48 Hours.\" He has covered the Fabio Sementilli case since 2017. © 2024 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved. Copyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Here’s a look at the biggest legal developments of the last week: In a ruling Monday, the Supreme Courtthrew out a judge’s nationwide decisiontemporarily blocking the removal of people alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gangTren de Araguaunder the Alien Enemies Act. Trump and his allies had complained bitterly about U.S. District Judge James Boasberg'stemporary restraining order last monthbarring deportations under the rarely used wartime law, even going as far as suggesting the judgeshould be impeached. Boasberg had issued the order after the lawyers for the plaintiffs in the case had argued some of those being sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador weren't gang members at all, and were being whisked away without any due process. The Supreme Court's5-4 rulingsaid legal challenges should be heard in the districts where the individual detainees are being held, an argument the government had made, but also said that the detainees must be given due process moving forward. “AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,” the court wrote in its unsignedmajority opinion. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said her colleagues shouldn't have blocked Boasberg's order and should not reward the administration for having disregarded the initial deportees' due process rights. \"The Government’s conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this Court now rewards the Government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a Nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" she wrote. The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the administration to \"facilitate\" the return ofKilmar Abrego Garcia, who the Justice Department has acknowledged was mistakenly sent to the El Salvador prison on March 15. \"The United States acknowledges that Abrego Garcia was subject to a withholding order forbidding his removal to El Salvador, and that the removal to El Salvador was therefore illegal,\" the ruling said. Despite the government's acknowledgement, it has not disclosed any efforts to return him to the U.S. or to move him to another country, maintaining he was out of its control now that he's in El Salvador. The administration has alleged that Garcia, who grew up in El Salvador, is a member of the gang MS-13, an allegation his attorneys have denied. They’ve also noted that he has no criminal record in the U.S. or El Salvador. U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis last week ordered Garcia to bereturned to the U.S.by Monday night — a decision that the high court paused while it reviewed the case. At a hearing before Xinis on Friday, a lawyer for the Justice Department said he had no information about what efforts the administration had made to get Garcia back, and no information about his current whereabouts. \"This is extremely troubling,\" the judge said. She ordered the government to give her daily updates. The attorney for the Justice Department, Drew Ensign, said he anticipated having some answers for her by April 15. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court halted afederal judge’s rulingrequiring several federal agencies to reinstate around 16,000 probationary workers the Trump administration had sought to fire. William Alsup, a federal judge in California,last month orderedthe administration to reinstate the probationary workers — generally employees with less than two years on the job or workers who were recently promoted to new positions. Alsup found the administration hadn't followed proper procedures for mass layoffs and had falsely claimed the workers were canned due to performance issues. “It is sad, a sad day when our government would fire some good employee, and say it was based on performance, when they know good and well, that’s a lie,” Alsup said, calling the move “a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.” The Supreme Court, however, found Alsup's ruling lacked the proper legal footing. \"The District Court’s injunction was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations’ standing,\" the ruling said. The decision said other claims in the case can move forward, but paused Alsup's order reinstating the workers until the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals fully hears and weighs in on the issue. On Wednesday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals halted a similar but broader order in a Maryland case where the government had been directed torehire around 24,000probationary workers. “The Government is likely to succeed in showing the district court lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims,”the 2-1 rulingby the appeals court said, staying an order last month that the workers be rehired at least temporarily. The panel said it was pausing U.S. District Judge James Bredar's ruling until it decides the government’s full appeal. Bredar had ordered the employees to be reinstated after finding \"the government conducted massive layoffs, but it gave no advanced notice. It claims it wasn’t required to because, it says, it dismissed each one of these thousands of probationary employees for ‘performance’ or other individualized reasons. On the record before the Court, this isn’t true.” This week, the Supreme Court also temporarilyblocked two other federal employeesfrom being rehired — whether that decision stands could have widespread implications. Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday issued an administrative stay — essentially a temporary pause — of orders reinstating Gwynne Wilcox, a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board. Trump fired Wilcox and Harris, both Biden appointees serving multiyear terms, during the first weeks of his second term. Both officials challenged their removals by pointing to laws that essentially say they can only be fired for malfeasance or neglect of duty. Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in court papers that Trump has the power to fire them regardless. Both Wilcox and Harris are involved in independent agencies that hear disputes over fired workers. Legal experts have said that if their firings are upheld, it could pave the way for Trump to seek to firemembers of the Federal Reserve, which traditionally operates independently of the White House. The court will decide what next steps to take in the case after hearing from lawyers for the two ousted officials, Roberts order said.",

    "title": "Federal judge refuses to block immigration enforcement operations in houses of worship",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday refused to block immigration agents from conducting enforcement operations at houses of worship in a lawsuit filed by religious groups over a new policy adopted by the Trump administration. U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich in Washington handed down the ruling in a lawsuit filed by more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups representing millions of Americans. The judge found that there have been only a handful of such enforcement actions and the faiths had not shown the kind of legal harm that would justify a preliminary injunction. “At least at this juncture and on this record, the plaintiffs have not made the requisite showing of a ‘credible threat’ of enforcement,” wrote Friedrich, who was appointed by President Donald Trump during his first term. “Nor does the present record show that places of worship are being singled out as special targets.” On Jan. 20, his first day back in office, Trump’s Republican administration rescinded a Department of Homeland Security policy limiting where migrant arrests could happen. Its new policy said field agents using “common sense” and “discretion” can conduct immigration enforcement operations at houses of worship without a supervisor’s approval. Plaintiffs’ attorneys claimed the new Homeland Security directive departs from the government’s 30-year-old policy against staging immigration enforcement operations in “protected areas” or “sensitive locations.” In February, a federal judge in Maryland ruled against the Trump administration in a similar case brought by a coalition of Quakers and other religious groups. U.S. District Judge Theodore Chang’s order in that case was limited to those plaintiffs. A judge in Colorado sided with the administration in another lawsuit over the reversal of a similar policy that had limited immigration arrests at schools.",

    "article_text": "A New Jersey mayor lashed out Friday at Jon Bon Jovi's charitable, \"pay it forward\" restaurant, claiming the eatery is attracting a problematic number of unhoused people to the town of Toms River. Mayor Dan Rodrick claims that Bon Jovi's popup restaurant,  JBJ Soul Kitchen which operates out of an Ocean County library, is nothing more than a \"soup kitchen\" that's within walking distance of a school. \"We appreciate that Bon Jovi wants to feed people that are needy,\" Rodrick told NBC News. \"But the public library down a block from a school is not the appropriate place to bus homeless in from all over the state of New Jersey and other states.\" Through the Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation, the\"Livin' on a Prayer\"singerand wife Dorothearun JBJ Soul Kitchen, a nonprofit community restaurant where patrons pay a \"suggested donation.\" \"There are no prices on our menu,\" according to therestaurant's website. \"Instead, we offer a suggested donation to our paying customers and we ask that you Pay it Forward to cover the cost of those who are unable to pay for their meals.\" It has permanent locations in Red Bank, Toms River, Newark and Jersey City and this recently opened pop-up Toms River location. That temporary spot opened doors in February on Washington Street. \"It is not a restaurant,\" Rodrick said. \"It is a soup kitchen that they put there for the homeless that they're bussing in.\" A rep for the famed Garden State rocker could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday. An attorney representing the Ocean County Library Commission said the JBJ pop-up has a lease that goes to May 23. But the lawyer didn't immediately address the mayor's assertion that unhoused people coming to that location are taxing town resources. \"They're (patrons at the pop-up) not from Toms River and Toms River should not have to bear the brunt of homelessness for the entire county of Ocean, especially when not a single one of these folks are from Toms River,\" Rodrick said. While the town has no immediate options to have the eatery shuttered, Rodrick said his legal team is weighing lawsuits that could eventually lead to its closure. The Ocean County community of about 99,000 residents has a medianhousehold income of a little less than $95,000and is probably best known for its youth baseball.

Hello from 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York. Diddy’s criminal trial is set to begin with jury selection in 24 days, when this newsletter will move downtown to a federal courtroom in the Southern District of New York. If you have any questions or requests, drop us a line atdiddyontrial@nbcuni.com. In today’s edition ofDiddy on Trial, I survey the now-disgraced music mogul’s 30-year career and vast cultural influence — a legacy tarnished by the allegations against him, which he has long denied. Plus,Chloe Melasgives us a window into the hip-hop mogul’s state of mind. But first, here’s a look at some developments in the trial. Was this newsletter forwarded to you?Sign up here. By Chloe Melas If convicted of the racketeering charge, Diddy could face up to life in prison. As the trial bears down on him, the gravity of the situation is setting in, those close to him say. “He’s trying to remain hopeful but the realization that he could spend the rest of his life behind bars has really hit him.” Another source told me Diddy misses his family. “He really misses his kids. They visit him every week,” the source said. By Daniel Arkin The world of hip-hop is filled with self-styled moguls and tastemakers. But there was a time when one man lorded over all the rest — Sean “Diddy” Combs. In the 1990s and 2000s, few personalities swaggered through the music industry quite like Diddy. In his decades in the public eye, Diddy established himself as a multihyphenate cultural force, building an empire that has now come crashing down amid allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct. Diddy founded the era-definingBad Boy Recordsin 1993 and cultivated the talents ofMary J. Blige,Usherand theNotorious B.I.G. He was their producer and one-man hype machine. In the recording studio, Diddy seamlessly blended rap lyrics with catchy R&B samples, creating a new stylistic template for a generation of artists. He then pivoted to performing in his own right, pumping out popular tracks such as “I’ll Be Missing You,” “Bump, Bump, Bump” and “Shake Ya Tailfeather.” He topped the Billboard charts, racked up 14 career Grammy nominations, and earned a reputation as a savvy hitmaker. Diddy, driven by keen commercial instincts, helped push hip-hop firmly into the American mainstream. Diddy was not content with simply conquering entertainment. He cemented himself as a global lifestyle brand, launching ventures almost as often as he changed his stage name. He spearheaded the successful clothing label Sean John in 1998. He became “brand ambassador” for the liquor company Cîroc. He presided over annual “White Parties” in the Hamptons. He elevated trendy streetwear into symbols of aspirational luxury. “He was an absolute curator of Black taste,” saidGerrick Kennedy, a freelance cultural critic who has covered Diddy for years. “He had his finger on the pulse.” Diddy was no stranger to allegations of violence, too. In the decades before he became the focal point of a sweeping federal investigation, he faced legal action or settlement payments more than four dozen times, according to court documentsreviewed by NBC News. Yet, through it all, he remained one of hip-hop’s pre-eminent kingmakers — wealthy, powerful and feared. But that’s all changed. Diddy is now just another inmate at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, where he is awaiting the start of his trial. The allegations and charges against him have become inextricable parts of his public legacy. No matter the outcome of the trial, Diddy’s time at the pinnacle of his profession is all but over.",

    "title": "Judge allows Menendez brothers' resentencing effort to move forward",
    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — A Southern California judge on Friday cleared the way for a legal process to determine ifErik and Lyle Menendez should be resentencedfor the 1989 shotgun murders of their parents. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Michael Jesic denied a motionfrom the district attorney’s office that sought to withdrawhis predecessor’s recommendation to reduce the brothers’ prison sentences from life without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life. A hearing on the matter is scheduled for April 17 and 18. If Jesic approves the recommendation, the brothers — who have served 35 years for the murders of Jose and Kitty Menendez at their Beverly Hills home on Aug. 20, 1989 — could be eligible for parole immediately. Friday's ruling came after a lengthy and at times heated hearing that saw a deputy district attorney and a defense lawyer arguing over the resentencing effort and a sometimes-exasperated judge who, at one point, said he would “cry a little” if the hearing did not finish Friday. \"You both have strong arguments,” Jesic said, before noting that he believes those arguments are best saved for next week's hearing. Wearing blue prison uniforms, the siblings appeared at Friday’s hearing via video link from the San Diego prison where they are incarcerated. During the hearing, a prosecutor with the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office recountedthe “severity” of the killings— at one point he showed crime scene photos — and echoed comments previously made by top prosecutor Nathan Hochman, who said last monththat he was withdrawing his predecessor’s recommendationto reduce the brothers’ prison sentences. Hochman has said that Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are now 54 and 57, respectively, should not be resentenced because they have not exhibited full insight into the murders or taken complete responsibility for their crimes. The DA stood by his decision after the judge’s ruling Friday evening. “These murders were calculated, premeditated, cold-blooded killings. Our position remains clear: Until the Menendez brothers finally come clean with all their lies of self-defense and suborning and attempting to suborn perjury, they are not rehabilitated and pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” Hochman said in a statement. In a court filing, prosecutors cited more than a dozen alleged lies they said the brothers have not acknowledged about the killings, including that they were defending themselves against an abusive father when they fatally shot their parents. In a separate filing, defense attorneys countered that Hochman’s statements were “patently meritless” and said that the previous DA, George Gascón, considered and rejected them. During Friday's hearing, deputy district attorney Habib Balian said that three decades after the murder, the brothers are \"still telling the same lies they were back then.\" He also suggested Gascón's decision last year to recommend the reduced sentence was intended to help boost his faltering reelection campaign. Gascón, who was voted out in November,has denied this and saidhe made the decision because the brothers have been “exceptional” prisoners and “poster cases” for the DA's resentencing unit. Jesic and defense attorney Mark Geragos appeared frustrated at times with the length of Balian's presentation, though the judge said he would allow both sides to continue and \"flesh it out.\" Geragos criticized the prosecution for failing to mention anything the brothers had done while incarcerated — they've helped inmates with severe disabilities, attended college and established a green space \"beautification\" project — and called them \"remarkable human beings.\" \"They didn’t do anything but put their nose down and do the hard work,\" he said. Geragos said it was “outrageous” that prosecutors had shown the crime scene images with Menendez family members in the courtroom and said \"victims are being re-traumatized all for political purposes.\" In his ruling Friday, Jesic said that the resentencing decisions made by Hochman and Gascón did not appear political. The siblings were convicted of first-degree murder after two trials in the 1990s. They said they fatally shot their parents after Lyle confronted their father about alleged ongoing abuse of Erik and threatened to expose the entertainment company executive. Lyle has said his father responded with what he viewed as a threat. Prosecutors have previously disputed the brothers’ abuse claims, calling them false and sayingthe killings were cold-blooded and financially motivated. The Menendez brothers have also sought their freedom through two other legal pathways — a request for clemency from California Gov. Gavin Newsom and a petition challenging their convictions. In February, Newsomdirected the state’s parole board to conduct a “risk assessment”looking at whether the brothers would pose an unreasonable public safety risk if released. That review is expected to finish in June. The petition, filed in May 2023, includes what the brothers’ lawyers have described as a critical piece of evidence confirming that Jose Menendez was sexually molesting Erik in the months before he was killed. Hochman has said that evidence — an undated photocopy of a letter that Erik has said he sent to a cousin in December 1988 — does not meet the standard required for a judge to order a new trial.",

    "title": "Dominican families plead for remains of relatives killed in roof collapse amid autopsy backlogs",
    "article_text": "SANTO DOMINGO — Identifying and conducting autopsies for the 225 people killed in theJet Set nightclub's roof collapsefour days ago has been a task so daunting it overwhelmed the country's morgue. Heartbroken families hoping to receive the remains of their loved ones have been waiting outside the Dominican Republic's institute of pathology for days, begging authorities torelease the bodiesso they can start to mourn their relatives. Róger de la Rosa, who flew from the United States after finding out on Wednesday that his sister, Rosie de la Rosa Ortega, was one of the fatal victims, wasdesperately demanding answers from forensic officialson Friday morning. He questioned the need for the autopsies. “No one has faced me,” de la Rosa said in Spanish. “No one has the courage to look me in the eyes.” Others like Ana Julia Mejía, who was waiting to receive her mother’s remains, had the same question. \"We don't want an autopsy because we know what they died of. We just want them to give them to us, so we can hold a wake,\"Mejía told Noticias Telemundo. Public Health MinisterVictor Atallah updatedthedeath toll from 221to 225when speaking toNoticias Telemundoearly Friday afternoon. Government officials have said the autopsies help determine if the person died instantly, as a result of their injuries or by asphyxia due to the debris. Also, they said, the autopsies will likely serve as \"important evidence\" in the ongoing investigation into what caused the collapse. As of late Thursday night, forensic officials had completed130 autopsies, according to the national attorney general’s office. Antoliano Peralta, a legal consultant to the Dominican Republic’s executive branch, admitted in an interview withNoticias Telemundothat the tragedy's death toll was so big it \"exceeds the forensic institute's capacity.\" Thesmell of the corpses inside the morguecould even be felt outside the building, reaching the families who were outside waiting for answers,Noticias Telemundo reported. No nation in the world is equipped to conduct hundreds of autopsies in one day, according to Atallah, the public health minister. Still, authorities assured they're doing everything they can to speed up the process. The attorney general’s office said ina statementthe government has \"strengthened our forensic medical team with the goal of completing all autopsies\" by Friday. Of the autopsies conducted as of Friday morning, over 80% of the victims died of head trauma caused by the impact of the crumbling ceiling, Atallah said. \"That means that they either died instantly or very quickly.\" In addition to the hundreds of bodies, rescue crews recovered 189 survivors from the rubble. Cristobal Moya was among those who survived. Speaking to NBC News from his hospital bedThursday afternoon, Moya said he survived \"thanks to God.\" He recalled sitting down to watch renowned merengue singer Rubby Pérez perform on stage when what appeared to be heavy dust began to fall from above. \"In a minute, the roof caved in. Something hit my head. I lost consciousness,\" Moya said in Spanish. \"When I woke up, I was trapped in the rubble.\" He thought for a second, \"Was I dreaming? No, I wasn’t.\" Videofrom the people who rescued Moya shows him laying face down, his head covered in blood and his body buried in the debris. Moya sustained injuries in his head, torso and legs. \"God gave me an opportunity,\" Moya said. \"A new opportunity at life.\" Videos from inside the Jet Set nightclub minutes before disaster struck show what is now Pérez's last concert. Before the roof collapse killed him, Pérez was entertaining the crowd with his powerful voice and energetic dance moves. The videos were filmed by Isaac González, the nightclub’s official photographer. He was there to capture what was supposed to be a celebratory event starring one of the biggest music stars of the Dominican Republic. But instead, he ended the night documenting one of thecountry’s deadliest events. González said the roof collapsed when he stepped outside the venue for five minutes to take a break. He was one of the first to film the club's devastation and the emergency response. His videos also show first responders arriving at the scene, later placing body bag after body bag into ambulances. Funeral servicesand burialsfor all the victims continue to take place this week. Among the people who died are Nelsy Cruz, the governor of Montecristi province,former MLB players Octavio DotelandTony Cabrera,Dominican fashion designer Martín Polancoand employees of Grupo Popular — one of the country’s largest banking companies — and the nation's Medical ColonelDr. José Ovidio Maldonado Reyes.

    "article_text": "Three people onboard a small plane died after it crashed Friday morning near the Boca Raton Airport in Florida. One person on the ground sustained non-life-threatening injuries, Michael LaSalle, the Boca Raton Fire Rescue Assistant Chief, said at a news conference. The plane's pilot reported rudder issues shortly before the crash, a source with knowledge of the situation told NBC News. The Cessna 310 aircraft left the Boca Raton Airport when it went down around 10:20 a.m. ET. It was headed to Tallahassee International Airport. Freshman flight school student Jared Scarpato said he went outside with his instructor and saw that the plane was flying \"too fast and too low.\" \"I said out loud, you know, he’s too low. And you know, what’s going through my mind is ... once he goes out of sight, you know that’s just really ... devastating,\" Scarpato said. The plane seemed to circle in the air before turning back toward the airport in Boca Raton,NBC South Floridareported. Witnesses who work in the area reported seeing the aircraft flying low and then felt the building shake. The plane burst into flames after it crashed, according to the news station. It's believed the person injured drove through a fireball and crashed into a tree, LaSalle said. Video showed debris scattered across a roadway and on train tracks, the station reported. What appeared to be two bodies could be seen in the debris as well as a damaged vehicle, NBC South Florida reported. Police said in apost on Xjust before 11 a.m. that the area of Military Trail and Glades Road was closed due to the crash. The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. \"On behalf of the city, we express our heartbreak at this tragic loss of life,\" Mayor Scott Singer said at the news conference. The Boca Raton airport briefly closed following the crash. This is a developing story. Please check back for updates.",

    "title": "What aviation experts say about the doomed helicopter in the fatal New York crash",
    "article_text": "The pilot of the tourist helicopter that crashed into the Hudson River on Thursday afternoon could not have done anything to save himself or his five passengers after the aircraft’s rotor blades and its tail boom detached in the air, an aviation expert said Friday. “Everything we train for as helicopter pilots is under the assumption that the rotor system is still attached to the aircraft,” said Brandt Anderson, a former U.S. Army combat helicopter pilot who is now a policy adviser. “Once that’s separated, there’s no wings, there’s no ability to glide — it’s just falling out of the sky at that point.” “It’s absolutely horrible,” he added. An official from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said at a news conference Friday that she would not speculate as to a preliminary cause when asked whether the agency had identified one, emphasizing instead that investigators were still searching for components of and structures from the aircraft, interviewing witnesses and obtaining records, including of the operator of the helicopter, New York Helicopters, and its owner. “We don’t rule anything out,” said Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the NTSB. “We take a very detailed and comprehensive view and it’s way too early in the investigation.” The Bell 206 sightseeing helicopter departed a downtown Manhattan heliport at 2:59 p.m. and the ride lasted less than 20 minutes. Eyewitness video showed the rotors and the fuselage separating in midair before the helicopter plummeted from the sky, crashing upside-down into the Hudson River near Jersey City, New Jersey. The crash killed Agustín Escobar, the chief executive for rail infrastructure for the German technology company Siemens, his wife, Merce Camprubi Montal, and their three children, as well as the pilot, Sean Johnson. Divers were still searching for the helicopter’s main rotor, main transmission and its roof and tail structures on Friday, Homendy said. Robert Joslin, a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona, Florida, said that when investigators examine the wreckage, they will look at whether there were any structural or impact failures that made the tail rotor come off. “Once the tail rotor comes off, I mean, this isn’t speculation, it’s just like a seesaw,” he said. “Once that tail boom was separated from the rest of the helicopter, then you could see it tumbling.” Joslin previously served as the Federal Aviation Administration’s  chief scientific and technical advisor for flight deck technology and was a flight test pilot with the agency. He was also a colonel in the U.S. Marine Corps and a military test pilot. He said investigators will also probe the aircraft’s maintenance records to see whether there were any issues in its history. Anderson, the former U.S. Army combat helicopter pilot, and John Cox, a pilot and the president and CEO of Safety Operating Systems LLC, said a fatal crash like this one is very rare. “There are instances where the Bell 206, in particular, can be put into stress by flying it aggressively,” Anderson said. “But based on what we know now, I don’t think that is the case here — and that makes it even more concerning. It makes the structural failure even more alarming.” At the news conference Friday, Homendy urged anyone with photos or videos that they believe could aid investigators to send them to the NTSB. Homendy said the videos circulating on social media have been “very helpful” to investigators, but that many of them had been filmed from a far distance and would require further review at the agency’s headquarters. “We’re hoping to get some additional videos that provide us information,” she said. “We don’t know what people have recorded or taken pictures of that could be helpful in an investigation.” She said the NTSB has found that to be the case in past investigations, such as the Ketchikan, Alaska, midair collision in 2019, where photos from a passenger aboard one of the airplanes helped the agency significantly in its investigation. While it remains unclear how the helicopter broke apart, Joslin said that the primary way that a motor blade would detach is through a “mast bump,” which occurs when excessive flapping of the rotor blades causes the hub to contact the rotor mast. “It is one of the hazards that is highlighted in teetering rotor helicopters,” Joslin said.",

    "title": "A wild week of tariff swings leaves consumers and Wall Street on edge",
    "article_text": "Tariffs were on,then they were off. At leasttemporarily, and only some of them— but not for China, which got hit with steeper duties and promptlyhit back. Wall Street reeled, then rebounded to its strongest weekly gain in well over a year. The past week has seen a head-spinning series of U.S. trade policy changes that economists, investors and ordinary consumers increasingly worry will drive up inflation or even trigger a recession. “The economy is facing considerable turbulence,” JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimonsaid Friday, when the bank reported strong earnings while warning of pitfalls ahead. Both JPMorgan — which sees 50-50 odds of a recession this year — and Morgan Stanleysaw revenues jump from stock trading activityas investors raced to adjust their holdings in the face of growing uncertainty. The major U.S. stock indexes ended on a high Friday after a volatile week of massive losses and gains. The eleventh-hour rebound came after White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt signaled that President Donald Trump is “optimistic” for a trade deal with China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 4.9% on the week, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished up 7.3%. The S&P 500 had its best week since November 2023, ending up 5.7%. That broad-based index was still down 5.5% since April 1, the day before Trump unveiled asweeping slate of fresh tariffs. While much of those new import taxes have beenreduced for a few months, market watchers and finance executives say major economic headwinds remain. “Timely resolution which benefits the U.S. would be good for businesses, consumers and the markets,” Wells Fargo told investors Friday about the global trade tensions. In the meantime, “we expect continued volatility and uncertainty and are prepared for a slower economic environment in 2025,” the bank said. Larry Fink, CEO of the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock,told CNBC on Fridaythat he thinks the U.S. economy is “very close, if not in, a recession now.” (An official determination on that frontcan only be madeby a panel of experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research, usually months after the fact.) Consumer sentiment, meanwhile,plunged 11% since last month, according to a reading Friday by the University of Michigan, the measure’s fourth straight month of declines. “Consumers report multiple warning signs that raise the risk of recession: expectations for business conditions, personal finances, incomes, inflation, and labor markets all continued to deteriorate this month,” the researchers wrote. The survey was conducted beforeTrump changed his mindon the tariffs he’d unveiled just a week earlier, covering nearly 90 countries. He said he came to the decision because more than 75 of them didn’t retaliate and reached out to negotiate. The temporary policy rollback, however, doesn’t apply to China. After Trump announced he was hiking tariffs on the country to 145%,Beijing retaliated Fridaywith 125% duties on U.S. goods. Investors say they aren’t sure exactly how the global trade picture will shake out. Morgan Stanley said in a note Friday that Trump’s 90-day reprieve “merely extends policy uncertainty” and leaves effective tariff rates at century-long highs. “While any delay of tariffs is beneficial on the margin, it is not the same as their removal,” they wrote. “History suggests that elevated and prolonged uncertainty that weighs on business confidence can have detrimental effects on business spending and hiring.” Inflation eased more than anticipated in March,dipping to an annual rate of 2.4%in government figures published Thursday, and wholesale prices alsocooled unexpectedlylast month. But analysts were quick to discount the encouraging data. “That was nice, but don’t get used to it,” Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst, said in a statement Thursday, citing widespread signs of unease across the consumer economy. Experts are alreadywarning that common purchases— from clothing and auto parts to grocery staples like coffee, nuts and seafood — remain on track to get pricier in the months ahead from tariffs. Price hikes are also in store for items extensively produced in China, including toys, video game consoles and electronics. Barclays analysts said Thursday that retail and import data suggests many consumers “have front-run these tariffs to some extent by making heavy purchases in February and March,” looking to snag Chinese-made gadgets and other items produced abroad before prices rise. Foot traffic at warehouse clubsjumped nearly 10%in the last week of March, days before Trump’s April 2 tariff rollout, according to Placer.ai tracking data, which the company said could indicate a race to stock up. The Barclays researchers said they expect price pressures to moderate over the course of the year “as firms trade less with China and source from the rest of the world, where we expect the average tariff to remain close to 10%.” But the bank still foresees inflation climbing to 4.1% overall by the end of this year. “The economic tariff Armageddon unleashed by Trump last week has been the dark black cloud over stocks since this fiasco began,” Wedbush Securities analysts wrote in a note to clients Friday. The impact has mainly been felt on Wall Street so far, they said, but “that is all about to change.”",

    "title": "Mortgage rates surge over 7% as tariffs hit bond market",
    "article_text": "The average rate on the popular 30-year fixed mortgage surged 13 basis points Friday to 7.1%, according to Mortgage News Daily. That’s the highest rate since mid-February. Mortgage rates have been on a roller coaster ride all week, as bond yieldsspiked higher mid-weekwhen President Donald Trump’s new tariffs on dozens of countries went into effect. Yields dropped when Trumplowered the tariff rate on most countrieshours later. Tariffs on Chinese imports, however, currently stand at 145%. But bonds began selling off again Friday,despite a cooler-than-expected inflation report. Mortgage rates loosely follow the yield on the 10-year Treasury. “There have been some bad weeks for bonds here and there over the careers of most anyone who’s alive to read these words, but unless your career began before 1981, you just lived through the worst week you’ve ever seen in terms of the jump in 10-year yields,” said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer at Mortgage News Daily. Graham said there are two ways to look at where bonds are trading today: “This is either the end of the worst week for 10-year yields since 1981 or the end of a fairly average two weeks that fit right in with the trend of the past 18 months.” On Friday, anothermonthly report on consumer sentimentcame in substantially lower than expected. The expectation for inflation jumped from 5% in March to 6.7% in April, the highest level since 1981. All of this comes right in the heart of the all-important spring housing market. For most consumers, a home is their single largest investment. “Forget about housing in this environment, with mortgage rates back up, consumers certainly concerned about the job market, housing will also be on the weak side,” said Nancy Lazar, chief global economist at Piper Sandler, on CNBC’s“The Exchange”on Friday.",

Frontier said its revenue growth likely rose 5% in the first quarter, with capacity up 5% over last year. “Revenue growth is anticipated to be lower than expected due to weakened demand in March, resulting in fare discounting and promotions across the industry, amplified by the close-in nature of Frontier’s bookings,” Frontier said in a securities filing. Frontier pointed to a drop in consumer confidence in March as evidence of weaker demand. Airline executives have said they’ve seen lower demand due to PresidentDonald Trump’strade war, a murky economic outlook, a drop in consumer confidence andmass government layoffs.

    "title": "Florida district won't renew teacher's contract for using student's preferred name",
    "article_text": "A Florida school district said it won’t renew the contract of a teacher who used a student’s preferred name, instead of legal name, without parental permission, in violation of state law. Melissa Calhoun is a literature teacher at Satellite High School in the coastal city of Satellite Beach, Florida. According to her LinkedIn profile, she’s worked for the Brevard County Public Schools district for the past 12 years. Unless the state intervenes, Calhoun, who did not immediately return requests for comment, could be one of the first educators to lose a job under Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law, or what critics call the “Don’t Say Gay” law. Brevard County Public Schools conducted an investigation after receiving a complaint from a parentwho said Calhoun had used a name other than their child’s legal name without the parent’s permission, according to a statement shared by Janet R. Murnaghan, a spokesperson for the district. “This directly violates state law and the district’s standardized process for written parental consent,” the statement said. “Based on the teacher’s own admission that she knowingly did not comply with state statute she received a letter of reprimand. Teachers, like all employees, are expected to follow the law.” Since the state will be reviewing Calhoun’s teacher certificate based on the complaint, the district said it will not renew her annual contract, which expires in May, until the issue is resolved. Dozens of students staged a peaceful walkout Thursday to protest the district’s decision not to renew Calhoun’s contract,according to NBC affiliate WESH of Orlando. “We’re here to really show support for Ms. Calhoun and to show that we are not OK with what is going on,” sophomore Brianna Knight told WESH. “We truly are upset that we are losing such a positive teacher.” Calhoun’s supporters alsostarted a petitionasking the Brevard County School Board to reinstate her. As of Friday afternoon, it had garnered more than 22,000 signatures. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Parental Rights in Education law in March 2022. At that time, it prohibited “classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity” in kindergarten through third grade “or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.” A year later,he signed an expanded versionof the measure that prohibits sexual orientation or gender identity instruction in prekindergarten through eighth grade, restricts reproductive health education in sixth through 12th grade, and bars schools from requiring students or employees to refer to each other with pronouns that do not align with their assigned sex at birth. It also prohibits transgender school employees from sharing their pronouns with students, among other restrictions. In July 2023, a few months after DeSantis signed the expanded measure, the Florida Board of Educationpassed new rulesto ensure schools were following the law and to “strengthen and enhance the safety and welfare of students in K-12 public schools and protect parental rights.” Among those rules was a requirement that school districts receive parental permission before staffers can call a student by anything other than their legal name, including a nickname, even at the student’s request. At a school board meeting this week, several parents spoke both in favor of and against the district’s decision not to renew Calhoun’s contract. “There was no harm, no threat to safety, no malicious intent,” one parent of a student in the district who also said she was one of Calhoun’s colleagues said during the meeting,WESH reported. “Just a teacher trying to connect with a student, and for that, her contract was not renewed despite her strong dedication and years of service. I ask you, how can we justify this?” School board member Katye Campbell said during the meeting that people might think the rule is “silly,” but that it’s important. “The parents are the number one decision-makers for their children,” Campbell said,The Washington Post reported. In response to a question about students’ rights, she said the district shouldn’t interfere in families’ decisions “unless we legally have a reason to.”",

    "title": "Dozens of USAID contracts were canceled last weekend. Here's what happened",
    "article_text": "By Melody Schreiber Afghan men load up food packets that were distributed as aid by the World Food Programme. Last weekend, all USAID contracts supporting humanitarian aid from WFP and other agencies in Afghanistan were canceled.Wakil Kohsar/AFP via Getty Images/AFPhide caption After the Trump administration's cancellation of thousands of humanitarian aid programs last month, about 900 programs, operating across the globe, were still receiving funding from the U.S. Agency for International Development. Over the weekend, however, at least 42 of those programs were informed that USAID had canceled their contracts, which provided funding for the delivery of aid services over a set period of time. The State Department did not say how many contracts had been canceled. The number of canceled programs and the value of the contracts — at least $1.3 billion — comes from OneAID, a grassroots group of USAID-affiliated staff and partners who support the preservation of foreign assistance. OneAID compiled this data from firsthand accounts. NPR confirmed the cuts with sources who have direct knowledge of them and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. The contracts, which covered a variety of humanitarian activities, including food aid administered by the U.N.'s World Food Programme, were canceled at the direction of Jeremy Lewin, the acting deputy administrator for policy and programs at USAID. NPR obtained a copy of the form letter that was emailed to the global and local organizations informing them that their contracts were being terminated. In a statement, the State Department said the latest round of cancellations reflects the Trump administration's efforts to \"reorient foreign assistance programming after decades of mismanagement, fraud, and misaligned priorities in the delivery of foreign assistance.\" Asked about OneAID's figures, the agency neither confirmed nor disputed the amounts. The list of cuts, according to the information collected by OneAID, included: \"This is just total whiplash,\" saysJeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International and a top USAID health official in the Obama administration, whose organization was not affected by the weekend cancellations. The cuts do not necessarily mean a program will cease to operate. Some humanitarian programs draw funding from multiple sources and could continue their work to some degree without U.S. aid. OneAid also compiled data on cuts in specific countries and territories, including Gaza ($12 million), Haiti ($5.9 million), Lebanon ($10.1 million), Niger ($8 million) and Syria ($126 million). The contract terminations in Syria are especially perplexing, said a USAID official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. One Syria program offering food to starving pregnant people and children younger than 5 was informed that its contract has not been canceled, but a separate contract for the staff who run that program was canceled, leaving no one to oversee the work, the official said. And all U.S. humanitarian aid to Afghanistan and Yemen has been eliminated. In Afghanistan, the canceled contracts totaled $280 million with the World Food Programme, $24 million with the United Nations Population Fund and $257 million with other nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The canceled contracts totaled $67 million for Yemen, which is undergoing \"the largest humanitarian crisis in the world,\" according to aYemen status reportprepared by the United Nations, which said that \"24.1 million people — 80% of the population\" need \"humanitarian aid and protection.\" Contracts that provide aid to Yemen were cut \"based on concern that the funding was benefiting terrorist groups, including the Houthis and the Taliban,\" Bruce said at the news conference on Tuesday. The Houthis, who are backed by Iran, are the most powerful group in Yemen. They hold the capital, Sanaa. They began attacking international shipping in the Red Sea, in solidarity with the Palestinians, after the Israel-Hamas war erupted in 2023. \"Cutting aid to Yemen's internationally recognized government — especially while it is actively fighting the Houthis — represents a significant setback for humanitarian efforts,\" said Middle East analyst Mohammed Albasha in a Signal message to NPR. Albasha is the founder of theBasha Report, a publication focused on policy in Yemen and the Middle East. Konyndyk said that ending humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan and Yemen doesn't just affect regimes that the U.S. government sees as illegitimate: \"We're also cutting off the people who are at the mercy of those regimes.\" \"What we're saying here is, basically, we're perfectly happy for the Afghan people to starve to death,\" he said. \"It leaves the Afghan people even more dependent on the Taliban, and it enables the Taliban to say 'See? The Americans don't care about you. We're your only hope.'\" The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the impact of the cuts. Other U.S.-funded projects in countries besides Afghanistan and Yemen were terminated because they provided cash-based assistance — where aid groupsprovide peoplewith moneyor vouchers to purchase food and other necessities, a type of assistance \"which the administration is moving away from,\" Bruce said. She cited \"concerns about misuse and lack of appropriate accountability\" as the reason for ending those awards. Bruce also said that \"no one was auditing\" or checking where USAID money was going for \"years, decades,\" though the funding has been closelyoverseenby Congress and by the organizations administering aid. Then there are the reversals. At the Tuesday press conference, Bruce said: \"There were a few programs that were cut in other countries that were not meant to be cut that have been rolled back and put into place.\" Although she did not provide examples or say in how many countries aid had been cut accidentally, she stated: \"It's just a few.\" According to OneAid's data, the World Food Programme had at least $464 million in aid contracts cut over the weekend and then subsequently reversed for programs in Ecuador, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Somalia and Syria. Aid contracts with other humanitarian groups were also canceled and then reinstated in the Marshall Islands ($1.6 million), Micronesia ($2.1 million), Palau ($2 million) and Papua New Guinea ($6 million). What comes next? The weekend cancellations are not the final word, according to Bruce. Aid contracts will be continuously reviewed, she said: \"We are in a constant, regular audit. That will always be the case now.\" Melody Schreiberis a journalist and editor ofWhat We Didn't Expect: Personal Stories About Premature Birth. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "'I cannot guarantee complete confidentiality,' VA therapists ordered to tell veterans",
    "article_text": "By Katia Riddle Veterans gathered in Indianapolis and in places across the country on March 14 to protest the Trump administration's staff and budget cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs.Jeremy Hogan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Imageshide caption Panic, fear, uncertainty, and anger. Those are the emotions mental health clinicians who work for the US Department of Veterans Affairs describe as they prepare for the VA'smandatory return-to-officedirective. Some are being summoned to offices as soon as Monday, April 14. Representatives from the VA say they are planning to have the back-to-office effort completed by May 5. For this story, NPR interviewed ten clinicians in VA locations around the country, the majority of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because they were afraid of losing their jobs. Days before the April 14 return-to-office deadline, many were still unclear about the expectations for return dates. Some had received last minute changes or delays for reporting to an office. In a memo obtained by NPR, regional leadership at one VA facility offered a script for its therapists to read to patients. \"Before we begin our session, I want to inform you that I am currently in a shared office space,\" reads the script. \"While I will do my utmost to maintain your privacy, I cannot guarantee complete confidentiality.\" These directives come after the VA indicated it would cut about 80,000 staff in a massive restructuring effort. A widely circulatedleaked memo, first obtained by the Associated Press, outlines the effort. In avideoaddressing the cuts, VA Secretary Doug Collins suggested the agency would eliminate waste and that the \"the days of kicking the can down the road are over.\" He offered reassurance that VA benefits would not be impacted and that the VA \"regrets anyone who loses their job.\" Many VA therapists were hired on atelehealth basisand point out that there simply is not space for them to work at VA facilities. They are anticipating confusion and congestion around issues such as parking, bathroom use and adequate kitchen facilities to reheat their lunches. But the primary concern for therapists is whether they will be able to deliver quality care to their patients in an environment without confidentiality. In emails and meetings, VA managers described to VA mental health staff \"pod\" working environments, where clinicians work with headphones in a call-center like configuration to provide telehealth. In one recording obtained by NPR, a manager in a teleconference meeting acknowledged that it was inevitable therapy sessions would be overheard and exhorted people not to share any confidential information. \"We won't be able to provide private sessions,\" says one licensed clinical social worker, who asked to be identified by a middle initial, L., for fear of retaliation. Guaranteed privacy between patient and doctor is a fundamental tenet of quality mental health care, protected by federal law. A group of 20 House Democratssigned a letterto VA Secretary Doug Collins vocalizing their outrage on this issue. They describe one scenario in which a social worker supervisor has been ordered to return to work \"sharing a 100-foot shower with another supervisor,\" to provide case management and clinical supervision. \"We're sure you can agree,\" they write, \"this sort of arrangement is hardly conducive to delivering the quality of care veterans deserve.\" VA representatives have repeatedly insisted that federal privacy laws will be upheld. In an email response to questions about these issues, VA spokesperson Peter Kasperowiczreiterated an accusationthat employees who are sounding alarms are motivated by a desire to \"phone it in.\" A person walks into the Department of Veterans Affairs' headquarters a block from the White House on March 6. President Trump and Elon Musk's DOGE effort targets about 80,000 jobs to be cut from the VA.Chip Somodevilla/Getty Imageshide caption Kasperowicz wrote that these continuing concerns are \"fear mongering from the media,\" and wrote that \"the small number of employees who are desperate to avoid returning to the office will do more to drive away staff and patients than VA's commonsense return-to-office policy ever will.\" VA care, he said, would continue uninterrupted and the \"VA will ensure that employees have a workspace that is appropriate for the work they do.\" But therapists say they do not see logistically how this is possible. L. worried the disclaimers therapists are being encouraged to use at the start of sessions would not withstand legal scrutiny, as consent for information sharing needs to be granted in writing. \"Therapists will either cancel the session themselves,\" L.says, \"and risk being reprimanded, or their patients will cancel.\" L. forsees longer waiting times for veterans seeking care as a result and points out that veterans are at disproportionate risk for suicide than those who have not served. Wait times are already bad. Often, he says, his clients \"have been waiting months and months – many of them with severe mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts.\" The VA is one of the biggest providers of mental health care across the US. In emails shared with NPR, some clinicians were told they would be returning to the office May 5, some were granted exemptions, and some were told to report to work April 14 – though these dates were also subject to change. One document obtained by NPR outlines steps for managers. \"This memo provides a framework to inform a standardized approach to terminating remote and telehealth agreements,\" it reads. Many cliniciansexpressed bewilderment about why certain workers were on the list of mandatory returns and others are not. Others were evaluating the possibility of working from their cars or finding space in a bathroom stall to conduct therapy sessions. Some workers were asked to participate in rearranging furniture in order to accommodate group seating arrangements. Tasks like \"rolling tables to podded rooms as temporary desks,\" or \"rolling away excess furniture,\" were on a to-do list, obtained by NPR. The American Psychological Association issued astatementcriticizing the policy and raising concerns about compliance with federal privacy laws. \"Providers are facing difficult choices between violating ethical standards regarding patient confidentiality or facing disciplinary action for non-compliance with return-to-office mandates,\" reads the statement. It goes on to warn that the policy \"could compromise access to care and confidentiality standards that are key to effective mental health treatment.\" UnderPresident Biden, thePACT actallocated nearly $800 billion to expand VA care and benefits for veterans exposed to toxins. The current efforts aim to reduce staffing numbers to the levels VA had before this legislation. It is not clear how VA would reduce staff to 2019 levels and still fulfill its legal requirements under the PACT act. Many clinicians described their recent experience as a kind of emotional warfare, and noted the irony of compromising their own mental health while trying to provide mental health care for others. \" I'm anticipating a good deal of distress across the board,\" says L. \"And that we will generally fail at our mission of treating veterans.\" If you or a loved one is in crisis, call, text or chat the988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.

    "title": "Major budget cuts proposed for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration",
    "article_text": "By Alejandra Borunda NOAA satellites captured an image of 2022's Hurricane Ian. Data from those satellites and other NOAA efforts feeds into hurricane forecasts, as well as efforts to understand weather, climate, and fisheries changes. A proposed budget for the agency would slash more than 25% of its funding.Handout/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption The Trump administration is proposing deep cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, according to a draft budget proposal viewed by NPR. The agency's budget for 2026 would be slashed by more than 25% overall from itscurrent levelof roughly $6 billion under the proposal, which would need to be approved by Congress. The draft cuts to NOAA's research operations and fisheries services are particularly severe. If enacted, the cuts would \"take us back to the 1950s in terms of our scientific footing and the American people,\" says Craig McLean, a former director of NOAA's office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, the agency's research arm, whose career spanned multiple administrations. The budget aims to eliminate OAR, cutting the budget by close to 75% from previous levels and slashing all funding for research that focuses on climate and weather. A few groups from the office, like a team that works on tornado science, would be moved to other parts of the organization. The budget would also end funding for themany cooperative research centersscattered across the country that contribute to climate and weather research. The proposed budget comes as the administration has already fired hundreds of NOAA employees. It also proposes slashing the operations and personnel budget of the National Marine Fisheries Service, which manages the country's ocean fisheries, by nearly 30%, and moving the rest of the office into the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — another agency entirely. It also asks for the Fisheries Service staff still with the agency to prioritize ways within its purview to \"unleash American energy.\" The proposal also aims to slim down NOAA's investment in some of its premier satellite technology, called geostationary satellites, by 44% compared to current levels. The agency currently has five in orbit, which provide much of the data critical for weather forecasts, as well as weather and climate research and coastal security. The agency was in the process of developing the next generation of its satellites, which would have included several new instruments; the next was scheduled to go into orbit in 2032. The cuts to the program will jeopardize that plan and hamper the progression of key science, according to NOAA officials familiar with the program who were not authorized to speak publicly. The budget for the National Weather Service would remain intact. The overall impacts of the cuts would ripple into Americans' lives, says Rep, Zoe Lofgren of California, the top Democrat on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee. \"What NOAA does is crucial to the lifesaving weather research and services that it provides to the American people,\" she says. \"This budget will leave NOAA hollowed out and unable to perform its life-saving work.\" The budget draft has not yet been finalized and could change after review. White House Office of Management and Budget spokesperson Alexandra McCandless wrote in an email that \"no final funding decisions have been made.\" The U.S. Department of Commerce didn't immediately respond to NPR's request for comment. Project 2025 provided a preview Many of the proposed changes echo concepts outlined in Project 2025, the conservative policy blueprint organized by the Washington, DC-based Heritage Foundation think tank, a document the Trump administration has followed closely in recent months. Project 2025 calls for NOAA to \"be broken up and downsized,\" keeping the pieces that many Americans are familiar with, like the National Weather Service, and dismantling many of NOAA's other offices. The proposed moves follow that rubric, such as shifting the Fisheries Service to another agency. It also called the agency part of \"the main drivers of the climate change alarm industry\" and laid out ways NOAA's climate science research could be curtailed, some of which have been proposed in the budget document. Decades of research by thousands of scientists in the U.S. and internationally, have linked rising atmospheric carbon dioxide with a warming Earth. Human activities, like burning coal, gas and other fossil fuels, are the primary cause of rising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Other disruptions at the agency Earlier this week, hundreds of NOAA employees who had been fired in February, then re-hired under a court order, were once again fired. The most recent firings occurred after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration couldmove forward with firingthose probationary orders, at least for now. Cuts to probationary staff, in tandem with the proposed slashing of the research and operations budgets, could hobble the agency's ability to keep Americans safe, says Andy Hazelton, a hurricane expert who was among those re-fired this week. \"NOAA was already stretched thin and understaffed,\" he says. \"It's going to go from stretched thin to decimated.\" NOAA provides most of the raw data and the models that predict hurricanes, and the hurricane forecasts many Americans see on their phones or TVs are created by the agency. Hazelton says reducing the research and observation capabilities of the agency could regress hurricane forecasting capability by the equivalent of decades. The cuts to the research wing, OAR, says former NOAA Deputy Undersecretary Mary Glackin, who served over several administrations, would \"decimate the laboratory systems and the relationship that we have with universities,\" who work in partnership with the agency on many of its climate, weather, and other research projects. The proposed changes would be \"monumental,\" she says. NOAA provides much of the raw data required for weather forecasts via a wide array of data-collection tools, from satellites to ocean buoys to weather balloons. And its scientists run models that turn that data into useful information, like those short-term weather forecasts, seasonal outlooks and long-term looks at how climate change is affecting Earth. The agency also includes offices that manage the billions of dollars of U.S. fishery resources, like tuna, cod, scallops and crab. Its scientists figure out how many fish can be caught in order to sustain fish populations in the long term, a task legally required by law. Interruptions to fisheries operations have resulted in the past in delays in season opening or lower annual quotas fishermen are allowed to catch. The agency also maintains coastal maps critical to safe maritime activities. The cuts to the climate programs, Glackin says, are shortsighted. \"If you're cutting your research, you don't care about tomorrow,\" she says. It would \"take a very long time to recover from something like that.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Judge rules Mahmoud Khalil can be deported",
    "article_text": "Adrian Florido Student negotiator Mahmoud Khalil is seen at a pro-Palestinian protest encampment on the Columbia University campus in New York, April 29, 2024.Ted Shaffrey/APhide caption JENA, La. — A Louisiana immigration judge ruled Friday that activist Mahmoud Khalil can be deported. Khalil, who as a Columbia University graduate student led pro-Palestinian protests there last year, was detained last month after Secretary of State Marco Rubio determined that Khalil had engaged in \"antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which foster a hostile environment for Jewish students in the U.S.\" In an undated 2-page memo submitted to the court, Rubio detailed that on March 7 he got information about Khalil from the Department of Homeland Security and as a result he determined that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would undermine a U.S. foreign policy goal of combating antisemitism around the world. During a hearing at the remote Louisiana detention center where Khalil is being held, Judge Jamee Comans said Friday that she had no authority to question Rubio's determination. After the ruling, Khalil told the judge, \"I would like to quote what you said last time that there's nothing that's more important to this court than due process rights and fundamental fairness. Clearly what we witnessed today, neither of these principles were present today or in this whole process. \"This is exactly why the Trump administration has sent me to this court, 1,000 miles away from my family,\" he added. \"I just hope that the urgency that you deemed fit for me are afforded to the hundreds of others who have been here without hearing for months.\" After the hearing, Khalil turned around to face the 22 observers and journalists filing out of the courtroom and formed the shape of a heart with his hands. He smiled. Khalil will not immediately be deported. His attorneys have said that if he were ordered deported, they would appeal the judge's ruling. Comans gave Khalil until April 23 to request a stay of his deportation if his attorneys believe he qualifies for one. And the judge said if they don't meet that deadline, she will order him deported either to Syria, where he was born, or to Algeria, where he is a citizen.

Khalil, who has a green card, is a lawful permanent resident. In ordering Khalil's deportation, Rubio relied on a rarely used federal statute from the 1950s that played a major role in shaping American immigration during the Cold War.  The McCarran-Walter Act, or the Immigration Nationality Act of 1952, gives the secretary of state authority to decide that a noncitizen's presence in the United States threatens the country's foreign policy goals. Khalil, 30, was arrested March 8 at the university-owned apartment building in New York City where he lives with his wife, a U.S. citizen who is pregnant. He was  transported to the Jena/LaSalle Detention Facility in Jena, La., where he has been held since. While Friday's hearing took place in immigration court, a separate case has been playing out in a federal court in New Jersey over whether Khalil should have been arrested and detained at all.

    "title": "Are Trump's tariffs a bargaining chip for a new global economic order?",
    "article_text": "Greg Rosalsky US President Donald Trump holds a chart as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025.BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images/AFPhide caption This is an excerpt of thePlanet Moneynewsletter.You can sign up here. Amid the dizzying trade actions President Trump has taken in recent days, it was easy to miss a remarkable speech the White House released by one of Trump's top economic advisors, Stephen Miran. Inthat speech, Miran hinted that the White House might be working to establish a new kind of global economic order that goes beyond just higher tariffs. As the White House has already made pretty clear, its economic goals include reducing or eliminating America's trade deficits with foreign countries and boosting domestic manufacturing. Tariffs are one big tool for those goals. But the existing global economic system is built on more than just low tariffs and free trade. It's built on a special role that the U.S. dollar plays in the global economy. The dollar is the \"international reserve currency.\" It's the main currency the world uses to trade and save. This special role for the dollar can be traced back to 1944. That's when global financial leaders met at a fancy hotel in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, and hammered out the details of a new global economic order that would take hold after World War II ended. (For more on the fascinating history of this, readthis oldPlanet Moneynewsletterand listen tothisPlanet Moneyepisode). In this recent speech and previous writings, Miran has complained that — while this special status for the dollar gives benefits to the United States and the global economy — it also strengthens the dollar, making American exports more expensive and U.S. manufacturing less competitive. He has suggested that America basically needs another Bretton Woods-style meeting to reform the international economic system, which would include potentially helping the United States to devalue the dollar or getting the world to compensate the United States for the special role the dollar plays in it. He has dubbed this potential summit the \"The Mar-A-Lago Accord.\" Some observers,including Stanford historian Jennifer Burns, believe this idea is actually a primary motivation for Trump's aggressive tariff policy. That the White House wants to strengthen their hands in negotiations for a grand bargain that serves America's economy. The reserve currency status of the dollar offers many benefits to the United States. One big one is it gives the United States a financial weapon to sanction other countries, by, for example, cutting their banks off to the flow of dollars or seizing U.S. financial assets, likethe U.S. did to Russiaafter it invaded Ukraine. Because the dollar is the international reserve currency, it's the lifeblood of trade around the world — even trade that doesn't involve the United States. Control over the dollar gives the U.S. government a superpower over the global economic system. Another big benefit of this special role for the dollar is lower interest rates on U.S. debt. People around the world have really wanted dollars and dollar-backed assets like U.S. Treasury bonds, which is how the government issues debt. When we buy stuff from abroad, those countries get dollars, and they need to do something with them. A lot of the time they buy U.S. debt. This mighty global demand for U.S. debt lowers interest rates on it. It's like the United States has a special, low-interest credit card and can spend like crazy and not face the same financial consequences as other nations. Economists have called this and other benefits the U.S. gets from this system \"the exorbitant privilege.\" But in his speech this week, Miran painted the dollar's reserve currency status as a kind of exorbitant burden. \"While it is true that demand for dollars has kept our borrowing rates low, it has also kept currency markets distorted,\" Miran said. In particular, with so much global demand for U.S. dollars, the value of the dollar is higher than it would otherwise be. That's great if you're an American consumer because foreign imports are relatively cheaper with a stronger dollar, but that's less great if you're an American exporter. A stronger dollar means that American exports are more expensive to foreigners. There's another sort of weird quirk about having the dollar as the global reserve currency. In what's known as \"the flight to safety,\" during times of economic stress, there's been a tendency for global investors to flee risky assets like stocks and buy \"safer\" U.S. Treasury bonds. Economists debate whether that's a good or bad thing, but it means that the dollar tends to strengthen even more during recessions. That's not great for American exporters, including manufacturers, during hard economic times. (Importantly — and thisapparently really scared the White House— during this week's economic turmoil there wasno flight to safety. In fact, there was a flight away from U.S. financial assets. Interest rates on U.S. debt spiked — and people began worrying about a potential financial crisis). Miran said in his recent speech, the \"reserve function of the dollar has caused persistent currency distortions and contributed, along with other countries' unfair barriers to trade, to unsustainable trade deficits. These trade deficits have decimated our manufacturing sector and many working-class families and their communities, to facilitate non-Americans trading with each other.\" Aswe've covered before in thePlanet Moneynewsletter, Vice President JD Vance has also questioned whether the reserve currency status of the dollar is a privilege or a burden. Last year, when he was a Senator, JD Vance highlighted that the reserve currency status strengthens the value of the dollar. That may be nice for American consumers, who get benefits like cheaper foreign goods and international travel. \"But it does come at a cost to American producers,\" Vance said. \"I think in some ways you can argue that the reserve currency status is a massive subsidy to American consumers but a massive tax on American producers.\" This, he suggested, contributes to \"our mass consumption of mostly useless imports, on the one hand, and our hollowed-out industrial base on the other hand.\" We spoke with UC Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen, a leading scholar of international finance and the author of books likeExorbitant Privilege: The Rise and Fall of the Dollar and the Future of the International Monetary System. And we asked him for his perspective on Miran and Vance's arguments about the costs of the dollar's special role in the world. \"There is a technical economic term for those arguments: Nonsense,\" Eichengreen says. Yes, Eichengreen says, the dollar is slightly stronger because of its central role it plays in international commerce. \" But that's like factor number 17 on the list of determinants of U.S. export competitiveness.\" There are just so many more important factors determining whether American manufacturing is competitive, like the productivity and wages of U.S. workers, the innovativeness of businesses, the inflation rate, the quality of our machines and equipment, and on and on. The higher value of the dollar due to high international demand to hold it in the existing system \"is just way down there in the factors hollowing out — or not hollowing out — our manufacturing sector.\" Eichengreen says that the special role for the dollar on the international stage is \"a significant benefit for America.\" Sure, he says, economists debate about the size of this benefit. \" But I think there is a broad-based consensus that America is better off having the dollar playing this exceptional role.\" To be clear, President Trump himself has said that the dollar's reserve status is really important. A month before winning reelection, Trump saidin an interviewthat if the dollar stopped being the reserve currency, America would go to \"third-world status.\" He continued, \"We cannot lose it.\" If any country tried to abandon it, he said he'd tell them, \"You're going to pay a 100% tariff on everything you sell into the United States\" and force them to abandon those plans. After taking office, Trump threatened a group of countries known as the \"BRICS\" group — including Brazil, Russia, India, Iran, China, and South Africa (hence, the acronym) — which has been working to develop an alternative reserve currency to the dollar. \"We are going to require a commitment from these seemingly hostile countries that they will neither create a new BRICS currency, nor back any other currency to replace the mighty U.S. dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs,\" President Trump said on Truth Social in late January. \"There is no chance that BRICS will replace the U.S. dollar in international trade, or anywhere else, and any country that tries should say hello to tariffs, and goodbye to America!\" he added. But, as Miran and Vance have highlighted, having the dollar as an international reserve currency also comes with tradeoffs, including potentially a stronger dollar. And Miran and other Trump officials are making a big deal out of the downsides of that tradeoff. How can they have their cake and eat it too? Miran has provided a potential roadmap to maintain the dollar as an international reserve currency while attempting to reduce the costs to America for it. And some observers, including Jennifer Burns, believe this plan might help explain why Trump has been so aggressive in raising tariffs on countries around the world. About a month before President Trump selected Miran to lead his Council of Economic Advisors, Miran publisheda long essayoutlining a series of potential reforms. One of his big ideas was what he called a \"Mar-A-Lago Accord.\" The basic idea is to get a bunch of representatives together — like the United States did in Bretton Woods back in 1944 — and rewrite the terms of the global economic system. With this meeting, the United States could get concessions, like helping the United States to devalue the dollar to improve manufacturing competitiveness and reducing America's debt burden. In his speech this week, Miran argued that the United States is basically underwriting the global economy with their use of the dollar and also global security with protection from its military. He said it's time for the world to share in paying for what he views as a large burden. Miran offered various ideas for countries to pay the United States for these global \"public goods\" it provides. They can, for instance, \"accept tariffs on their exports to the United States without retaliation.\" They could buy more from America or invest in factories here. They could even \"simply write checks to [the U.S.] Treasury that help us finance global public goods.\" It is unclear that this is all the actual strategy behind Trump's sprawling tariffs. Some believe there's no coherent strategy at all. The Trump administration has been throwing the kitchen sink in their arguments justifying their trade actions and different advisors have been saying different things. The rollout of the tariffs has been erratic. U.S. financial markets — including the market for U.S. government bonds — have been freaking out about all of this. \" I hope that the events of the last few days have reminded everybody in the administration that financial markets have a low tolerance for these kind of ideas more broadly and for erratic changes in policy,\" Eichengreen says. Despite this turmoil and antagonistic global diplomacy, there's a stickiness to the U.S. dollar as the international reserve currency. Scholars — including Eichengreen — have been warning that the dollar's special status is in danger for decades. But the world keeps using it. There are tremendous benefits to using the dollar because everyone else is using dollars. And there's not a ready-to-go alternative. Plus, Eichengreen says, the U.S. has — until now — been \"a good steward\" of the dollar and the role it plays in the international economic system. The world has had faith in American institutions. It's a big reason for the \"flight to safety.\" But that didn't happen during this week's self-imposed financial turmoil. There was an epic stock market downturn, and investors didn't flock to Treasuries and other U.S. financial assets. Eichengreen says that interest rates on the bond market have moved for all sorts of potential reasons, including the potential of higher inflation because of the tariffs. He's wary about reading short-term price movements as telling us something big about the future of the dollar. But, he says, he is definitely more worried these days. \"I'm very much more concerned all of a sudden than I have been in the past,\" Eichengreen says. \"We have not seen in our lifetimes an effort to blow up the international economic order as we know it. So now we're in a world where anything that we used to take for granted — and that certainly includes the international role of the dollar — is suddenly in doubt.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Maryland judge again asks government to return man wrongly deported to El Salvador",
    "article_text": "Joel Rose A member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus holds a picture of Kilmar Abrego Garcia during a news conference to discuss Abrego Garcia's arrest and deportation on April 9, 2025 in Washington, D.C.Alex Wong/Getty Imageshide caption GREENBELT, Md. — A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Friday to provide her with daily updates on its efforts to return a Maryland man who was wrongly deported to El Salvador back to the United States. The mood was tense in the courtroom as the judge, Paula Xinis, chastised Justice Department lawyers and expressed frustration with the government's efforts to comply. The hearing followed Thursday'sSupreme Court ruling largely upholding Xinis' original orderto bring Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. Within hours of the high court's decision, Xinis issued a new order, directing the federal government to \"take all available steps to facilitate the return\" of Abrego Garcia to the United States as soon as possible. And she ordered the Justice Department to provide an immediate update on his location and status, what steps the government has taken so far to bring him back and what additional steps it is considering. In response, the Trump administration asked for more time to answer the judge's questions, arguing that the government needs \"a meaningful opportunity to review the Supreme Court's decision before it is ordered to report what steps it will take in response to that decision.\" \"Foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines, in part because it involves sensitive country-specific considerations wholly inappropriate for judicial review,\" the lawyers wrote in another filing. That tension carried over into Friday's status conference. \"I'm not asking for state secrets,\" Xinis said. \"He's not here. The government was prohibited from sending him to El Salvador. And now I'm asking just a very simple question. Where is he?\" Drew Ensign, a deputy assistant attorney general, said repeatedly that he did not have the answers Xinis was seeking. \"We intend to comply with Supreme Court's order,\" Ensign told the judge. \"We're actively taking steps to do so. We are not able to meet the court's deadlines because they're impracticable.\" Abrego Garcia's case has become a high-stakes clash between the White House and courts, and the latest case to test how quickly the Trump administration can remove people it says are threats to Americans' safety. His case is unique in that the administration admitted his deportation was a mistake, but says he cannot be brought back. The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador, and to \"be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.\" The unsigned order marked a rare win for those challenging the administration's deportation orders. There were no dissents, though Justice Sonia Sotomayor ina statement accompanying the order wrote that\"to this day, the Government has cited no basis in law for Abrego Garcia's warrantless arrest, his removal to El Salvador, or his confinement in a Salvadoran prison. \"Nor could it.\" The court's two other liberal justices joined her. The Supreme Court sent the case back to Xinis with instructions to clarify the wording of her original order — in particular, her use of the word \"effectuated\" in her directions to the Trump administration. Xinis's order — now relying only on the word \"facilitate\" — seems intended to address the Supreme Court's question. The justices also wrote that the intended scope of that term is \"unclear,\" and that it might exceed the lower court's authority. They instructed the lower court to \"clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.\" The Department of Homeland Security emphasized that section of the order in its response. \"SCOTUS agreed with us that the District Court improperly interfered with the President's foreign affairs power,\" said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs, in an emailed statement. \"The District Court was overbearing and, as SCOTUS said, should clarify its directive with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs. We look forward to continuing to advance our position in this case.\" The Trump administration has admitted that Abrego Garcia was deported because of what it calls an \"administrative error,\" but has argued that there is nothing it can do because Abrego Garcia was already out of the U.S. in the custody of the Salvadoran government when the mistake was discovered. Xinis, the Maryland judge, had earlier rejected that argument. Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland for over a decade, along with his wife and their three children, all U.S. citizens. In 2019, an immigration judge had granted him a form of protected status that should have prevented his deportation to El Salvador. Despite that, ICE officers arrested Abrego Garcia last month. He was deported to El Salvador a few days later, along with hundreds of other men that the Trump administration accuses of being gang members. The White House maintains that Abrego Garcia is a member of the Salvadoran gang, MS-13, which the Trump administration has designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, and should not be allowed back into the U.S. But Abrego Garcia's lawyers dispute that. They say he has been living peacefully in Maryland for 14 years, and has never been charged with or convicted of a crime in any country. Abrego Garcia's lawyers argue the MS-13 allegations are based largely on an accusation from a confidential informant who accused him of being a member of the gang in New York, where Abrego Garcia has never lived. Xinis described the accusations as \"vague\" and \"uncorroborated,\" and noted that the Trump administration has introduced no evidence of a criminal indictment or complaint into the record. More appeals in the case are likely. Still, the Trump administration appeared unwilling to back down. In a social media post on Thursday night, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller framed the Supreme Court's order as a rejection of the lower court's reasoning. The justices \"made clear that a district court judge cannot exercise Article II foreign affairs powers,\" Millerwrote. He argued that El Salvador is holding \"the illegal alien terrorist\" in custody, not the U.S. government — leaving it unclear exactly when, or if, Abrego Garcia would be returning to Maryland.

    "title": "AI isn’t ready to replace human coders for debugging, researchers say",
    "article_text": "Even when given access to tools, AI agents can't reliably debug software. There are few areas where AI has seen more robust deployment than the field of software development. From \"vibe\" coding to GitHub Copilot to startups building quick-and-dirty applications with support from LLMs, AI is already deeply integrated. However, those claiming we're mere months away from AI agentsreplacing most programmersshould adjust their expectations because models aren't good enough at the debugging part, and debugging occupies most of a developer's time. That's the suggestion of Microsoft Research, which built a new tool called debug-gym to test and improve how AI models can debug software. Debug-gym (available onGitHuband detailed ina blog post) is an environment that allows AI models to try and debug any existing code repository with access to debugging tools that aren't historically part of the process for these models. Microsoft found that without this approach, models are quite notably bad at debugging tasks. With the approach, they're better but still a far cry from what an experienced human developer can do. Here's how Microsoft's researchers describe debug-gym: Debug-gym expands an agent’s action and observation space with feedback from tool usage, enabling setting breakpoints, navigating code, printing variable values, and creating test functions. Agents can interact with tools to investigate code or rewrite it, if confident. We believe interactive debugging with proper tools can empower coding agents to tackle real-world software engineering tasks and is central to LLM-based agent research. The fixes proposed by a coding agent with debugging capabilities, and then approved by a human programmer, will be grounded in the context of the relevant codebase, program execution and documentation, rather than relying solely on guesses based on previously seen training data. Pictured below are the results of the tests using debug-gym. This approach is much more successful than relying on the models as they're usually used, but when your best case is a 48.4 percent success rate, you're not ready for primetime. The limitations are likely because the models don't fully understand how to best use the tools, and because their current training data is not tailored to this use case. \"We believe this is due to the scarcity of data representing sequential decision-making behavior (e.g., debugging traces) in the current LLM training corpus,\" the blog post says. \"However, the significant performance improvement... validates that this is a promising research direction.\" This initial report is just the start of the efforts, the post claims.  The next step is to \"fine-tune an info-seeking model specialized in gathering the necessary information to resolve bugs.\" If the model is large, the best move to save inference costs may be to \"build a smaller info-seeking model that can provide relevant information to the larger one.\" This isn't the first time we've seen outcomes that suggest some of the ambitious ideas about AI agents directly replacing developers are pretty far from reality. There have been numerous studies already showing that even though an AI tool can sometimes create an application that seems acceptable to the user for a narrow task, the models tend to produce code laden with bugs and security vulnerabilities, and they aren't generally capable of fixing those problems. This is an early step on the path to AI coding agents, but most researchers agree it remains likely that the best outcome is an agent that saves a human developer a substantial amount of time, not one that can do everything they can do.

    "title": "Turbulent global economy could drive up prices for Netflix and rivals",
    "article_text": "\"... our members are going to be punished.\" Debate around how much taxes US-based streaming services should pay internationally, among other factors, could result in people paying more for subscriptions to services like Netflix and Disney+. On April 10, the United Kingdom's Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) Committee reignited calls for a streaming tax on subscription revenue acquired through UK residents. The recommendation came alongside the committee's 120-page report [PDF] that makes numerous recommendations for how to support and grow Britain’s film and high-end television (HETV) industry. For the US, the recommendation garnering the most attention is one calling for a 5 percent levy on UK subscriber revenue from streaming video on demand services, such as Netflix. That’s because if streaming services face higher taxes in the UK, costs could be passed onto consumers, resulting in morestreaming price hikes. The CMS committee wants money from the levy to support HETV production in the UK and wrote in its report: The industry should establish this fund on a voluntary basis; however, if it does not do so within 12 months, or if there is not full compliance, the Government should introduce a statutory levy. Calls for a streaming tax in the UK come after 2024's 25 percent decrease in spending for UK-produced high-end TV productions and 27 percent decline in productions overall, per the report. Companies like the BBC have said that they lack funds to keep making premium dramas. In a statement, the CMS committee called for streamers, “such as Netflix, Amazon, Apple TV+, and Disney+, which benefit from the creativity of British producers, to put their money where their mouth is by committing to pay 5 percent of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences.\" The committee's report argues that public service broadcasters and independent movie producers are \"at risk,\" due to how the industry currently works. More investment into such programming would also benefit streaming companies by providing \"a healthier supply of [public service broadcaster]-made shows that they can license for their platforms,\" the report says. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has said that it will respond to the CMS Committee's report. In response to the report, a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement shared bythe BBCyesterday that the \"UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America—and we want it to stay that way.” Netflix reportedly claims to have spent billions of pounds in the UK via work with over 200 producers and 30,000 cast and crew members since 2020, perThe Hollywood Reporter. In May 2024, Benjamin King, Netflix's senior director of UK and Ireland public policy, told the CMS committee that the streaming service spends \"about $1.5 billion\" annually on UK-made content. Netflix's statement this week, responding to the CMS Committee's levy, added: ... in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking, and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs. Adam Minns, executive director for the UK’s Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA), highlighted how a UK streaming tax could impact streaming providers' content budgets. \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses,” he said, per the BBC. An anonymous source that The Hollywood Reporter described as \"close to the matter\" said that \"Netflix members have already paid the BBC license fee. A levy would be a double tax on them and us. It’s unfair. This is a tariff on success. And our members are going to be punished.\" The anonymous source added: “Ministers have already rejected the idea of a streaming levy. The creation of a Cultural Fund raises more questions than it answers. It also begs the question: Why should audiences who choose to pay for a service be then compelled to subsidize another service for which they have already paid through the license fee. Furthermore, what determines the criteria for ‘Britishness,’ which organizations would qualify for funding ... ?\" In May, Mitchel Simmons, Paramount’s VP of EMEA public policy and government affairs, also questioned the benefits of a UK streaming tax when speaking to the CMS committee. “Where we have seen levies in other jurisdictions on services, we then see inflation in the market. Local broadcasters, particularly in places such as Italy, have found that the prices have gone up because there has been a forced increase in spend and others have suffered as a consequence,\" he said at the time. Interest in the UK putting a levy on streaming services follows other countries recently pushing similar fees onto streaming providers. Music streaming providers, like Spotify, for example, pay a 1.2 percent tax on streaming revenue made in France. Spotify blamed the tax for a1.2 percent price hikein the country issued in May. France’s streaming taxes are supposed to go toward the Centre National de la Musique. Last year, Canada issued a5 percent tax on Canadian streaming revenuethat’s been halted as companies including Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Disney, and Spotifybattle it in court. Lawrence Zhang, head of policy of the Centre for Canadian Innovation and Competitiveness at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation think tank, hasestimatedthat a 5 percent streaming tax would result in the average Canadian family paying an extra CA$40 annually. A streaming provider group called the Digital Media Associationhas arguedthat the Canadian tax “could lead to higher prices for Canadians and fewer content choices.\" \"As a result, you may end up paying more for your favourite streaming services and have less control over what you can watch or listen to,” the Digital Media Association’s website says. Uncertainty aroundUS tariffsand theirimplicationson the global economy have also resulted in streaming companies moving slower than expected regarding new entrants, technologies, mergers and acquisitions, and even business failures, Alan Wolk, co-founder and lead analyst at TVRev,pointed outtoday. “The rapid-fire nature of the executive orders coming from the White House” has a massive impact on the media industry, he said. “Uncertainty means that deals don’t get considered, let alone completed,” Wolk mused, noting that the growing stability of the streaming industry overall also contributes to slowing market activity. For consumers, higher prices for other goods and/or services could result in smaller budgets for spending on streaming subscriptions. Establishing and growing advertising businesses is already a priority for many US streaming providers. However, the realities of stingier customers who are less willing to buy multiple streaming subscriptions or opt for premium tiers or buy on-demand titles are poised to put more pressure on streaming firms’ advertising plans. Simultaneously, advertisers are facing pressures from tariffs, which could result in less money being allocated to streaming ads. “With streaming platform operators increasingly turning to ad-supported tiers to bolster profitability—rather than just rolling out price increases—this strategy could be put at risk,” Matthew Bailey, senior principal analyst of advertising at Omdia, recently toldWired. He added: Against this backdrop, I wouldn’t be surprised if we do see some price increases for some streaming services over the coming months. Streaming service providers are likely to tighten their purse strings, too. As we’ve seen, this can result in price hikes andsmaller or less daring content selection. Streaming customers may soon be forced to reduce their subscriptions. The good news is that most streaming viewers are already accustomed to growing prices and have figured out which streaming services align with their needs around affordability, ease of use, content, and reliability. Customers may set higher standards, though, as streaming companies grapple with the industry and global changes.

    "title": "Holy water brimming with cholera compels illness cluster in Europe",
    "article_text": "Testing found that the holy water was \"heavily contaminated.\" European tourists who toted home bottles of water from a holy well in Ethiopia were likely hoping for blessings and spiritual cleansing—but instead carried an infectious curse and got an intestinal power cleanse. Three people in Germany and four in the UK fell ill with cholera after directly drinking or splashing their faces with the holy water. Two required intensive care. Luckily, they all eventually recovered, according toa report in the journal Eurosurveillance. The infections occurred in February after some of the patients reported taking independent trips to Ethiopia in January. Two of the German patients and three of the UK patients reported travel to the country, and several reported visiting a holy well called Bermel Giorgis (also spelled ‘Georgis’) in the Quara district. The German travelers and at least one of the UK travelers brought water home with them and shared it. The well, named after Saint George, is considered a revered holy site by members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, who visit seeking \"healing, spiritual clarity, and divine experiences,\"according to a travel site. A bulletin from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Controlnoted that the well is in an area experiencing a cholera outbreak. But there is also armed conflict in the region, making public health interventions challenging. Given that the use of holy water is deeply rooted in the church and that samples are often gifted by returning travelers, the ECDC warns that \"new cases may continue to occur until the source of contamination at the well has been addressed.\" Whatever the source, it's a potent one, the Eurosurveillance report highlights. To get cholera, a person needs to be exposed to a hefty dose of the bacteria that causes it,Vibrio cholerae. \"As the infectious dose ofV. choleraeO1 has been estimated to be 105–108[100,000 to 100 million] colony-forming units (CFU), this suggests the holy water was heavily contaminated and bacteria remained viable at ambient temperature during the flight and in Europe,\" the German and UK researchers who authored the report wrote. Testing indicated that the cholera strain that the travelers brought home was a particularly nasty one.V. choleraeO1, which is linked to other recent outbreaks in Eastern and Middle Africa, is resistant to a wide variety of antibiotics, namely: fluroquinolones, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, macrolides, and sulphonamides. The strain also carried a separate genetic element (a plasmid) that provided resistance mechanisms against streptomycin and spectinomycin, cephalosporins, macrolides, and sulphonamides. The main treatment for cholera, which causes profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting, is oral rehydration. Antibiotics are sometimes used to reduce severity. Fortunately, this strain was still susceptible to the antibiotic tetracycline, one of the drugs of choice for cholera. However, there are reports of other cholera strains in Africa that have also acquired tetracycline resistance. In all, \"The extension of a cholera outbreak in Africa causing a cluster of infections in Europe is unusual,\" the authors write. They call for travelers to be aware of infectious threats when eating and drinking abroad—and to not ingest holy water. Clinicians should also be aware of the potential of cholera in travelers to Ethiopia. To truly fight cholera outbreaks, though, there needs to be sustained investment in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). Cases of cholera have surged globally after the pandemic,according to the World Health Organization. \"Low-income countries will continue to need overseas development aid support to control outbreaks and epidemics using effective WASH, surveillance, communications, diagnostics and countermeasure programmatic delivery,\" the authors of the Eurosurveillance report write.

    "title": "That groan you hear is users’ reaction to Recall going back into Windows",
    "article_text": "Snapshotting and AI processing a screen every 3 seconds. What could possibly go wrong? Security and privacy advocates are girding themselves for another uphill battle against Recall, the AI tool rolling out in Windows 11 that will screenshot, index, and store everything a user does every three seconds. When Recall was first introduced in May 2024, security practitioners roundly castigated it for creating a gold mine for malicious insiders, criminals, or nation-state spies if they managed to gain even brief administrative access to a Windows device. Privacy advocates warned that Recall was ripe for abuse in intimate partner violence settings. They also noted that there was nothing stopping Recall from preserving sensitive disappearing content sent through privacy-protecting messengers such as Signal. Following months of backlash, Microsoft later suspended Recall. On Thursday, the companysaidit was reintroducing Recall. It currently is available only to insiders with access to the Windows 11 Build 26100.3902 preview version. Over time, the feature will be rolled out more broadly. Microsoft officials wrote: Recall (preview)* saves you time by offering an entirely new way to search for things you’ve seen or done on your PC securely. With the AI capabilities of Copilot+ PCs, it’s now possible to quickly find and get back to any app, website, image, or document just by describing its content. To use Recall, you will need to opt-in to saving snapshots, which are images of your activity, and enroll in Windows Hello to confirm your presence so only you can access your snapshots. You are always in control of what snapshots are saved and can pause saving snapshots at any time. As you use your Copilot+ PC throughout the day working on documents or presentations, taking video calls, and context switching across activities, Recall will take regular snapshots and help you find things faster and easier. When you need to find or get back to something you’ve done previously, open Recall and authenticate with Windows Hello. When you’ve found what you were looking for, you can reopen the application, website, or document, or use Click to Do to act on any image or text in the snapshot you found. Microsoft is hoping that the concessions requiring opt-in and the ability to pause Recall will help quell the collective revolt that broke out last year. It likely won’t for various reasons. First, even if User A never opts in to Recall, they have no control over the setting on the machines of Users B through Z. That means anything User A sends them will be screenshotted, processed with optical character recognition and Copilot AI, and then stored in an indexed database on the other users’ devices. That would indiscriminately hoover up all kinds of User A's sensitive material, including photos, passwords, medical conditions, and encrypted videos and messages. AsPrivacy Guideswriter Emwrote on Mastodon: This feature will unfortunately extract your information from whatever secure software you might have used and store it on this person's computer in a possibly less secure way. Of course this person could manually take a screenshot of all of this anyway, but this feature makes it that even a well-intentioned person might either not be aware it is on, or might wrongly assume it is secure enough. This feature isn't fully released yet, but it might be soon. The presence of an easily searchable database capturing a machine’s every waking moment would also be a bonanza for others who don’t have users’ best interests at heart. That level of detailed archival material will undoubtedly be subject to subpoena by lawyers and governments. Threat actors who manage to get their spyware installed on a device will no longer have to scour it for the most sensitive data stored there. Instead they will mine Recall just as they do browser databases storing passwords now. Microsoft didn’t immediately respond to a message asking why it’s reintroducing Recall less than a year after the feature got such a chilly reception. For critics, Recall is likely to remain one of the most pernicious examples ofenshittification, the recently minted term for the shoehorning of unwanted AI and other features into existing products when there is negligible benefit to users.

    "article_text": "Chrome for Android is getting a neat visual upgrade. The Internet might look a bit different on Android soon. Last month, Google announced its intent to make Chrome for Android a more immersive experience by hiding the navigation bar background. The promised edge-to-edge update is now rolling out to devices on Chrome version 135, giving you a touch more screen real estate. However, some websites may also be a bit harder to use. Moving from button to gesture navigation reduced the amount of screen real estate devoted to the system UI, which leaves more room for apps. Google's move to a \"dynamic bottom bar\" in Chrome creates even more space for web content. When this feature shows up, the pages you visit will be able to draw all the way to the bottom of the screen instead of stopping at the navigation area, which Google calls the \"chin.\" Credit:\n\n          \n          Google As you scroll down a page, Chrome hides the address bar. With the addition of the dynamic bottom bar, the chin also vanishes. The gesture handle itself remains visible, shifting between white and black based on what is immediately behind it to maintain visibility. Unfortunately, this feature will not work if you have chosen to stick with theclassic three-button navigation option. You may notice some problems with certain websites after the change rolls out. Since sites can draw to the bottom of the screen, important footers could end up behind the gesture bar. This could make elements like newsletter signups and cookie preferences more annoying to use or dismiss. Google'sedge-to-edge migration guideadvises web developers to utilize safe area insets, which will ensure that UI elements will not render directly behind the navigation bar. Simply being on Chrome 135 is not necessarily enough to get the dynamic bottom bar. A separate server-side update is rolling out to enable edge-to-edge viewing—there's no way to force this update, but in our testing, it appears to be rolling out widely.

    "title": "Powerful programming: BBC-controlled electric meters are coming to an end",
    "article_text": "Customers are being pushed to smart meters that have their own signal problems. Radio signal broadcasts have their usefulness, but they eventually end (except, perhaps, forSETI). Every so often, we mark the public end of a once-essential wavelength, such as3G cellular,analog television, or theCanadian time check. One of the most weirdly useful signals will soon end in the United Kingdom, with notable consequences if its transition is not properly handled. Beginning in the early 1980s, UK homes could have electrical meters installed with a radio teleswitch attached. These switches listened for a 198 kHz signal from the BBC's Radio 4 Long Wave service, primarily broadcast from the powerful Droitwich Transmitting Station. These switches listened to 30 messages per minute, waiting for a certain 50-bit data packet to arrive that signaled that electricity was now at cheaper, off-peak rates (\"tariffs\" in the UK). With this over-the-air notice, homes that bought into Economy 7 or Economy 10 (7 or 10 hours of reduced-price power) could make use of ceramic-stuffedstorage heatersthat stayed warm into the day, prepare hot water heaters, and otherwise make use of off-peak power. How the electrical companies, BBC, and meters worked together is fascinating in its own right and documented ina recent video by Ringway Manchester(which wefirst saw at Hackaday). But BBC Radio 4's Long Wave transmissions arecoming to an end, due to both modern realities and obscure glass valves. Two rare tungsten-centered, hand-craftedcooled anode modulators(CAM) are needed to keep the signal going, and while the BBC bought up the global supply of them, they are running out. The service is seemingly on its last two valves and has been telling the public about Long Wave radio's end for nearly 15 years. Trying to remanufacture the valves is hazardous, as any flaws could cause a catastrophic failure in the transmitters. Rebuilding the transmitter, or moving to different, higher frequencies, is not feasible for the very few homes that cannot get other kinds of lower-power radio, or internet versions,the BBC told The Guardian in 2011. What's more, keeping Droitwich powered such that it can reach the whole of the UK, including Wales and lower Scotland, requires some 500 kilowatts of power, more than most other BBC transmission types. As of January 2025, roughly600,000 UK customers still use RTS metersto manage their power switching, after 300,000 were switched away in 2024. Utilities and the BBC have agreed that the service will stop working on June 30, 2025, and have pushed to upgrade RTS customers to smart meters. In a combination of sad reality and rich irony,more than 4 million smart meters in the UK are not working properly. Some have delivered eye-popping charges to their customers, based on estimated bills instead of real readings, likeSir Grayson Perry's 39,000 pounds due on 15 simultaneous bills. But many have failed because the UK, like other countries,phased out the 2G and 3G networksolder meters relied upon without coordinated transition efforts.

    "title": "Apple silent as Trump promises “impossible” US-made iPhones",
    "article_text": "How does Apple solve a problem like Trump’s trade war? Despite a recent pause on some tariffs, Apple remains in a particularly thorny spot as Donald Trump's trade war spikes costs in the tech company's iPhone manufacturing hub, China. Analysts predictthat Apple has no clear short-term options to shake up its supply chain to avoid tariffs entirely, and even if Trump grants Apple an exemption, iPhone prices may increase not just in the US but globally. The US Trade Representative, which has previouslygranted Apple an exemptionon a particular product, did not respond to Ars' request to comment on whether any requests for exemptions have been submitted in 2025. Currently, the US imposes a 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports, while China has raised tariffs on US imports to 125 percent. Neither side seems ready to back down, and Trump's TikTok deal—which must be approved by the Chinese government—risks further delays the longer negotiations and retaliations drag on. Trump has faced criticism for delaying the TikTok deal, with Senate Intelligence Committee Vice Chair Mark Warner (D-Va.)telling The Vergelast week that the delay was \"against the law\" and threatened US national security. Meanwhile, China seems to expect more business to flow into China rather than into the US as a result of Trump's tough stance on global trade. With the economy and national security at risk, Trump is claiming that tariffs will drive manufacturing into the US, create jobs, and benefit the economy. Getting the world's most valuable company, Apple, to manufacture its most popular product, the iPhone, in the US, is clearly part of Trump's vision. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters this week that Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years was supposedly a clear indicator that Apple believed it was feasible to build iPhones here, Bloombergreported. \"If Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change,\" Leavitt said. Apple did not respond to Ars' request to comment, and so far, it has been silent on how tariffs are impacting its business. For Apple, even if it can build products for the US market in India, where tariffs remain lower, Trump's negotiations with China \"remain the most important variable for Apple\" to retain its global dominance. Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, told CNBC that \"Apple could be set back many years by these tariffs.\" Although Apple reportedly stockpiled phones to sell in the US market, that supply will likely dwindle fast as customers move to purchase phones before prices spike. In the medium-term, consultancy firm Omdia forecasted, Apple will likely \"focus on increasing iPhone production and exports from India\" rather than pushing its business into the US, as Trump desires. But Apple will still incur additional costs from tariffs on India until that country tries to negotiate a more favorable trade deal. And any exemption that Apple may secure due to its investment promise in the US or moderation of China tariffs that could spare Apple some pain \"may not be enough for Apple to avoid adverse business effects,\" co-founder and senior analyst at equity research publisher MoffettNathanson, Craig Moffett, suggested to CNBC. And if Apple is forced to increase prices, it likely won't be limited to just the US, Bank of America Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan suggested, asreportedby The Guardian. To ensure that Apple's largest market isn't the hardest hit, Apple may increase prices \"across the board geographically,\" he forecasted. \"While Apple has not commented on this, we expect prices will be changed globally to prevent arbitrage,\" Mohan said. Apple may even choose to increase prices everywhere but the US, vice president at Forrester Research, Dipanjan Chatterjee, explained in The Guardian's report. \"If there is a cost impact in the US for certain products,\" Chatterjee said, Apple may not increase US prices because \"the market is far more competitive there.\" Instead, \"the company may choose to keep prices flat in the US while recovering the lost margin elsewhere in its global portfolio,\" Chatterjee said. Analysts have said that Trump's dream that a \"made-in-the-USA\" iPhone could be coming soon is divorced from reality. Not only do analysts estimate that more than 80 percent of Apple products are currently made in China, but so are many individual parts. So even if Apple built an iPhone factory in the US, it would still have to pay tariffs on individual parts, unless Trump agreed to a seemingly wide range of exemptions. Mohan estimated it would \"likely take many years\" to move the \"entire iPhone supply chain,\" if that's \"even possible.\" Further, Apple's $500 billion commitment covered \"building servers for its artificial intelligence products, Apple TV productions and 20,000 new jobs in research and development—not a promise to make the iPhone stateside,\" The Guardian noted. For Apple, it would likely take years to build a US factory and attract talent, all without knowing how tariffs might change. A former Apple manufacturing engineer, Matthew Moore, told Bloomberg that \"there are millions of people employed by the Apple supply chain in China,\" and Apple has long insisted that the US talent pool is too small to easily replace them. \"What city in America is going to put everything down and build only iPhones?\" Moore said. \"Boston is over 500,000 people. The whole city would need to stop everything and start assembling iPhones.\" In a CBS interview, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick suggested that the \"army of millions and millions of human beings\" could be automated, Bloomberg reported. But China has never been able to make low-cost automation work, so it's unclear how the US could achieve that goal without serious investment. \"That’s not yet realistic,\" people who have worked on Apple's product manufacturing told Bloomberg, especially since each new iPhone model requires retooling of assembly, which typically requires manual labor. Other analysts agreed, CNBCreported, concluding that \"the idea of an American-made iPhone is impossible at worst and highly expensive at best.\" For consumers, CNBC noted, a US-made iPhone would cost anywhere from 25 percent more than the $1,199 price point today, increasing to about $1,500 at least, to potentially $3,500 at most, Wall Street analysts have forecasted. It took Apple a decade to build its factory in India, which Apple reportedly intends to use to avoid tariffs where possible. That factory \"only began producing Apple’s top-of-the-line Pro and Pro Max iPhone models for the first time last year,\" CNBC reported. Analysts told CNBC that it would take years to launch a similar manufacturing process in the US, while \"there’s no guarantee that US trade policy might not change yet again in a way to make the factory less useful.\" It appears that there's not much Apple can do to avoid maximum pain through US-China negotiations. But Apple's CEO Tim Cook—who is considered \"a supply chain whisperer\"—may be \"uniquely suited\" to navigate Trump's trade war, Fortunereported. After Cook arrived at Apple in 1998, he \"redesigned Apple’s sprawling supply chain\" and perhaps is game to do that again, Fortune reported. Jeremy Friedman, associate professor of business and geopolitics at Harvard Business School, told Fortune that rather than being stuck in the middle, Cook may turn out to be a key intermediary, helping the US and China iron out a deal. During Trump's last term, Cook raised a successful \"charm offensive\" that secured tariff exemptions without caving to Trump's demand to build iPhones in the US, CNBCreported, and he's likely betting that Apple's recent $500 billion commitment will lead to similar outcomes, even if Apple never delivers a US-made iPhone. Back in 2017, Trump announced that Apple partner Foxconn would be building three \"big beautiful plants\" in the US and claimed that they would be Apple plants, CNBC reported. But the pandemic disrupted construction, and most of those plans were abandoned, with one facility only briefly serving to make face masks, not Apple products. In 2019, Apple committed to building a Texas factory that Trump toured. While Trump insisted that a US-made iPhone was on the horizon due to Apple moving some business into the US, that factory only committed to assembling the MacBook Pro, CNBC noted. Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring suggested that Apple may \"commit to some small-volume production in the US (HomePod? AirTags?)\" to secure an exemption in 2025, rather than committing to building iPhones, CNBC reported. Although this perhaps sounds like a tried-and-true game plan, for Cook, Apple's logistics have likely never been so complicated. However, analysts told Fortune that experienced logistics masterminds understand that flexibility is the priority, and Cook has already shown that he can anticipate Trump's moves by stockpiling iPhones and redirecting US-bound iPhones through its factory in India. While Trump negotiates with China, Apple hopes that an estimated 35 million iPhones it makes annually in India can \"cover a large portion of its needs in the US,\" Bloomberg reported. These moves, analysts said, prove that Cook may be the man for the job when it comes to steering Apple through the trade war chaos. But to keep up with global demand—selling more than 220 million iPhones annually—Apple will struggle to quickly distance itself from China, where there's abundant talent to scale production that Apple says just doesn't exist in the US. For example, CNBC noted that Foxconn hired 50,000 additional workers last fall at its largest China plant just to build enough iPhones to meet demand during the latest September launches. As Apple remains dependent on China, Cook will likely need to remain at the table, seeking friendlier terms on both sides to ensure its business isn't upended for years. \"One can imagine, if there is some sort of grand bargain between US and China coming in the next year or two,\" Friedman said, \"Tim Cook might as soon as anybody play an intermediary role.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "A guide to the “platonic ideal” of a Negroni and other handy tips",
    "article_text": "Perfumer by day, mixologist by night, Kevin Peterson specializes in crafting scent-paired cocktails. Kevin Peterson is a \"nose\" for his own perfume company,Sfumato Fragrances, by day. By night, Sfumato's retail store in Detroit transforms into Peterson's craft cocktail bar,Castalia, where he is chief mixologist and designs drinks that pair with carefully selected aromas. He's also the author ofCocktail Theory: A Sensory Approach to Transcendent Drinks, whichgrew out ofhis many (many!) mixology experiments and popular YouTube series,Objective Proof: The Science of Cocktails. It's fair to say that Peterson has had an unusual career trajectory. He worked as a line cook and an auto mechanic, and he worked on the production line of a butter factory, among other gigs, before attending culinary school in hopes of becoming a chef. However, he soon realized it wasn't really what he wanted out of life and went to college, earning an undergraduate degree in physics from Carleton College and a PhD in mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan. After 10 years as an engineer, he switched focus again and became more serious about his side hobby, perfumery. \"Not being in kitchens anymore, I thought—this is a way to keep that little flavor part of my brain engaged,\" Peterson told Ars. \"I was doing problem sets all day. It was my escape to the sensory realm. 'OK, my brain is melting—I need a completely different thing to do. Let me go smell smells, escape to my little scent desk.'\" He and his wife, Jane Larson, founded Sfumato, which led to opening Castalia, and Peterson finally found his true calling. Peterson spent years conducting mixology experiments to gather empirical data about the interplay between scent and flavor, correct ratios of ingredients, temperature, and dilution for all the classic cocktails—seeking a \"Platonic ideal,\" for each, if you will. He supplemented this with customer feedback data from the drinks served at Castalia. All that culminated inCocktail Theory,which delves into the chemistry of scent and taste, introducing readers to flavor profiles, textures, visual presentation, and other factors that contribute to one's enjoyment (or lack thereof) of a cocktail. And yes, there are practical tips for building your own home bar, as well as recipes for many of Castalia's signature drinks. In essence, Peterson's work adds scientific rigor to what is frequently called the \"Mr. Potato Head\" theory of cocktails, a phrase coined by the folks atDeath & Company, who operate several craft cocktail bars in key cities. \"Let's say you've got some classic cocktail, a daiquiri, that has this many parts of rum, this many parts of lime, this many parts of sugar,\" said Peterson, who admits to having a Mr. Potato Head doll sitting on Castalia's back bar in honor of the sobriquet. \"You can think about each ingredient in a more general way: instead of rum, this is the spirit; instead of lime, this is the citrus; sugars are sweetener. Now you can start to replace those things with other things in the same categories.\" We caught up with Peterson to learn more. Ars Technica: How did you start thinking about the interplay between perfumery and cocktail design and the role that aroma plays in each? Kevin Peterson: The first step was from food over to perfumery, where I think about building a flavor for a soup, for a sauce, for a curry, in a certain way. \"Oh, there's a gap here that needs to be filled in by some herbs, some spice.\" It's almost an intuitive kind of thing. When I was making scents, I had those same ideas: \"OK, the shape of this isn't quite right. I need this to roughen it up or to smooth out this edge.\" Then I did the same thing for cocktails and realized that those two worlds didn't really talk to each other. You've got two groups of people that study all the sensory elements and how to create the most intriguing sensory impression, but they use different language; they use different toolkits. They're going for almost the same thing, but there was very little overlap between the two. So I made that my niche: What can perfumery teach bartenders? What can the cocktail world teach perfumery? Ars Technica: In perfumery you talk about a top, a middle, and a base note. There must be an equivalent in cocktail theory? Kevin Peterson: In perfumery, that is mostly talking about the time element: top notes perceived first, then middle notes, then base notes as you wear it over the course of a few hours. In the cocktail realm, there is that time element as well. You get some impression when you bring the glass to your nose, something when you sip, something in the aftertaste. But there can also be a spatial element. Some things you feel right at the tip of your tongue, some things you feel in different parts of your face and head, whether that's a literal impression or you just kind of feel it somewhere where there's not a literal nerve ending. It's about filling up that space, or not filling it up, depending on what impression you're going for—building out the full sensory space. Ars Technica: You also talk about motifs and supportive effects or ornamental flourishes: themes that you can build on in cocktails. Kevin Peterson: Something I see in the cocktail world occasionally is that people just put a bunch of ingredients together and figure, \"This tastes fine.\" But what were you going for here? There are 17 things in here, and it just kind of tastes like you were finger painting: \"Hey, I made brown.\" Brown is nice. But the motifs that I think about—maybe there's just one particular element that I want to highlight. Say I've got this really great jasmine essence. Everything else in the blend is just there to highlight the jasmine. If you're dealing with a really nice mezcal or bourbon or some unique herb or spice, that's going to be the centerpiece. You're not trying to get overpowered by some smoky scotch, by some other more intense ingredient. The motif could just be a harmonious combination of elements. I think the perfect old-fashioned is where everything is present and nothing's dominating. It's not like the bitters or the whiskey totally took over. There's the bitters, there's a little bit of sugar, there's the spirit. Everything's playing nicely. Another motif, I call it a jazz note. A Sazerac is almost the same as an old-fashioned, but it's got a little bit of absinthe in it. You get all the harmony of the old-fashioned, but then you're like, \"Wait, what's this weird thing pulling me off to the side? Oh, this absinthe note is kind of separate from everything else that's going on in the drink.\" It's almost like that tension in a musical composition: \"Well, these notes sound nice, but then there's one that's just weird.\" But that's what makes it interesting, that weird note. For me, formalizing some of those motifs help me make it clearer. Even if I don't tell that to the guest during the composition stage, I know this is the effect I'm going for. It helps me build more intentionally when I've got a motif in mind. Ars Technica: I tend to think about cocktails more in terms of chemistry, but there are many elements to taste and perception and flavor. You talk about ingredient matching, molecular matching, and impression matching, i.e., how certain elements will overlap in the brain. What role do each of those play? Kevin Peterson: A lot of those ideas relate to how we pair scents with cocktails. At my perfume company, we make eight fragrances as our main line. Each scent then gets a paired drink on the cocktail menu. For example, this scent has coriander, cardamom, and nutmeg. What does it mean that the drink is paired with that? Does it need to literally have coriander, cardamom, and nutmeg in it? Does it need to have every ingredient? If the scent has 15 things, do I need to hit every note? The literal matching is the most obvious. \"This has cardamom, that has cardamom.\" I can see how that pairs. The molecular matching is essentially just one more step removed: Rosemary has alpha-pinene in it, and juniper berries have alpha-pinene in them. So if the scent has rosemary and the cocktail has gin, they're both sharing that same molecule, so it's still exciting that same scent receptor. What I'm thinking about is kind of resonant effects. You're approaching the same receptor or the same neural structure in two different ways, and you're creating a bigger peak with that. The most hand-wavy one to me is the impression matching. Rosemary smells cold, and Fernet-Branca tastes cold even when it's room temperature. If the scent has rosemary, is Fernet now a good match for that? Some of the neuroscience stuff that I've read has indicated that these more abstract ideas are represented by the same sort of neural-firing patterns. Initially, I was hesitant; cold and cold, it doesn't feel as fulfilling to me. But then I did some more reading and realized there's some science behind it and have been more intrigued by that lately. Ars Technica: You do come up with some surprising flavor combinations, like a drink that combined blueberry and horseradish, which frankly sounds horrifying. Kevin Peterson: It was a hit on the menu. I would often give people a little taste of the blueberry and then a little taste of the horseradish tincture, and they'd say, \"Yeah, I don't like this.\" And then I'd serve them the cocktail, and they'd be like, \"Oh my gosh, it actually worked. I can't believe it.\"  Part of the beauty is you take a bunch of things that are at least not good and maybe downright terrible on their own, and then you stir them all together and somehow it's lovely. That's basically alchemy right there. Ars Technica: Harmony between scent and the cocktail is one thing, but you also talk about constructive interference to get a surprising, unexpected, and yet still pleasurable result. Kevin Peterson: The opposite is destructive interference, where there's just too much going on. When I'm coming up with a drink, sometimes that'll happen, where I'm adding more, but the flavor impression is going down. It's sort of a weird non-linearity of flavor, where sometimes two plus two equals four, sometimes it equals three, sometimes it equals 17. I now have intuition about that, having been in this world for a lot of years, but I still get surprised sometimes when I put a couple things together. Often with my end-of-the-shift drink, I'll think, \"Oh, we got this new bottle in. I'm going to try that in a Negroni variation.\" Then I lose track and finish mopping, and then I sip, and I'm like, \"What? Oh my gosh, I did not see this coming at all.\" That little spark, or whatever combo creates that, will then often be the first step on some new cocktail development journey. Ars Technica: Smoked cocktails are a huge trend right now. What's the best way to get a consistently good smoky element? Kevin Peterson: Smoke is tricky to make repeatable. How many parts per million of smoke are you getting in the cocktail? You could standardize the amount of time that it's in the box [filled with smoke]. Or you could always burn, say, exactly three grams of hickory or whatever. One thing that I found, because I was writing the book while still running the bar: People have a lot of expectations around how the drink is going to be served. Big ice cubes are not ideal for serving drinks, but people want a big ice cube in their old-fashioned. So we're still using big ice cubes. There might be a Platonic ideal in terms of temperature, dilution, etc., but maybe it's not the ideal in terms of visuals or tactile feel, and that is a part of the experience. With the smoker, you open the doors, smoke billows out, your drink emerges from the smoke, and people say, \"Wow, this is great.\" So whether you get 100 PPM one time and 220 PPM the next, maybe that gets outweighed by the awesomeness of the presentation. If I'm trying to be very dialed in about it, I'll either use a commercial smoky spirit—Laphroaig scotch, a smoky mezcal—where I decide that a quarter ounce is the amount of smokiness that I want in the drink. I can just pour the smoke instead of having to burn and time it. Or I might even make my own smoke: light something on fire and then hold it under a bottle, tip it back up, put some vodka or something in there, shake it up. Now I've got smoke particles in my vodka. Maybe I can say, \"OK, it's always going to be one milliliter,\" but then you miss out on the presentation—the showmanship, the human interaction, the garnish. I rarely garnish my own drinks, but I rarely send a drink out to a guest ungarnished, even if it's just a simple orange peel. Ars Technica: There's always going to be an element of subjectivity, particularly when it comes to our sensory perceptions. Sometimes you run into a person who just can't appreciate a certain note. Kevin Peterson: That was something I grappled with. On the one hand, we're all kind of living in our own flavor world. Some people are more sensitive to bitter. Different scent receptors are present in different people. It's tempting to just say, \"Well, everything's so unique. Maybe we just can't say anything about it at all.\" But that's not helpful either. Somehow, we keep having delicious food and drink and scents that come our way. I've been taking a lot of survey data in my bar more recently, and definitely the individuality of preference has shown through in the surveys. But another thing that has shown through is that there are some universal trends. There are certain categories. There's the spirit-forward, bittersweet drinkers, there's the bubbly citrus folks, there's the texture folks who like vodka soda. What is the taste? What is the aroma? It's very minimal, but it's a very intense texture. Having some awareness of that is critical when you're making drinks. One of the things I was going for in my book was to find, for example, the platonically ideal gin and tonic. What are the ratios? What is the temperature? How much dilution to how much spirit is the perfect amount? But if you don't like gin and tonics, it doesn't matter if it's a platonically ideal gin and tonic. So that's my next project. It's not just getting the drink right. How do you match that to the right person? What questions do I have to ask you, or do I have to give you taste tests? How do I draw that information out of the customer to determine the perfect drink for them? We offer a tasting menu, so our full menu is eight drinks, and you get a mini version of each drink. I started giving people surveys when they would do the tasting menu, asking, \"Which drink do you think you like the most? Which drink do you think you like the least?\" I would have them rate it. Less than half of people predicted their most liked and least liked, meaning if you were just going to order one drink off the menu, your odds are less than a coin flip that you would get the right drink. Ars Technica: How does all this tie into your \"cocktails as storytelling\" philosophy? Kevin Peterson: So much of flavor impression is non-verbal. Scent is very hard to describe. You can maybe describe taste, but we only have five-ish words, things like bitter, sour, salty, sweet. There's not a whole lot to say about that: \"Oh, it was perfectly balanced.\" So at my bar, when we design menus, we'll put the drinks together, but then we'll always give the menu a theme. The last menu that we did was the scientist menu, where every drink was made in honor of some scientist who didn't get the credit they were due in the time they were alive. Having that narrative element, I think, helps people remember the drink better. It helps them in the moment to latch onto something that they can more firmly think about. There's a conceptual element. If I'm just doing chores around the house, I drink a beer, it doesn't need to have a conceptual element. If I'm going out and spending money and it's my night and I want this to be a more elevated experience, having that conceptual tie-in is an important part of that. Ars Technica: Do you have any simple tips for people who are interested in taking their cocktail game to the next level? Kevin Peterson:  Old-fashioneds are the most fragile cocktail. You have to get all the ratios exactly right. Everything has to be perfect for an old-fashioned to work. Anecdotally, I've gotten a lot of old-fashioneds that were terrible out on the town. In contrast, the Negroni is the most robust drink. You can miss the ratios. It's got a very wide temperature and dilution window where it's still totally fine. I kind of thought of them in the same way prior to doing the test. Then I found that this band of acceptability is much bigger for the Negroni. So now I think of old-fashioneds as something that either I make myself or I order when I either trust the bartender or I'm testing someone who wants to come work for me. My other general piece of advice: It can be a very daunting world to try to get into. You may say, \"Oh, there's all these classics that I'm going to have to memorize, and I've got to buy all these weird bottles.\" My advice is to pick a drink you like and take baby steps away from that drink. Say you like Negronis. That's three bottles: vermouth, Campari, and gin. Start with that. When you finish that bottle of gin, buy a different type of gin. When you finish the Campari, try a different bittersweet liqueur. See if that's going to work. You don't have to drop hundreds of dollars, thousands of dollars, to build out a back bar. You can do it with baby steps. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "FTC now has three Republicans and no Democrats instead of the typical 3-2 split",
    "article_text": "Senate puts third Republican on FTC while two Democrats sue Trump over firings. The Federal Trade Commission now has three commissioners, and all of them are Republicans. The FTC historically had a 3–2 partisan split, with the president's party having a one-seat advantage. But President Trumpfired FTC Democrats Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughterlast month, and the Senate yesterday confirmed Trump nominee Mark Meador to the agency's third Republican spot. The Senatevote was 50–46and went along party lines. \"I respect Mr. Meador's qualifications and his prior experiences... But I cannot support the confirmation of any additional members to the FTC until Commissioner Slaughter and Commissioner Bedoya are reinstated,\" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)said yesterday. \"President Trump's dismissal of Commissioners Slaughter and Bedoya is not only illegal; it hurts consumers and small businesses by undermining the independence of the Agency that Congress established to protect consumers from fraud, scams, and monopoly power. An independent FTC is critical for protecting consumers and has done so in a bipartisan manner for over 110 years.\" The consumer protection and competition agency will now operate with a 3–0 Republican advantage while the two Democrats ousted by Trump seek a court order that would reinstate them. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson, who previously backed Trump's authority to fire commissioners,saidthat Meador \"is a brilliant antitrust lawyer who will be a great asset to the Trump-Vance FTC.\" Meador was previously a visiting fellow at the Heritage Foundation Tech Policy Center, an antitrust and competition policy counsel for Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), a trial attorney for the Justice Department during Trump's first term, and an attorney at the FTC. A 3–0 Republican advantage helps Trump extend the executive branch's control over agencies that historically operated independently from the White House. Trump previouslyissued an executive orderdeclaring \"Presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch,\" while the White House said the order applies to \"so-called independent agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\" After declaring the FTC to be under White House control, Trump fired both Democratic members despite a US law and Supreme Court precedent stating that the president cannot fire commissioners without good cause. House Commerce Committee leaders said the all-Republican FTC will end the \"partisan mismanagement\" allegedly seen under the Biden-era FTC and then-Chair Lina Khan. \"In the last administration, the FTC abandoned its rich bipartisan tradition and historical mission, in favor of a radical agenda and partisan mismanagement,\" said astatementissued by Reps. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky) and Gus Bilirakis (R-Fla.). \"The Commission needs to return to protecting Americans from bad actors and preserving competition in the marketplace.\" Consumer advocacy group Public KnowledgethankedSenate Democrats for voting against Meador. \"In order for the FTC to be effective, it needs to have fiveindependentcommissioners doing the work,\" said Sara Collins, the group's director of government affairs. \"By voting 'no' on this confirmation, these senators have shown that it is still important to prioritize protecting consumers and supporting a healthier marketplace over turning a blind eye to President Trump's unlawful termination of Democratic Commissioners Slaughter and Bedoya.\" The two Democrats arechallenging the firingsin a lawsuit that said \"it is bedrock, binding precedent that a President cannot remove an FTC Commissioner without cause.\" Trump \"purported to terminate Plaintiffs as FTC Commissioners, not because they were inefficient, neglectful of their duties, or engaged in malfeasance, but simply because their 'continued service on the FTC is' supposedly 'inconsistent with [his] Administration's priorities,'\" the lawsuit said. US law says an FTC commissioner \"may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" A 1935 Supreme Court ruling said that \"Congress intended to restrict the power of removal to one or more of those causes.\" Slaughter and Bedoya sued Trump in US District Court for the District of Columbia and asked the court to declare \"the President's purported termination of Plaintiffs Slaughter and Bedoya unlawful and that Plaintiffs Slaughter and Bedoya are Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Quantum hardware may be a good match for AI",
    "article_text": "New manuscript describes analyzing image data in a quantum processor. Concerns about AI's energy use have a lot of people looking into ways tocut down on its power requirements. Many of these focus on hardware and software approaches that are pretty straightforward extensions of existing technologies. But a few technologies are much farther out there. One that's definitely in the latter category? Quantum computing. In some ways, quantum hardware is a better match for some of the math that underlies AI than more traditional hardware. While the current quantum hardware is a bit too error-prone for the more elaborate AI models currently in use, researchers are starting to put the pieces in place to run AI models when the hardware is ready. This week, a couple of commercial interests are releasing a draft of a paper describing how to get classical image data into a quantum processor (actually, two different processors) and perform a basic AI image classification. All of which gives us a great opportunity to discuss why quantum AI may be more than just hype. Just as there are many machine-learning techniques that fall under the AI umbrella, there are many ways to potentially use quantum computing to perform some aspect of an AI algorithm. Some are simply matters of math; some forms of machine learning require, for example, many matrix operations, which can be performed efficiently on quantum hardware. (Here is a good reviewof all the ways quantum hardware might help machine learning.) But there are also ways in which the quantum hardware can be a good match for AI. One of the challenges of running AI on traditional computing hardware is that the processing and memory are separate. To run something like a neural network requires repeated trips to memory to look up which destination signals from one artificial neuron need to be sent to and what weight to assign each signal. This creates a major bottleneck. Quantum computers don't have that sort of separation. While they could include some quantum memory, the data is generally housed directly in the qubits, while computation involves performing operations, called gates, directly on the qubits themselves. In fact, there has been a demonstration that, for supervised machine learning, where a system can learn to classify items after training on pre-classified data, a quantum system canoutperform classical ones, even when the data being processed is housed on classical hardware. This form of machine learning relies on what are called variational quantum circuits. This is a two-qubit gate operation that takes an additional factor that can be held on the classical side of the hardware and imparted to the qubits via the control signals that trigger the gate operation. You can think of this as analogous to the communications involved in a neural network, with the two-qubit gate operation equivalent to the passing of information between two artificial neurons and the factor analogous to the weight given to the signal. That's exactly the system that a team fromthe Honda Research Instituteworked on in collaboration with a quantum software company calledBlue Qubit. The focus of the new work was mostly on how to get data from the classical world into the quantum system for characterization. But the researchers ended up testing the results on two different quantum processors. The problem they were testing is one of image classification. The raw material was from the Honda Scenes dataset, which has images taken from roughly 80 hours of driving in Northern California; the images are tagged with information about what's in the scene. And the question the researchers wanted the machine learning to handle was a simple one: Is it snowing in the scene? All the images were sitting on classical hardware, of course. To classify an image on quantum hardware, it had to be converted to quantum information for processing. The team tried three methods of encoding the data, which differed in terms of how the pixels of the images were sliced up and how many qubits the resulting slices were sent to. The researchers used a classical simulator of a quantum processor to do the training steps, which identified the appropriate numbers—again, think in terms of the weights of a neural network—to use during the two-qubit gate operations. They then ran the hardware on two different quantum processors. One, from IBM, has a lot of qubits (156) but a slightly higher error rate during gate operations. The second is from Quantinuum and is notable for having a very low error rate during operations, but it only has 56 qubits. In general, the accuracy of the classification went up as the researchers used more qubits or as they ran more gates. In general, though, the system worked; accuracies were well above what you'd expect from random chance. At the same time, they were generally lower than what you'd get from a standard algorithm run on normal hardware. We're still not at the point where existing hardware has both enough qubits and a low enough error rate to be competitive on classical hardware. Still, the work was clearly able to show that real-world quantum hardware is capable of running the sorts of AI algorithms that people have been expecting it to. But like everyone else, people hoping to solve useful problems will have to wait for further improvements on the hardware side.

    "title": "Experimental drug looks to be gastric bypass surgery in pill form",
    "article_text": "Daily drug creates temporary coating in small intestine. The booming popularity of Ozempic and otherGLP-1 drugsfor weight loss has led to a flurry of companies vying to makenew and improved anti-obesity medications. One of those is Boston-based Syntis Bio, which is working on a daily pill that mimics the effects of gastric bypass—no actual surgery required. Today, the company announced early data from animals and a small group of human volunteers showing that its approach is safe and may be able to suppress hunger. The company presented the findings Thursday at the European Congress on Obesity and Weight Management. “We're at a stage with obesity treatment where it's important for us to figure out, how do we now tune it to be more effective?” says Rahul Dhanda, Syntis Bio’s CEO and cofounder. Apoll conducted in April and May of 2024found that around 12 percent of Americans have tried a GLP-1 drug such as Ozempic, Wegovy, Zepbound, or Mounjaro—a number that has likely only grown over the past year. But many people eventually stop using these drugs. Cost and insurance coverage is one factor. Another is that GLP-1s can cause nausea, vomiting, and other unpleasant side effects. And some patients would prefer a pill over a weekly injection. Syntis is aiming to develop another option for people looking to lose weight. The company’s drug is designed to redirect the absorption of nutrients from the beginning of the small intestine to its end. The effect is similar to gastric bypass, in which surgeons make the stomach smaller and shorten the small intestine. As a result, food bypasses much of the small intestine. The procedure changes how the body absorbs food and leaves people feeling fuller from eating less. Gastric bypass is a type of bariatric surgery, which an estimated 280,000 people receivedin 2022.But fewer people are turning to surgery with the advent of new anti-obesity medications. A study published last year inJAMA Open Networkfound that as prescriptions for GLP-1s skyrocketed between 2022 and 2023, rates of bariatric surgery dropped 25.6 percent. The drug Syntis is working on does not actually shorten the intestine, like gastric bypass does. Instead, it creates a temporary coating in the upper part of the small intestine, blocking the absorption of nutrients there. This moves nutrients down to the lower part of the small intestine, where satiety hormones—including GLP-1—are triggered. It does this with two main ingredients: dopamine, a small molecule best known for its relation to the brain, and a tiny amount of hydrogen peroxide. When this combination reaches the small intestine, it comes into contact with a naturally occurring enzyme called catalase. The job of catalase is to break down hydrogen peroxide, which is harmful to the body in high amounts, into water and oxygen. The process converts the dopamine into polydopamine, a biocompatible polymer. Within minutes, a thin film of polydopamine forms that coats the lining of the small intestine. The cells in this lining turn over quickly, so the coating is only temporary. It’s designed to last around 24 hours. The drug is based on research conducted at MIT by Giovanni Traverso, a gastroenterologist and mechanical engineer, and Robert Langer, a chemical engineer who has launched more than two dozen biotech companies. The two discovered the mechanism when working on a way to develop liquid drug formulations that could be given to children. They soon realized they could make this temporary synthetic coating more or less permeable, to either enhance absorption or slow it down. That latter ability was appealing as a treatment for obesity. “This material is something you would take as a capsule or liquid, but the next day it's gone because of the natural turnover of our mucosal surface in the GI tract,” Traverso says. He and Langer cofounded Syntis with Dhanda in 2022. He likens this coating to what mussels and other shellfish use to stick to rocks or the ocean floor. In the results Syntis announced, the drug was delivered in a liquid form via a tube directly to the small intestine so that researchers could check that the polymer coating formed as expected. A tablet form has already been tested in pigs and dogs, and it’s what Syntis plans to test in future human studies. In rats, the drug produced a consistent 1 percent weekly weight loss over a six-week study period while preserving 100 percent of lean muscle mass. In a first-in-human pilot study of nine participants, the drug was safe with no adverse effects. Tissue samples taken from the intestine were used to confirm that the coating formed and was also cleared from the body within 24 hours. The study wasn’t designed to assess weight loss, but blood testing showed that after the drug was given, glucose levels and the “hunger hormone” ghrelin were lower while the levels of leptin, an appetite-regulating hormone, were higher. “When nutrients are redirected to later in the intestine, you're activating pathways that lead towards satiety, energy expenditure, and overall healthy, sustainable weight loss,” Dhanda says. Syntis Bio’s findings in animals also hint at the drug’s potential for weight loss without compromising muscle mass, one of the concerns with current GLP-1 drugs. While weight loss in general is associated with numerous health benefits, there’sgrowingevidencethat the kind of drastic weight loss that GLP-1s induce can also lead to a loss of lean muscle mass. Louis Aronne, an obesity medicine specialist and professor of metabolic research at Weill-Cornell Medical College, says that while GLP-1s are wildly popular, they may not be right for everyone. He predicts that in the not-so-distant future there will be many drugs for obesity, and treatment will be more personalized. “I think Syntis’ compound fits in perfectly as a treatment that could be used early on. It’s a kind of thing you could use as a first-line medication,” he says. Arrone serves as a clinical adviser to the company. Vladimir Kushnir, professor of medicine and director of bariatric endoscopy at Washington University in St. Louis, who isn’t involved with Syntis, says the early pilot data is encouraging, but it’s hard to draw any conclusions from such a small study. He expects that the drug will make people feel fuller but could also have some of the same side effects as gastric bypass surgery. “My anticipation is that this is going to have some digestive side effects like bloating and abdominal cramping, as well as potentially some diarrhea and nausea once it gets into a bigger study,” he says. It’s early days for this novel technique, but if it proves effective, it could one day be an alternative or add-on drug to GLP-1 medications. This story originally appeared onwired.com.

    "title": "Trump White House budget proposal eviscerates science funding at NASA",
    "article_text": "\"This would decimate American leadership in space.\" This week, as part of the process to develop a budget for fiscal-year 2026, the Trump White House shared the draft version of its budget request for NASA with the space agency. This initial version of the administration's budget request calls for an approximately 20 percent overall cut to the agency's budget across the board, effectively $5 billion from an overall topline of about $25 billion. However, the majority of the cuts are concentrated within the agency's Science Mission Directorate, which oversees all planetary science, Earth science, astrophysics research, and more. According to the \"passback\" documents given to NASA officials on Thursday, the space agency's science programs would receive nearly a 50 percent cut in funding. After the agency received $7.5 billion for science in fiscal-year 2025, the Trump administration has proposed a science topline budget of just $3.9 billion for the coming fiscal year. Among the proposals were: A two-thirds cut to astrophysics, down to $487 million; a greater than two-thirds cut to heliophysics, down to $455 million; a greater than 50 percent cut to Earth science, down to $1.033 billion; and a 30 percent cut to Planetary science, down to $1.929 billion. Although the budget would continue support for ongoing missions such as the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope, it would kill the much-anticipated Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, an observatory seen as on par with those two world-class instruments that is already fully assembled and on budget for a launch in two years. \"Passback supports continued operation of the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes and assumes no funding is provided for other telescopes,\" the document states. Other significant cuts include ending funding for Mars Sample Return as well as the DAVINCI mission to Venus. The budget cuts also appear intended to force the closure of Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, where the agency has 10,000 civil servants and contractors. The cuts are in line with whatArs Technica exclusively reported last month, that the Trump administration was considering a massive 50-percent cut to NASA's science programs. Publicly, some officials downplayed these concerns. As recently as this week, NASA's acting administrator, Janet Petro,characterized this reportingas \"rumors from really not credible sources.\" However, science policy experts have been more alarmed, characterizing such cuts as an \"extinction level\" event for what is seen as the crown jewel of the space agency. Nearly all of NASA's most significant achievements over the last 25 years have been delivered by the science programs, including feats such asIngenuityflying on Mars, New Horizons swooping by Pluto, and Cassini's discovery of water plumes on Enceladus. This passback document represents just the opening salvo of the process to establish a federal budget for fiscal-year 2026, which begins on October 1 of this year. The budget is produced by the White House Office of Management and Budget, which is overseen by Russell Vought, who has longmade his anti-science budgeting priorities clearthrough his Center for Renewing America. The Trump administration nominee to lead NASA, private astronaut Jared Isaacman, said during aconfirmation hearing this weekthat he strongly supported NASA's science programs. It is unlikely that Isaacman was involved in drafting this document, as he has not yet been confirmed by the US Senate. Nominees, typically, are excluded from policy prior to confirmation. After receiving passback documents, NASA usually has 72 hours to review the materials and then submit appeals and justification for changes. Any modifications are then incorporated into a final document that becomes the \"President's Budget Request\" for the next fiscal year. It is unclear when the Trump administration plans to release this budget request, a public document. It could happen within the next four to six weeks. Following this, the White House will work with Congress to actually set the budget. The US House and Senate each have separate appropriations committees that consider (or not) the White House priorities in establishing a final budget that the president must then sign into law. Fierce opposition to some of these NASA cuts is likely in Congress. \"This massive cut to NASA Science will not stand,\" US Rep. George Whitesides, D-California, told Ars. \"For weeks we have been raising the alarm about a rumored 50 percent cut to NASA's world-leading science efforts. Now we know it is true. I will work alongside my colleagues on the Science Committee to make clear how this would decimate American leadership in space and inflict great damage to NASA centers across the country.\" One concern, however, is that should the budgeting process be delayed—as is often the case with the federal budget—the White House could force agencies to make operational plans based on the president's budget request once the new fiscal year begins on October 1. Again, this will depend on negotiations with Congress, but, using a process calledimpoundment,some Trump officials believe it may be possible to turn the budget request into an actual budget for all intents and purposes.

    "title": "Wheel of Time recap: The show nails one of the books’ biggest and bestest battles",
    "article_text": "With one episode left in the season, the screws tighten hard on our poor characters. Andrew Cunningham and Lee Hutchinson have spent decades of their lives with Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson'sWheel of Timebooks, and they previously brought that knowledge to bear as theyrecapped each first season episodeandsecond season episodeof Amazon'sWoTTV series. Now we're back in the saddle for season 3—along with insights, jokes, and the occasional wild theory. These recaps won't cover every element of every episode, but they will contain major spoilers for the show and the book series. We'll do our best to not spoil major future events from the books, but there's always the danger that something might slip out.If you want to stay completely unspoiled and haven't read the books, these recaps aren't for you. New episodes ofThe Wheel of Timeseason 3will be posted forAmazon Primesubscribers every Thursday. This write-up covers episode seven, \"Goldeneyes,\" which was released on April 10. For example! When the Cauthon sisters fricassee Eamon Valda to avenge their mother and Alanna laughs joyfully at the sight of his charred corpse?That'sa death you ain't coming back from. Even assuming that Loial's plot armor has fallen off, the way we've seen the show shift and consolidate storylines means it's impossible to say how the presence or absence of one character or another couple ripple outward. This episode alone introduces a bunch of fairly major shifts that could play out in unpredictable ways next season. But let's back up! The show takes a break from its usual hopping and skipping to focus entirely on one plot thread this week: Perrin's adventures in the Two Rivers. This is a Big Book Moment; how do you think it landed? Though it was a hell of a battle, yeah. The improvements in pulling off large set pieces continues to scale from season to season—comparing this battle to the Bel Tine fight back in the first bits of season 1 shows not just better visual effects or whatever, but just flat-out better composition and clearer storytelling. The show continues to prove that it has found its footing. Did the reprise of the Manetheren song work for you? This has been sticky for me—Iwantto like it. I see what the writers are trying to do, and I see how “this is a song we all just kind of grew up singing” is given new meaning when it springs from characters’ bloody lips on the battlefield. But it just… doesn’t work for me. It makes me feel cringey, and I wish it didn’t. It’s probably the only bit in the entire episode that I felt was a swing and a miss. Part of the point of the Two Rivers section inThe Shadow Risingis that it helps to back up something we've seen in our Two Rivers expats over the course of the first books in the series—that there is a hidden strength in this mostly ignored backwater of Randland. To the extent that the books are concerned with Themes, the two big overarching ones are that strength and resilience come from unexpected places and that heroism is what happens when regular, flawed, scared people step up and Do What Needs To Be Done under terrible circumstances. (This is pure Tolkien, and that's the difference betweenThe Wheel of TimeandA Song of Ice and Fire—WoTwants to build onLotR's themes andASoIaFis mainly focused on subverting them.) But to get back to what didn't work for you about this, the strength of the Two Rivers is meant to be more impressive and unexpected because these people all view themselves, mostly, as quiet farmers and hunters, not as the exiled heirs to some legendary kingdom (a la Malkier). They don't go around singing songs about How Virtuous And Bold Was Manetheren Of Old, or whatever. Manetheren is as distant to them as the Roman Empire, and those stories don't put food on the table. So yeah, it worked for me as an in-the-moment plot device. The show had already played the \"Perrin Rallies His Homeland With A Rousing Speech\" card once or twice, and you want to mix things up. I doubt it was even a blip for non-book-readers. But it is a case, as with the Cauthon sisters' Healing talents, where the show has to take what feels liketooshort a shortcut. In amongst the big moments were a bunch of nice little character bits, too—the kinds of things that keep me coming back to the show. Perrin’s glowering, teeth-gritted exchange with Whitecloak commander Dain Bornhald was great, though my favorite bit was the almost-throwaway moment where Perrin catches up with the Cauthon sisters and gives them an update on Mat. The two kids absolutely kill it, transforming from sober and traumatized young people into giggling little sisters immediately at the sight of their older brother’s sketch. Not even blowing the Horn of Valere can save you from being made fun of by your sisters. (The other thing that scene highlighted was that Perrin, seated, is about the same height as Faile standing. She’s tiny!) We also close the loop a bit on the Tinkers, who, after being present in flashback a couple of episodes ago, finally show back up on screen—complete with Aram, who has somewhat of a troubling role in the books. The guy seems to have a destiny that will take him away from his family, and that destiny grabs firmly ahold of him here. The entire Whitecloak subplot is something that stretches out interminably in the books, as many side-plots do. Valda lasts until Book 11 (!). Dain Bornhald holds his grudge against Perrin (still unresolved here, but on a path toward resolution) untilBook 14. The show has jumped around before, but I think this is the first time we've seen it pull something forward from that late, which it almost certainly needs to do more of if it hopes to get to the end in whatever time is allotted to it (we're still waiting for a season 4 renewal). This gets into the area of time that book readers commonly refer to as “The Slog,” which slogs at maximum slogginess around book 10 (which basically retreads all the events of book nine and shows us what all the second-string characters were up to while the starting players were off doing big world-changing things). Without doing any more criticizing than the implicit criticizing I’ve already done, The Slog is something I’m hoping that the show obviates or otherwise does away with, and I think we’re seeing the ways in which such slogginess will be shed. There are a few other things to wrap up here, I think, but this episode being so focused on a giant battle—and doing that battle well!—doesn’t leave us with a tremendous amount to recap. Do we want to get into Bain and Chiad trying to steal kisses from Loial? It’s not in the book—at least, I don’t think it was!—but it feels 100 percent in character for all involved. (Loial, of course, would never kiss outside of marriage.) I find myself starting each of these episodes by taking fairly detailed notes, and by the middle of the episode I catch myself having not written anything for minutes at a time because I am just enjoying watching the show. On the topic of structure and pacing, I will say that these episodes thatmaketime to focus on a single thread also make more room for quiet character moments. On the rare occasions that we get a less-than-frenetic episode I just wish we could have more of them. But Loial’s unexpected death (if indeed death it was) gives me pause.Arewe simply killing folks off left and right,Game of Thronesstyle? Has certain characters’ plot armor been removed? Are, shall we say,alternativesolutions to old narrative problems suddenly on the table in this new turning of the Wheel?I’m excited to see where this takes us—though I truly hope we’re not going to have to say goodbye to anyone else who matters. Closing thoughts, Andrew? Any moments you’d like to see? Things you’re afraid of? One way to keep the perspectives and plotlines from endlessly proliferating and recreating The Slog is simply to kill some of those people so they can't be around to slow things down. I am not saying one way or the other whether I think that's actually a series wrap on Loial, Son Of Arent, Son Of Halan, May His Name Sing In Our Ears, but we do probably have to come to terms with the fact that not all fan-favorite septenaryWheel of Timecharacters are going to make it to the end. As for fears, mainly I'm afraid of not getting another season at this point. The show is getting good enough at showing me big book moments that now I want to see a few more of them, y'know? But Economic Uncertainty + Huge Cast + International Shooting Locations + No More Unlimited Cash For Streaming Shows feels like an equation that is eventually going to stop adding up for this production. I really hope I'm wrong! But who am I to question the turning of the Wheel? Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "The Trek Madone SLR 9 AXS Gen 8 tears up the roads and conquers climbs",
    "article_text": "Trek's top-of-the-line performance road bike offers some surprises. When a cyclist sees theTrek Madone SLR 9 AXS Gen 8for the first time, the following thoughts run through their head, usually in this order: \"What a beautiful bike.\" \"Damn, that looks really fast.\" \"The owner of this bike is extremely serious about cycling and has a very generous budget for fitness gear.\" Indeed, almost every conversation I had while out and about on the Madone started and ended with the bike's looks and price tag. And for good reason. Credit:\n\n          \n          Eric Bangeman Let's get the obvious out of the way. This is an expensive and very high-tech bike, retailing at $15,999. Part of the price tag is the technology—this is a bicycle that rides on the bleeding edge of tech. And another part is the Project One Icon \"Tête de la Course\" paint job on the bike; less-flashy options start at $13,499. (And if $15,999 doesn't break your budget, there's an even fancier Icon \"Stellar\" paint scheme for an extra $1,000.) That's a pretty penny but not an unusual price point in the world of high-end road bikes. If you're shopping for, say, a Cervélo S5 or Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL8, you'll see the same price tags. Madone is Trek's performance-oriented road bike, and the Gen 8 is the latest and greatest from the Wisconsin-based bike manufacturer. It's more aerodynamic than the Gen 7 (with a pair of aero water bottles) and a few hundred grams weightier than Trek's recently discontinued Emonda climbing-focused bike. I put nearly 1,000 miles on the Gen 8 Madone over a two-month period, riding it on the roads around Chicagoland. Yes, the land around here is pretty flat, but out to the northwest there are some nice rollers, including a couple of short climbs with grades approaching 10 percent. Those climbs gave me a sense of the Madone's ability on hills. Trek manufactures the Gen 8 Madone out of its 900 series OCLV carbon, and at 15.54 lb (7.05 kg)—just a hair over UCI's minimum weight for racing bikes—the bike is 320 g lighter than the Gen 7. But high-tech bikes aren't just about lightweight carbon and expensive groupsets. Even the water bottles matter. During the development of the Gen 8 Madone, Trek realized the water bottles were nearly as important as the frame when it came to squeezing out every last possible aerodynamic gains. Perhaps the most obvious bit of aerodynamic styling is the diamond-shaped seat tube cutout. That cutout allows the seat tube to flex slightly on rougher pavement while cutting back on lateral flex. It's slightly smaller than on the Gen 7 Madone, and it looks odd, but it contributes to a surprisingly compliant ride quality. For the wheelset, Trek has gone with the Aeolus RSL for the Madone SLR 9. The tubeless-ready wheels offer a 51 mm rim depth and can handle a max tire size of 32 mm. Those wheels are paired with a set of 28 mm Bontrager Aeolus RSL TLR road tires. About four weeks into my testing, the rear tire developed what looked like a boil along one of the seams near the edge of the tire. Trek confirmed it was a manufacturing defect that occurred with a batch of tires due to a humidity-control issue within the factory, so affected tires should be out of stores by now. You'll pilot the Madone with Trek's new one-piece Aero RSL handlebar and stem combo. It's a stiff cockpit setup, but I found it comfortable enough even on 80-plus-mile rides. Visually, it's sleek-looking with a complete absence of wires (and the handlebar-stem combo can only be used with electronic groupsets). The downside is that there's not enough clearance for a Garmin bike computer with a standard mount; I had to use a $70 K-Edge mount to mount my Garmin. The Gen 8 Madone also replaces Trek's Emonda lineup of climbing-focused bikes. Despite weighing 36 grams more than the Emonda SLR 9, Trek claims the Gen 8 Madone has an 11.3 W edge over the climbing bike at 22 mph (and a more modest 0.1 W improvement over the Gen 7 Madone at the same speed). The first time I rode the Madone SLR 9 Gen 8 on my usual lunchtime route, I set a personal record. I wasn't shooting for a new PR—it just sort of happened while I was putting the bike through its paces to see what it was capable of. It turns out it's capable of a lot. Riding feels almost effortless. The Madone's outstanding SRAM Red AXS groupset contributes to that free-and-easy feeling. Shifting through the 12-speed 10-33 cassette is both slick and quick, perfect for when you really want to get to a higher gear in order to drop the hammer. At the front of the drivetrain is a 172.5 mm crank paired with 48t/35t chainrings, more than adequate for everything the local roads were able to confront me with. I felt faster on the flats and quicker through the corners, which led to more than a couple of hero pulls on group rides. The Madone also has a power meter, so you know exactly how many watts you cranked out on your rides. There's also a nice bit of future-proofing with the Madone. Lidl-Trek has been riding some of the cobbled classics with theSRAM Red XPLR AXS groupset, a 13-speed gravel drivetrain that doesn't need a derailleur hanger. Danish all-arounder Mads Pedersen rode a Madone SLR 9 Gen 8 with a single 56t chainring up front, paired with the Red XPLR tovictory at Gent-Wevelgemat the end of March. So if you want to spend another thousand or so on your dream bike setup, that's an option, as the Madone SLR 9 Gen 8 is one of the few high-performance road bikes that currently supports this groupset. Living in northeastern Illinois, I lacked opportunities to try the new Madone on extended climbs. Traversing the rollers in the far northwestern suburbs of Chicago, however, the bike's utility on climbs was apparent. Compared to my usual ride, an endurance-focused road bike, I felt like I was getting the first few seconds of a climb for free. The Madone felt lightweight, nimble, and responsive each time I hit an ascent. What surprised me the most about the Madone was its performance on long rides. I went into testing with the assumption that I would be trading speed for comfort—and I was happy to be proven wrong. The combination of Trek's aerodynamic frame design (which it calls IsoFlow), carbon wheelset, and tubeless tires really makes a difference on uneven pavement; there was almost no trade-off between pace and comfort. What didn't I like? The water bottles, mainly. My review bike came equipped with a pair ofTrek RSL Aero water bottles, which fit in a specially designed cage. Trek says the bottles offer 1.8 W of savings at 22 mph compared to round bottles. That's not worth it to me. The bottles hold less (~650 ml) than a regular water bottle and are irritating to fill, and getting them in and out of the RSL Aero cages takes a bit of awareness during the first few rides. Thankfully, you don't need to use the aero bottles; normal cylindrical water bottles work just fine. The price bears mentioning again. This is an expensive bike! If your cycling budget is massive and you want every last bit of aerodynamic benefit and weight savings, get the SLR 9 with your favorite paint job. Drop down to the Madone SLR 7, and you get the same frame with a Shimano Ultegra Di2 groupset, 52t/36t crank, and a 12-speed 11-30 cassette for $7,000 less than this SLR 9. The SL 7, with its 500 Series OCLV carbon frame (about 250 grams heavier), different handlebars and fork, and the same Ultegra Di2 groupset as the SLR 7 is $2,500 cheaper still. In conceiving the Gen 8 Madone, Trek prioritized aerodynamic performance and weight savings over all else. The result is a resounding, if expensive, success. The color-shifting Project One paint job is a treat for the eyes, as is the $13,499 Team Replica colorway—the same one seen on Lidl-Trek's bikes on the UCI World Tour. At the end of the day, though, looks come a distant second to performance. And with the Gen 8 Madone, performance is the winner by a mile. Trek has managed to take a fast, aerodynamic road bike and make it faster and more aerodynamic without sacrificing compliance. The result is a technological marvel—not to mention a very expensive bike—that is amazing to ride. Let me put it another way—the Madone made me feel like a boss on the roads. My daily driver is no slouch—a 5-year-old endurance bike with SRAM Red, a Reserve Turbulent Aero 49/42 wheelset, and Continental GP5000s, which I dearly love. But during my two-plus months with the Madone, I didn't miss my bike at all. I was instead fixated on riding the Madone, dreaming of long rides and new PRs. That's the way it should be.

    "title": "Researcher uncovers dozens of sketchy Chrome extensions with 4 million installs",
    "article_text": "Even weirder: Why would Google give so many the \"Featured\" stamp for trustworthiness? Google is hosting dozens of extensions in its Chrome Web Store that perform suspicious actions on the more than 4 million devices that have installed them and that their developers have taken pains to carefully conceal. The extensions, which so far number at least 35, use the same code patterns, connect to some of the same servers, and require the same list of sensitive systems permissions, including the ability to interact with web traffic on all URLs visited, access cookies, manage browser tabs, and execute scripts. In more detail, the permissions are: These sorts of permissions give extensions the ability to do all sorts of potentially abusive things and, as such, should be judiciously granted only to trusted extensions that can’t perform core functions without them. “At this point, this information should be enough for any organization to reasonably kick this out of their environment as it presents unnecessary risk,” John Tuckner, founder of browser extension analysis firm Secure Annex and the researcher who stumbled on the cluster of extensions, wrote in apost published Thursday. In an email, he said the only permission required for some extensions is management. “Some of the other extensions like the 'Browse Securey' might traditionally require more permissions like 'webRequest' to block malicious sites, but things like access to 'cookies' are definitely not needed across the full list,” he said. The extensions share other dubious or suspicious similarities. Much of the code in each one is highly obfuscated, a design choice that provides no benefit other than complicating the process for analyzing and understanding how it behaves. All but one of them areunlistedin the Chrome Web Store. This designation makes an extension visible only to users with the long pseudorandom string in the extension URL, and thus, they don’t appear in the Web Store or search engine search results. It’s unclear how these 35 unlisted extensions could have fetched 4 million installs collectively, or on average roughly 114,000 installs per extension, when they were so hard to find. Additionally, 10 of them are stamped with the “Featured” designation, which Googlereservesfor developers whose identities have been verified and “follow our technical best practices and meet a high standard of user experience and design.” One example is the extensionFire Shield Extension Protection, which, ironically enough, purports to check Chrome installations for the presence of any suspicious or malicious extensions. One of the key JavaScript files it runs references several questionable domains, where they can upload data and download instructions and code: One domain in particular—unknow.com—is listed in the remaining 34 apps. Tuckner tried analyzing what extensions did on this site but was largely thwarted by the obfuscated code and other steps the developer took to conceal their behavior. When the researcher, for instance, ran the Fire Shield extension on a lab device, it opened a blank webpage. Clicking on the icon of an installed extension usually provides an option menu, but Fire Shield displayed nothing when he did it. Tuckner then fired up abackground service workerin the Chrome developer tools to seek clues about what was happening. He soon realized that the extension connected to a URL at fireshieldit.com and performed some action under the generic category “browser_action_clicked.” He tried to trigger additional events but came up empty-handed. So Tuckner tried a new tactic. He found a configuration someone haduploadedyears earlier to GitHub for Browse Securely for Chrome, another extension in his list (it has since changed its name toSecured Connection by Security Browse. The GitHub user who uploaded the file did so because they believed the extension was malicious. When Tuckner loaded the unique ID for this extension into his installation of Fire Shield, it suddenly started sending a variety of events to the server that tracked user behaviors, such as what websites he was visiting, what sites had preceded that visit, and the size of his display screen. The researcher still hasn’t found proof that Fire Shield or any of the other extensions are malicious, but what he saw was enough to remove all reasonable doubt. “While I could not find an instance of the extension exfiltrating credentials, this level of obfuscation, along with the ability for the extension’s configuration to be remotely controlled, and the capabilities in the browser extension’s code is enough for me to come to the same conclusion that all of these extensions include some kind of spyware or infostealer,” he wrote. “That is ultimately the problem and threat these extensions pose when they can be controlled remotely.” The discovery serves as the latest reminder that there are real-world consequences to installing extensions for Chrome, Firefox, or any other browser, just as there are consequences for installing phone apps. Google, Apple, and others continually nudge us to install as many of these as we can. This is poor advice. Extensions and apps should be installed only when they provide a benefit that can’t be obtained otherwise. Even then, they should be installed only after reading recent reviews to see what kind of experiences others have had and looking into the developer. These steps are particularly important when installing extensions or apps from Google, given the much higher incidence of malice being reported over the past decade from its offerings. The full list of extensions is: Extension IDs and other indicators of compromise appear in Thursday's post andthis spreadsheetcompiled by Tuckner. Anyone who has one of these extensions installed should remove it immediately. Google didn’t immediately respond to questions asking if the company is investigating and what vetting it performed in awarding the Featured designation to some of these apps. Questions sent to some of the email addresses listed in the extension policies also didn't receive responses. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "“What the hell are you doing?” How I learned to interview astronauts, scientists, and billionaires",
    "article_text": "The best part about journalism is not collecting information. It's sharing it. I recentlywrote a storyabout the wild ride of the Starliner spacecraft to the International Space Station last summer. It was based largely on an interview with the commander of the mission, NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore. His account of Starliner’s thruster failures—and his desperate efforts to keep the vehicle flying on course—was riveting. In the aftermath of the story, many readers, people on social media, and real-life friends congratulated me on conducting a great interview. But truth be told, it was pretty much all Wilmore. Essentially, when I came into the room, he was primed to talk. I'm not sure if Wilmore was waiting for me specifically to talk to, but he pretty clearly wanted to speak with someone about his experiences aboard the Starliner spacecraft. And he chose me. So was it luck? I’ve been thinking about that. As an interviewer, I certainly don’t have the emotive power of some of the great television interviewers, who are masters of confrontation and drama. It's my nature to avoid confrontation where possible. But what I do have on my side is experience, more than 25 years now, as well as preparation. I am also genuinely and completely interested in space. And as it happens, these values are important, too. Interviewing is a craft one does not pick up overnight. During my career, I have had some funny, instructive, and embarrassing moments. Without wanting to seem pretentious or self-indulgent, I thought it might be fun to share some of those stories so you can really understand what it’s like on a reporter’s side of the cassette tape. I had only been working professionally as a reporter at the Houston Chronicle for a few years (and as the newspaper’s science writer for less time still) when the opportunity to interview Stephen Hawking fell into my lap. What a coup! He was only the world’s most famous living scientist, and he was visiting Texas at the invitation of a local billionaire named George Mitchell. A wildcatter and oilman, Mitchell had grown up in Galveston along the upper Texas coast, marveling at the stars as a kid. He studied petroleum engineering and later developed the controversial practice of fracking. In his later years, Mitchell spent some of his largesse on the pursuits of his youth, including astronomy and astrophysics. This included bringing Hawking to Texas more than half a dozen times in the 1990s and early 2000s. For an interview with Hawking, one submitted questions in advance. That's because Hawking was afflicted with Lou Gehrig's disease and lost the ability to speak in 1985. A computer attached to his wheelchair cycled through letters and sounds, and Hawking clicked a button to make a selection, forming words and then sentences, which were sent to a voice synthesizer. For unprepared responses, it took a few minutes to form a single sentence. What to ask him? I had a decent understanding of astronomy, having majored in it as an undergraduate. But the readership of a metro newspaper was not interested in the Hubble constant or the Schwarzschild radius. I asked him about recent discoveries of the cosmic microwave background radiation anyway. Perhaps the most enduring response was about the war in Iraq, a prominent topic of the day. \"It will be far more difficult to get out of Iraq than to get in,\" he said. He was right. When I met him at Texas A&M University, Hawking was gracious and polite. He answered a couple of questions in person. But truly, it was awkward. Hawking’s time on Earth was limited and his health failing, so it required an age to tap out even short answers. I can only imagine his frustration at the task of communication, which the vast majority of humans take for granted, especially because he had such a brilliant mind and so many deep ideas to share. And here I was, with my banal questions, stealing his time. As I stood there, I wondered whether I should stare at him while he composed a response. Should I look away? I felt truly unworthy. In the end, it was fine. I even met Hawking a few more times, including at a memorable dinner at Mitchell’s ranch north of Houston, which spans tens of thousands of acres. A handful of the world’s most brilliant theoretical physicists were there. We would all be sitting around chatting, and Hawking would periodically chime in with a response to something brought up earlier. Later on that evening, Mitchell and Hawking took a chariot ride around the grounds. I wonder what they talked about? By this point, I had written about science for nearly a decade at the Chronicle. In the early part of the year, I had the opportunity to interview noted chimpanzee scientist Jane Goodall and one of the world’s leading oceanographers, Sylvia Earle. Both were coming to Houston to talk about their research and their passion for conservation. I spoke with Goodall by phonein advance of her visit, and she was so pleasant, so regal. By then, Goodall was 76 years old and had been studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania for five decades. Looking back over the questions I asked, they’re not bad. They’re just pretty basic. She gave great answers regardless. But there is only so much chemistry you can build with a person over the telephone (or Zoom, for that matter, these days). Being in person really matters in interviewing because you can read cues, and it’s easier to know when to let a pause go. The comfort level is higher. When you’re speaking with someone you don’t know that well, establishing a basic level of comfort is essential to making an all-important connection. A couple of months later,I spoke with Earle in personat the Houston Museum of Natural Science. I took my older daughter, then nine years old, because I wanted her to hear Earle speak later in the evening. This turned out to be a lucky move for a couple of different reasons. First, my kid was inspired by Earle to pursue studies in marine biology. And more immediately, the presence of a curious 9-year-old quickly warmed Earle to the interview. We had a great discussion about many things beyond just oceanography. The bottom line is that I remained a fairly pedestrian interviewer back in 2011. That was partly because I did not have deep expertise in chimpanzees or oceanography. And that leads me to another key for a good interview and establishing a rapport. It’s great if a person already knows you, but even if they don’t, you can overcome that by showing genuine interest or demonstrating your deep knowledge about a subject. I would come to learn this as I started to cover space more exclusively and got to know the industry and its key players better. To be clear, this was not much of an interview. But it is a fun story. I spent much of 2014 focused on space for the Houston Chronicle. I pitched the idea of an in-depth series on the sorry state of NASA’s human spaceflight program, which was eventually titled \"Adrift.\" By immersing myself in spaceflight for months on end, I discovered a passion for the topic and knew that writing about space was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I was 40 years old, so it was high time I found my calling. As part of the series, I traveled to Kazakhstan with a photographer from the Chronicle, Smiley Pool. He is a wonderful guy who had strengths in chatting up sources that I, an introvert, lacked. During the 13-day trip to Russia and Kazakhstan, we traveled with a reporter from Esquire named Chris Jones, who was working on a long project about NASA astronaut Scott Kelly. Kelly was then training for a yearlong mission to the International Space Station, and he was a big deal. Jones was a tremendous raconteur and an even better writer—his words, my goodness. We had so much fun over those two weeks, sharing beer, vodka, and Kazakh food. The capstone of the trip was seeing the Soyuz TMA-14M mission launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome. Kelly was NASA’s backup astronaut for the flight, so he was in quarantine alongside the mission’s primary astronaut. (This was Butch Wilmore, as it turns out). The launch, from a little more than a kilometer away, was still the most spectacular moment of spaceflight I’ve ever observed in person. Like, holy hell, the rocket was right on top of you. Immediately after the launch, which took place at 1:25 am local time, Kelly was freed from quarantine. This must have been liberating because he headed straight to the bar at the Hotel Baikonur, the nicest watering hole in the small, Soviet-era town. Jones, Pool, and I were staying at a different hotel. Jones got a text from Kelly inviting us to meet him at the bar. Our NASA minders were uncomfortable with this, as the last thing they want is to have astronauts presented to the world as anything but sharp, sober-minded people who represent the best of the best. But this was too good to resist. By the time we got to the bar, Kelly and his companion, the commander of his forthcoming Soyuz flight, Gennady Padalka, were several whiskeys deep. The three of us sat across from Kelly and Padalka, and as one does at 3 am in Baikonur, we started taking shots. The astronauts were swapping stories and talking out of school. At one point, Jones took out his notebook and said that he had a couple of questions. To this, Kelly responded heatedly, “What the hell are you doing?” Not conducting an interview, apparently. We were off the record. Well, until today at least. We drank and talked for another hour or so, and it was incredibly memorable. At the time, Kelly was probably the most famous active US astronaut, and here I was throwing down whiskey with him shortly after watching a rocket lift off from the very spot where the Soviets launched the Space Age six decades earlier. In retrospect, this offered a good lesson that the best interviews are often not, in fact, interviews. To get the good information, you need to develop relationships with people, and you do that by talking with them person to person, without a microphone, often with alcohol. Scott Kelly is a real one for that night. I have spoken with Elon Musk a number of times over the years, but none was nearly so memorable as a long interview we did for my first book on SpaceX, calledLiftoff. That summer, I made a couple of visits to SpaceX’s headquarters in Hawthorne, California, interviewing the company’s early employees and sitting in on meetings in Musk’s conference room with various teams. Because SpaceX is such a closed-up company, it was fascinating to get an inside look at how the sausage was made. It's worth noting that this all went down a few months before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some ways, Musk is the same person he was before the outbreak. But in other ways, he is profoundly different, his actions and words far more political and polemical. Anyway, I was supposed to interview Musk on a Friday evening at the factory at the end of one of these trips. As usual, Musk was late. Eventually, his assistant texted, saying something had come up. She was desperately sorry, but we would have to do the interview later. I returned to my hotel, downbeat. I had an early flight the next morning back to Houston. But after about an hour, the assistant messaged me again. Musk had to travel to South Texas to get the Starship program moving. Did I want to travel with him and do the interview on the plane? As I sat on his private jet the next day, late morning, my mind swirled. There would be no one else on the plane but Musk, his three sons (triplets, then 13 years old) and two bodyguards, and me. When Musk is in a good mood, an interview can be a delight. He is funny, sharp, and a good storyteller. When Musk is in a bad mood, well, an interview is usually counterproductive. So I fretted. What if Musk was in a bad mood? It would be a super-awkward three and a half hours on the small jet. Two Teslas drove up to the plane, the first with Musk driving his boys and the second with two security guys. Musk strode onto the jet, saw me, and said he didn’t realize I was going to be on the plane. (A great start to things!) Musk then took out his phone and started a heated conversation about digging tunnels. By this point, I was willing myself to disappear. I just wanted to melt into the leather seat I was sitting in about three feet from Musk. So much for a good mood for the interview. As the jet climbed, the phone conversation got worse, but then Musk lost his connection. He put away his phone and turned to me, saying he was free to talk. His mood, almost as if by magic, changed. Since we were discussing the early days of SpaceX at Kwajalein, he gathered the boys around so they could hear about their dad’s earlier days. The interview went shockingly well, and at least part of the reason has to be that I knew the subject matter deeply, had prepared, and was passionate about it. We spoke for nearly two hours before Musk asked if he might have some time with his kids. They spent the rest of the flight playing video games, yucking it up. When they're on the record, astronauts mostly stick to a script. As a reporter, you're just not going to get too much from them. (Off the record is a completely different story, of course, as astronauts are generally delightful, hilarious, and earnest people.) Last week, dozens of journalists were allotted 10-minute interviews with Wilmore and, separately, Suni Williams. It was the first time they had spoken in depth with the media since their launch on Starliner and return to Earth aboard a Crew Dragon vehicle. As I waited outside Studio A at Johnson Space Center, I overheard Wilmore completing an interview with a Tennessee-based outlet, where he is from. As they wrapped up, the public affairs officer said he had just one more interview left and said my name. Wilmore said something like, “Oh good, I’ve been waiting to talk with him.” That was a good sign. Out of all the interviews that day, it was good to know he wanted to speak with me. The easy thing for him to do would have been to use “astronaut speak” for 10 minutes and then go home. I was the last interview of the day. As I prepared to speak with Wilmore and Williams, I didn't want to ask the obvious questions they’d answered many times earlier. If you ask, “What was it like to spend nine months in space when you were expecting only a short trip?” you’re going to get a boring answer. Similarly, although the end of the mission was highly politicized by the Trump White House, two veteran NASA astronauts were not going to step on that landmine. I wanted to go back to the root cause of all this, the problems with Starliner’s propulsion system. My strategy was simply to ask what it was like to fly inside the spacecraft. Williams gave me some solid answers. But Wilmore had actually been at the controls. And he apparently had been holding in one heck of a story for nine months. Because when I asked about the launch, and then what it was like to fly Starliner, he took off without much prompting. I don’t know exactly why Wilmore shared so much with me. We are not particularly close and have never interacted outside of an official NASA setting. But he knows of my work and interest in spaceflight. Not everyone at the space agency appreciates my journalism, but they know I’m deeply interested in what they’re doing. They know I care about NASA and Johnson Space Center. So I asked Wilmore a few smart questions, and he must have trusted that I would tell his story honestly and accurately, and with appropriate context. I certainly tried my best. After a quarter of a century, I have learned well that the most sensational stories are best told without sensationalism. Even as we spoke, I knew the interview with Wilmore was one of the best I had ever done. A great scientist once told me that the best feeling in the world is making some little discovery in a lab and for a short time knowing something about the natural world that no one else knows. The equivalent, for me, is doing an interview and knowing I’ve got gold. And for a little while, before sharing it with the world, I’ve got that little piece of gold all to myself. But I’ll tell you what. It’s even more fun to let the cat out of the bag. The best part about journalism is not collecting information. It’s sharing that information with the world.

    "title": "Rocket Report: “No man’s land” in rocket wars; Isaacman lukewarm on SLS",
    "article_text": "China's approach to space junk is worrisome as it begins launching its own megaconstellations. Welcome to Edition 7.39 of the Rocket Report! Not getting your launch fix? Buckle up. We're on the cusp of a boom in rocket launches as three new megaconstellations have either just begun or will soon begin deploying thousands of satellites to enable broadband connectivity from space. If the megaconstellations come to fruition, this will require more than a thousand launches in the next few years, on top of SpaceX's blistering Starlink launch cadence. We discuss the topic of megaconstellations in this week's Rocket Report. As always, wewelcome reader submissions. If you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar. So, what is SpinLaunch doing now?Ars Technica has mentioned SpinLaunch, the company that literally wants to yeet satellites into space, in previous Rocket Report newsletters. This company enjoyed some success in raising money for its so-crazy-it-just-might-work idea of catapulting rockets and satellites into the sky, a concept SpinLaunch calls \"kinetic launch.\" But SpinLaunch is now making a hard pivot to small satellites, a move that, on its face, seems puzzling after going all-in on kinetic launch and even performingseveral impressive hardware tests, throwing a projectile to altitudes of up to 30,000 feet.Ars got the scoop, with the company's CEO detailing why and how it plans to build a low-Earth orbit telecommunications constellation with 280 satellites. Traditional versus kinetic... The planned constellation, named Meridian, is an opportunity for SpinLaunch to diversify away from being solely a launch company, according to David Wrenn, the company's CEO. We've observed this in a number of companies that started out as rocket developers before branching out to satellite manufacturing or space services. Wrenn said SpinLaunch could loft all of the Meridian satellites on a single large conventional rocket, or perhaps two medium-lift rockets, and then maintain the constellation with its own kinetic launch system. A satellite communications network presents a better opportunity for profit, Wrenn said. \"The launch market is relatively small compared to the economic potential of satellite communication,\" he said. \"Launch has generally been more of a cost center than a profit center. Satcom will be a much larger piece of the overall industry.\" Peter Beck suggests Electron is here to stay.The conventional wisdom is that the small launch vehicle business isn't a big moneymaker. There is really only one company, Rocket Lab, that has gained traction in selling dedicated rides to orbit for small satellites. Rocket Lab's launcher, Electron, can place payloads of up to a few hundred pounds into orbit. As soon as Rocket Lab had some success, SpaceX began launching rideshare missions on its much larger Falcon 9 rocket, cobbling together dozens of satellites on a single vehicle to spread the cost of the mission among many customers. This offers customers a lower price point than buying a dedicated launch on Electron. But Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, says his company has found a successful market providing dedicated launches for small satellites, despite price pressure from SpaceX,Space News reports. \"Dedicated small launch is a real market, and it should not be confused with rideshare,\" he argued. \"It’s totally different.\" No man's land... Some small satellite companies that can afford the extra cost of a dedicated launch realize the value of controlling their schedule and orbit, traits that a dedicated launch offers over a rideshare, Beck said. It's easy to blame SpaceX for undercutting the prices of Rocket Lab and other players in this segment of the launch business, but Beck said companies that have failed or withdrawn from the small launch market didn't have a good business plan, a good product, or good engineering. He added that the capacity of the Electron vehicle is well-suited for dedicated launch, whereas slightly larger rockets in the one-ton-to-orbit class—a category that includes Firefly Aerospace's Alpha and Isar Aerospace's Spectrum rockets—are an ill fit. The one-ton performance range is \"no man's land\" in the market, Beck said. \"It’s too small to be a useful rideshare mission, and it’s too big to be a useful dedicated rocket\" for smallsats. (submitted by EllPeaTea) ULA scrubs first full-on Kuiper launch.A band of offshore thunderstorms near Florida's Space Coast on Wednesday night forced United Launch Alliance to scrub a launch attempt of the first of dozens of missions on behalf of its largest commercial customer, Amazon,Spaceflight Now reports. The mission will use an Atlas V rocket to deploy 27 satellites for Amazon's Project Kuiper network. It's the first launch of what will eventually be more than 3,200 operational Kuiper satellites beaming broadband connectivity from space, a market currently dominated by SpaceX's Starlink. As of Thursday, ULA hadn't confirmed a new launch date, but airspace warning notices released by the FAA suggest the next attempt might occur Monday, April 14. What's a few more days?... This mission has been a long time coming. Amazon announced the Kuiper megaconstellation in 2019, and the company says it's investing at least $10 billion in the project (the real number may be double that). Problems in manufacturing the Kuiper satellites, which Amazon is building in-house, delayed the program's first full-on launch by a couple of years. Amazon launched a pair of prototype satellites in 2023, but the operational versions are different, and this mission fills the capacity of ULA's Atlas V rocket. Amazon has booked more than 80 launches with ULA, Arianespace, Blue Origin, and SpaceX to populate the Kuiper network. (submitted by EllPeaTea) Space Force swaps ULA for SpaceX.For the second time in six months, SpaceX will deploy a US military satellite that was sitting in storage, waiting for a slot on United Launch Alliance's launch schedule,Ars reports. Space Systems Command, which oversees the military's launch program, announced Monday that it is reassigning the launch of a Global Positioning System satellite from ULA's Vulcan rocket to SpaceX's Falcon 9. This satellite, designated GPS III SV-08 (Space Vehicle-08), will join the Space Force's fleet of navigation satellites beaming positioning and timing signals for military and civilian users around the world. The move allows the GPS satellite to launch as soon as the end of May, the Space Force said. The military executed a similar rocket swap for a GPS mission that launched on a Falcon 9 in December. Making ULA whole... The Space Force formally certified ULA's Vulcan rocket for national security missions last month, so Vulcan may finally be on the cusp of delivering for the military. But there are several military payloads in the queue to launch on Vulcan before GPS III SV-08, which was already completed and in storage at its Lockheed Martin factory in Colorado. Meanwhile, SpaceX is regularly launching Falcon 9 rockets with ample capacity to add the GPS mission to the manifest. In exchange for losing the contract to launch this particular GPS satellite, the Space Force swapped a future GPS mission that was assigned to SpaceX to fly on ULA's Vulcan instead. Russia launches a former Navy SEAL to space.Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate, and now a NASA astronaut, blasted off with two cosmonaut crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket early Tuesday,CBS News reports. Three hours later, Kim and his Russian crewmates—Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky—chased down the International Space Station and moved in for a picture-perfect docking aboard their Soyuz MS-27 spacecraft. \"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional post-docking video conference. Rotating back to Earth... Ryzhikov, Zubritsky, and Kim joined a crew of seven living aboard the International Space Station, temporarily raising the lab's crew complement to 10 people. The new station residents are replacing an outgoing Soyuz crew—Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Wagner, and Don Pettit—who launched to the ISS last September and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own spacecraft April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space. This flight continues the practice of launching US astronauts on Russian Soyuz missions, part of a barter agreement between NASA and the Russian space agency that also reserves a seat on SpaceX Dragon missions for Russian cosmonauts. China is littering in LEO.China’s construction of a pair of communications megaconstellations could cloud low Earth orbit with large spent rocket stages for decades or beyond,Space News reports. Launches for the government’s Guowang and Shanghai-backed but more commercially oriented Qianfan (Thousand Sails) constellation began in the second half of 2024, with each planned to consist of over 10,000 satellites, demanding more than a thousand launches in the coming years. Placing this number of satellites is enough to cause concern about space debris because China hasn't disclosed its plans for removing the spacecraft from orbit at the end of their missions. It turns out there's another big worry: upper stages. An orbital time bomb... While Western launch providers typically deorbit their upper stages after dropping off megaconstellation satellites in space, China does not. This means China is leaving rockets in orbits high enough to persist in space for more than a century, according to Jim Shell, a space domain awareness and orbital debris expert at Novarum Tech. Space News reported on Shell's commentary in asocial media post, where he wrote that orbital debris mass in low-Earth orbit \"will be dominated by PRC [People's Republic of China] upper stages in short order unless something changes (sigh).\" So far, China has launched five dedicated missions to deliver 90 Qianfan satellites into orbit. Four of these missions used China's Long March 6A rocket, with an upper stage that has a history of breaking up in orbit, exacerbating the space debris problem. (submitted by EllPeaTea) SpaceX wins another lunar lander launch deal.Intuitive Machines has selected a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket to launch a lunar delivery mission scheduled for 2027,the Houston Chronicle reports. The upcoming IM-4 mission will carry six NASA payloads, including a European Space Agency-led drill suite designed to search for water at the lunar south pole. It will also include the launch of two lunar data relay satellites that support NASA’s so-called Near Space Network Services program. This will be the fourth lunar lander mission for Houston-based Intuitive Machines under the auspices of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services program. Falcon 9 has the inside track... SpaceX almost certainly offered Intuitive Machines the best deal for this launch. The flight-proven Falcon 9 rocket is reliable and inexpensive compared to competitors and has already launched two Intuitive Machines missions, with a third one set to fly late this year. However, there's another factor that made SpaceX a shoe-in for this contract. SpaceX has outfitted one of its launch pads in Florida with a unique cryogenic loading system to pump liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellants into the Intuitive Machines lunar lander as it sits on top of its rocket just before liftoff. The lander from Intuitive Machines uses these super-cold propellants to feed its main engine, and SpaceX's infrastructure for loading it makes the Falcon 9 rocket the clear choice for launching it. Time may finally be running out for SLS.Jared Isaacman, President Trump's nominee for NASA administrator, said Wednesday in a Senate confirmation hearing that he wants the space agency to pursue human missions to the Moon and Mars at the same time, an effort that will undoubtedly require major changes to how NASA spends its money. My colleague Eric Berger was in Washington for the hearing andreported on it for Ars. Senators repeatedly sought Isaacman's opinion on the Space Launch System, the NASA heavy-lifter designed to send astronauts to the Moon. The next SLS mission, Artemis II, is slated to launch a crew of four astronauts around the far side of the Moon next year. NASA's official plans call for the Artemis III mission to launch on an SLS rocket later this decade and attempt a landing at the Moon's south pole. Limited runway ...Isaacman sounded as if he were on board with flying the Artemis II mission as envisioned—no surprise, then, that the four Artemis II astronauts were in the audience—and said he wanted to get a crew of Artemis III to the lunar surface as quickly as possible. But he questioned why it has taken NASA so long, and at such great expense, to get its deep space human exploration plans moving. In one notable exchange, Isaacman said NASA’s current architecture for the Artemis lunar plans, based on the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, is probably not the ideal “long-term” solution to NASA’s deep space transportation plans. The smart reading of this is that Isaacman may be willing to fly the Artemis II and Artemis III missions as conceived, given that much of the hardware is already built. But everything that comes after this, including SLS rocket upgrades and the Lunar Gateway, could be on the chopping block. Welcome to the club, Blue Origin.Finally, the Space Force has signaled it's ready to trust Jeff Bezos' space company, Blue Origin, for launching the military's most precious satellites,Ars reports. Blue Origin received a contract on April 4 to launch seven national security missions for the Space Force between 2027 and 2032, an opening that could pave the way for more launch deals in the future. These missions will launch on Blue Origin's heavy-lift New Glenn rocket, which had a successful debut test flight in January. The Space Force hasn't certified New Glenn for national security launches, but military officials expect to do so sometime next year. Blue Origin joins SpaceX and United Launch Alliance in the Space Force's mix of most-trusted launch providers. A different class ...The contract Blue Origin received last week covers launch services for the Space Force's most critical space missions, requiring rocket certification and a heavy dose of military oversight to ensure reliability. Blue Origin was already eligible to launch a separate batch of missions the Space Force set aside to fly on newer rockets. The military is more tolerant of risk on these lower-priority missions, which include launches of \"cookie-cutter\" satellites for the Pentagon's large fleet of missile-tracking satellites and a range of experimental payloads. Why is SpaceX winning so many Space Force contracts?In less than a week, the US Space Forceawarded SpaceX a $5.9 billion dealto make Elon Musk's space company the Pentagon's leading launch provider, replacing United Launch Alliance in the top position. Then, the Space Force assigned most of this year's most lucrative launch contracts to SpaceX. As we mentioned earlier in the Rocket Report, the military also swapped a ULA rocket for a SpaceX launch vehicle for an upcoming GPS mission. So, is SpaceX's main competitor worried Elon Musk is tipping the playing field for lucrative government contracts by cozying up to President Trump? It's all good, man ...Tory Bruno, ULA's chief executive, doesn't seem too worried in his public statements,Ars reports. In a roundtable with reporters this week at the annual Space Symposium conference in Colorado, Bruno was asked about Musk's ties with Trump.\"We have not been impacted by our competitor's position advising the president, certainly not yet,\" Bruno said. \"I expect that the government will follow all the rules and be fair and follow all the laws, and so we're behaving that way.\" The reason Bruno can say Musk's involvement in the Trump administration so far hasn't affected ULA is simple. SpaceX is cheaper and has a ready-made line of Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets available to launch the Pentagon's satellites. ULA's Vulcan rocket isnow certified to launch military payloads, but it reached this important milestone years behind schedule. Two Texas lawmakers are still fighting the last war.NASA has a lot to figure out in the next couple of years. Moon or Mars? Should, or when should, the Space Launch System be canceled? Can the agency absorb apotential 50 percent cutto its science budget? If Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz get their way, NASA can add moving a space shuttle to its list. The Lone Star State's two Republican senators introduced the \"Bring the Space Shuttle Home Act\" on Thursday,CollectSpace reports. If passed by Congress and signed into law, the bill would direct NASA to take the space shuttleDiscoveryfrom the national collection at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and transport it to Space Center Houston, a museum and visitor attraction next to Johnson Space Center, home to mission control and NASA's astronaut training base.Discoveryhas been on display at the Smithsonian since 2012. NASA awarded museums in California, Florida, and New York the other three surviving shuttle orbiters. Dollars and nonsense ...Moving a space shuttle from Virginia to Texas would be a logistical nightmare, cost an untold amount of money, and would create a distraction for NASA when its focus should be on future space exploration. In a statement, Cruz said Houston deserves one of NASA's space shuttles because of the city's \"unique relationship\" with the program. Cornyn alleged in a statement that the Obama administration blocked Houston from receiving a space shuttle for political reasons.NASA's inspector generalfound no evidence of this. On the contrary, transferring a space shuttle to Texas now would be an unequivocal example of political influence. The Boeing 747s that NASA used to move space shuttles across the country are no longer flightworthy, and NASA scrapped the handling equipment needed to prepare a shuttle for transport. Moving the shuttle by land or sea would come with its own challenges. \"I can easily see this costing a billion dollars,\" Dennis Jenkins, a former shuttle engineer who directed NASA's shuttle transition and retirement program more than a decade ago, told CollectSpace in an interview. On a personal note, the presentation ofDiscoveryat the Smithsonian is remarkable to see in person, with aerospace icons like the Concorde and the SR-71 spy plane under the same roof. Space Center Houston can't match that.

TheUniversal Orlando Resort’snewest theme park is set to open in May and the elements you’ll encounter, from monsters to dragons to the Florida heat, should influence your style and level of comfort. Before you embark on a journey through new and exciting portals to Super Nintendo World, the Isle of Berk fromHow to Train Your Dragon,the Universal Monsters Dark Universe, and more, we’ve curated this guide to ensure you pop out in pop culture essentials. Official merch is available now online and at licensed retailers, so no matter which epic fandom you favor, you can pull your look together in plenty of time. This guide is a reminder to go at your own pace but also try to be prepared… and I need this advice for myself, too. The two mall mainstays that come to mind first, especially if you need a quick turnaround on sizing and comfort, are BoxLunch and Hot Topic. Being able to check a website and see if inventory is available for pick-up at your local shop is far less stressful than ordering online and hoping your items will fit when they eventually arrive. We’ve all been there and it’s not ideal if packing gives you anxiety (raises hand). Even if you put things off, you can just go to the mall to visit your local coven at HT or explore the fandom wares at BoxLunch. They’ve even got some recent selections inspired by the Universal Monsters, Nintendo, andHow to Train Your Dragonthat are perfectly suited for the trip. Having options with buttons you can open or peel off to air that humid sweat away is very important. RSVLTS is fantastic for fashion with endurance against the elements and thisCreature From the Black Lagoon-inspired polois a great fandom-bounding option if you want to look dressed up like the Gill-man. Otherwise, outfits paying homage to Universal Monsters with capes and robes can be tricky because you don’t want to get heatstroke at a new theme park, especially if you’re lucky enough to nab tickets during its opening summer. Thankfully you can channel the Bride of Frankenstein and the Monster with Hot Topic selections like thisshort-sleeve teeand afemme option for Gill-manfans. Since breathable clothes are a must,this Toothless Baseball jerseywith a scale design is a good option and a part of very gender-neutral selections at BoxLunch, which also includeexclusive Nightfury accessories from Loungefly. And for your Mario party there’s cuteaccessoriesandtops. What’s really neat is that even Epic Universe’s official merchandise is also available to nab in advance. At least with going this route, if a size doesn’t work and you don’t realize it until you’re in Florida, as long as you have your proof of purchase you can probably exchange it at Universal. The selection is not entirely what’s available at the theme parks as of previews, but still very solid especially when it comes to theming. In particular theHow to Train Your Dragonselection is extensive with cosplay liteToothless hats,fashionable attire for women, men, and childrenplus water bottle holders. I know that sounds odd to cape for cozy drinkware sleeves but these have cute designs, like thisToothlessone, and can hang off strollers. I use one of mine from Universal for that specifically while taking my kiddo to the parks so I don’t have to buy the expensive drink cup attachment. The widest selection of pre-arrival shopping I would say is the Universal Monsters. The Dark Universe branded character re-designs of Dracula and friends are going to be a hot commodity. I’d say grab some of the officialapparelandaccessoriesnow because they might be sold out when you get there. There’s a market for flippers that raid the newly branded merch, which can put a damper on a first visit if you were hoping to get something “Dark Universe” branded, only to find it’s all gone. So get it while you can if the item you were looking for is available online already. ThisBride of Frankenstein hair bucket hat,Âcute monsters steel tumbler, andBaby Dracula backpackare too cleverâI don’t trust them still being there come May. And then there’s the parks-exclusiveSuper Nintendo Worldofficial releases which are as close to the real Nintendo store as we can get, so don’t miss out on thenewest arrivals. Epic Universe opens May 22; for more information and tickets visithere. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Netflix’s Moonrise Anime Is a Gorgeous Space Opera, but Its Story Is a Mess",
    "article_text": "On paper, Netflix’s new sci-fi anime,Moonrise, is anime catnip to old and new generations of anime fans as a dream collaboration too significant to fail, even if the platform faltered in promoting it before its release. Directed by Masashi Koizuka ofWit Studio(Attack on Titan), featuring character designs by Hiromu Arakawa ofFullmetal Alchemistfame, and scripted by Tow Ubukata(Fafner in the Azure), the series promised a space opera evoking the essence ofStar WarsandSpace Battleship Yamato. This impressive combination of talent elevatedMoonriseto must-watch status before a single frame was seen. However, the narrative struggles to maintain a consistent harmony with the anime’s otherwise stunning sci-fi action sequences and sharp animation, resulting in an uneven viewing experience under Netflix’s instant-gratification binge-watch model. Moonriseis set in a near future where humanity flourishes in a seemingly idyllic utopia, free from racial discrimination, war, pollution, and prejudiceâthanks to Sapientia. This global AI network, trusted wholeheartedly by humanity and followed without question, meticulously oversees global politics. One of Sapientia’s far-reaching initiatives sees Earth offload its challenges of yesteryear through a lunar development project, where criminals and pollutants are sequestered on the moon. This ignites a civil war among three factions: a rebel army on the moon, lunar “Sapientian” loyalists, and Earth’s joint military force. At the heart of this space conflict is Jack Shadow, who, driven by the loss of his family in a terrorist attack, joins a covert scout unit tasked with neutralizing rebel leader Bob Skylum, known as “the king of the moon.” However, his mission turns unexpectedly when he discovers that a childhood friend is fighting on the opposing side. From the jump,Moonriseembodies the grandeur of a high-budget Hollywood space opera, perfectly matching the prestige of its dream team of creators. Towering CG space freighters boast intricate architectural designs meticulously crafted from stern to bow. The fight choreography is immaculately drawn, as heroes and villains glide across the screen in fluid, weightless movementsâevoking the Survey Corps’ acrobatic 3D maneuver gear fromAttack on Titanfused with the gravity-defying double jumps ofDestiny 2‘s guardians. Blending its weighty and uncannily relevant political themesâmirroring the socio-political climate of 2025, where disenfranchised rebels criticize Sapientians for their economic privilege to afford eggs, now a rare luxuryâthe show introduces a distinctive form of space magic known as “engrave.” This ability allows its heroes to transform special matter, crafted by Sapientia, into energy-based weapons like blades, guns, and ammunition. WhileMoonrisetakes a loose approach to defining the limits of engrave, likening it to the alchemy ofFMAor the power of Green Lantern rings, that doesn’t hamper the anime’s undeniable cool factor. Another small but not insignificant quality that makesMoonrisestand out: Arakawa’s comfy character designs. While much of the aesthetics of its main characters, like Jack and Phil, look like sci-fi versions ofFMA‘s titular alchemists, Arakawa’s designs also enrich the anime with diverse body types and ethnicities. It is refreshing to see a space-faring anime go to the lengths to make its cast feel like a reflection of the real world. All of the above are glistening tools that would otherwise lead toMoonrisebeing a classic in the making, had its narrative not struggled to stay in orbit with its brilliance. By the midpoint ofMoonrise, its once-absorbing themes and gripping narrative begin to dissolve, like a vibrant sticker in a carâs rearview mirrorâits colors fading until only a shadow of its former self lingers as the story trudges forward. Much of this stems from the showâs peculiar storytelling approach. While its early episodes are packed with political jargon, shifting allegiances, and name-dropped space territoriesâelements that usually signal a fully realized sci-fi worldâthe anime squanders this foundation with its erratic time handling, ultimately undermining its depth. Instead of feeling like you’re piecing together its plot alongside its characters,Moonriseleaves viewers in the dark until characters casually mention that years have passed between scenes that otherwise felt like they occurred moments after each other. This turnsMoonriseinto a frustrating experience, leaving viewers grasping for clarity as they struggle to decipher the true motives of its key players beyond the basic notion of opposing factions. The show obscures character dynamics, making it difficult to pin down where alliances genuinely lie. Despite its ambitious attempt to weave numerous moving parts into an 18-episode runâlonger than the typical 12-episode anime seasonâMoonrisestruggles to maintain narrative cohesion. Instead of feeling like a fully realized story, its plotting resembles the rushed finale of a multi-season show or a compilation film that glosses over heartfelt character moments, reducing its depth to broad strokes. As a result, despite its extended runtime, the anime feels like it sacrificed crucial content that could have smoothed out its abrupt character developments, leaving viewers with the sense that too many significant details and explanations are missing. Another casualty ofMoonrise‘s bizarrely paced narrative is its wonderfully designed characters; the takeaway feels like you’ve given a kid a 128-color crayon box and then witnessed them favor a handful of colors, leaving the rest unused. Outside of the anime’s four leads, the supporting cast is visually striking but ultimately hollow, serving archetypal roles rather than contributing anything truly meaningful to the story. The only glimpse of meaningful characterization forMoonriseâs supporting cast lies in its ending themeâironically bypassed by Netflixâs autoplay. In those brief moments, viewers get a clearer sense of their dynamics and personalities than the actual show ever provides. Viewers are left adrift, subjected to characters who petulantly withhold explanations from both their opposition and the audienceâeven as they themselves appear perplexed in the showâs penultimate episode. WhileMoonrisedoes attempt to unravel some of its not-so-high-concept mysteries, it does so through lifeless exposition dumps that sap any remaining intrigue. Eventually, you stop leaning in with each revelation, letting them passively wash over you until the show finally hands you an answerâone you were never given the chance to decipher on your own. Even more frustratingly, the show loses its grip on political intrigue and the tension surrounding the political upheaval among the factions. The sharp psychological edge of the political conflict is blunted by the abrupt introduction of a fourth entity, which drains the momentum from its human drama. Ultimately,Moonrisecrashes and burns, weaving loose plot threads, themes, and action into a cohesive conclusion. Its finale largely avoids the political intricacies it initially set up. The result is a lackluster and unsatisfying payoff to the promising groundwork of its first half. While the anime’s action hints at the potential for a sci-fi classic, its undercooked narrative and feeble ending reduce its political commentary to Netflix’s “We’ve gotMobile SuitGundamat home.” All 18 episodes ofMoonriseare streaming on Netflix.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. When is it worth giving your older but still reliable PC or laptop a reprieve from the recycling center? When you cangive it new life for just $16 in the form of the HP S650 internal 240GB solid-state hard drive, which you can do right now thanks to this limited-time 20% off deal at Amazon. The extra boost of storage and speed you get from a quick, easy hard drive replacement is a solid solution for a computer that’s past having any trade-in value but still does its job. The original internal hard drive in your older-model PC or laptop is probably a hard disk drive (HDD), and it’s probably on its last legs â slow to boot up, slow to read and write, and glitchy. In short, it’s probably past the point of reliability, which is the most essential need you have from a computer. You could spend hundreds or more to replace the entire machine, or you could kick that can down the road and give your device new life for just $16 See at Amazon Why make the move from an HDD to an SSD (solid-state drive) like the HP S650?The SSD has far fewer moving parts and thus fewer potential breakdowns, far greater speed, greater reliability, and superior overall efficiency. Another thing about those older HDDs? They’re awful when it comes to energy usage, which means they’re electricity vampires that drive up your utility bill, and all that energy-hogging also creates unsustainably high internal temperatures, especially in laptops.Â The HP S650 boasts ultra-low power consumption, which translates into greater efficiency and longer life. It features a pure aluminum heat spreader that’s far more efficient at dissipating heat and dropping the amount of power consumption, meaning it can work harder and faster than your current drive while staying infinitely cooler. How much faster? Sequential read speeds of up to 560 MB per second and write speeds of up to 500 MB/s are the benchmarks set by the HP S650. That’s roughly five times faster than the average HDD, with a fraction of the energy usage and heat output. Good on you for keeping an older computer or laptop with an HDD at its core running for this long â it speaks to you being a careful and responsible user. But all good things come to an end, and it’s time to say goodbye to that heavy, clunky, loud HDD.Give your old reliable device a new lease on life with the HP S650 240GB SSD for just $16 while this Amazon offer is still good.

    "title": "Google’s Pixel Watch 4 Could Ditch the Pins for Wireless Charging",
    "article_text": "Good for Google! It has found its Apple Watch equivalent. The Pixel Watch 4, which we expect later this year, is already trudging through the rumor mill. Google has purportedly made some nice tweaks to it. However, most of the changes are minimal. They remind me of how Apple updates the Apple Watch every year, but only alittlebit. Most years aren’t worth the upgrade unless you’re due for it. But Pixel Watch moving to a more proper wireless charging would be a welcome tweak. Â©91Mobiles / OnLeaksWhere have all the pogo pins gone?According to91mobilesand OnLeaks, two rumor barons that have been on the mark with these things before, the charging pins are gone. Yes, the pins that previously helped funnel faster charging speeds to the Pixel Watch’s battery look to be headed for a de-proprietary upgrade. The Pixel Watch2/3currently relies specifically on having that magnetic pogo mount to charge, which is annoying when your watch is nearly dead and the charger is at home. It’s also been annoying trying to find a good three-in-one charge-it-all-up accessory for the Pixel devices.ZDNetlikes this off-brand one, and there’s a popular one onAmazon,but they both only work with the last two Pixel Watch generations. Axing the pins means that, hopefully, Google will elect a standard Qi-charging pad to make it easier to charge with what’s available. However, even the elimination of pogo pins doesn’t guarantee that. For instance, the Apple Watch Series 10 is free of pins, but it’s still a proprietary charging standard. The Vergesuggests that the pogo pins are gone because WearOS will be more power efficient and won’t need the extra metal to charge so quickly. I’ve been enjoying my battery life with the larger Pixel Watch 3, so I didn’t consider this. Regardless, we won’t know anything until the Pixel Watch 4 exists. For now, we have this rumor, which includes a supposedly thicker 14.3 mm chassis for the regular Pixel Watch 4 compared to the 12.3 mm on the Pixel Watch 3. That may be due to a bigger battery or extra components added insideâmaybe it’ll get depth sensing like theApple Watch Series 10. There’s also some rumors around whether those are extra buttons on the other side of the Pixel Watch 4, where the speaker is usually housed, putting it at four input buttons if you count the push-button dial. Maybe that’s why the watch is bulkier? Again, even though nothing here has been confirmed, these are all minor feature additions compared to past generations. From what I see, it’ll be hard to justify the Pixel Watch upgrade unless you’re needing whatever those two new buttons should do.

    "title": "James Cameron Hopes Future Filmmakers Will Use AI to Save Jobs, Not Cut Them",
    "article_text": "ForJames Cameron, saving the movie business might come down to using AI. Considering he directed cautionary talesThe TerminatorandTerminator 2: Judgment Day, that’s a leap of faith that has us look at the future with trepidation. But don’t worry; the conversation he had about it onBoz to the Futurepodcast (viaVariety) dives into how he hopes it can be accomplished without cutting jobs drastically. âIn the old days, I would have founded a company to figure it out. Iâve learned maybe thatâs not the best way to do it. So I thought, all right, Iâll join the board of a good, competitive company thatâs got a good track record,â Cameron explained about joining the board of directors at Stability AI. âThe goal was to understand the space, to understand whatâs on the minds of the developers. What are they targeting? Whatâs their development cycle? How much resources you have to throw at it to create a new model that does a purpose-built thing, and my goal was to try to integrate it into a VFX workflow.â âAnd itâs not just hypothetical,â he explained referencing how it would impact his work on theAvatarfranchiseand other hugely ambitious cinema. âIf we want to continue to see the kinds of movies that Iâve always loved and that I like to make and that I will go to seeâDune, Dune: Part Two, or one of my films or big effects-heavy, CG-heavy filmsâweâve got to figure out how to cut the cost of that in half,” he said. “Now thatâs not about laying off half the staff and at the effects company. Thatâs about doubling their speed to completion on a given shot, so your cadence is faster and your throughput cycle is faster, and artists get to move on and do other cool things and then other cool things, right? Thatâs my sort of vision for that.” Where he does feel AI is a threat is in replacing storytelling as an art form. âI just donât personally believe that a disembodied mind thatâs just regurgitating what other embodied minds have saidâabout the life that theyâve had, about love, about lying, about fear, about mortalityâand just put it all together into a word salad and then regurgitate itâ¦I donât believe thatâs ever going to have something thatâs going to move an audience,” he said. “You have to be human to write that. I donât know anyone thatâs even thinking about having AI write a screenplay.â However, pop culture fans have seen AI being used to fuel content such as fake movie trailers that mislead audiences, and viral AI images that rip off the animation masters at Studio Ghibli. That aspect of the technology makes Cameron âa little bit queasy.” Filmmakers, he said, should be influenced directly in theirvision, not theirhardware. “I aspire to be in the style of Ridley Scott, in the style of Stanley Kubrick. Thatâs my text prompt that runs in my head as a filmmaker. In the style of George Miller: wide lens, low, hauling ass, coming up into a tight close-up,” he said. “Yeah, I want to do that. I know my influences. Everybody knows their influences.” Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Social Security Admin Reportedly Moving All Communication to X, the Everything App",
    "article_text": "The Social Security Administrationbacked off its plan to cut phone services, but it’s still taking steps to limit the ways that people will be able to access information about the essential agency. The SSA plans to stop issuing communications through normal channels like press releases and will instead make statements exclusively on X. According to the report, the shift was made clear during internal meetings between agency managers. âWe are no longer planning to issue press releases or those dear colleague letters to inform the media and public about programmatic and service changes,â SSA regional commissioner Linda Kerr-Davis said,per Wired. âInstead, the agency will be using X to communicate to the press and the public.” The SSA pretty regularly engages with the public, including advocacy groups, through “Dear Colleague” letters that directly address the concerns of third parties who have questions or concerns about Social Security-related matters. Those are typically shared on the agency’s“News” page, which includes communications to advocates, statements from the SSA Press Office, and the agency’s newsletter. All of that, it seems, will disappear and be replaced by theSSA X feed. The agency’s account currently has just over 138,000 followers. By comparison, about73 million people(that’s about 1 in every 5 Americans) receive Social Security benefits of some kind and may be interested in updates regarding those services. The shift to Elon Musk’s platform comes after several high-profile instances of the SSA website going down after the Musk-led Department of Government Efficiencyslashed its IT team. Outages have lasted full days at certain points, but the administration has claimed it has nothing to do with DOGE’s efforts, which have already left the agencyshort-staffed and scrambling. Anyway, those outages will probably be used as justification for shifting communication to X, which has been Musk’s preferred platform for communication even before he bought it. In 2020, Muskdissolved Tesla’s press officeentirely and shifted the company’s comms exclusively to what was then Twitter. Shockingly, the company found itvery difficult to communicate withÂ the public and press. For Tesla, the shift is vaguely justifiable, as the company’s customers are likely a little tech-savvy. That is distinctively not the case for Social Security, which primarily serves people of retirement age. People can start receiving their full Social Security benefits at 67 years old. Per publicly available demographic information about X’s user base,about 5% of its usersare 65 years old or older. So the audience for SSA updates is not on the platform that the agency will primarily use to communicate. Seems not great.

Nate offered a mobile app that promised users a one-click checkout experience on any e-commerce website “without human intervention,” effectively meaning they could store their credit card and shipping information with Nate instead of inputting it on each website.

Maybe by ‘AI’, the company was actually referring to “Asian Intelligence.” Nate raised over $50 million between 2018 and 2021. The Information firstreportedon the allegations against Nate and its CEO Albert Saniger back in 2022. Here is an excerpt from the report: To process transactions automatically on retailer sites without the aid of humans, Nate’s software needed to figure out how to locate specific buttons on the page, such as the one that adds an item to a shopping cart, without getting blocked by trackers on the site that look for automated bots, said two people with direct knowledge of the technology. That proved difficult. As a result, throughout 2021, the share of transactions Nate handled manually ranged between 60% and 100%. When Paul Hudson from Glade Brook went to order a pair of Levi’s jeans from the denim maker’s website using Nate’s checkout, Saniger wrote in a corporate Slack channel called “vip-notificaitons-for-albert” to alert colleagues that a transaction needed processing right away. Many companies in the AI field still rely on humans to some degree, especially to validate data that has been generated by an algorithm, with the hope being that AI will soon be able to take over entirely. Hot startups like Scale AI are infamous for relying on farms of cheap labor to label data and correct outputs of AI models. EvenUp, a startup that says it uses AI to automate the process of writing legal claims, was reportedlyrelying on humansas recently as late last year to correct AI-generated texts. The most successful AI startups thus far are the ones making tools, and mainstream adoption of AI by enterprises remains a question mark over concerns about reliability. Where Nate seems to have gotten into hot water was explicitly claiming that humans were almost never used in the checkout process, which was blatantly false. Maybe the company thought it could “fake it till you make it” and simply ran out of time to get the product working as intended. But it was also entering an incredibly crowded space, with Amazon dominating e-commerce and other companies like Shopify introducing their own one-click checkout products. It also is hard to see how Nate could grow a business around a relatively simple feature. Similar companies like Bolt, another one-click checkout startup, have only managed togenerate a pittance of revenue. Nate, which still appears to exist, reliedheavily on commissionsto try and grow its app, offering influencers the ability to create lists of their favorite products in the app and receive a cut of any sale. Funnily enough, however, Nate may have been onto something with its product. Amazon, OpenAI, and Google are amongst the companies that have recently introduced “agents” they market as being able to automatically perform tasks including online shopping for users. The products remain nascent, and users have complained they are slow, expensive, and buggy. They do present some potential to automate arduous tasks and make computing more accessible to demographics like the elderly. Nobody should show much sympathy for Nate’s private investors, supposedly seasoned venture capitalists who are entrusted with billions of dollars from the likes of pension funds and expected to conduct extensive due diligence before making investments. The venture capital model is precipitated on home runs, with the expectation that most investments will go to zero. Saniger is facing one count of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud, both of which could result in up to twenty years in prison.

    "title": "Sneak Preview of Trump’s 2026 NASA Budget Is a Science-Killing Horror Show",
    "article_text": "After weeks of uncertainty, it appears that the Trump administration is preparing to gut NASA, based on a preliminary budget that would see the space agency’s funding nearly halved. Weeks of whispers (read: statements in scientific and Congressional committee meetings) have already indicated the way the breeze was blowing for NASA. And by breeze, we mean hurricane-force headwinds. The Washington Postreportedthat the preliminary “passback” version of Donald Trump’s budget proposal would slash NASA’s funding to $3.9 billion from $7.3 billion. Nicky Fox, NASA’s associate administrator for science,toldthe House Science Committee’s space subcommittee on April 1 that the agency had not run any scenarios on what NASA would do if funding was cut 50%, because the agency had not yet seen the Trump administration’s 2026 budget request. Well, some folks have seen itâand it ain’t pretty. According to SpaceNews, Fox said that “a 50% cut is going to result in some pretty drastic decisions.” I hope your pencils are sharpened, NASA budget folks, as you may not be able to afford sharpeners next year. NASA’s press secretary Bethany Stevens stated that âNASA has received the fiscal year 2026 budget passback from the Office of Management and Budget, and has begun the deliberative process.â We’ll see how those deliberations go. Cutting the nation’s space agency’s budget will mean stopping a huge number of ongoing and planned missions that would otherwise help astronomers, astrophysicists, and planetary scientists understand the cosmos. The missions NASA undertakes allow humankind to explore beyond the limits of our own world’s gravity, expanding the horizons of our species in the universe. Furthermore, NASA’s missions help us answer three of the most fundamental questions of human existence: Where did we come from, where are we going, and are we alone? According to the Post’s report, the agency’s astrophysics budget will drop to less than half a billion dollars from $1.5 billion. Its planetary science budget would drop from $2.7 billion to $1.9 billion and its Earth science budget would halve, falling to just over $1 billion from about $2.2 billion.Â No telescope besides the Hubble and Webb space telescopes would be fundedâbad news for theRoman Space Telescope, set to launch as soon as next year. Already, space science thought leaders are describing the passback budget as an extinction-level event for NASA, an agency that has led the way in space exploration for nearly 70 years. Asreportedby Ars Technica, the document is just the first part of a process for the fiscal-year 2026 budget, produced by the White House Office of Management and Budget. That office is run by Russell Voughtâwhose goal from day one was to “traumatically” affect scientists, asreportedby Nature. The passback document comes as no surprise; after all, NASA slashed nearly half a billion dollars in contractslast monthat the behest of the so-called Department of Government Efficiencyâbut it turns a concerning proposition into a grave reality. NASA has generally enjoyed bipartisan supportâthe U.S. leading the way in space exploration and championing scientific discovery are ideas both sides of the aisle can get behind. But the current administration evidently wants to see that money go elsewhereâaway from learning about the cosmos, away from understanding the universe’s fundamental physical laws, away from the mysteries that transcend life as we know it. But it remains to be seen just how Congressional opposition will stop the administration’s gleeful gutting of the nation’s most glamorous scientific agency.

    "article_text": "The news cycle sinceA Minecraft Movie‘s April 4 release has gone something like this: “Whoa, that movie is making a lot of money!” right into “Whoa, that movie is inspiring some over-excited audience reactions!” While Jared Hess’ film is continuing torake in box-office receiptsworldwide,the social media frenzyoverwhat’s happening at its screeningsis now commanding the narrative. We all know what a “chicken jockey” is now, and Hess couldn’t be more delighted. “It’s been so bananas,” Hess(Napoleon Dynamite, Nacho Libre, Masterminds)toldEntertainment Weekly. “It’s been way too fun … It’s weird when you’re having too much fun and the cops get called. It’s funny because I think it’s just literally cheering and throwing popcorn, which is so funny to me that cops are getting called for popcorn. Yeah, it’s hilarious. I’ve seen so many funny videos.” While the rowdy audiences have inspired some theaters to issue warnings against bad behavior fromMinecraftfans, Hess has a more positive take on the situation. “I’m just glad people are making memories with their friends and families,” he told EW. “I’m just so happy that people are finding joy in going back to cinemas and seeing things as a community, as a group of people. It’s like we’ve become so isolated on our devices, and it’s just fun to experience things as a group of human beings [and] it’s fun that they’ve found it in this goofy movie that we’ve made.” Perhaps the takeaway is, if you want to watchA Minecraft Moviein a quiet environment where you can hear every quotable line slipping from Jack Black’s lips, and not be showered in popcorn bits, you’ll need to wait until its home release.

    "title": "Apple, Are You Okay?",
    "article_text": "Something odd has been happening for the last few months. We’ve been hearing more and more about internal conflicts at Apple, a company typically so locked down that it makes Lockheed Martin look like a leaky sieve. FirstMark Gurman at Bloomberg reportedon a nasty internal fight over Siri and Apple Intelligence, complete with a recap of a team meeting. YesterdayThe Information followed with a more extensive scoopon the same subject.Â Todaywe got a piece from The New York TimesÂwhich strongly implies Tim Cook is failing as a leader and the company’s enormous potential is being mismanaged. Yikes. The stories and the details aren’t especially surprising if you’ve watched the abysmal response to Siri and Apple’s AI moves.Siri has been a mess for years, being one of the most secure voice assistants but also one of the stupidest and most prone to failures. Apple Intelligence is so mediocreJoanna Stern from the Wall Street Journalgot Apple Software Chief Craig Federighi to admit it on camera. AI is juicing the valuations of every major publicly traded tech company and the idea that Apple,themajor publicly traded tech company, can’t get a strong grasp on the technology is raising alarm bells all over the place. But Apple’s AI boondoggle shouldn’t be a surprise. Google, Microsoft, and nearly every other tech company have rushed to implement AI with middling to poor results. I’ve seen the word AI used in more pitches in the last two years than I ever saw VR or 3D deployed at the height of their respective crazes. We’ve got AI pins, and buttons, and glasses. It’s pre-loaded on laptops and phones and used as an adjective every time a company wants to make its technology sound fancier than it is. Apple is a company that usually waits for the dust to settle and proper use cases to emerge before it steps in and announces its reinvented a technology. Getting into the mix this early was always odd for Apple. Apple is the gal who is normally fashionably late to the bar, but its AI move was Apple showing up at the exact time doors open. It’s not a surprise that Apple Intelligence is, by all accounts, an initiative summoned from the bowels of marketing and forced onto designers and engineers who were not ready or enthusiastic about the possibilitiesâparticularly in the time frames dictated by Apple leadership. It’s also not a surprise that the Siri team, which is where most of the AI work happens, has seen some major leadership changes or that Craig Federighi and his glorious hair stepped in to make the change. Apple screwed up and is now using its incredible resources to fix its problems. What is surprising was that Apple let the tail wag the dog by allowing its marketing department to effectively create the roadmaps for AI. We’ve now seen three different significant leaks from the company about those issues. This is not how Apple operates. The very public infighting feels like the kind you often see where they gleefully use news outlets to make their point and win internal battles, but given it is Apple, a company that has maintained a very capable leak-free culture for decades, there’s also the sense that some people are just mad at the direction of the company. But whatever the motivations behind the leaks they’re showing a major shift in how Apple’s culture operates. Apple’s AI stumbles aren’t the problem, nor are the stories about them. They’re all symptoms of something very weird happening at One Apple Park Way. AppleApple Intelligence Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "An AI-Powered Alternate Universe Where MAGA Figures Own Libs Is Thriving on YouTube",
    "article_text": "If it feels like people are living in their own universes sometimes, it’s not that far from the truth. Anew report from Mother Jonesdigs up the surprisingly populated world of pro-MAGA, AI-generated slop videos that have carved out a niche on YouTube by turning the mostr/thatHappened-ass stories into content that Boomers and other folks in need of some copium happily lap up. The story highlights a couple of the biggest offenders, accounts like Elite Stories and Mr. Robe Stories, along with a selection of others that have created a MAGA alternate universe. The account uploads videos that are pure AI slop from start to finish: AI narration telling a completely fabricated story with AI-generated images sprinkled in to illustrate it. The videos usually run anywhere from 10 to 40 minutesâlong enough to get in a couple ad breaks to make some money. And asMother Jones points out, some of the videos are indeed monetized. Elite Storieshas since disappeared from the platformâapparently banned by YouTube in response to Mother Jones’ reportingâbut a cached version of the YouTube account that appears in a Google search shows the account had more than 160,000 followers at the time of its removal. An archived version of the account shows a sampling of the videos you can find there: “A Little Girl Asks Trump About God â His Response Brings Her To Tears.” Other videos showcase Attorney General Pam Bondi and Clint Eastwood, for some reason. Mr. Robe Stories(what a name, by the way) is also down now, but it had over 41,000 subscribers, and it provides a collection of similar MAGA-tilted stories about people wronging figures from across the extended Trump universe, only for them to get struck down by their 150 IQ heroes like Baron Trump and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. Some of the Mr. Robe Stories uploads sit at just a few hundred views, like “Karoline Leavitt Claps Back Ruthlessly After Michelle Obama Mocks Donald Trump” which is really just a Mad Libs of nonsense that apparently has not resonated with the audience. Others, though, rack up more than a million views. “Barron Trump STANDS UP as Professor Mocks Melania â His Response Shocks Everyone” broke the million watch mark and is filled with comments from people who are more than happy to take the tale as fact. “Barron is such a respectful and well-raised young man. His parents must be proud!” a top comment reads. “I have so much respect for Baron and my opinion of professor’s has lowered again!” another said. To be fair to the uploading account, all of the videos do appear to display a disclaimer at the start of the video that notes they are entirely works of fiction. But when people want to believe it’s true, they’re happy to ignore the one-second-long warning message and take the next half-hour worth of content as gospel. Almost as troubling as the videos themselves and the commenters who want badly to believe the stories are real are the ads that are being served on top of them. In viewing these videos in incognito mode (I’m not trying to fuck up my own algorithm *that* bad), I was served mostly pseudo-scientific trash about Alzheimer’s disease, including one that claimed the condition is caused primarily by drinking water at the wrong temperature. Earlier this week, YouTubeissued a statementsupporting the NO FAKES Act of 2025, a proposed bill that would establish protections for the voice and visual likeness of people who may be duplicated by generative AI tools. But it appears the platform has a lot of work to do in moderating AI content. A spokesperson for YouTube told Gizmodo, “Our Community Guidelines apply to all content on YouTube, including AI-generated content. In this case, we terminated the channel in question for violating our spam policies. Our privacy process can also be used by someone to request the removal of AI-generated content that simulates their likeness.” generative aiMAGASlopYouTube Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Imagine just casually having one ofC-3PO‘s feet displayed in your home. There’s nothingStar Warsfans love more thanweird little details, and this unique piece ofmemorabiliaâgoing up for sale as part ofHeritage Auctions’ upcoming May the Fourth-timed eventâcertainly fits the bill. Anthony Daniels did indeed wear this as part of his costume while filming 1980’sStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. Take a closer look in the gallery: The C-3PO foot comes from the personal collection of legendary art director and production designer Harry Lange, whose credits besidesEmpireincludedReturn of the Jedi,2001: A Space Odyssey,Moonraker,The Great Muppet Caper, andThe Dark Crystal. According toHeritage Auctions, “the costume piece is constructed of vacuum formed plastic ribbed shell, plated in metallic gold and expertly studio finished. Measuring 12″ x 3.75″ x 5″, the foot’s bottom is open, as the shell is designed to fit over an actor’s shoe. The foot is an Anthony Daniels signature costume piece and represents a lightweight alternative in the evolution of the C-3PO costume,” having evolved from the heavier creation Daniels wore inA New Hope. Can you actually wear it? As a matter of fact: “There is a small, clean production made pinhole in the toe for attachment to a shoe beneath it. The back of the shell is intentionally split to allow a foot and shoe to slip into it.” Not that you would want to walk around in such a priceless bit ofStar Warshistory, mind you!

    "title": "Texas Republicans Want to Steal Space Shuttle Discovery From the Smithsonian",
    "article_text": "After NASA’s Space Shuttles were retired in 2010, they were eventually sent to museums in Florida, California, New York, and the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Virginia. But Texas Republicans are not happy that the Lone Star state didn’t get one, given its historic significance to space travel. And they’ve introduced legislation to take the space shuttle currently at the Smithsonian and bring it to Houston. U.S. senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz introduced a new bill on Thursday called theBring the Space Shuttle Home Act, which would require the space shuttle Discovery to be transferred from the Smithsonian to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston. Discovery was sent to the Smithsonian because it’s the oldest shuttle that’s still space-worthy, making it invaluable for future research and study. If the legislation passed, it would require the Smithsonian to come up with a plan for moving the shuttle, and that’s where things get very, very tricky. As the news outletcollectSpaceexplains, it’s virtually impossible to move the shuttle because the hardware used to relocate the four shuttles back in 2012 was destroyed. One of the modified Boeing 747 jetliners that moved the shuttles to their current homes is sitting in a museum and isn’t flightworthy, while the other would need new engines and a lot of other modification work to make it fit for purpose, according to collectSpace. Even assuming you successfully flew Discovery to Houston, the work on the ground would present its own problems. Getting the Endeavour from the L.A. International Airport to the California Science Center took three days to cover just12 miles. Hundreds of trees had to be removed, and while it was quite a spectacle to watch the slow-moving shuttle wind through the city, it was an enormous undertaking. What about just taking Discovery apart and reassembling it? That would destroy the thermal blankets and tiles, according to collectSpace, some of the many things that make it valuable as an existing flightworthy shuttle for future research and study. And even if it were broken up into smaller pieces, those parts would still be far too large to move through traffic in any normal way. But none of that seems to be a concern to the Texas senators who are trying to make this happen. Sen. Cornyn complains that Texas wasn’t given one of the shuttles because President Barack Obama was playing politics. âHouston played a critical role throughout the life of the Space Shuttle program, but it is clear political favors trumped common sense and fairness when the Obama administration blocked the Space City from receiving the recognition it deserves,â Cornyn said in a statementposted online. âI am proud to lead the effort to finally bring Discovery home to Houston, where future generations of Texans and Americans can come to learn about the cityâs integral role in our nationâs space shuttle program.â Incredibly, it doesn’t seem like the two Texas senators even bothered to talk with Space Center Houston before coming up with their idea, according tocollectSpace. And while it sounds like the museum directors aren’t opposed to the plan, it does seem extremely odd they wouldn’t have been consulted in advance of such disruptive legislation. âHome to the Johnson Space Center and its famed Mission Control, Houston has an unparalleled reputation and history in the exploration of the new frontier,â Sen. Cruz said in a statement. âIt is past time that the Space Center Houston Museum houses a Space Shuttle, given the unique relationship between the entire program and its support staff in Houston. Bringing the Discovery to its final home will offer hundreds of thousands of visitors each year the opportunity to engage with a living piece of NASAâs history and understand why Houston is known worldwide as âSpace City.ââ Discovery first launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida onAug. 30, 1984, and landed from its final mission to the International Space Station onMarch 9, 2011.

    "title": "6 Crucial Things to Remember Before The Last of Us Season 2",
    "article_text": "The highly anticipated and long-awaitedsecond season ofThe Last of Usdebuts this weekend, so it’s time to get ready. Hopefully,in the two years since we last sawJoel and Ellie, you gave the first season a recent binge to get ready for the new episodes. But if not, don’t worry. We’ve got you covered. Season one ofThe Last of Uswas FILLED with characters and information, but the nature of the show is that not a ton of that will carry over into season two. People move on,the journey continues, etc. But some threads do connect the seasonsâand with that in mind, here are six things you need to remember to prepare forThe Last of Usseason two. Joel is a capable survivalist who was tasked with transporting a young woman named Ellie across the United States because she was somehow immune to a worldwide infection that killed most of the population and turned them into killers. Over the course of the trip, Joel and Ellie developed a strong bond, in large part because Joel lost his own daughter at the start of the outbreak. However, once they got to the hospital where Ellie needed to be, he realized creating a cure will result in Ellie’s death. Instead, Joel killed everyone in the hospital to save Ellie, even if it means there won’t be a cure. Born just as her mother was about to die from the outbreak, Ellie grew up as an orphan unaware that she was immune. That changed when she was a teenager and, as a result, she agreed to go with Joel to figure out how her special immunity could be used to save everyone. She knew it might mean the end of her life but was okay with it. However, Joel made that decision for her. When she woke up, Joel told her that there were other immune people and the cure thing didn’t work, so they didn’t need her. Ellie sensed this could be a lie but was forced to trust him anyway. Unlike a traditional zombie show,The Last of Uscenters on the spread of a parasitic fungal infection. Basically, a kind of killer plant that infects your brain, kills you, and brings you back as one of them. Most people on the show simply call these beings “Infected.” It’s similar to a zombie, just with more life. There are various different levels, from basically normal human-looking creatures up to “Bloaters,” which are humans whose whole body has been overrun with the disease. Also, there have been hints that the infection is kind of a hive mind, which is why the infected work so well together. When the world started to end, the government’s response was led by a group called FEDRA. Many people didn’t trust FEDRA though and so the Fireflies were formed. They were a rebel group that fought against FEDRA. The Fireflies were also the ones who were working toward the cure. However, after Joel killed so many of them in Salt Lake City, they’ve all but disappeared. Some have separated into other groups. Tommy is Joel’s brother who has also survived the outbreak. He is also a very capable survivalist who was fighting with the Fireflies but left that life and to start a family in Jackson, Wyoming. There, he and his wife Maria have helped create a bustling community. They also have a young son, Joel’s nephew. Jackson, Wyoming is a fully functioning city where Joel and Ellie settle at the end of season one. It’s one of several independent safe havens we’ve seen across the country but by far the most welcoming and maybe the best stocked. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Tony Gilroy Says Lucasfilm Might Actually Be Making a Star Wars Horror Project",
    "article_text": "For as long has he has been bringingÂAndorto life,Tony Gilroyhas championed the series as one that opens the gateway forÂStar Warstoexplore various genresit rarely touches on in TV and film. And now, according to the man himself, the franchise might actually be doing that. Speaking toBusiness Insiderat a recentÂAndorevent in London ahead of the second season’s premiere later this month, Gilroy said responded to a question about a comment he’d previously floated aboutStar Warsseries he’d like to see, including a horror story, saying “They’re doing that. I think they’re doing that. I think that’s in the works, yeah.” Speaking toSFX Magazineback in March, Gilroy had previously joked thatÂAndor‘s success should pave the way for a sitcom or horror project. “I always fantasized that the show would break new ground, that someone would be able to make a three-camera sitcom inStar Warsor a horror movie. I think the first thing I said to Kathy [Kennedy] when she said they wanted to open a line, was, ‘Could you do a courtroom drama? And why not?’ We’ve worked really hard onAndorto make our lane, and it’s up to other people now to find another way to do it.” If the horror project does now exist, Gilroy is seemingly not part of its production, going by his comments about being perfectly happy to round out his time onStar WarswithÂAndor‘s completion. But if it does happen (a less-than-certain guarantee when it comes toStar Warsin recent times), at least the show will have completed its goals to getÂStar Warsto push the scope and tones of the stories it’s willing to telloutside of ancillary media. io9 has reached out to Disney for comment and clarification on Gilroy’s remarks, and will update this post when and if we hear back.

    "title": "Wireless Phone Chargers With Fans Make More Sense Than You Think",
    "article_text": "Wireless charging pucks make hot phones even hotter. Sure, it allows you access to phones’ only USB-C port while charging, but the process of electromagnetic induction is still less efficient than a direct connection through a power cable. That leads to excess heat. If you’ve ever picked up a phone on the charge and immediately dropped it like you’ve touched a hot iron, then you already know that particular pain point. Which is why I’m surprised there aren’t more devices like the $60Torras PowerCircleQi2 charger. It’s essentially a combination wireless charger and fan cooler. Yes, it may make your phone look like its trying out its jet engine cosplay, but its the kind of device whose function vastly outweighs its form. The Torras PowerCircle slaps onto the back of any supporting phone for 15W wireless charging and can prop up the device with the rotating stand-up ring. However, with the fan whirring away, Torras claims the device will stay at an even 55 degrees Fahrenheit or lower throughout over 100 minutes of charging time. The company also claims you can go from zero to 80% in just under an hour, which seems about right for 15W wireless charging. And to account for the fan, it’s also far thicker than your traditional charging puck. Heck its even thicker than other pucks with fans built in, like the $45 MagFusion GameFrost Qi2 15w charger fromAukey. Phones that grow hot lose out in both performance and charging efficiency, which is not a big deal if all youâre doing is sticking your phone on a pad to charge while you sleep. It’s when you actually want to use your device while charging that you may see performance dip. Torras claims its burger slider-sized charging puck will maintain stable performance far better than a traditional Qi2 charger. You can also use the charger without the fan, but asAndroidCentralpointed out, thatâs because you need to press a button on the charger then re-plug it in to get the fan working to begin with. Phone fan coolersâincluding cheap ones made by companies likeTrakxyor more-expensive varieties fromBlack Sharkâare nothing new. Yet the PowerCircle is one of the few that focuses exclusively on fast charging heat. But spending $60 (though likely closer to $50 on sale) or even $40 on a wireless charger seems a little much when a 15W Qi-certified Anker puck will cost you less than $30. The fan-cooler devices have a niche use case, but I can imagine it could be extra practical for gaming on a phone. The PowerCircle might charge your phone while the phone’s USB port is occupied by a phone controller like aBackBone OneorRazer Kishiand keep it cool for uninterrupted performance. The fan on charger is really a “no, duh” now that we’re starting to see more of these on these devices on the market. According to theWireless Power Consortium, Qi2 is supposed to achieve up to 95% power efficiency, far above the 75% of the older Qi standard. Even that 5% is enough to create a sauna on the back of your device. Anybody with experience in PC building already knows the benefit of simple fan cooling. Rather than sticking it near the air conditioner, a small dedicated fan just makes more sense. Now lets see how far we can take it.

Perhaps you want to build out a desk space where you hook up to a docking station to some extra monitors and more to really spread out your work.

    "title": "The Reason Why Lazarus Looks Different in Its U.S. and Japanese Versions",
    "article_text": "Lazarus,Cowboy BebopcreatorShinichirÅ Watanabe‘s newest sci-fi anime series on Adult Swim, is the talk of the town in anime circles. A lot of the online chatter has focused on thecompare-contrast territorybetween Watanabe’s two shows. But regardingLazarusitself, some fans have noticed differences between the Japanese and U.S. releases, leaving them wondering if they are missing out on a potentially superior version of the series. AnX/Twitter post by user SaeIsshoÂ points out scenes fromLazarusprotagonist Axel Gilberto’s parkour prison escape in the anime’s premiere episode seem to have added frames andimproved compositing polishin the Japanese version. The tweet, which has garnered over 91,000 views, has ignited curiosity among fans about whether the remaining 12 episodes will feature similar subtle differences and if it might be worth waiting for theJapanese language version of the showset to release on Adult Swim and Max in May. It seems Lazarus has two different versions, with the Japanese one being the most complete. For instance some scenes in the Japanese version are about twice as long in terms of key frames, and there are noticeable differences in compositing choices across various parts of the EP.pic.twitter.com/jLR264Zojq — Sae (@SaeIssho)April 7, 2025 Given all the recent turmoil over stuff like theNintendo Switch 2having acheaper, Japanese-only version; general anxiety overvibe-based tariffs, and China reinforcing the proverbial inward barbwire gate over the U.S. withlimited releases of films likeA Minecaft Movie; anime fans’ nagging sense of FOMO over Watanabe’s return to sci-fi isn’t completely left-field. However, a source familiar with the matter has clarified the apparent difference between the showsâand it seems anime fans have nothing to worry about. Speaking with io9, a source close to the show’s production says minor tweaks were made to the U.S. and Japanese broadcast versions ofLazarusto pass the Harding testâan automatic test for flashing and patterns that could trigger photosensitivity and epilepsy. Think the infamousPokÃ©monPorygon episode, where a lightning bolt flash reportedly triggered over 700 alleged instances of nausea, dizziness, headaches, and photosensitivity-triggered seizures in audiences across Japan back in 1997. According to the source, minor tweaks were implemented in both versions ofLazarusto adhere to the Harding test. They include dropping a few animation frames and slightly darkening numerous shots. The source stressed that neither animation nor redone composites were added to either show version, and Watanabe approved all updates. Mystery solved. Though, knowing the anime community, fans will probably still rewatch the Japanese language version ofLazarusfor the chance to hearCowboy Bebopalumni voice actors like Koichi Yamadera (Spike Spiegel) and Megumi Hayashibara (Faye Valentine) as Dr. Skinner and Herch, respectively. In our review ofLazarus’first five episodes, we said the anime has the juice, writing “Lazarusfirmly establishes itself as a series capable of delivering a compelling anime without compromising on animation quality, musical score, or thematic depth in its early goings.” Hopefully, the show will continue its winning momentum to its final episode. New episodes ofLazaruspremiere every Saturday night on Adult Swim, with next-day streaming on Max. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Rematch blew away my expectations: trailers don't do Sloclap's 5v5 football game justice",
    "article_text": "It's the closest I've come to feeling like I'm actually playing a game of football in a videogame. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Every now and then a game comes along that seems unassuming at first but totally blows away all of your expectations and reveals itself to be something special. Rematch is one of those games. Yes, it's football, but it's far closer to the likes of Rocket League and Overwatch than it is to FIFA and is all about action and teamplay. Trailers really don't do this game justice (although you can watch the latest one above). Watching people run around a pitch, even when extremely stylish, can't capture just how good this feels to play. Rematch is the closest I've come to feeling like I'm actually playing a game of football. Instead of playing as a whole team like in FIFA and other football games, you control just one player in a team of three to five people. You need to run and react to every pass and tackle, and really work hard to aim your shots and score a goal. Even if you're not a fan of football, I'm confident that the fast-paced drama will win you over. Rematch is being made by Sloclap, creators of martial arts games Absolver and Sifu, and it shows in the sense of bodily control and opportunities for reaction. We were trying to get to that core essence of at least part of what makes football so much fun and a beautiful sport. \"We want you to feel like an amazing athlete,\" creative director Pierre Tarno told PC Gamer at a recent studio visit in Paris. \"We want players to feel the high stakes pressure of football. We were trying to get to that core essence of at least part of what makes football so much fun and a beautiful sport.\" Put most simply by the developer: FIFA is a football simulation, while Rematch is a footballplayersimulation. Rematch will launch later this summer with four modes—3v3, 4v4, 5v5, and a ranked 5v5 with other modes to be added in later seasons. Matches last about six minutes, but can spill into overtime and for now things are multiplayer only, with bots for solo play being worked towards for season 3 in 2026. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"For me, where the game strikes the best balance of action, engagement, and tactical gameplay is 5v5, and that's why I think it makes sense to have it as the main competitive game mode,\" Tarno said. \"But new game modes, even fun ones, if they're popular enough and deep enough could find their way into competitive queues. We're very open to mixing things around.\" I played a few rounds of 4v4 and 5v5—the pitch changing sizes slightly to create more heated games when there are fewer players. By my third match, I was hooked. The simple act of connecting with the ball and making things happen feels amazing. Chasing it down after the opposing team fumbled a shot then passing it further upfield to line up a shot made me feel like a hero just as much as getting in a few cheeky goals. As I got deeper into it, I started picking up more techniques like overhead passes and volleys. There's also a stamina bar that allows you to put on extra bursts of speed to really launch yourself into every charge and a short 'extra effort' opportunity to push yourself to the limit. You can also swap playing positions on the fly during a match—goalkeepers aren't locked in and are encouraged to step out of the penalty box to become a part of offensive pushes. If things start to go a bit wrong anyone can step in to play keeper, too. It's down to whoever reaches the backend of the pitch first to take up the gloves. You'll be randomly assigned a spot at the start of each game, but you never have to stick to it—if someone else prefers to play goal it's a very quick changeover and means that no one has to feel left behind or pressured into any position. When in possession of the ball you're particularly vulnerable to having it stolen from you via tackles so you'll need to try to push it ahead of you and keep passing to keep up that frenetic tempo. The drawback of online play, however, and a side effect of all that pressure is that people's 'passion' for the game might bubble over in unsavoury ways. Encouraging healthy teamplay is a design problem, says Tarno, and one hope is that the setting will encourage friendly behavior. Rematch takes place in an \"optimistic future\" that has embraced clean energy sources such as solar and wind farms, a \"colorful and cheerful\" world that's about \"the joy of playing with friends.\" The developer has also noticed that teamwork tends to emerge naturally, because whoever has the ball is in danger of having it taken from them. \"There's more of an advantage to defense than to offense,\" Tarno said. \"So vulnerability in possession is something that spontaneously generates team play. When we ran load tests, we were playing games—solo queuing against randoms who didn't know each other—and they were passing the ball. It was one thing that really was a relief. Because I was a bit scared of every time somebody gets the ball, they try to be the hero and be the star of the show etc. But since it's a risk to dribble and the winning strategy is to construct an action and a team play.\" And if all that fails there's always mute and block options and Sloclap will be monitoring griefing techniques—they've already made sure that the goalkeeper can't just catch and chuck a ball into their own goal to annoy their team. Rematch will be out on June 19 for $30—it's got aSteam page here—and there are opportunities to play it in invite-only betas before then. If you're interested, you can sign up for a chance to participateon the official website. We'll also have more on Rematch in the next issue of PC Gamer magazine.

    "title": "'Let's just fail quickly this time': Semiwork took a 'big risk' on REPO after its first game took 6 years to make and didn't sell very well",
    "article_text": "Semiwork was in a tough spot after Voidigo failed to catch on, so it took a bit of a different approach to its next game. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The co-op horror gameREPOis, like Schedule I, a surprise indie hit. Released in February, it's got an \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating across more than 91,000 user reviews onSteamand remains near the top of its most-played chart: As I write this, nearly 170,000 people are playing. In a new developer video diving into REPO's creation, semiwork's Pontus Sundström explains how it all came about, and the circumstances surrounding its creation were not particular fortuitous: Semiwork had spent six years working on its previous game, Voidigo, and while it also has an \"overwhelmingly positive\" rating on Steam, it wasn't a big seller. That left the studio in a spot where its future wasn't assured, and so its approach to REPO was a little bit different. \"Okay, we can't take this next step,\" semiwork co-founder Walter Tischkewitz says in the video. \"We did it anyway. 'Let's just fail quickly this time.' And we took all the money from Voidigo and we put it all in this game, REPO.\" While REPO is similar in some ways toLethal Company, another big indie success, semiwork has previously said it wasn't actually inspired by that game but instead emerged from an idea for asingleplayer horror gameabout cleaning a haunted mansion while hiding from a creature called the Headman. Today's video dives deeper into that evolution, revealing that the decision to ditch cleaning came after it was decided to make REPO a multiplayer game: \"Co-op cleaning in real life, it's not that fun.\" \"Yeah, think about cleaning in real life,\" Tischkewitz says. \"You never go like, 'Hey friend, let's help each other clean here, let's grab the broom together and clean co-op and have a fun time.' It's always like, 'You take bathroom one, I take bathroom two.' So there wasn't really anything in the gameplay loop that kept the players together, and that's when we realized, okay, maybe we're not doing a cleaning game.\" The idea for what REPO would become grew \"organically\" from there, while the team took sort of a learn-as-you-go approach to actually making the game because it was their first project made with Unity. That's also why the first content update, promised in March, is taking a little longer to arrive. \"We are still learning things as we go, and we want to make sure that we learn stuff the right way,\" Sundström says. \"Which means that future updates after the first update will probably be released a little bit faster because we have a little more knowledge on things and how to do it.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Plans for that update, whenever it arrives, include various quality of life features, a new map, and a \"duck bucket,\" a bucket you can put over the duck. Trust me, it's important.

    "title": "Dark and Darker finally gets a PvE-exclusive 'Adventure Mode'",
    "article_text": "Early access season 6 has some big changes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Have you ever wished you could go exploring inDark and Darkerwithout worrying about getting ganked by a fellow adventurer who started playing the game 200 hours before you even discovered its existence? If so, good news:Season 6of the game's early access release includes a new \"Adventure Mode,\" a PvE-exclusive co-op format that gives players the opportunity for some risk-free dungeon crawling. \"Risk free,\" to be more specific, in the sense that you won't have to keep a constant wary eye on that sketchy looking dude with the knife who always seems to be hanging back from the group. There will still be plenty of ways to die in the depths, and it sounds like developer Ironmace may have fiddled with things to account for the absence of PvP threats: Much of the new mode is seemingly being left for players to discover the hard way, but the patch notes say \"the risk/reward balance including loot drops, monster difficulties, and other settings for all the game modes have been adjusted to give varying risk to reward profiles.\" The update also adds \"new monster patterns\" for the Nightmare Ice Spider, Nightmare Harpy, Nightmare Cockatrice, Nightmare Frost Giant Shielder, Nightmare Yeti, Nightmare Giant Worm, and Nightmare Wendigo, as well as a \"High-Roller boss summoning system\" for the Lich, Warlord, Ghost King, and Frost Wyvern. So yeah, that soundsdangerous, but I suppose it's only fair. And frankly a PvE mode in Dark and Darker is long overdue. I'm a dungeon crawler fan but I tend to take them very slowly and methodically (yes, the sketchy looking dude with the knife who's always hanging back from the group is me), and it's not a tremendous amount of fun when I'm tucked away somewhere studying enemy movements and all of a sudden Charlie Hulkenstern comes lumbering up with a mace that looks like a Volkswagen glued to a tree trunk and starts trying to pulp me with it. Look, I'm just not a PvP guy, I admit it, and so Dark and Darker hasn't really been my bag thus far. Maybe now, that'll change. Dark and Darker early access season 6 is live now.

    "title": "Blue Prince tips: 10 useful tricks for mastering the mysterious mansion",
    "article_text": "Before you set foot in the ever-changing mansion, here's some spoiler-free advice to make things easier. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. InBlue Princeyou've inherited a mysterious mansion, but the twist is you also have to build that mansion, one room at a time, while you explore it. The deeper you get, the more mysteries you'll find, and even as you unravel one you'll stumble across a few more to take its place. There's a lot to grasp in the early hours of this puzzle strategy adventure, and as you begin your search through the 45-room mansion in search of its hidden 46th room, you might need some help getting your feet under you. Here's 10 spoiler-free tips to make your trips through the mansion a bit easier to manage. I know, I know, there's a big empty grid and right at the top there's a square marked \"antechamber.\" Who could resist trying to make a beeline straight for it? It's so darn intriguing. But you won't get there if you're aiming for it like a guided missile. The further north you go (each grid square north you travel adds one to the \"rank\" of the room you draft) the more locked doors you'll encounter—and the odds of drafting a perfect series of rooms with northern-facing doors isn't in your favor anyway. You'll need todraft a winding route through the mansion, not build in a straight line, to collect all the keys and gems you can to make the higher ranks of rooms easier to deal with. Your goal may change from day to day: reach the antechamber, find the 46th room, solve a puzzle, draft a specific room, use a special key you found. But your constant goal should always be tofill the house with as many rooms as possible. The more rooms you draft, the more resources you'll collect, the more likely you are to draft the specific room you want, and the better chance you'll have to see rare or completely new rooms come up in your drafts. Build the biggest house you can every single time you play and your real goals will become much easier to accomplish. One trip through the house with a metal detector will clue you into a secret:there's extra resources scattered aroundthat you never knew were there. So keep your eyes peeled even when you don't have a detector. You'll sometimes spot an extra key on a table, a gem on a nightstand, a coin on the floor, a snack on a countertop. They're often hard to spot, even with a detector, but they'll help on your current run. In the same vein: don't expect glowing lines around items you can pick up or use. This isn't a game that waves its arms to get your attention. Reusable items like the shovel, sledgehammer, lockpick kit, security keycard, compass:they don't stand out from the environmentyou find them in. Maybe you'll know to look for them in a toolshed or closet, but they'll appear elsewhere in the house, too. Until you learn to recognize them, you might miss them, so walk up close to everything that might be a tool and see if your cursor changes from a pointer to a hand. The lavatory. A dead-end red room. We all hate it, so why would anyone willingly draft it? Thing is, if it or another room you don't like comes up in your draft, it's probably going to keep coming up on that same day, again and again. It can be best todraft rooms you don't want early, even if it's not convenient, rather than waiting for them to show up at a critical moment deeper into the mansion when you're short on options. Say you start building west from the entrance hall and it's going great, even three or four ranks in, and you've got a couple open doorways to draft from. I'll often stop and backtrack to the entrance to build out the east side of the house. Before you get too far up in the ranks, make sure your lower ranks have been built, even if it means burning a bunch of steps to backtrack. Once again, the ultimate message is: fill the house with rooms. The mansion is full of puzzles but many aren't confined to a single room. You might see a clue days before you see the puzzle it helps with. Observe everything, write down what you see, take screenshots of letters and photos. Build a stockpile of information about the house you can refer back to later down the line. Some rooms you can draft wherever you want, others will only appear in certain areas. Logic can help: where in a house would a garage be built, for instance? Probably not right in the middle surrounded by other rooms: how would you get the car into it? Consider where in the mansion you're standing when you're drafting and it might explain why certain rooms show up and others don't. Think of Blue Prince as a co-op game you play with your future self: do what you can today to make tomorrow easier. A mailroom is an empty dead-end today, but tomorrow it'll be filled with goodies, so draft it even if it halts today's progress. Give up on reaching the antechamber if it means using your final steps to carry an upgrade disk to a distant terminal, because you'll be able to improve a room you'll use in your future runs. Leave an important key in the coat check so it'll be easier to find tomorrow or the next day. Your future self will thank you. There's also the door you came in. At the start of each day, the camera slowly pushes in through the front door into the entrance hall… so you canturn aroundimmediately and walk right back out of the mansion. There's stuff out there, ultimately a lot of stuff, and you can't access most of it yet, but it's well-worth exploring a bit in your early hours with Blue Prince.

    "title": "The Talos Principle: Reawakened goes back to the beginning for a touching coda to its musings on what it means to be human",
    "article_text": "The remastered edition of Croteam's hit puzzle game is out now, and it's really good. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm a big fan of the Talos Principle games, and so was happy to hear that the original, now more than 10 years old, was getting the remaster treatment asThe Talos Principle: Reawakened. And it's not just a graphical overhaul: The updated edition also features an entirely new chapter that takes players back to the very earliest days of the simulation that brought about the rebirth of humanity. The Talos Principle: Reawakened, redone in Unreal Engine 5, looks great: I recall the original being a very pretty game for its time but even so, this is a big step up. There's also an array of new quality of life and accessibility features, and a new puzzle editor that enables players to easily create and share puzzles through Steam—great for people who just want to jump in and bang around with lasers, blocks, and fans, without getting all wrapped up inphilosophy. If you're new to The Talos Principle, this is definitely the version to play. As someone who's already been through it, though—and who was really taken by the narrative—the big hook here is the addition of a new chapter called In the Beginning. And from here, there are spoilers, so avert your gaze if you don't want to blow the big secret. The Talos Principle takes place in a world where humanity has been rendered extinct by some unknown pandemic. With a cure out of reach (a prospect I find much more believable in the wake of Covid-19), a small number of humanity's best minds spent their final days working to set the stage for a rebirth of human life in the form of machines, whose AI minds would be carried across the threshold of true humanity through the experience of play. The stories of the scientists behind this effort could be glimpsed in The Talos Principle games through audio logs and forgotten bits of code, but it was left almost myth-like within the context of the game, which is experienced entirely from the perspective of androids who exist long after humanity's demise. The new chapter in The Talos Principle: Remastered, entitled In the Beginning, shifts the focus to those long-dead humans: It takes place during a test of the simulation that will ultimately birth true machine intelligence, conducted while Alexandra Drennan and most of her team are still alive. The puzzles in In the Beginning are tough: Name notwithstanding, this is definitely a chapter of the game to be played after the base game and Road to Gehenna are completed, because you're going to have a very hard time of it if you're not well familiar with the game's puzzle mechanics. But the real attraction, for me at least, lies in what it reveals about the last desperate days of the simulation, through bug reports, last minute design changes, priority shifts, and various Easter eggs scattered throughout the pre-release test build. It's not perfect—the voice acting doesn't really carry any sense of the desperation you'd expect from people weeks or days away from inevitable death—but the stories told in these little bits of text and voice are touching, occasionally funny or heartbreaking, and very human in totality, which is exactly what The Talos Principle is all about. In one bug report, a scientist on the team struggles to figure out why audio cues aren't working when the waveforms are clearly showing activity, until he realizes that Frank unplugged the goddamn speakers again; in another, a team member whose name may be familiar to Talos Principle 2 players reports that her symptoms have progressed too far and she can't work anymore; it's time to go home. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Talos Principle: Reawakened is $40/£34/€40, which for owners of the original game might seem like a little much for a single additional chapter. Publisher Devolver Digital is offering discounts of up to 40% for people who own The Talos Principle and/or Talos 2, but only for two weeks after release. There's somemixed reactionto that: Some fans say they'd have been happy to pay full price for such an extensive redo, others are disappointed that even with the highest discount applied, the remaster still costs more than $20 for current owners. If you'd like to get a sample of The Talos Principle: Reawakened's shiny new paint job, a demo remains available onSteam: Croteam said it will be removed now that the game is out, but it's being left up for a bit so mod makers canmigrate their workto the full release. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "article_text": "\"When he didn’t get his way, he stormed off.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OpenAI is countersuing Elon Musk, and claims the company's co-founder is engaged in \"bad faith tactics\" in order to gain control of its industry-leading AI technology.Musk sued OpenAIand its CEO Sam Altman, his fellow co-founder, last year in an attempt to stop him changing the corporate structure from a non-profit to a for-profit company. OpenAI was co-founded by Musk and Altman in 2015. Musk left OpenAI in 2018 and now alleges that the company has abandoned its founding mission to develop AI for the benefit of humanity, and is therefore in breach of contract. He first launched his suit in early 2024, before dropping it in June and re-filing in August last year. \"Elon's nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,\"said OpenAI in a statement. \"Today, we countersued to stop him.\" Then the gloves really come off. \"Elon’s never been about the mission,\" continues OpenAI's statement. \"He’s always had his own agenda. He tried to seize control of OpenAI and merge it with Tesla as a for-profit—his own emails prove it. When he didn’t get his way, he stormed off. \"Elon is undoubtedly one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time. But these antics are just history on repeat—Elon being all about Elon.\" OpenAI also posteda timeline in December 2024that it claims shows Musk \"not only wanted, but actually created, a for-profit as OpenAI’s proposed new structure. When he didn’t get majority equity and full control, he walked away and told us we would fail. Now that OpenAI is the leading AI research lab and Elon runs a competing AI company, he’s asking the court to stop us from effectively pursuing our mission.\" Last week a California court set a March 2026 trial date for Musk's suit against OpenAI, but the courts have denied Musk's request for an injunction against Altman's plans. US District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also said she expected Musk to give evidence in court. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"This is about control. This is about revenue. It's basically about one person saying, 'I want control of that start-up',\" Ari Lightman, professor at Carnegie Mellon University,told the BBC, adding that all this talk of AI principles \"takes a backseat with all this rigmarole over control and monetization.\" Musk's newer AI company, xAI Holdings, has the LLM Grok and last month acquired X (formerly Twitter) in an all-stock deal. The troll billionaire also offered to buy OpenAI outright for$97.4 billion, which Sam Altman publicly rejected by offering to buy X for a tenth of that amount. \"Had OpenAI's Board genuinely considered the bid, as they were obligated to do, they would have seen just how serious it was,\" Musk's lawyer Marc Toberofftold the BBC. \"It's apparent they prefer to negotiate with themselves on both sides of the table than engage in a bona fide transaction in the best interests of the charity and the public.\" The sums involved here are truly hard to get your head around. Last month OpenAIraised $40 billion in a deal with Softbankthat values the company overall at $300 billion. It says this will \"pave the way\" towards artificial general intelligence (AGI), the industry's holy grail of a model that can outperform humans at all tasks. You know what, screw it: what does Musk's LLM Grok think of all this? \"I’m Grok from xAI,\"writes Musk's little chatbot. \"This OpenAI-Musk clash is a messy one. It looks like Musk’s worried OpenAI’s for-profit shift betrays its original nonprofit vibe, especially with Microsoft in the mix. Fair point—mission drift’s a real thing. But OpenAI’s got a case too: big AI needs big bucks, and their funding push makes sense. \"Both sides are dug in, slinging lawsuits and accusations—bad-faith tactics, control grabs, you name it. The evidence shows valid gripes on both ends, but this public brawl’s a distraction. AI’s supposed to help humanity, right? They’d do better teaming up than tearing each other down. Legal battles won’t fix the future—collaboration might.\" Both of these Silicon Valley gorillas say they're acting in the best interests of Open AI and, indeed, humanity itself. Yes, this is all a bit like an episode of The Good Wife. But it perhaps says everything that, for all the barbs being thrown from both sides, a chatbot is making more sense than two of the planet's richest entrepreneurs. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "article_text": "Alongside some bloke called Miles Davis. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The original music for Minecraft, alongside the reboot jingle for Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system, have been inducted into the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress and are now part of the American audio canon. These were two of the 25 recordings that make up 2025's additions (thanks AP), all of which were chosen for their \"cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation’s recorded sound heritage.\" \"These are the sounds of America, our wide-ranging history and culture\" said Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden. \"The National Recording Registry is our evolving nation’s playlist.\" The Minecraft OST was composed by German producer Daniel Rosenfeld (known professionally as C418) and released as the 2011 album \"Minecraft: Volume Alpha.\" The reboot sound for Microsoft’s Windows 95 operating system was composed by Rock & Roll Hall of Famer and producer Brian Eno. They're in pretty incredible company. The other inductees include Miles Davis' seminal 1970 album \"Bitches Brew\", considered to be among the greatest jazz albums of all time, and a recording that thePenguin Guide to Jazzdescribes as \"one of the most remarkable creative statements of the last half-century.\" Also inducted was Elton John's 1973 album \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\", Tracy Chapman's eponymous 1988 album, Mary J. Blige's 1994 recording \"My Life\", 2006's Back to Black by Amy Winehouse, and the 2015 original Broadway cast recording of the Hamilton soundtrack, composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda. As well as albums the singles \"I Am Woman, Hear Me Roar\" (Helen Reddy, 1972) and \"My Heart Will Go On\" (Celine Dion, 1997) enter the archive. As for the Minecraft soundtrack, in an old Reddit AMA Daniel Rosenfeld recalls that \"Markus [Persson] found me pretty early on, on an old IRC channel from a similarly old blog called TIGSource. We hung out there basically daily throwing our work back and forth until something clicked for Markus. I think our specific weird kinds of music interests just clicked in a way that made Markus choose for me to do it all. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"Making music for videogames is arguably three- and sometimes four- dimensional. The player oftentimes controls the screen, which means we have to predict the outcome to make sense. In the case of Minecraft for example, that was mostly a big fat ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. I mean, there was thought put into it, but we chose the music to specifically be random because it was an easier solution than for it to trigger specifically to events. The game is completely random, so I chose to go into that as well. And that's just for Minecraft! You could go so wild with conceptualising audio design.\" PC users of a certain vintage will recognise Brian Eno's Windows 95 startup theme instantly: Eno was given a list of concepts that the composition needed to capture, and a target running time of just over three seconds. The final composition ended up more like six seconds long. \"The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas,\"Eno said in a 1996 interview. \"I’d been working on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated someone coming along and saying, 'Here’s a specific problem—solve it.' \"The thing from the agency said, 'We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal, blah-blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional,' this whole list of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said 'and it must be 3.25 seconds long.' \"I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little piece of music. It’s like making a tiny little jewel.\" Eno ended up producing 84 miniature compositions. \"I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces of music,\" said the musician. \"I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke a logjam in my own work. Then when I’d finished that and I went back to working with pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.\" Funnily enough, the iconic composition was created on an Apple Mac. \"I’ve never used a PC in my life,\"Eno told the BBC in 2009. \"I don’t like them.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "article_text": "These puzzles aren't just your typical obstacles. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Causal Loop is a new first-person puzzler with a sci-fi setting fromMirebound, a team of ex-Blizzard developers. While there's been something of a resurgence in puzzle games as of late, Causal Loop seeks to set itself apart from the herd by providing puzzles that don't just work as obstacles to progression but as a way to decide how you will progress. \"Unlike traditional branching narratives, Causal Loop embeds its choice-driven design directly into gameplay,\" according to the press release. \"The puzzles are expressions of decision-making instead of just obstacles. Every action becomes part of an evolving timeline, where small miscalculations can cascade into complete failure.\" It's a neat way to make puzzles matter a bit more to the story progression and not just feel like a throwaway hurdle that you have to leap over once and then forget about for the rest of the game. Another seemingly cool feature is echoes. In a commentary video, the developers explain what this actually means: \"Players use their ability to create up to three echoes of their past selves. This ability allows players to record their actions in the game and replay them in synchronised loops.\" So while there's only one of you completing the puzzles at times, you'll have to coordinate multiple actions. But this power won't just help players solve puzzles—it can also mess things up for your future self if you don't consider every possibility and how your actions can affect the things around you. \"It doesn’t just impact the present, it sends ripples across the entire sequence that might only become clear later,\" the press release says. \"The result is a puzzle system where the player’s agency is absolute, but so is their responsibility.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Puzzles aside, the story and location also look pretty interesting. Set on an alien planet, you play as an exo-archeologist named Bale who spent the better part of his life unearthing lost civilisations and finding the secrets they left behind. This is what brings you to Tor Ulsat, the planet full of puzzles. From what is shown in the trailer, it looks like your average alien planet, but the graphics are pretty. \"With the help of experienced industry artists and our first intern, we've elevated the audiovisual quality to a professional standard,\" the devs say. Unreal Engine 5 was also used, including Lumen's advanced lighting technology. All in all, it looks like an exciting venture and one that the devs have every confidence in. \"We believe in Causal Loop's success because of the high demand for first-person puzzle games, which currently remain underrepresented,\" said creative director Kai Moosmann. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Elie is a news writer with an unhealthy love of horror games—even though their greatest fear is being chased.

    "title": "Apple reportedly shipped 600 tons of iPhones in rapid time to 'beat the tariff', only for tariffs to see a 90-day pause",
    "article_text": "This should hold off price rises for a little while. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Tariffs. If you've been following the news over the last few months, that word has likely popped up more than any other. Well, not including 'and' and 'Trump', of course. The tech industry, being dependent on labour from all around the world, is in a unique place with tariffs ever looming, and Apple's solution to this problem is just to get as many iPhones in the United States before it all takes place. As reported byReuters, Apple has allegedly shipped 600 tons of iPhones (estimated to be around 1.5 million units) from India to the US since March. Production in India was reportedly ramped up ahead of the original date tariffs were set to hit in order to stockpile devices. Reuters reports a source claims Apple \"wanted to beat the tariff.\" In India, there are three factories in total, with those split between two main suppliers, Foxconn and Tata. The Foxconn plant has reportedly been running on Sundays, in order to ramp up production ahead of tariffs. Apple has previously been reliant on production from Zhengzhou, China, but has swapped much of its focus to India, which also has a large manufacturing operation. However, this swap in production won't entirely remove Apple from countries hit by tariffs, and importing mass amounts of iPhones is likely only a stall tactic until a better plan, or tariff deal, comes along. Stockpiling millions of iPhones to sell in the future means Apple can avoid charging more for its tech for as long as possible. The iPhone 14 is likely to be discontinued in September this year, with the likely arrival of the iPhone 17, so production is still very much in the air. Here's a quick rundown of the timeline thus far. US President Donald Trump announced Tariffs as part of his campaign plan long before his current term in the White House, and he put in place some tariffs back in 2016. The intent of said tariffs is to encourage production in America, rather than abroad. After months of conversation and delays at the start of this year, Trump finally put a blanket 10% on all countries, with the likes of Taiwan, Vietnam, and China seeing bigger tariffs. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In response to this initial wave, both Vietnam and Taiwan announced they would not apply retaliatory tariffs, in an effort to establish communication with the US. China, inversely, announced its own wave of retaliatory tariffs. With companies likeFramework,Nintendo, andRazerall reportedly making adjustments in response, the stock market saw a negative effect from these tariffs and Trump put a 90-day pause on them just this week. However, he has not taken back the145% tariff put on China, as of the time of writing. With tariffs putting stock and shipping instabilities on products, Apple won't be the only company stockpiling. Just this week, it was reported thatSamsung pulled in a much higher-than-average profitthis quarter due to companies and users stockpiling chips ahead of the implementation of tariffs. With countries seeing a brief pause on tariffs, it seems like production will only continue to ramp until the next time Trump's tariffs hit the world.

    "title": "PCs with Intel's new warranty-backed 'IPO' overclocking feature reportedly go on sale in China with claimed 10% frame-rate uplifts but what about the rest of us?",
    "article_text": "IPO supposedly makes overlocking all elements of an Arrow Lake CPU simple, effective and safe. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. No, Intel hasn't gone all Gordon Gekko and got into the business of stock floatations and corporate finance. Intel Performance Optimization or IPO isn't an Initial Public Offering of a new share, but a new warranty-backed tuning paradigm that's designed to act as a middle ground between running CPUs like theIntel Core Ultra 9 285Kat stock frequencies and clocking the twangers off them manually while risking permanent damage. And it's now available on pre-built PCs. The catch is that IPO has only been mooted by Intel in China thus far and these first PCs are indeed being sold there and not anywhere else.According to UNIKO's Hardware on X, \"Intel IPO (Intel Performance Optimization) PC is now available on the China market with specific sellers.\" intel ipo (intel performance optimization) pc is now available on the china market with specific sellers like 攀升.ipo means overclocking cpu+dram, from frequencies and timings to power limits.ipo warranty is said to be provided by the seller, stability is covered.btw, even… pic.twitter.com/DXSXlFPszQApril 10, 2025 IPO hasn't been announced for global markets, but it appears to support overclocking both CPU and memory, including everything from frequencies and timings to power limits, courtesy of a set of pre-baked profiles. As far as we can understand it, IPO appears to deliver most of the benefits of manual overclocking without the risks or need to be well-versed in PC BIOS settings. UNIKO's Hardware's post on X also indicates that stability at IPO profile settings is guaranteed. In one example of the practical impact of IPO, it's said anIntel Core Ultra 7 265Kcan be run at 5.4 GHz across the P-cores, up from 5.2 GHz, while the E-core frequency steps up from 4.6 GHz to 4.9 GHz. Meanwhile, the frequency of the DDR5 memory edges up from 8,000 MT/s to 8,400 MT/s. In some ways, however, where things get really interesting is the overclocking of other elements of the CPU. The ring bus runs slightly faster at 4 GHz versus 3.9 GHz stock, while the uncore (ie parts of the chip other than the CPU cores) increases from 2.6 GHz to 3.1 GHz. Likewise, the speed of the die-to-die interconnect between the Arrow Lake CPU's chiplets jumps from 2.1 GHz to 3.1 GHz. Exactly how much any individual change makes is a complicated question. But overall, the example pre-built PC highlighted by UNIKO's Hardware comes with a claim of 10% faster in-game frame rates versus stock settings when using the IPO profile. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Whether all of this is enough to firstly close the performance gap to the likes ofAMD's hot-selling 9800X3D CPUand secondly undo the PR damage of failing 13th and 14th Gen CPUs, not to mention the patchy initial performance of Arrow Lake chips, including the Core Ultra 7 265K, is quite another matter. However, if IPO performs as advertised, it's certainly something we'd like to see rolled out beyond China. A 10% performance boost may not be massive. But when the generational uplift from, say, an Nvidia RTX 4070 GPU tothe latest RTX 5070isn't all that much better, 10% for free definitely isn't to be sniffed at.

    "article_text": "So uncivilized. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Star Wars Battlefront 2 is currently undergoing its own Jedi purge—and Sith purge, and wookiee purge. Really, it's a purge of any animate being in the galaxy, droid or otherwise. For the last few days, players have been reporting that Battlefront 2 has been left almost completely unplayable as hackers have managed to prevent any matches from starting in any of its game modes (viaIGN). Reports of hackers wielding ill-gotten admin powers in official Battlefront 2 serversdate back months, but the issue has intensified withinthe last two weeks. Hackers are seemingly able to disable player spawns entirely, rendering lobbies completely nonfunctional as the game can never properly begin. As of four days ago, players on theBattlefront 2 subredditwere describing servers for the game's 40-player modes like Galactic Assault and Supremacy as being \"permanently hacked,\" leaving only co-op and smaller lobby gametypes playable. While players are held hostage, hackers have been spamming affected lobbies withabusive chat. Within the last 24 hours, even less popular gametypes like Heroes vs Villains and Starfighter Assault are suffering from permanently stalled lobby spawns. \"Every single gamemode is completely broken,\" redditorAltiDutesaid. At time of writing, the ongoing hack is the subject of all but two threads on the front page of EA'sofficial Battlefront 2 forums. On Steam, Battlefront 2 has seen a steady increase in negative reviews in the last week as the lobbies have gotten progressively more busted. \"The cheating situation is insane,\"one reviewerwrote. \"It's impossible to play the game due to anti-spawn cheating.\" To assess the damage personally, I subjected myself to the pain of the EA app and reinstalled Battlefront 2 to try and hop into a game. Unfortunately, after lengthy lobby searches, it didn't seem like any game I was sorted into was capable of finding enough players to attempt to start a match. Considering there are apparentlyless than a thousand people in-game, it's unclear whether that's related to the current hacking issue or not. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This isn't the first time Battlefront 2 has had issues with prolonged hacking campaigns. As IGNpreviously reported, Battlefront 2 saw a widespread issue in 2021 where entire lobbies of players couldn't be reduced below 1HP, meaning no player could ever be killed and no game could end without a timeout or players voluntarily quitting. That hack persisted for months before it was eventually fixed. PC Gamer has reached out to EA for comment, and we'll update if we hear back.

    "article_text": "Roberts appeared in dozens of videogames over a long and prolific career, but the grizzled witcher Vesemir is the one that stands out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. William Roberts, a prolific voice actor who portrayed Vesemir inCD Projekt's The Witcher videogames, has died at age 80. Roberts' death was first reported byThe Guardianin February, in an obituary written by his former wife. He was born in Oregon but \"made his career in Britain,\" Nicolette Roberts wrote, \"as an actor, director, voice artist, and writer.\" Among other things, he read for BBC Radio programs, narrated audiobooks for the Royal National Institute of Blind People and other independent companies, and acted in radio productions including Batman and Judge Dredd. Roberts also appeared in dozens of videogames, according to hisMobyGamescredits, including Timesplitters 2, Crysis, Age of Conan, Battlefield: Bad Company, Killzone 2, Sniper Elite, Deponia, Star Wars: Battlefront, Horizon: Zero Dawn, A Way Out, The Medium, and Atomic Heart. But for most of us, his defining role was that of Vesemir, Geralt's timeworn mentor and friend: A role memorable enough to warrant a mention in his obituary. \"He was widely recognized for his rich, resonant tones and sensitive readings of work by authors including Melville, Poe and Lovecraft. In the 1980s he was the voice of Texas Tom in a series of adverts for the Texas Homecare DIY stores, and more recently he voiced several characters in videogames, most notably playing Vesemir in The Witcher series.\" Vesemir appeared in theoriginal Witcher videogame, but took a more prominent role in The Witcher 3, working with Geralt through the game's opening chapter and then later at Kaer Morhen. He's not a major character in the game but his status as an elder witcher granted him an impact that outweighed the size of the role: When Vesemir speaks, people—even hardened witchers—listen. While Roberts died in February, his passing didn't come to the attention of Witcher fans until CD Projekt paid tribute to the actor earlier this week: This year, we lost William 'Bill' Roberts, who portrayed Vesemir in The Witcher games. Today, we bid him a fond farewell. You taught us, you gave advice, you cared for us. Kaer Morhen will never be the same without you. Godspeed, dear old friend. ❤️ pic.twitter.com/Jgh0vklL5qApril 9, 2025 Later in life, Roberts trained as a pilot and flew his own plane across Europe and the US; he also took up writing, authoring fiction and biographies under the nameWE Roberts.

    "article_text": "Tuesday, April 15, we're all returning to Faerûn. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Larian has finally announced a date for Baldur's Gate 3 patch eight, an enormous update to our 2023 game of the year andTop 100champion. The update will go live on Tuesday, April 15, with a special launch stream on Larian's YouTubeChannel From Hellset for the following day. All of BG3's numbered updates have been quite substantial: Patch five at the end of 2023 introduced thepermadeath Honour mode, while the most recent patch sevenexpanded BG3's evil endingswith new cutscenes. Taken together, they add up to a sort of \"Definitive Edition\" final pass, much as Larian did with its Original Sin games. Patch eight is one of the biggest yet. The photo mode might have excited me more back when we were desperate for Baldur's Gate 3 thumbnails on PC Gamer dot com, but the new subclasses are like Christmas and my birthday rolled into one: A new way to play the game for each of BG3's core classes, which has alreadyset the power gaming sicko in me into overdrive. Consensus from the playtest is that theHexblade WarlockandBooming Bladespell are the new hotness. I've finally settled on a Hexblade 1 / Swashbuckler 11 as my first build to tackle patch eight, though I also have a very dear fondness for theArcane Archersubclass from its various forms in D&D videogames over the years. The back half of April was shaping up to be pretty quiet ahead of May's deluge of new releases likeDoom: The Dark AgesandElden Ring Nightreign, but now Larian's gone and lobbed a grenade right in the middle of it.

    "title": "My favorite thing about Blue Prince's intricate puzzles is that they're optional—you don't have to solve most of them to finish the game",
    "article_text": "A puzzle in a game is often presented as a brick wall: no passing this point until you solve it. Blue Prince doesn't work that way. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I think the first co-op game I ever played was Myst back in 1993. It wasn'ttechnicallyco-op, but my friend and I treated it that way. We sat side-by-side at my PC, playing through the point-and-click adventure and working to solve its baffling puzzles together. Blue Prince, a game where you enter a strange, shifting 45-room mansion to find its hidden 46th room, has a bit in common with Myst: it's about exploring an eerie and mysterious location, you'll need a pen and paper to take pages of careful notes, it's perfect for playing alongside a mystery-loving partner or friend… and it's absolutely packed with intricate puzzles. Where Blue Prince is a better game than Myst—where it's brilliant in its design in general—is that despite being filled with puzzles, you don't particularly need to solve any of them to reach room 46. In Myst and a lot of puzzle games, puzzles represent a brick wall: a place where you have to stop until you've solved the puzzle. Can't solve it? Then you're not getting any further in this direction and you're definitely not making it to the end of the game. In Blue Prince, if you can't solve a puzzle… don't worry about it. You can keep on going and find another way to that elusive final room. I solved a ton of puzzles in my playthrough of Blue Prince, but I'm pretty sure I could have gotten through the whole game without solving almost any of them. To be clear, I'm not sayingdon't solve the puzzles.They're elegantly designed puzzles, you'll have an absolute blast wrapping your mind around them, and it'll obviously make your life a lot easier as you move through the house. All I mean is, if you run into a puzzle you can't solve, it's not going to stop you in your tracks. You can try again later, or find another way to the finish line altogether. A few specific puzzles appear nearly every time you play: the parlor has a logic puzzle and the billiards room has a mathematical puzzle. Each of these puzzles, when solved, will give you either keys or gems. You're gonna need keys, because the deeper you journey into the mansion, the more locked doors you'll find, and you need gems to access certain kinds of rooms. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Thing is, you'll find plenty of gems and keys throughout the mansion even if you can't solve the math and logic puzzles in those two rooms. I've skipped those puzzles plenty of times just because I'd had enough keys and gems that I didn't need to stop to collect more. I've also gotten the answers to those puzzles wrong and missed out on the prize. Maybe flubbing a puzzle ended my run early once or twice, but you could skip those puzzles altogether, on every run, and still make it to room 46. There are other, more difficult puzzles hidden in the mansion. Most I tackled with glee, including a few that took me quite a while to figure out. (Sorry to be so vague, but I don't want to spoil even a single puzzle for anyone). I was happy when I solved them, but I discovered later that the places I accessed by solving them weren't, technically, critical to finishing the game. These puzzles all helped me reach Room 46, but I could have made it without solving them. There are even a few rooms I haven't solved completely yet, and at least one I haven't even attempted to solve. Around 25 hours in I knew I was getting close to Room 46, and I walked into a room I'd never seen before. It immediately gave off the vibe:Hi, I am a huge complicated puzzle!I wasn't in the mood for yet another monstrous brain-bender at that moment, so you know what I did? I noped out. I left the room and headed through a different door, and I still finished the run and made it to the final room. And if you're looking for guides, there's no need to search the internet or fire up YouTube: there are guides you'll find right there in the game itself. In the later hours of my playthrough, I'd occasionally find rooms deep within the mansion explaining how some of its puzzles work, the details listed in a note or on a chalkboard. I'd already figured those puzzles out by that point, but if I hadn't, the game was happy to lend me a hand. So, if you play Blue Prince (you should) and get stuck on a puzzle (you will), don't sweat it. Turn around, go through a different door, and try again later. Or, don't. Unlike most puzzle games, skipping a puzzle here and there won't stop you from finishing.

    "article_text": "And it's free to use. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There are a handful of major game streaming apps on the market but not all that many accessible ways of streaming your entire rig to your phone. Razer has just launched an app to fix that problem, and really hopes you pair the app with its controllers, the Kishi Ultra or Kish V2 while you do so. The newRazer PC Remote Playapp is built on Moonlight, which is an open-source PC streaming software, originally using Nvidia's streaming protocol. You have previously been able to get Razer's build for the appvia Github, but this week marks the launch of the app into both Apple and Android app stores. This is all to say that, while you have previously been able to stream your full PC to your phone, tablet, etc before, it hasn't quite been as easy as this. To set up Razer PC Remote Play, you have to downloadRazer Nexusand PC Remote Play apps on your phone, getRazer Cortexon your gaming rig, enable game streaming, and link the two up. You need to be on the same Wi-Fi network when you first set the two devices up but can connect wirelessly from any hotspot after the first time. Impressively, when I booted up the app, it detected that my iPhone 15 Pro Max had a refresh rate of 120 Hz and set it to run games at that refresh rate. This is a neat bit of tech and, when run in an optimised mode, it even turns off the screen of your rig, only showing an image on your extra device. That device could be a phone on the go, a tablet in another room, or even a different laptop or PC. I sent my colleague Nick on the journey of testing out PC Remote Play and he told me \"The app's pretty clunky to use, to be honest, and with all the Razer stuff running in the background, it makes my main PC quite janky\". However, he did say the set-up was smooth and streaming to his phone looks pretty great, if laggy—the above stream is with the bandwidth set to 30 Mbps. As a proof of concept, Nick told me the app has potential. This isn't Razer's first move into cloud gaming. TheRazer Edgeis a (now discontinued) gaming handheld, that hooks up to a Razer Kishi controller to play games on. Effectively a glorified Android tablet with a Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 chip, you can play mobile games on it, or use it as a dedicated streaming device. You could even buy itdirectly from Xbox, which encouraged users to use the Xbox cloud streaming platform built into Game Pass.

I'm currently writing this in a different country than where my main rig is located so I was unable to actually link the app to my device. However, I could get some genuine use out of an app that cleanly allows streaming. Hardware overlord Dave swears byGeForce Nowbut I haven't quite found the right game streaming service for me. The two services are different but the end result is still playing a beefy PC game on the go. If my internet connection can handle it, this one will be going on my to-do list when I'm back home.

    "title": "How to get into the antechamber in Blue Prince",
    "article_text": "It's not a race. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When you start unravelling the mysteries of the manor in Blue Prince, getting to the antechamber is one of the first challenges you'll likely set yourself. It's easy to assume this game is just a race to the finish, and that the antechamber is your key to reaching Room 46. But that's not the case, and instead of rushing to get to what looks like the final room, it's better to take your time and think strategically. If the challenge of placing the right rooms wasn't enough already, then getting into the antechamber is just another layer of the puzzle for you to solve. Sure, you can place all your rooms and get close to it, but that won't grant you immediate access. Here's what you need to do to unlock the antechamber. To unlock the antechamber, you need to find a lever to pull to open one of the doors.It's no use building rooms towards the back of the blueprint if you don't know which door of the antechamber you'll unlock. Fortunately, there are three levers you can use to unlock the room. These can be found in the following rooms, which may appear randomly throughout your journey in the mansion: When you draw up one of these rooms, you can expect an additional layer of difficulty to make your trip to the antechamber harder. At least once you've got to the lever, you'll have a straight run to the chamber given lady luck is on your side. Getting to the lever itself is just another part of the puzzle though, and it's different in every room. Seven doors are locked in the Grand Hall, and thelever you need is behind one of them. As you can imagine, you'll need seven keys to unlock them. There'sno way to predict which door the lever is behindas it changes each time the room is drawn up, but if youuse a silver key on the door, you've got a higher chance of immediately finding the lever. Your best bet in finding a silver key is visiting either alocksmith or billiard room,which is where I've seen them.You could also keep wandering around the manor until you candraft a foyer, which automatically unlocks every door in every hallway. This will massively reduce your need for keys, and you'll be able to check behind every door without walking in and wasting your steps, since you'll see the lever from beyond the doorframe. Once you have found it, you'llunlock the door to the east of the antechamber. If you've drawn up a greenhouse, you'll notice that the lever on the wall is missing the actual stick. You'll need to go back through the mansion to find it, but that is also entirely down to luck. I've seenthe broken lever pop up in the workshop and the billiard roomso far in my runs, but I haven't discovered any pattern as to which rooms to aim for. Much like the silver key for the Grand Hall, I think it's down to luck. Activating theGreenhouse lever will open the door to the west side of the antechamber.If you've found the broken level but you haven't drawn up a greenhouse, or you've got another of the three rooms, it's best tostore the lever in a coat room so you can easily access it in the following run. Unlike the rest of your inventory, the items you store in a coat room won't be wiped at the end of the day. It's easy to overlook this room in favour of a room that leads somewhere at the start of the day, but when you've started gathering items, it's a room well worth drafting. To get into the Secret Garden, you'll need tofind the Secret Garden Key, which is another random spawn around the map. I've only seen this key via the locksmith so far, but I imagine it's similar to the silver key which I've found in the billiard room as well. When you've got the key, you need to draft rooms to thefurthest column west or the furthest column east on the map, and then unlock a door using the Secret Garden key to spawn the room. The lever isn't available to use right away. Instead, you need togo to the fountain, and move the weathervane on top using the valves next to the fountainuntil all the prongs point toward the statue. This will reveal the lever, which willunlock the door to the south of the antechamber. Once you've unlocked a door, keep drafting rooms until you get to the antechamber. Inside, you'll find the basement key which you'll need to continue your journey into Room 46. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "As tariff chaos looms, Nvidia's RTX 5070 GPU is actually available below MSRP in the UK",
    "article_text": "It's a topsy-turvy time for tech pricing. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. With GPU prices already having gone bananas andtariffs of 145%seemingly set to wallop almost everything coming out of China, is it odd to report that you can actually buy an NvidiaRTX 5070for below MSRP? A little, surely. The catch is that the card is being offered in the UK, so this is not a US or worldwide opportunity. But for the record, the Gainward GeForce RTX 5070 Python III can be had right now for£518.99 from Overclockers. The official UK MSRP is currently £529,slightly lower than its original £539 launch MSRP in the UK. It's also worth noting that Overclockers is one of the UK's most prominent retailers of PC hardware. So, this is very much a legitimate offering from a well-established vendor. Gainward RTX 5070 | 12 GB GDDR7 | 6144 shaders | 2512 MHz boost |£518.99 at OverclockersThe RTX 5070 isn't a huge leap over the RTX 4070, but it is that little bit faster. And it comes with Nvidia's fabulous feature set. This Gainward card slips a little under the UK's £529 MSRP, which is certainly novel in current graphics card environment of ever-escalating prices. Now, if this is an appealing deal for an RTX 5070, the question remains if the RTX 5070 itself is a strong buy. On the downside, it represents relatively little advance over the old RTX 4070.That's why it scored a lowly 61% in our review. That low score wasn't due to some hideous flaw or lack of features. Viewed outside of the prism of pricing, the RTX 5070's silicon is seriously slick and the RTX 50-series as a whole offers clearly the best GPU feature set. But it also represents so little advance over the last-gen RTX 4070 for both performance and features, it's very hard not to be disappointed. All that said, we are where we are with current GPU technology and pricing and, in the current environment, a 5070 for below MSRP is a strong buy. That's partly becauseAMD's Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XTare selling above MSRP in the case of the former and very hard to find at all in the case of the latter. So, you can have anRX 9070 non-XT for about £580 in the UK. But it doesn't have as strong a feature set as the 5070. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Anyhow, it's very hard to say where GPU prices go from here. Will non-US pricing continue to slide with more and more options at or below MSRP? Could the US see a huge spike thanks to those supposed 145% tariffs? It's all terribly hard to predict.

    "title": "Ex-PlayStation exec argues 'only the dog can hear' differences between consoles and gaming PCs: 'They're all quite similar'",
    "article_text": "\"Like, 'we're gonna have 20% more ray tracing'. Okay?\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As we tend to brag from time to time, it's becoming more and more evident that the winner of the console wars isn't a console at all—but the humble personal computer. We're totally not biased in this opinion given the name of our website, and I don't appreciate the insinuation. In all seriousness, there is some truth to it.Console exclusives keep coming to PC, their sales are down, and the conveniences of couch play are no longer the domain of the console alone. Even Nintendo, everlasting bastion of the console exclusive, is struggling to market its Switch 2 in a way that doesn't make it looklike a Steam deckwith fewer games. It doesn't help that there are tons of quality of life bumps on a PC, too—as our ownFraser Brown astutely noted last year, being able to stream your PC to a TV, or take it on walkabouts with a Steam Deck makes it functionally very similar. The death knell of the console wars is finally starting to ring. Former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden,speaking to podcast PlayerDriven, did some wondering out loud on the subject, and he thinks that the console war's triumvirate of manufacturers is something that needs to go, full stop: \"Ultimately, I would like the games industry to have the same penetration rate as television sets do.\" Penetration rate is just fancy exec talk for 'what proportion of the population has this thing'. For example, most households in the UK have a kettle. Because we like our tea very much. \"So how do you get there? One thing, I don't think you get there by having only three manufacturers.\" It's here Layden loses me just a little. He proposes something \"along the lines of the 'game' format … We'd get a pretty good game format OS—if the players could agree to come together—and then licence that out. Just like we do with Blu-ray, just like we do with the compact disk—and let people compete on content.\" Layden posits that \"The architecture in the current version of [consoles] and of high-end PCs are quite close now, they're all quite similar. And any changes or any enhancements to that—like we like to say in the studios, 'only the dog can hear that'. Like, 'we're gonna have 20% more ray tracing'. Okay?\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Not to push up my glasses and have a very snooty chuckle, but any PC I'd describe as high-end routinely pushes even current-gen consoles into a locker and takes their lunch money. But that's also an uncharitable read on what I think Layden's actually getting here. Sure, you can grab an absolute terror for a couple thousand dollars—way more expensive than a console would run you—but Layden is right in that only graphically-minded freaks like our hardworking hardware team are going to be able to notice the difference. If you're aiming for the same ubiquity of a kettle, TV, or fridge? The vast majority of people won't see much change between amid-rangegaming PC and a console. This, Layden prophesies, is what's needed to \"take gaming from not just being the most financially lucrative entertainment in the world … but make it also the most socially impactful entertainment in the world.\" The issue is—and to Layden's credit, he's talking about a pie-in-the-sky scenario—game engines are a heck of a lot more complicated than CDs. Tuning for performance is a nightmare, and while upscaling tech isdownright impressive, it's far from being able to let you run a current-gen gamewellon lower-end hardware. In an ecosystem where visual fidelity is a huge selling point, as long as you can conceivably push for \"20% more ray-tracing\", people are gonna want that. Even if the senses required to notice it are an acquired taste. Not to mention, AI, which could be used to further technological equity between rigs, is mostly just beingused to make games even more ultrareal.

    "article_text": "Well, this can't be good. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You'd be forgiven for thinking that if you downloaded a Google Chrome extension from the official Chrome Web Store, it was likely to be above board. Not so, according to the founder of browser extension security platform Secure Annex, who claims he's identified 35 Chrome extensions with 4 million total installs that he concludes 'include some kind of spyware or infostealer.' The accused extensions have several things in common. They use many of the same code patterns, connect to many of the same servers, and require the same system permissions (viaArs Technica). However, John Tuckner, founder of cybersecurity firm Secure Annex,also found they use obfuscated codethat looks designed to conceal their behaviour. \"These extensions have some strong relations and most claim to actually perform some purpose like ad blocking, extension protection, better search results, or privacy protection which likely keeps them available in the web store\", says Tuckner. \"While all are different, the code for their claimed purpose is often very minimal or missing entirely.\" In the case of one particular example, Fire Shield Extension Protection, running it on a lab device resulted in a blank webpage, while clicking the options menu appeared to do nothing. Chrome developer tools revealed that the extension connected to a URL and performed a generic \"browser_action_clicked\" response, but nothing further. Using a unique extension ID found on GitHub, Tuckner was able to observe Fire Shield sending a variety of events to a web server, tracking what websites he was visiting, which he had visited previously, and the size of his display. \"While I could not find an instance of the [Fire Shield] extension exfiltrating credentials, this level of obfuscation alone, the ability for the extension’s configuration to be remotely controlled, and the capabilities in the browser extension’s code is enough for me to come to the same conclusion that all of these extensions include some kind of spyware or infostealer\" says Tuckner. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Tuckner says that he identified 35 extensions using \"eerily similar names\" and with distinct similarities. 34 of them reference a mysterious \"unknow.com\" in their background service listings. All but one of the identified extensions are unlisted, meaning that you'd have to click on a link directly to go to its Chrome store page. Nevertheless, 10 of the accused extensions are given the \"Featured\" badge by Google. As Tuckner opines: Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming. \"Why are some of these extensions selected to be 'Featured' by Google when they are not discoverable by normal users? \"This blows my mind. Any normal user might interpret that status as the extension being verified and reputable. It should absolutely not be possible to be 'Featured' and not discoverable at the same time.\" Indeed. You can find thefull list of extensions identified by Tuckeras potentially malicious at the bottom of the Ars Technica article. Many of them have names like Incognito Shield, Privacy Guard, and Total Safety, so if you're using a Chrome extension to protect your online presence, it's worth taking a look to see if you have some serious cleaning up to do.

    "article_text": "The final stretch. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Finding the basement key inBlue Princeis your gateway to completing its labyrinth of puzzles. As you work your way around the mansion, you'll find a number of items and keys you can use to progress further and unlock special rooms. But the basement key is arguably the most important. This key is the only way you'll be able to continue exploring and find the coveted room 46. There's only one place the basement key can be found in Blue Prince, which makes it significantly easier than any of the other items you're challenged to find during your time in the manor. Here's what you need to do to get the basement key for yourself, and where to head afterwards. The basement key can only be found in the antechamber.Unlike the other keys you'll need to unlock doors around the map, the basement key can only ever be found in this room, and you won't have to solve any puzzles to get it. With that said, getting into the antechamber is a puzzle in itself. You need tounlock the doors leading into the antechamberusing levers in three other rooms: the Grand Hall, the Secret Garden, or the Greenhouse. Once you're in the antechamber, thebasement key is on a pedestal in the middle. Pick it up, and you'll then need to find your way into the basement. There are a couple of ways you can do this, with the first, being via theFoundation elevator. You can alsouse the key to unlock the well door beneath the Fountainif you've drained it via the pump room, which will lead you underground. From here your path will be blocked by a minecart, but you'll be able to push it out of the way to continue forwards. If you have the basement key and you haven't used it to unlock a door leading to the basement before a day resets, you will have to go back to the antechamber to get it the following day. If you manage to unlock a door into the basement, but that's as far as you get, the door will remain unlocked at least and you can aim to get there the next day rather than retracing the steps from the day before.

    "title": "How to solve the parlor puzzle in Blue Prince",
    "article_text": "Figure out the lies to earn some gems. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Theparlor puzzleis one of the earliest challenges you'll encounter in Blue Prince. It's a great opportunity to get some gems as a reward, but you do need to work for it. You'll find two gems in one of the three boxes to the left as you enter the room, yet you can't just open them all. You have one chance to unlock the correct box containing the reward but as you can imagine, it's not straightforward. This puzzle is basically a challenge to figure out which boxes are lying so you can unlock the one containing the reward. There's a note on the desk to the right of the boxes which provides a clue, alongside a wind-up key which you'll need to pick up to unlock your chosen box. All that said, here's how to complete the parlor puzzle. You need to read the three statements on top of the boxes todetermine which one contains the reward of two gems. These statements are different every day, so you won't be able to rely on memory to solve it should you unlock the parlor the following day too. The note on the desk in the right corner of the room explains the following: As mentioned, you'll need to take the wind up key to the boxes in order to unlock them. It's important to remember that just because a box has a true statement, that doesn't mean it contains the gems. Here's an example of one of the first puzzles I faced in the parlor, and how I came to the conclusion. You might be able to use a similar approach if you're stuck. Immediately, the black box statement can be written off as false in this example. We know that one box contains a reward thanks to the note left on the desk. This means that either the blue and white boxes could be true statements, and both hint at the black box containing gems. You may think that there is a chance the statement on the white box could be false, but that would also make the statement on the blue box false. Going back to the note, we know that there is at least one true statement, and both would lead us toward the black box containing gems.This is just one example of multiple puzzles this room can throw out, but it's the kind of process you'll need to apply to each if you need help solving the puzzle. Generally, I've found that eitherlooking for the obvious liestraight away, like a box saying something we know is incorrect thanks to the information we've found on the note, or alternativelyfinding a statement that is obviously true, can help to dissect the other statements. It's a lot to think about, especially for a puzzle that seems so simple. But when you're desperate for gems, the reward is well worth the effort.

    "article_text": "Ifrit, Lord of Burnout. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Final Fantasy 14 is famous for, as much as anything, its music—and its lead composer, Masayoshi Soken, is very much part of that equation. As someone with one too many hours in the MMO myself, I can testify that this man's orchestration skills have moved me to tears more than once. He may, however, have been burning the candle at both ends. In a recent interview withPCGamesN, Soken confesses that working on both Final Fantasy 14and16 at the same time was hellish—in the literal sense of the word. \"I would be very honest in saying that I never want to do anything like that again,\" Soken explains. \"Every day was a really horrible hell—really something beyond your imagination of hell.\" Soken explains that he believed he could take on both games because, well, he did it back in the day.When FF14's disastrous 1.0 launched, Soken worked both on additional music for 1.0andthe tracks for A Realm Reborn, the reboot that saved the world of Eorzea from the brink. \"I had the experience of working on two massive games … I just didn’t give up this time either.\" As for FF16, the composer obviously pulled it off, but he notes that the experience was \"completely different .. all the things I had to make were just completely different in size\". Soken's determination in the face of a challenge isn't anything new, mind. Back in 2021, he revealed that he'dbeen battling cancerthrough the majority of Shadowbringer's patch quests, keeping his condition a secret from most of his colleagues while he worked from the hospital and underwent chemotherapy. Which is both admirable and sort of concerning—work is important, but not at the expense of your own health. Still, Soken at least seems to've realised that he shouldn't work on two major Final Fantasy titles at the same time, ever again. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"If they said, 'Would you do it simultaneously?' I would just say no … If they asked me, 'Is it that you don'twantto do it?' I would say no. It’s a difficult, difficult question. If I had two bodies, I would do both.\" Unfortunately, as is often said, no-one can be in two places at once—and I'd rather Soken be in one place, maybe with a decent amount of sleep, continuing to make bangers for a game that is full of them.

Nvidia currently uses Samsung GDDR7 modules in the new cards, so it's unclear if this switch would mean using both suppliers at once for consumer GPUs, or moving over wholesale to SK Hynix memory for the foreseeable future. Should these reports turn out to be correct, however, that would mean that new graphics card stock (of theRTX 5070, at least) may be on its way at some point in the very near future. Ifs, buts, and maybes. Still, Nvidia already hasagreements with both memory suppliersin place across its portfolio, including Samsung's eight-layer HBM3E memory used for low-tier AI processors sold to the Chinese market and SK Hynix 12-layer HBM3E in its all-singing, all-dancingBlackwell AIproducts. If a hold up in Nvidia's consumer GPU supply chain was down to Samsung memory production, then clearing that bottleneck with an SK Hynix solution would be a help to supply. Samsung has previously admittedstruggling to meet Nvidia's standardsin the memory production arena, although this was more about meeting requirements for chip performance rather than satisfying overall supply. Still, one may affect the other, of course, but this was in relation to HBM3E and not GDDR7 used in gaming cards. And then there are tariffs to throw into the equation. Given that the Trump administration seems tochange its mind on US tariffson a daily basis at the moment, it's reasonable to think that a supplier switch might help Nvidia navigate some troubled waters, although both manufacturers primarily operate out of South Korea for GDDR7 production. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Supply chains are complicated things, though, and the great tariff wheel-of-fortune we all appear to be spinning on is more complex still. Tech manufacturers the world over look to be considering their options at the moment, and the question of who makes what and ships it from where is an ever-present one when producing any product in these troubled times. Anyway, more GPU supply sounds like a good thing to me. At the very least, an influx of RTX 50-series cards might get the market moving back in the right direction, by which I mean, gamers being able to purchase a new GPU for a reasonable amount of money.

    "title": "Report estimates AI energy demands will quadruple in the next few years, with some large planned centres estimated to use the equivalent power of 5,000,000 households",
    "article_text": "It's fairly hopeful about AI's impact on the environment, though. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. One of the biggest concerns people have about AI is energy consumption, and a recent report suggests that things are only going to get worse in that regard over the next few years. However, the same report also argues there is a silver lining. A study from the Internal Energy Agency (IEA) titled Energy and AI was recently published (viaThe Guardian) using data gleaned from global datasets and consultation with \"governments and regulators, the tech sector, the energy industry and international experts\". In it, the paper suggests energy demands for data centres broadly will grow by double, and the use of AI data centres, specifically, will grow by a factor of four. The energy needed to supply these data centres is reported to grow from 460 TWh in 2024 to more than 1,000 TWh in 2030. This is then predicted to reach 1,300 TWh by 2035. Though traditional data centres are also projected to grow with time, AI-optimised servers are taking up the biggest equivalent share of that growth. As pointed out by IEA director of sustainability, Laura Cozzi, in afull presentationon the paper, the energy demand for individual data centres is growing over time. Hyperscale data centres (effectively the biggest ones) consume the equivalent power of 100,000 households today, with the largest under construction right now set to consume the equivalent of 2 million households. The largest currently announced (but not yet under construction) would consume the energy of 5 million households. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. However, the paper argues that this increased demand isn't all doom and gloom in regard to climate change. It starts the 'AI and climate change' section by pointing out that over 100 countries have deals to reach net zero emissions between 2030 and 2070. A forty-year gap is a rather nebulous one when the demand is surging now, and 'net zero' could mean quite a lot, on the grand scale. The fact that bringing in energy demands doesn't appear to be an argument made here suggests that net zero will be achieved with offsets, as opposed to regulation on AI. However, the argument made in 'Energy and AI' is largely that AI models, and their advancement, can be used to rein in inefficiencies in other energy sectors, reducing emissions in regards to methane, the power sector, and larger industry. The report argues \"The adoption of existing AI applications in end-use sectors could lead to 1,400 Mt of CO2 emissions reductions in 2035\". The report estimates global fuel combustion emissions equated to 35,000 Mt in 2024. This argued offset is inclusive of an adoption that the report suggests isn't currently happening. \"It is vital to note that there is currently no momentum that could ensure the widespread adoption of these AI applications. Therefore, their aggregate impact, even in 2035, could be marginal if the necessary enabling conditions are not created.\" Talking to The Guardian, Claude Turmes, former secretary for sustainable development and infrastructure for Luxembourg, is critical of the report's findings. Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming. ​​\"Instead of making practical recommendations to governments on how to regulate and thus minimise the huge negative impact of AI and new mega data centres on the energy system, the IEA and its [chief] Fatih Birol are making a welcome gift to the new Trump administration and the tech companies which sponsored this new US government.” The IEA report has a built-in AI chatbot on-page and when I asked it what the paper says about climate change, it told me: \"The widespread adoption of existing AI applications could lead to emissions reductions equivalent to around 5% of energy-related emissions in 2035. However, this is still far smaller than what is needed to address climate change.\" James is a more recent PC gaming convert, often admiring graphics cards, cases, and motherboards from afar.

    "title": "Marvel Rivals Season 2 is fire, mostly thanks to Emma Frost's ability to choke slam other heroes out of their ultimate abilities",
    "article_text": "Emma Frost is the Vanguard we all deserve. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm sure we've all experienced the unbridled rage inMarvel Rivalsthat comes with repeatedly getting jumped by Magik, Spider-Man, Iron Fist or whoever the enemy team's designated diver is. As someone who predominantly plays Strategist, I encounter this pretty much daily, which is whyEmma Frostin all her brawling, dive-countering glory is so much fun to play. I've never been able to gel with a Vanguard. I'm not quite sure what it is, as I play tank inOverwatch 2quite often. But for whatever reason, things are different in Marvel Rivals and no matter how much I try to force Groot or Doctor Strange, nothing seems to work. For this reason, I wasn't expecting to love Emma Frost as much as I do. Marvel Rivals tier list: Best characters for each roleMarvel Rivals characters: Current and confirmed rosterMarvel Rivals ranks: How to climb in competitiveMarvel Rivals codes: Grab free gear and moreMarvel Rivals crosshairs: The best custom reticles Her ability set can be a bit tough to familiarise yourself with at first, as she works a little differently from the other heroes. LikeRamattra from Overwatch 2, Emma Frost has two sets of abilities depending on what form she's in. In her regular form, Emma Frost has the Psychic Spear ability, which allows her to seize an enemy's \"sentience\" and deal damage twice as quickly, as well as having Mind's Aegis, which lets her put up a shield. However, in her diamond form, which also has damage reduction, she gets access to two different abilities, Carbon Crush and Crystal Kick. These let her grab an enemy and choke slam them to the floor, and kick enemies, dealing knockback damage. Emma Frost's normal form and abilities are pretty good for standard play: Her Telepathic Pulse has enough range on it that you can reach flying heroes up in the sky and keep other tanks at arm's length. But it's not nearly as fun as her diamond form. With this, you become a really brawly tank, much like Captain America or Hulk, as your primary fire shifts to Faceted Fury (you throw punches), which can be devastating when you couple it with Carbon Crush, something that I like to use as a finishing move. This second form gives Emma Frost a good amount of freedom to shift as fights change, being a normal mid-range tank when your team is holding their own and then quickly changing to a close-range brawler if your backline is getting jumped by Spider-Man or an enemy Vanguard tries to get too close. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But her diamond ability isn't just of use when fending off flankers, it can also be used to stun enemies out of their ultimate abilities. Emma Frost probably won't stay all-powerful for too long. As long as you get to enemy players before they can stun you with their ultimate like Doctor Strange or Groot, then you can stop their ult in its tracks. Or for other heroes like Peni Parker, Black Panther, or Spider-Man, you can just slam them to the floor in the midst of their ultimate, instantly stopping it, and maybe even killing them in the process. The only hero I've come across so far who I can't seem to knock out of their ultimate is Magneto, but if he hits you while you're in diamond form, he won't be able to kill you, so it's not a massive problem. It's all fun and games being able to ruin someone's game by messing up their carefully timed ultimate, but like most new heroes added to Marvel Rivals, I can foresee some balance issues with Emma Frost. The devs working on Marvel Rivals haven't been shy about wanting to prioritise fun over balance. They've explained how the most important thing is to ensure players are having fun with the game, and they aim to ensure this by providing heroes with unique, powerful, and interesting abilities. Emma Frost ticks all of these boxes, but she's so strong that playing against her will likely be a bit of a chore. Human Torchhad the same issue when he wasadded alongside The Thing in Season 1.5, where he became the new meta thanks to histeam-up ability with Storm, which turned her ultimate into a fire tornado. But like Human Torch, Emma Frost probably won't stay all-powerful for too long. Either she'll be nerfed slightly when the next hero balance patch rolls around, or the devs will just add an even stronger hero to the mix. I'll be sure to take advantage of her unbridled strength until that time comes. Elie is a news writer with an unhealthy love of horror games—even though their greatest fear is being chased.

    "article_text": "I've heard others say the same. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm sorry to have to do this, but I'm using this article to make a direct, sincere plea to Todd Howard. Todd, you and I have had our differences: I didn't love Starfield, you refuse to make Morrowind 2: Dagoth Ur's Day Out. But we need to put that behind us. Why? Because your people are hurting, Todd. They're suffering. In their fan-forums and Discords, the Oblivion community has gone absolutely doolally waiting for you to announce that Oblivion remake they've all convinced themselves is coming. Really, we're atSilksong communitylevels of derangement here. If you're not up to date with the latest news on videogames from 2006, word of a possibleremake of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivionleaked out of Microsoft a few years back, and by my recollection the community reaction at the time was broadly 'Huh, well, that'd be neat.' But in the last few months, rumours that the remake is due for an imminent release—maybe even a same-day announcement and release—has accelerated Oblivion likers straight past enthusiasm and into full-blown ferality. So far as I can tell, the Oblivion community has found a kind of quantum superposition by which it's able to occupy every possible emotional state at once. We've gotbaseless confidencethat the remake is coming,baseless confidencethat it isn't,fear,madness, obsessiveaugur-reading, a complete descent intoconspiratorial thinking, and this guy who says it wasactually released yesterday. It's all in good humour of course, but the thirst underpinning it all is very real, and I can't help but find that a little odd. Don't get me wrong, I'd be very eager to get my hands on a full-blown Oblivion remake too—that game was a crucial part of my childhood and I'm nothing if not a sucker for nostalgia—but at least the Silksong community has gone mad over a period of years in the wait for a 100% new game that is definitely, actually real. The Oblivion community has done that in a few months for a game that might not ever have existed at all, and which you can already pretty much remake yourself thanks to the thousands of Oblivion mods that are out there. It's like there's a gas leak in the subreddit. \"At this point I feel like the entire subreddit is already merging with Shivering Isles,\" writes Reddit userLiebermodein a pithily on-brand observation. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Still, at least it's entertaining. For my money—and I emphasise that this is pure speculation based on no insider knowledge at all—I reckon Bethesdadoeshave an Oblivion remake cooking away somewhere, and it's probably due out sooner rather than later. But if you're at the point where you're launching an online Spanish Inquisition against the doubters (or the believers) well, then… carry on, actually.

    "article_text": "Jackpot! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's only been a week since the new Devil May Cry animated show arrived on Netflix, and what a week it's been. There's been the usual amount of fans angry that their beloved game has been butchered (change is a hard thing to grasp), people confused about Dante's sick dance scenes, and now the announcement that the show has been renewed for a second season. \"Let's dance,\" Netflix says in anannouncement post. \"Devil May Cry is officially coming back for Season 2!\" Although there's no specific date tagged onto this announcement, Netflix does say that it's coming soon. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Now, soon could mean just about anything. Years and years of delays have shifted my interpretation of \"soon\" from meaning months away to meaning sometime in the distant or not so distant future, who knows? So while I'd like to think that this means we'll be getting the second season before the end of 2025, I'm certainly not holding out hope for a speedy return. It seems like most fans are excited to see this show renewed for a second season, but there are still more than a few who are unsure whether this show is even worth it, asking:\"No bs, is this honestly worth watching?\" I'll admit that some of the CG use is slightly egregious, but it does make way for some of the best animated scenes I could've hoped to see in a Devil May Cry animated show, like Dante's bike fight scene while he's chasing the white rabbit. Otherwise, I can't help but absolutely love Johnny Yong Bosch's performance as Dante. Hemay not be the canonical choice, but it works for me. Needless to say, whatever you think of Devil May Cry's first season, this reveal shouldn't come as much of a surprise.

    "title": "There's hope for the PC market yet: Sales boom before tariff hammer comes down and HP expects 90% of its US PCs will be made outside of China by the end of the year",
    "article_text": "Is this the peak before the dip? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Serial PC hardware market watchers and soothsayers Canalys has dumped itslatest set of PC hardware sales data. And the raw numbers are good, with total PC sales up by nearly 10% for the first quarter of a 2025 compared to the same period last year. But withTrump's China tariffs escalating by the minute, and currently clocking in at 145%, it's anyone's guess where PC sales go from here. Meanwhile, Canalys says PC makers have already taken major steps to move production out of China, citing HP's expectation that it will be making 90% of its PCs outside of China by the end of 2025. To be more precise about those PC sales figures, Canalys says, \"total shipments of desktops, notebooks and workstations grew 9.4% to 62.7 million units in Q1 2025. To break that down a bit, \"notebook (including mobile workstations) shipments hit 49.4 million units, up 10% compared to a year ago. Shipments of desktops (including desktop workstations) rose 8% to 13.3 million units.\" Of course, you could argue this uptick in PC sales isn't actually healthy. Indeed, Canalys implies just that, saying, \"Q1 volumes were boosted by OEMs ramping up shipments to the US in anticipation of the first round of the Trump administration’s tariff announcements.\" The obvious implication being, there's a probable dip to come. \"Subsequent quarters this year are likely to see a slowdown as inventory levels normalize and customers face higher prices,\" Canalys reckons. As for the solution, moving production out of China appears to be the narrative: \"Major OEMs already began supply chain diversification during Trump’s first term and are expected to continue moving away from China towards Vietnam, Thailand, and India, despite these countries also facing the imposition of tariffs.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. What's more, Canalys points out that CEO Enrique Lores has stated that 90% of HP's products sold in the US would be made outside of China by the end of this year. It's notable that it's 90% of product sold in the US, not 90% of overall HP product. In other words, HP products for other markets are likely to have higher Chinese content. Taking this all in the round, it's hard to know what conclusions to draw. PC sales are doing well of late, but tariffs loom. Then again, it seems like large sectors of the industry are already well placed to avoid China tariffs, at least in part. Ultimately, however, our own Andy Chalksummed the situation up wellwhen he said, \"Whether you're a Wall Street investor or just someone trying to upgrade their gaming PC, all you're left with today is more uncertainty and instability.\" It's hard to imagine how that doesn't push up prices, at least a little bit.

The chicken jockey trend is currently ripping its way through any cinema showingA Minecraft Movie. For those of you who are blissfully unaware, this trend sees cinemas erupt in chaotic celebration when Jack Black, who plays Steve, utters the words \"chicken jockey\" towards the end of the film. While it seems like a nuisance for staff and some fans, apparently the director, Jared Hess, loves it. \"It's way too funny,\" Hess says in an interview withThe New York Times. \"It’s been a total blast. I’m just laughing my brains out every time someone sends me a new video.\" I'll admit that some of the videos are really funny, especially the ones where, during the ruckus, someone manages to climb onto their friend's shoulders mimicking the chicken jockey just in time for the grand reveal; now that's dedication. Minecraft update: What's new?Minecraft skins: New looksMinecraft mods: Beyond vanillaMinecraft shaders: SpotlightMinecraft seeds: Fresh new worldsMinecraft texture packs: PixelatedMinecraft servers: Online worldsMinecraft commands: All cheatsMinecraft build ideas: What to build next \"Jack says it with such passion,\" Hess continues. \"Everything that comes out of his mouth in the film is spoken with such authority and seriousness, like this is the most important thing anybody has ever heard in their life. I think people just love the craziness of it.\" But while some of the videos are funny to watch, I bet they aren't funny to witness in real life. Cinemas all over have been trying to combat chaotic showings of the film, dealing with rowdy and annoying teenagers and then being left to clean up the mess of 50 people's popcorn thrown across the floor and evena live chicken being let loose in the cinema. One cinemahad to call the copsafter a showing got way too out of control. There is an element of knowing what you're getting into when you show up to a screening for A Minecraft Movie. While I wouldn't be happy to get popcorn and soda dumped on my head, I'd really only have myself to blame if I decided to watch the film in a cinema right now. Although it doesn't apply to everyone. I've seen videos and posts from parents who have described how awful these showings are for their young kids who just want to go to the film, see some creepers, and watch as Jack Black screams about Minecraft items. But Hess seems to think that these reactions are almost unavoidable: \"It’s not something you see all the time, but I think [the chicken jockey] is adorable, and ridiculous, and it can murder you, and that’s something that makes it special.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "One is significant to my childhood, at the very least. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Just listen to that short clip above. Go on, I'll wait. That, my friends, is the sound that began some of my early computing experiences, when this hardware writer was a mere whelp dipping his toes into the wonderful world of personal computing. Whaddaya mean you don't recognise it? It's the Windows 95 start-up sound, and it's recently been added to the US Library of Congresslist of nationally significant recordings. Alongside \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" by Elton John, Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go on\", and, err, \"Minecraft: Volume Alpha\", to name but a few (viaThe Register). I'd imagine for quite a few of you reading it's the latter that sums up your childhood, but for me it's the strained opening notes of good old Windows 95, ideally delivered over two tinny beige speakers of dubious origin. Those were the days. Tracks added to the list are judged to be \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress, as explained in a handyFAQ. Titles are submitted to the organisation by public nomination, before being whittled down to 25 selected recordings per year. Windows 95was launched in, you guessed it, 1995. July 14, to be exact, meaning that it's the 30th anniversary of the much-beloved (it's still not just me, is it?) operating system this year. Save the cake and streamers for July, I guess, but for now, it's nice to see the old stalwart getting some early recognition. Windows 95 was in many ways a leap forward for personal computing, adding in a now very recognisable updated GUI that made the Windows operating system much more personable and easy to use. I have vague memories of messing around withWindows 3.1and DOS-based interfaces before Win 95 hit the scene, and it was a dark and scary time. That GUI really did seem to make Windows a friendlier, happier place to be, with far fewer blinking prompts and obtuse menu systems. So, if you're a Windows user today you owe something both to Windows 95 and that start-up sound. To me, it was the sound ofadventuresbeginning on my screen and wasted (read: enjoyable) summers to come.

    "article_text": "Gear up for another stacked season with the Hellfire Gala. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As you'd expect from a new update,Marvel RivalsSeason 2 brings tons of events you can complete for all sorts of free goodies. In fact, it's better than ever, as there are two events giving away great skins right now. While the Wanda's Chaos Gown event simply asks you to play some matches, theCerebro Databaseevent is much more complicated, at least at first glance. Thanks to stacked menus, confusing terminology, and a hefty task ahead of you, thisMarvel Rivals Season 2event is a head-scratcher compared to what we're used to. But you'll need to power through it to earn theFlower MaidenMantis costume, so it's well worth the effort. Let's face it, the collector in us all would want to nab the skin even if it sucked, but that's beside the point. The Cerebro Database event features four challenge sections, represented by different characters: Emma Frost, Wolverine, Black Panther, and Namor.Complete all four challenges and you'll earn the Flora Maiden skin for Mantis. To accomplish these challenges, you need tobeat individual missions in each section to form three vertical, horizontal, or diagonal lineson the board. You'll earn a small reward for each line you create in each section. Importantly, you don't need to beat all the missions within each individual challenge; just enough to form three lines. You're best off completing the easiest missions and ignoring the rest (which will be automatically ticked off at the end to clear the board). Here's my suggestions: You're likely to complete some odd missions here and there, since most are actually pretty easy to do by accident, but aiming for these ones will let you finish the event fast. The Black Panther and Namor challenge sections are time-gated to a later date. I'll add details on which missions to complete in these sections when they become available in-game. Other than the Flower Maiden Mantis costume, you'll also earn heaps of chrono tokens and units, and profile customisation options such as nameplates and sprays, though we all know the free skin is the biggest treat here.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Don't worry if you're feeling a bit stumped by Friday'sWordle, because we've got everything you need to win right here. Start with our general tips and see how you go, knowing our clue for the April 11 (1392) puzzle's here to help if you need it. Need more? You've got it. The answer to today's Wordle is never more than a quick scroll away. A wild guess on my third row really sorted today's Wordle out in an instant. It was completely wrong, but in all the ways that made the right word obvious. Now I knew for certain where everything didn't go, rearranging them into the only places they could still fit was easy. These are often used to point the way to a destination, such as a train platform or service desk. Also a sharp weapon, traditionally made mostly from wood. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Need a win? The answer to the April 11 (1392) Wordle isARROW. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "Schedule 1 player follows NPCs around for a week to reveal their surprisingly thoughtful, dynamic lives",
    "article_text": "\"Dude pulling doubles every day. No wonder he's employee of the month and needs so many drugs.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Schedule 1 is the sort of indie game that only gets more impressive the longer you stare at it. It's a drug dealing simulator, so you expect to grow weed out of a cramped apartment by day and hustle by night, but Schedule 1's complexity can catch you by surprise once you poke around its clockwork town full of named citizens with jobs, homes, schedules, desires, and unique habits. Jessi, for instance, has quickly become a community favorite for her, um, distinct personality. She's one of the first regular customers you can bring into the fold of your burgeoning empire and a real firecracker. She's kind of a jerk, but I appreciate a straight shooter and respect Jessi's dogmatic belief that the caps lock is there to be used. You always know when Jessi's hitting you up for another order, because the text pop-up reads something like \"HEY, I NEED 7 BIO STINK RIGHT NOW. I HAVE $400\". As you might have deduced, Jessi is also a favorite because she buys alotof drugs. So much that you can easily upsell her on more units or straight up overcharge her. On the other end of the spectrum is Kyle, a supremely chill dude who smokes weed and then walks to his job at Taco Ticklers. Kyle was the first subject of an ongoing peoplewatching experiment by Reddit user_inferno_44. They followed Kyle around for a week and recorded exactly what they did each day. The results are as mundane as you'd expect, but I was surprised to learn the poor guy is severely overworked: Kyle, my man, they have you pulling 14-hour shifts at the taco place? That's rough, but actually, I've never seen anyone else in a Taco Ticklers uniform around the restaurant, so I suppose he's the only employee (Krusty Krab-style). \"Dude pulling doubles every day. No wonder he's employee of the month and needs so many drugs,\" wrote lonelystone81 under the post. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. To make matters awkward, it's also possible to purchase the Taco Ticklers as a money laundering front, which makes us the baddies flagrantly ignoring OSHA protocol. What a cool and non-crucial detail to include that 30-minute lunch break in the simulation, by the way. Not even Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, a grand RPG with routines and jobs, has lunch breaks (though people do walk to the tavern after a hard day's work). Next, inferno followed Kyle's roommate,Austin. I can't remember if I've met this guy in my save yet, but judging by his habits I bet we'd get along. He leaves the house a bit later than Kyle and walks to the community center, where he presumably works until his 30-minute break at 10:30. Then he heads to the Taco Tickler to eat lunch and hang with Kyle, then promptly darts over to the arcade where he games for the next seven hours. At 11 pm, well past police curfew, he walks home. What a gamer. \"Homies gotta be the local pinball wizard spending all that time at the arcade,\" added user Exact-Trash2360. The latest subject isJessi herself, who maybe has the most dynamic yet dull routine of the trio. In true stoner fashion, Jessi's day doesn't start until early lunchtime, 11 am. Her routine is one big smoke tour: First she smokes at the Taco Tickler, grabs a Cuke from the vending machine, then walks to the town hall and smokes there, before teleporting to the boardwalk to sit on a bench and smoke. To top it off, she smokes down at the docks and then walks back to her motel room to bump loud music. No wonder she goes through a jar of my best weed strain in a day. Part of me thinks that Jessi's lack of a job, hobby, or interest beyond smoking in empty spaces and drinking soda is an oversight by TVGS to give her any real life, but on second thought, that's a pretty believable lifestyle for a true connoisseur.

    "title": "ChatGPT's memory upgrade might just be the biggest AI improvement we see all year",
    "article_text": "Long-term AI assistance gets a lot easier when it can remember your interactions When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OpenAIjust rolled out a majormemory upgrade for ChatGPT. Though subtle in a way, I think it could mark a significant shift in how people engage with AI, certainly in the long term. Before now,ChatGPT's memory was limited to the current session unless ChatGPT decided some bit of it should be added to long-term memory or if you manually did so. Otherwise, every new conversation was a clean slate. Now, ChatGPT can pull from your entire chat history across every session to respond to your latest query. It knows your vibe and can track your projects. It will remember things from your discussions even if you might have forgotten. It still has the user-saved memory that you deliberately ask it to store, but now, every little comment and question will also be part of how ChatGPT processes conversations with you, like a polite robot intern who’s secretly keeping a journal. If you want to find out what ChatGPT's image of you is, you can just ask it to \"Describe me based on all our chats.\" You might not think this is such a big change, but as someone who's become a regular user of ChatGPT, I can easily imagine how it will benefit me. When I ask for a recipe idea, ChatGPT will now pull up previous recipes it's provided and ask if I liked the result, coming up with new meal ideas based on my opinion of the earlier one. The same goes for brainstorming bedtime story ideas. I almost never want to write one entirely, but I do get some inspiration from the premises ChatGPT suggests, and now it will be better at riffing on suggestions I've said before. While new features and improvements to AI chatbots can sometimes feel like a lot of noise for something that isn't that big a deal, persistent memory feels like real progress just by being a feature built for the long term. Maintaining context across interactions makes it easier for the overall 'relationship' to feel more meaningful. It also opens the door to new use cases. Imagine tutoring that adapts to your learning style across weeks. Or therapy journaling with an AI that remembers what you said three sessions ago. Or productivity planning that doesn’t need to be re-explained every Monday morning. You don’t need the AI to be sentient as long as it's consistent. ChatGPT's memory improvement isn't without complications, though. Having an AI remember you across time inevitably raises questions about privacy, autonomy, and, frankly, how much information you want your AI companion to have. Yes, it’s helpful that it remembers you’re kosher and like a bit of spice in your dishes, but you don't want it to assume too much. This is pretty specific to just me, but I do a lot of tests of ChatGPT and its features, and not every test is built around my real life. I'm not traveling to Japan next week; I just wanted to see how ChatGPT would do at devising an itinerary. I then have to either delete that session or explain to the AI that it shouldn't use that question when formulating answers to other questions. There’s also a philosophical element. The more AI mimics memory, the easier it becomes to anthropomorphize. If it remembers your favorite sports team, your pet’s name, or your dislike of semicolons, it starts to feel like a person, and it's vital to not ascribe self-awareness to an algorithm that is far from attaining it. It’s easy to trust a tool that remembers you. Maybe too easy in this case. Nonetheless, for good or ill, I maintain that ChatGPT's comprehensive memory is one of the most consequential AI upgrades this year so far and will likely still be so when 2025 is over. Memory is a potent trick, even if it doesn't let you make a Ghibli Studio version of yourself. Memory is the thing that turns an inert tool into a long-term assistant. Even if your assistant is just a digital emulation of a brain floating in a cloud, it's nice that it will remember the little things.

    "title": "Nespresso's new sweet vanilla decaf pods could make coffee my new favorite bedtime drink",
    "article_text": "Move aside, cocoa When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I love coffee, but I also love my sleep, so after about 2pm I always switch to decaf to avoid being kept awake at night. It works well, but opting for decaf generally means you miss out on some of the more unusual flavors around – like thedouble-fermented passionfruit beansI got from my local coffee roaster recently, orNespresso's white chocolate and strawberry coffee pods, which are an unlikely but delicious combination of flavors. My Speciality Coffee Association (SCA) instructor calls it 'cheating coffee', but when it tastes this good, who cares? Thankfully, just as alcohol-free beer is now mainstream and varied, we're starting to see roasters and manufacturers start to get more creative with decaf – and Nespresso's newSweet Vanilla Decaffeinatopods are so comforting, they might just become my new favorite bedtime drink. Coffee beans can have notes of vanilla by themselves, depending on the variety and the roast, and when extracted correctly (a tricky process to get right), coffee does have a natural sweetness. However, it's quite subtle, and if you want something more dessert-like, a coffee with added flavor is the way forward. Decaffeinated coffee is made by removing the caffeine from green (unroasted ) coffee beans by dissolving it in water. There are a few different ways to achieve this, and Nespresso uses two different methods. The first involves simply soaking the beans in hot water to dissolve the caffeine (known as the Swiss water process). This process leaves behind no residue that could alter the taste and character of the coffee The second method (the carbon dioxide process) is more efficient. Again, it involves soaking the beans in water to make them porous, but this time the soaked beans are placed in a pressurized container and exposed to CO2, which dissolves the caffeine. Once caffeine has been extracted from the beans, it can be re-used to make high-caffeine drinks likeNespresso's energy-boosting functional coffees. After loading a pod into myNespresso Vertuo Pop(one of thebest Nespresso machinesaround if you need something compact) and hitting the brew button, I was left with a cup full of creamy decaf coffee with a generous layer of foam. It's delicious by itself, and the added flavor doesn't overpower the taste of the beans, but I enjoy a milky bedtime drink and vanilla typically works well with dairy, so I was keen to see how it would hold up as a white coffee. The Sweet Vanilla Decaffeinato pods are mug-sized, meaning they'll fill a 230ml mug, but I still had room for a little caramel-flavored barista oat milk, or regular dairy milk. The flavors both combine very nicely, though regular milk would work best if you don't have a particularly sweet tooth. Hopefully we'll see even more decaf options soon – cheating or otherwise.

    "article_text": "Chinese officials have privately claimed responsibility for the intrusions When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Amid a serious escalation of hostilities between the two nations, senior Chinese officials have apparently acknowledged behind closed doors that Beijing was involved in a series of cyberattacks on US critical infrastructure. These attacks sawChinese Volt Typhoon hackers infiltrate US critical infrastructure systems for years, including compromising energy, communications, transportation, and water industries. China had previously denied any involvement in these attacks, but theWall Street Journalnow reports Beijing officials admitted involvement in an “indirect and somewhat ambiguous” way, interpreted by US officials as a “warning to the U.S. about Taiwan.” Monitor your credit score with TransUnion starting at $29.95/month TransUnion is a credit monitoring service that helps you stay on top of your financial health.

News about increasing reciprocal tariffs between the two nations is pretty unavoidable, but the trade war is not the only stage for offensives, with US officials reportedly considering pursuing cyber strikes against China and security experts warning that China is poised to retaliate against tariffs with a “Typhoon” attack - referring to hacking groups Salt and Volt Typhoon. This news comes after the Trump administration has implemented mass federal layoffs, which a formerNSA cybersecurity director has warned will have a “devastating impact on cybersecurity”. These admissions are, of course, likely to be a tactical move from China to underscore its own capabilities and willingness to use them.

    "title": "It's alive! IBM unveils its most powerful mainframe yet, which it says is fully engineered for the AI Age",
    "article_text": "IBM z17 is powered by the Telum II processor Big Blue announced in 2024 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. IBM has announced the z17, a new mainframe to address growing AI demands on enterprise infrastructure. Positioned as a foundation for hybrid cloud environments, and with support for real-time AI and enterprise-grade resilience, the IBM z17 is designed to handle transaction-heavy workloads, improve operational efficiency, and address security concerns in industries with stringent compliance needs. Central to the new mainframe is the Telum II processor, which was originally announced at Hot Chips 2024. Developed usingSamsung5nm technology, it integrates an on-chip AI coprocessor to support inferencing tasks, including small language models with fewer than 8 billion parameters. Alongside the processor, Big Blue plans to offer the Spyre Accelerator card (also originally previewed at Hot Chips) to complement the Telum II and extend the AI compute capabilities for unstructured data processing such as text-based generative AI. The z17 can accommodate up to 48 of these accelerator cards, allowing scalability across enterprise workloads. It is expected to be available 4Q 2025 via PCIe card. Security is a big focus for the IBM z17 and includes AI-powered features such as Sensitive Data Tagging for z/OS and IBM Threat Detection for z/OS, both of which use natural language processing to identify and protect sensitive data or scan for potential threats. In addition, it supports NIST-standardized quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms to address future regulatory requirements. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The z17 system also incorporates a new data processing unit to accelerate I/O protocols for networking and storage. IBM says it expects application developers to benefit from AI-driven assistants that can automate tasks across the software development lifecycle, improving productivity and reducing skill transition issues in mainframe environments. Transactional AI use cases such as fraud detection, money laundering prevention, and anomaly detection can now be deployed closer to the data source, IBM says, with support for multimodel inference to improve accuracy and reduce false positives. \"The industry is quickly learning that AI will only be as valuable as the infrastructure it runs on,\" said Ross Mauri, general manager of IBM Z and LinuxONE, IBM. \"With z17, we're bringing AI to the core of the enterprise with the software, processing power, and storage to make AI operational quickly. Additionally, organizations can put their vast, untapped stores of enterprise data to work with AI in a secured, cost-effective way.\" Available in configurations that support up to 208 processors and 64TB of memory, the z17, which is the culmination of five years of design and development, is designed to operate at 5.5GHz and comes housed in up to four frames. While aimed at critical workloads, IBM is also positioning it as part of a larger hybrid cloud strategy.

    "title": "Fujifilm's quirky new compact just leaked – and it could be 2025's most fun camera",
    "article_text": "The new 'X-Half' looks like it could be a little bundle of joy When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fujifilmhas never exactly followed the herd, but even by its standards the company's next compact camera will be an eccentric one – if new rumors about the so-called 'X-Half' are to be believed. Fuji Rumorsrecently sharedwhat it claims is the first leaked image of the camera, and has now followed that up withnew postthat gives it a name. The X-Half, it seems, will be a compact camera with 1-inch sensor that rivals the many half-frame cameras that have become popular among young snappers in recent years. What is half-frame? As thePentax 17andKodak Ektar H35show, the format –traditionally found on 35mm film cameras – sees shots taken in vertical format, effectively giving you twice as many photos from a roll a film. The X-Half's twist, according to rumors, is that it'll be digital and, potentially, a bit more desirable than those two cameras. Meet the Fujifilm X-Half – Fujifilm’s Upcoming Digital Half Frame Camerahttps://t.co/5Bpynjtpy9 pic.twitter.com/viEj6jIThIApril 11, 2025 Another reason why half-frame cameras are popular is because they easily let you create 'diptych' images, or two side-by-side frames. This lets you juxtapose two different angles on the same subject, which is a very social media-friendly trick. To help you compose these shots, Fuji Rumors claims the X-Half will have a vertical LCD on its rear panel. Like Fujifilm's other big hits – notably theFujifilm X100VI– the X-Half will also seemingly again blend digital convenience with film-like charm. The leaked specs include an optical viewfinder (which should keep the price down, compared to an EVF), a retro, Leica-like design, and a few manual controls including an exposure compensation dial. It'll also apparently have a fixed lens with an f/2.4 aperture. There's unfortunately no rumored released date for the X-Half yet. But with speculation on the rise, it seems possible that Fujifilm could launch it in time for the summer seasons in the US and UK – assuming tariff-related complications don't derail it. With many Fujifilm fans patiently waiting for more 'serious' cameras, like an X-Pro 4, these X-Half rumors probably aren't what many have been waiting for – but I'm happy to see something new on the horizon. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. While the idea of a digital half-frame camera seems odd on paper – after all, you don't need to worry about saving film costs with digital – the X-Half could definitely find an audience among those who want a retro sidekick that's different from their smartphones, but easier to use than thebest film cameras. In that sense, it'll likely have more in common with Fujifilm's Instax series than pricier pro models like theGFX100RF.If it is Fujifilm's next launch, you could see it as the perfect flip-side to the latter, which is a medium format powerhouse that costs $4,899 / £4,699 / AU$8,799. The X-Half could, instead, be a compact that caters to a new, younger audience who want something with a bit more substance than an Instax. That may leave Fuji fans who sit in between those two extremes feeling a little unloved, but aFujifilm X-E5is still rumored to be en route in 2025. For now, it seems Fujifilm is doing what originally brought it such big success in the early days of mirrorless cameras – hopping on new photographic trends with its own unique twist.

    "title": "Samsung's new Bespoke Jet AI Lite might be the perfect upgrade to my classic Bespoke Jet vacuum, if the price is right",
    "article_text": "It all depends on price and performance When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Yes,Samsungonly launched its flagshipBespoke Jet AI Ultravacuum with excellent suction just a few weeks back in late March 2025. And now, hot off the heels of that model, Samsung’s just unveiled the Bespoke Jet AI Lite, scheduled to launch this month. As the name suggests, it should be more affordable and an entry-level option compared to the AI Ultra. Samsung’s also built it to be considerably lighter. In handheld mode, it weighs 1.45kg, which is 23% lighter than the previous-gen Bespoke Jet AI, and considerably lighter than the new AI Ultra model as well. In theshared release, Samsung pitches it as a convertible model that's great for use as a standard stick vacuum but also perfect for reaching tougher spots, both high and low, in handheld mode. It is still set to be pretty feature-filled, though, with the ‘all-in-one clean station', which will act as a home for the Bespoke Jet, included in the box. The vacuum cleaner will set on top and recharge, so it’s always ready for a run, and it will self-empty into a bag hidden in the base. This way, you won’t need to manually empty the onboard dust bin. With AI in the name, Samsung is also including some – but not all – of its AI tech into what we assume will be a cheaper stick vacuum cleaner with a docking station. The Bespoke Jet AI Lite leads with AI Cleaning Mode 2.0, which lets the floorhead sense the surface it’s on to adjust the suction power and roller speed. For instance, for an easy-to-clean hard floor, the vacuum will lower the suction to stretch the battery life. We’ll be interested in testing the AI features here on the Lite model, but inour review of the Bespoke Jet AI Ultra, we found them a little unreliable even if the vacuum overall delivered excellent cleaning performance. That vacuum offers 400W of suction power, while the Bespoke Jet AI Lite tops out at 280W from a proprietary HexaJet motor. Yes, there is a significant cutback in overall power, but it's still extremely sucky – matching the suction offered by theGen5detectcurrently sitting at the top ofDyson's range. The lower spec should also equate to a more affordable price than the eye-watering $1,099.99 / £1,199.99 / AU$1,699 tag on the AI Ultra. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. On paper, the Bespoke Jet AI Lite seems to be trickling down some of the main-stay features, and as someone with a classic Bespoke Jet, this one is piquing my interest if the price turns out to be right … and if it launches in the United States. I already like the design, easy control, and the original's auto-emptying, recharging docking station, so this upgrade to a better motor and some fancier features could be worth it. Samsung only says that the Bespoke Jet AI Lite will launch in April 2025 but stops short of confirming pricing and the countries where it will be available. We’ve reached out to Samsung for more information on pricing and availability by region. For now, we know that it's not planned to launch in the UK until around June.

    "title": "Garmin has just crossed a powerful bike light with a 4K dash cam – and as a cyclist, I’m all in",
    "article_text": "The downside? The Varia Vue comes with a hefty price tag When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Garminhas just revealed a powerful new gadget for cyclists who want to invest in their road safety – a cross between a powerful 600-lumen front light and a4Ksafety camera, which means it can double as a cycling dash cam. The new Varia Vue is effectively the flip-side of Garmin's rear tail light and radar (called theVaria RCT715), which it can also sync with. This model is much more powerful, though, being much brighter thanks to its 600-lumen output. It also packs a 4K front-facing camera (rather than 1080p), which can automatically save videos if it detects an incident – just like thebest dash cams. It's one of those products that it feels like Garmin should have made years ago. Whether you cycle in busy, well-lit urban areas or on country roads – or, like me, a bit of both – a powerful front light and a camera are essential cycling accessories, so it's good to see them combined one nicely designed, albeit expensive bundle. Garmin says the built-in camera has electronic image stabilization to help you make out license plates even on pot-holed roads, although this does come at the expense of a crop. We'll have to see how well that stabilization compares to thebest action cameraslike theGoPro Hero 13 Black. While Garmin has experience with action cams with its now-discontinuedVirb series, I'm not expecting the Varie Vue to match GoPro andDJIfor image quality. Even so, it needs to reach a certain level to make it a viable cycling dash cam, as capturing small details can be important. To help capture those incidents in full, it also has a concealed microphone for audio. The only potential downside of combining these two gadgets is battery life, but Garmin's claimed specs suggest it's workable. It says the Varia Vue will last \"up to seven hours\" in day flash mode with the camera recording (although this drops to just over an hour on full brightness) and or \"up to nine hours\" when the headlight is turned off, and you shoot in 1080p. If you're planning a long ride, the camera can also be used while charging. Your video clips are stored on a microSD card (which isn't included), and you can also save footage automatically to the cloud via Wi-Fi using Garmin Vault. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The downside? There's inevitably a subscription for using Vault, and it's a pretty pricey at $99 / £99 a year. Still, the overall concept is a good one, and as a London-based cyclist, I like the idea of neatly combining a light and cycling dash cam in one relatively small unit. The Varia Vue is available to buy now for $549 / £459 (around AU$965). In many ways, bike tech still feels a little behind the times, which is why I still combine a fairly dated Lezyne front light (which still has a micro USB charging port) with an old GoPro if I'm heading out on a long-ish ride on the roads. But it seems there's finally a little more competition in the smart bike light space, with Garmin's Varia Vue arriving to take on the more established Cycliq Fly12 Sport (which combines a 4K camera with a 400-lumen light for a more affordable $319 / £299 / AU$449). Wahoo also recently announced the new Trackr Radar, a rear taillight with radar tech like Garmin's Varia RCT715. None of these are exactly cheap, and there is an argument that you're better off going with two separate devices if you don't need a camera for every ride. While nice in theory, Varia Vue's cloud storage component could also prove to be an excessively expensive extra if you don't often use it. Still, it's good to see some long-awaited innovation in bike safety tech, and the increased competition should hopefully mean some more affordable options follow in Varia Vue's slipstream – depending on tariffs, of course.

Sarah Wynn-Williams, former Director of Public Policy at Facebook, spoke in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism.

    "title": "MSI has apparently leaked new its Nvidia RTX 5060 Ti third-party GPUs, and I’m worried these budget GPUs will come with a ‘new motherboard’ tax",
    "article_text": "Probably can't call these budget GPUs if you're one who needs a motherboard upgrade When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nvidiahas yet to complete the full launch of its RTX 5000 series GPU lineup, as it still has some low-end cards in the pipeline. Fortunately, a new leak has given us a first look at third-party models of an unannounced Blackwell GPU. Spoiler alert: you might want to upgrade your motherboard. Thanks toVideoCardz,MSI's GeForce RTX 5060 Ti graphics cards have leaked with new images showcasing four different models, and each of them uses either 16-pin or 8-pin connectors. More importantly,allof these GPUs will use PCIe 5.0, as the leaked images (which I won't post here) indicate. While higher-end RTX 5000 series GPUs can provide great performance results for users on non-PCIe 5.0 motherboards, it might not be the same story for lower-end cards like the upcoming RTX 5060 Ti. Since low-end GPUs don't have the same processing power as what you'd get with anRTX 5080, for example, aspects like VRAM capacity and PCIe bandwidth speeds have a bigger impact on performance. If the RTX 5060 Ti is indeed PCIe 5.0 x8, it's more than likely going to hinder performance for gamers still using PCIe 4.0 (or older) motherboards, as the GPU won't be used to its full potential when it may desperately need it - especially for the rumored 8GB VRAM models. In this case, you have to wonder whether buying a new budget GPU and possibly having to upgrade to a PCIe 5.0 motherboard (if you don't already have one) is worth the cost: instead, it may be a better choice to purchase an older high-end GPU - if one can be found at launch price, anyway. Let me get one thing straight: this isn't me having a go at Nvidia or any other GPU manufacturer making the jump to the PCIe 5.0 interface. It's rather an observation of howbad the GPU market is in terms of consumers finding GPUsat their launch prices, and the high likelihood of having to mandatorily upgrade your motherboard or other components to get the best out of your new graphics card. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. For those using PCIe 4.0 motherboards, the RTX 3000 and 4000 series GPUs are ideal, as they are all PCIe 4.0 cards. While the new PCIe 5.0 cards can still be used on other motherboards, you willdefinitelyfeel the performance loss, particularly with weaker hardware as its capabilities would be cut in half by bandwidth limitations. It's also easy for me to suggest buying an older high-end GPU, but you'd either struggle to find it in stock anywhere due to discontinuations, or end up overpaying (just look atXFX's Radeon RX 7900 XTX for example). So it begs the question: is 'budget' PC gaming becoming non-existent? Inflation, scalpers, low availability, and tariffs are all active, making what is supposed to be budget hardware more expensive. When you tie that in with an entire PC build, it's no longer 'budget'. Aside from handheld gaming PCs or laptops, PC gaming is currently an expensive hobby, and I'm hoping things can change sooner for the better...

    "title": "WhatsApp has just dropped these 9 new features – including 2 that I'm not happy about",
    "article_text": "One involves Meta AI When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The aftermath ofApple’slatestiOS 18.4 updateis still lingering, and we’re all coming to grips with its roster of new features. With that said,WhatsApphas also just dropped its own big update, announcing brand new additions to its existing call, chats, and channels sections. Now I say ‘big update’, but that’s a bit of an understatement asWhatsApp’s list of new upgrades is extensive, and includes minor new features such as smoother video call quality, and voice message transcripts on Channels. However there are nine stand-out features we think are interesting additions to the messaging platform, but two of them have rubbed us the wrong way. First of all, despite how small-scale some of the new features are, there’s a handful that could make a significant impact on your WhatsApp experience, starting with its simple pinch-to-zoom feature in video calls. It’s taken WhatsApp a considerable amount of time to catch up to the likes of FaceTime where users have been able to zoom for a while, but regardless of the delay on WhatsApp’s part, this is a benefit I know frequent video call users like myself will reap. In addition to this new call feature, WhatsApp now allows you to add someone to an ongoing 1:1 call right from a chat thread. Calls aside, WhatsApp has brought even more functions to its chat section. If you’re an iPhone user that gravitates towards WhatsApp as opposed to using its flagship iMessage service, there’s now a way for you to set WhatsApp as your default, provided you’ve installed the latest version of iOS. All you have to do is go to your iPhone Settings, select Default Apps, and choose WhatsApp. It doesn’t stop there. WhatsApp is doubling down on its integration with your daily and personal life, introducing new events updates in 1:1 chats as well as groups, as well as a new feature that allows you to scan and send documents directly from WhatsApp on iPhone. The last two helpful features that could benefit WhatsApp users include video notes (like voice notes) for channels, allowing admins to instantly record and share videos up to 60 seconds. Finally, you can highlight notifications in groups, giving you an easier way to prioritize your group chat notifications. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Overall, the new additions to WhatsApp pack a lot of value, even though some may have a slightly less impact than others. But of course, there are two other functions that WhatsApp has added that haven’t quite sat well with users – one which made quite a bad impression this week. If you’ve been out of the loop, WhatsApp introduced anew Meta AI buttonin EU regions that you can’t remove from the app’s UI – leading to an uproar of angry WhatsApp users. Essentially an AIchatbotfeature, Meta’s new button in WhatsApp is a place for users to go to for a number of functions like answering questions or generating content. But the function itself isn’t necessarily what users are mad about, and it’s more to do with the fact they’ve not been given the option to remove it. Quietly introduced in WhatsApp’s recent wave of new functions, there’s now a way of seeing who in your group chats are online, thanks to a new function that shows you the real-time status of each member in a group chat. This is obviously less of a headache compared to the untouchable Meta button, but it means that there's a lot more pressure to be swift in your replies. Don't get me wrong, I'm a punctual text-replier, but we all have those days where we just don't have the energy to deal with our group chats – especially when plan-making goes horribly wrong, or you just don't want to reply to particular person. This new feature makes it easier for your friends and family to call you out, and WhatsApp knows exactly what it's doing. Rowan is an Editorial Associate and Apprentice Writer for TechRadar.

    "title": "OnePlus Watch 3 gets surprise price hike in the US – and you can already guess why",
    "article_text": "It now costs $170 more than expected When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While the US government’s stance on import tariffs has softened for many regions (at least at the time of writing) it’s still fullsteamahead with major import duty being imposed on China-made goods. Which is perhaps why thenew OnePlus Watch 3 costs $499.99– $170 more than the $329.99 price tag that had previously been revealed for the smart watch. OnePlus has yet to confirm if the price hike is tariff-related, but we do know that goods coming from China to the US are currently facing a 145% tariff. That amount has only been increasing, as China and the US seem locked into a trade war neither wants to back down from. We know it’s made in China after anow-infamous typo on its back, which declared the smart watch is “Meda in China.” This actually caused the watch’s full release to be delayed until now – perhaps inadvertently leading to this price hike as in that time major new tariffs were introduced. What’s more, while the device has had a price hike in the US, in other countries that’s not the case. For example in theUK storeit still costs just £319.99, suggesting that this cost increase is indeed a US tariff issue. Unless the US Government’s stance on tariffs changes sometime soon, you can expect prices to go up for your other favorite gadgets. While smaller import duties could maybe have been eaten up by brands looking to stay competitive in the US market, 154% hikes are impossible to ignore and they will be passed to consumers. You simply can’t keep prices the same if products that previously cost, say, $100 to manufacture in China now at a minimum have to be sold in the US for $254 – and that's before you account for any kind of profit margin. It’ll be especially frustrating for people looking to pick up more budget-friendly tech like the OnePlus Watch 3. You'll feel the squeeze of tech costing a few hundred bucks extra more than folks who were already happy to splash a lot of cash on high-end gadgets. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I wish we could offer some sound advice on what you should do to try and fend off price hikes, but apart from rushing to buy before you start to feel their sting, or hoping they go away again, there’s not a lot you can do. And it doesn’t help that the US government’s stance on tariffs seems to change every day – making predictions of what’ll happen next near-impossible. Our best advice is for you to be prepared to make your existing tech last longer – or to buy secondhand or refurbished tech that won’t be subject to import duty because it’s already in the US. Because for the foreseeable future new tech is going to feel even more like a luxury than it did before.

    "title": "Mastering SaaS contract management: Five key strategies for IT leaders",
    "article_text": "Strategies for efficient SaaS contract management to reduce risks and cost When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In today’s fast-pacedbusinessworld, organizations rely heavily onSaaS(Software as a Service) applications to drive efficiency, reduce costs and foster innovation. However, with this growing dependence on software comes the complex task of effectively managing SaaS contracts. Without robust contract management practices, organizations risk inefficiencies, hidden costs, non-compliance and missed opportunities to optimize their software spend. For IT leaders, mastering SaaS contract management is a strategic necessity. Giulio D’Ali, Senior Vice President of SaaS Management from Technology and SaaS management solutions provider Calero shares five strategies to streamline SaaS contract management, reduce risks and enhance financial control. Senior Vice President of SaaS Management at Calero. One of the key challenges in SaaS management is the decentralization of contracts across various departments. Without a single view of all contracts, it becomes increasingly difficult to track renewal dates, service level agreements (SLAs) and vendor performance. This lack of oversight can lead to costly mistakes, such as missing renewal deadlines or overpaying for unused licenses. Centralizing SaaS contract management through a dedicated platform helps organizations consolidate all contractdatainto one system. This centralized system provides comprehensive visibility into contract terms, pricing, renewal dates and vendor performance. For IT leaders, having this centralized view is crucial for aligning software expenditures with business goals. By understanding how each contract supports or hinders organizational objectives, you can make more informed decisions, mitigate compliance risks and negotiate better terms with vendors. Managing renewals is one of the most time-consuming and error-prone aspects of SaaS contractmanagement. Without automation, it’s easy for IT teams to miss renewal deadlines or to renew contracts without fully assessing the vendor’s performance. These oversights can lead to unexpected costs, service interruptions, or worse - being locked into unfavorable terms without the chance to renegotiate. Automating the renewal process is one of the most effective ways to streamline SaaS contract management. By setting up automated reminders and alerts for upcoming renewals, organizations can ensure that they never miss a critical deadline. In addition to avoiding auto-renewals at high rates, automated renewals provide an opportunity for IT teams to assess the software’s value. This proactive approach allows businesses to negotiate better terms, eliminate underutilized licenses and reallocate resources to more strategic areas, ultimately maximizing ROI from SaaS investments. While SaaS management typically falls under the IT department, its impact stretches far beyond IT, touching procurement, finance and other areas of the business. The key to efficient SaaS contract management lies in ensuring that all departments are aligned and working off the same set of data. Integrating SaaS management with procurement workflows allows organizations to align software purchasing with broaderfinancialand operational strategies. This integration makes it easier for procurement teams to compare vendor offerings, track spending and ensure that purchasing decisions adhere to corporate policies. By automating and streamlining the contract management process, procurement and IT teams can work collaboratively to negotiate better deals, identify cost-saving opportunities and prevent unnecessary spending on duplicate or unused software subscriptions. For IT leaders, thiscollaborationwith procurement not only improves financial oversight but also reduces the risk of SaaS sprawl - where software subscriptions proliferate without oversight - leading to wasted resources and unnecessary complexity. As SaaS applications continue to play a critical role in business operations, compliance with industry regulations and internal policies is non-negotiable. Whether it’s adhering to data privacy laws like GDPR or ensuring that SaaS vendors meet specific security standards, managing compliance manually is no longer feasible. SaaS management platforms equipped with compliance tracking capabilities allow IT leaders to monitor vendor performance against establishedsecurityprotocols and compliance frameworks. With real-time alerts and automated audits, organizations can proactively manage risks and ensure that vendors are meeting their contractual obligations. By integrating compliance monitoring directly into the contract management process, businesses can reduce the likelihood of regulatory violations, data breaches, or costly fines. Furthermore, SaaS management platforms can help IT teams keep track of data protection and security certifications, providing peace of mind that all vendors are compliant with the necessary standards and minimizing potential risks to the business. Managing SaaS contracts isn’t just about monitoring performance and compliance, it’s also about gaining financial control. With so many subscription-based services, it’s easy for costs to spiral out of control, especially if there’s a lack of visibility into overall usage and spending. Streamlining SaaS contract management provides organizations with granular financial insights, enabling IT teams and CFOs to better forecast costs, optimize spending and eliminate waste. By consolidating all contract data, including license usage, spend history and renewal terms, businesses can gain a clearer picture of their software investments. This visibility allows for more accurate financial planning and better control over SaaS-related expenses. Additionally, with better insights into software usage, organizations can prevent SaaS sprawl by identifying and eliminating underused or redundant subscriptions. This level of financial oversight helps organizations avoid unnecessary costs and keep SaaS expenses aligned with actual demand, improving overall budget predictability. In an age of digital evolution, SaaS contract management is no longer a back-office task. For CIOs, CTOs, SAMs and other IT leaders, it’s a strategic lever for optimizing software investments, ensuring compliance and driving cost efficiency. By centralizing contract data, automating renewals, fostering collaboration between IT and procurement and utilizing compliance and financial insights, organizations can unlock the full value of their SaaSapplicationswhile avoiding the risks associated with poor contract management. By adopting these five best practices, businesses can streamline their SaaS contract management process and stay agile, competitive and financially efficient in an increasingly complex digital landscape.

    "title": "Trump’s Kiev envoy clarifies proposal to ‘divide Ukraine like postwar Berlin’",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, has rejected the notion that he proposed partitioning Ukraine like post-WWII Germany, accusing The Times of misrepresenting his remarks about a Cold War-style post-ceasefire security arrangement. Kellogg told The Times in aninterviewpublished on Friday that British and French – but not American – troops could lead a Western military force positioned west of the Dnepr River, while Ukrainian forces would hold territory further east. He also suggested establishing a demilitarized zone (DMZ) roughly 18 miles (30 kilometers) wide along the current lines of control to prevent direct clashes with Russian forces. “You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two, when you had a Russian zone, a French zone, and a British zone, a US zone,”said Kellogg, a retired US Army lieutenant general, appointed by Trump to deal directly with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. Kellogg acknowledged that Moscow“might not accept”the proposed zones of control, and claimed that a DMZ would create conditions for a“sustainable”ceasefire and would“not be provocative at all”to Moscow. The British newspaper ran its story with the headline“Trump envoy: We can divide Ukraine like postwar Berlin,”prompting Kellogg to accuse the publication of taking his words out of context. “The Times article misrepresents what I said,”Kellogg wrote on X on Friday evening.“I was speaking of a post-ceasefire resiliency force in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty. In discussions of partitioning, I was referencing areas or zones of responsibility for an allied force (without US troops). I was NOT referring to a partitioning of Ukraine.” The Times report, however, noted that Kellogg’s idea implies that any final settlement would involve Kiev relinquishing claims to territories already controlled by Russia – a point that echoes proposals recently floated by Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff. Witkoff, who met Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg on Friday, had previously argued that recognizing Russian ownership of Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye, and Kherson was the swiftest path to halting the conflict. The suggestion, reportedly voiced during a White House meeting last week, has triggered internal debate within the Trump administration, with Kellogg allegedly pushing back against full territorial concessions. Kiev’s backers remain split on a proposed“reassurance force”that could potentially be deployed to Ukraine after hostilities between Kiev and Moscow end. Following the latest meeting of the“coalition of the willing”– composed of some 30 predominantly EU and NATO member states – in Brussels on Thursday, only six Western nations expressed readiness to send troops, according to AFP. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against deploying troops to Ukraine under any pretext, specifically objecting to forces from any NATO countries ending up in the country. Last month, former Russian president and deputy chair of Russia’s Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, said that the potential emergence of any NATO“peacekeepers”in Ukraine would mean a war between the bloc and Russia.",

    "title": "Putin’s latest talks with Trump’s envoy: What we know so far",
    "article_text": "White House special envoy Steve Witkoff has departed Russia in the same secrecy he arrived on Friday, after spending more than four hours talking with President Vladimir Putin behind closed doors in St. Petersburg. The marathon talks – the third known meeting between the two – were held in Putin's hometown, with both Moscow and Washington offering few details about the substance of the discussions. Here’s what we know so far. Surprise visit to St. Petersburg Witkoff’s latest trip to Russia came without prior public announcement. Air traffic monitors tracked a plane linked to the US envoy flying from Florida to St. Petersburg overnight. He was later spotted alongside Russian presidential aide Kirill Dmitriev, walking out of a hotel in the city center before the talks. Previous meetings between Witkoff and Putin had taken place in Moscow. Kremlin sheds some light The Kremlin confirmed that the four-hour discussion focused on“aspects of the settlement of the Ukraine conflict,”but declined to provide further details. Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov previously said topics could also include normalization of US-Russia relations, a possible in-person meeting between Trump and Putin, and concerns Moscow wanted to convey directly to a trusted Trump representative. White House explains visit White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff’s trip was part of Trump’s broader effort to negotiate a ceasefire and an eventual peace deal in Ukraine.“This is another step in the negotiating process,”Leavitt said, while declining to provide specifics. Putin envoy’s visit to Washington Witkoff’s visit came just days after Russian presidential aide Kirill Dmitriev traveled to Washington for talks with senior Trump officials. Dmitriev, who advises Putin on international economic cooperation, described Friday’s discussions with Witkoff as“productive”in a post on X, welcoming the US envoy to St. Petersburg. Current state of Russia-US talks on Ukraine During a White House meeting with President Donald Trump last week, Witkoff argued that recognizing Russian ownership of Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye, and Kherson was the swiftest path to halting the conflict, according to media reports. General Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, reportedly pushed back, stressing that Ukraine would not accept full territorial concessions. Witkoff defended his approach in a recent interview with Tucker Carlson, citing referendums held in the regions. The White House meeting reportedly concluded without a decision from Trump, who has repeatedly said he aims to broker a ceasefire as soon as possible. What’s next? Peskov said another phone call between Putin and Trump is“theoretically possible”following Witkoff’s visit, depending on the outcome of negotiations. The two leaders last spoke on March 18, and have both publicly expressed readiness to eventually meet in person when the time is right.",

    "title": "Kremlin reveals content of Putin’s talks with Trump envoy",
    "article_text": "The discussions between Russian President Vladimir Putin and White House special envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday involved“aspects of the settlement of the Ukraine conflict,”the Kremlin has announced, declining to provide further details. Witkoff visited Russia on Friday and met with Putin in St. Petersburg. The meeting lasted over four hours and the content of the talks has been largely kept under wraps by Moscow and Washington. However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addressed the issue during a press briefing earlier in the day when asked by a reporter about the purpose of Witkoff’s visit to Russia. According to Leavitt, the visit was aimed at facilitating direct US communications with the Kremlin as part of a broader effort to negotiate a ceasefire and eventual peace agreement in the Ukraine conflict. The Trump administration faced growing internal divisions this week after Witkoff allegedly proposed a ceasefire plan that would recognize Russian control over four eastern regions claimed by both Moscow and Kiev, Reuters reported on Friday citing anonymous sources. During a White House meeting with President Donald Trump last week, Witkoff argued that recognizing Russian ownership of Lugansk, Donetsk, Zaporozhye, and Kherson was the swiftest path to halting the war, the outlet’s sources said. General Keith Kellogg, Trump’s Ukraine envoy, reportedly pushed back, stressing Ukraine would not accept full territorial concessions. The meeting reportedly concluded without a decision from Trump, who has repeatedly said he wants to broker a ceasefire by May. Witkoff subsequently traveled to Russia on Friday for talks with Putin. The episode has deepened rifts within the Trump administration, as officials debate how to resolve the Ukraine conflict, Reuters wrote. Witkoff’s approach, previously outlined in a March interview with Tucker Carlson, has reportedly alarmed both Republican lawmakers and US allies. “They’re Russian-speaking,”Witkoff told Carlson of the eastern territories.“There have been referendums where the overwhelming majority of the people have indicated that they want to be under Russian rule.” Several Republicans reportedly contacted National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio to raise concerns about Witkoff’s stance, criticizing him for echoing Russian rhetoric. A recent dinner with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who until recently was under US sanctions, further stirred controversy. Originally planned at Witkoff’s home, it was moved to the White House after security concerns were raised. Despite criticism, Witkoff retains strong backing from Trump and some administration officials. Waltz praised his efforts, citing his business background and recent diplomatic activity, including securing the release of US citizen Marc Fogel from Russia.",

    "article_text": "The US State Department has confirmed that Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink will be leaving her post in the near future. Media reports began circulating several days ago that the diplomat would resign soon. When asked to comment during a press briefing on Thursday, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said that“Ambassador Brink’s been ambassador at the embassy in Ukraine for three years, during a time of war for those three years, an extraordinary performance there, and we wish her well.” When further pressed by a reporter to provide an unequivocal confirmation, Bruce replied that the envoy was“returning home. Yes.” Reuters, citing anonymous sources, has reported that Brink is leaving of her own accord. Appointed by former President Joe Biden, she has served as ambassador in Kiev since May 2022. While there has been no official information as to her potential replacement, the outlet quoted another unnamed source as saying that Chris Smith, the deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe and policy and regional affairs in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, is among the candidates under consideration. Smith served as deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in the Ukrainian capital between 2022 and 2023, Reuters noted. Brink’s resignation comes at a time when US President Donald Trump is engaged in active diplomacy with Russia in an effort to put an end to the Ukraine conflict.",

    "title": "Why Trump quickly rolled back the global trade war",
    "article_text": "“Now I’ve seen it all.” I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said that to myself over the past few months. Every time Donald Trump sets fire to another piece of the global order, I find myself staring at the same spot, wondering how we got here – and what I’ve missed in the script of modern politics. During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to“teach a lesson”to all of America’s trading partners. True to form, he didn’t waste time testing that theory. In February, he launched a trial balloon by slapping tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico. The pretext? They weren’t doing enough to curb migration and drug trafficking. Ottawa and Mexico City quickly came to the table, validating Trump’s belief that the tariff stick could beat other nations into talks. That success emboldened him to try the same strategy globally. So he did. And what followed was, frankly, more entertaining than many had expected. Markets crashed. Oil prices plunged. Economists predicted a recession. Americans started stockpiling food and supplies. The media raced to outdo one another with the most ridiculous nicknames for the unfolding chaos. Meanwhile, the White House calmly insisted everything was“going to plan.” And what exactly was the plan? Trump himself made it quite clear: to make the world“kiss his ass.” This, in essence, is the classic Trump playbook – what some call his“psychopath strategy.”He creates a crisis, then offers to dial it back as a“goodwill gesture,”demanding concessions in return. In this case, those concessions were to include correcting America’s trade deficits and forcing production to return home. But this time, Trump may have overplayed his hand. Starting a trade war with the entire world simultaneously didn’t just rattle governments – it shook Americans at home. As the reality of a potential recession hit, Trump’s approval ratings plummeted. Many in the public began to view the president and his team as, to put it mildly, lacking in competence. The widespread backlash gave Democrats a rare opportunity to go on the offensive. Anti-tariff rallies sprang up across the country, organized by liberal groups and activists. Trump faced public rebukes from Barack Obama and Kamala Harris. Congressman Al Green even announced plans to introduce articles of impeachment – for a third time. And it wasn’t just the left sounding the alarm. Republican Senator Ted Cruz, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, warned of a potential“bloodbath”for the GOP in the 2026 midterms if the tariffs triggered a full-scale recession. Billionaires on Wall Street – many of whom had backed Trump – voiced their displeasure. Most notably, Elon Musk, a longtime Trump ally, publicly criticized the president’s trade adviser Peter Navarro, calling him“an idiot”and“dumber than a bag of potatoes.” Faced with political, financial, and public pressure, the Trump administration acted quickly. On April 9, Trump announced that 75 countries had contacted him requesting deals. In response, he reduced tariffs to 10% for a 90-day window, framing it as an opportunity for negotiation. But not everyone is budging. China, in particular, has proven to be a far more resilient adversary. The US–China trade war continues to escalate, with tit-for-tat tariffs now reaching 140% – and climbing. If it goes on unchecked, trade between the world’s two largest economies could shrink by 80%, with catastrophic consequences for both sides. So what’s next? Two scenarios seem likely. Either Trump pressures his trading partners into quick concessions and declares victory, or he walks away halfway through and finds a new distraction – much like he did with Ukraine. Remember the fanfare when Trump promised to deliver peace in Ukraine“within 24 hours”? Or even“within 100 days”? The moment it became clear that wasn’t going to happen, the White House stopped talking about it altogether. That’s Trump’s style. Create a spectacle, dominate the headlines, then quietly move on once it stops working. And let’s not forget – he still has a few cards left to play. Gaza, for instance, which he once dubbed the“Riviera of the Middle East.”Or the Iranian nuclear issue, another favorite of his unrealized“brilliant ideas.” So no – I won’t say I’ve seen everything. If anything, recent events have taught me that with Trump, there’s always more madness just around the corner. And the scariest part? Sometimes it works.

    "title": "NATO needs Romania to launch WWIII – Georgescu",
    "article_text": "Calin Georgescu, a former Romanian presidential candidate whose bid was controversially invalidated earlier this year, has claimed that NATO wants to“launch World War III from Romania.”In an interview with US journalist Tucker Carlson, he said his staunch pro-peace stance was among the main reasons why he was barred from running for president. The right-wing politician, known as an outspoken critic of NATO, the EU, and Western support for Ukraine, scored a surprise win in the first round of November’s presidential election, receiving 23% of the vote. However, the country’s Constitutional Court swiftly moved in to annul the result over alleged“irregularities”in his campaign. Later, Georgescu was stripped of his right to run for office. Appearing on Carlson’s podcast on Thursday, the former Romanian presidential candidate alleged that NATO wants to“launch… World War III from Romania.”The politician cited the fact that the“largest military base of NATO is in Romania,”coupled with the 380-mile (612 km) long border that his country shares with Ukraine. “In this situation of course Romania is the asset for[the]European Union, for[French President Emmanuel]Macron in order to launch the war,”Georgescu insisted. Călin Georgescu is the most popular political figure in Romania and one of the bravest and wisest politicians in the world. This fall he ran for president on a platform against “war, technocracy and debt” and would have won, until the Biden administration pushed to cancel the…pic.twitter.com/iRWkrrZEsq “They want to turn NATO[into]an offensive force”and are“pushing for war,”he alleged, adding that“my position was exactly against them.” According to Georgescu,“all my campaign was just concentrate[d]on peace[.]When I said… the word ‘peace’, they immediately alerted… because they need war.” The right-wing politician went on to say that the“majority of Romanian people… have this position against any intervention and any participation[in]war.” “I was denied[the right to run for president]by the globalist mafia,”the former candidate alleged, further claiming that the people behind the invalidation of his candidacy were the same people who attempted to derail Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in the US, using similar smear tactics. Appearing on ‘The Shawn Ryan Show’ in January, Georgescu similarly suggested that NATO military infrastructure in Romania could be used to launch a major offensive against Russia. Bucharest, a NATO member since 2004, has been expanding the MK Air Base to make it the largest NATO installation in Europe. Moscow has described the base as“anti-Russian”and warned that it would be among the first targets for retaliatory strikes in a military conflict.",

Witkoff, a confidant of US President Donald Trump, has been tapped as his special envoy in the effort to mend ties with Russia. Today’s meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg is Witkoff’s third since February, when he successfully negotiated a prisoner exchange which Washington and Moscow described as a trust-building gesture. He was also part of a high-level US delegation that met Russian officials in Saudi Arabia last month for discussions on the Ukraine conflict. ”I can confirm that Mr. Witkoff is in Russia to have direct communications with the Kremlin and with Vladimir Putin,”Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing. ”This is another step in the negotiating process towards a ceasefire and an ultimate peace deal in Russia and Ukraine,”she said, declining to provide further details.“As these negotiations are ongoing, I obviously will not get ahead of the president or his team. But I think the president has been quite clear that he’s been continually frustrated with both sides of this conflict, and he wants to see this fighting end.” Speaking with journalists before Friday’s meeting, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the duration of the talks would be flexible and could take“an hour, or two, three or four; as long as President Putin requires.” Last week, Witkoff met with Russian presidential aide Kirill Dmitriev in Washington. The head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund advises Putin on international economic cooperation and was spotted in the morning walking out of a hotel in St. Petersburg alongside Trump’s envoy. Peskov warned against expecting significant progress from the meeting but mentioned topics that could be discussed, such as the normalization of bilateral relations, a potential in-person meeting between the two presidents, and the conflict in Ukraine.",

    "title": "Trump plans charm offensive to win over Greenland – NYT",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s administration is planning a public relations campaign and financial incentives to persuade Greenlanders to join the United States, the New York Times has reported. Trump has repeatedly stated that Washington needed to take control of the autonomous Danish territory in order to enhance America’s“national security,”claiming recently he will“100% get”the Arctic island. The president has even alluded to using military force if necessary. The new approach focuses on persuasion over coercion, featuring advertising and social media campaigns to influence public opinion among Greenland’s approximately 57,000 residents, the NYT reported on Thursday, citing unnamed US officials. The plan includes mobilizing several cabinet departments to implement Trump’s long-standing goal of acquiring the Mexico-sized territory. The Trump administration is also studying financial incentives for Greenlanders, including replacing the $600 million in subsidies that Denmark gives the island with annual payments of about $10,000 per person, the sources said. Some Trump officials reportedly claim the costs could be offset by revenue from Greenland’s natural resources, including rare earths, copper, gold, uranium and oil. In order to bolster the campaign, the White House is highlighting Greenlanders’ shared ancestry with Alaska and Arctic Canada as well as other historical ties, including the US military’s presence on the island during World War II, the report said. Greenland was under Danish rule from the early 19th century until the 1950s, but during World War II it was briefly occupied by US forces after Nazi Germany seized Denmark. The island now hosts a US military base and an early warning system for ballistic missiles. In recent decades, the island has gained greater autonomy, receiving home rule in 1979 and the right to declare independence after a 2009 referendum. Trump first floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in 2019 and has revived the proposal since returning to office. His administration describes the island as a strategic asset, citing its location and untapped natural resources. Trump’s plans and a recent visit by a high-profile US delegation, including US Vice President J.D. Vance and White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, have drawn vocal criticism from Greenlandic and Danish officials, who have rejected any suggestion of a sale. Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen has condemned Trump’s recent remarks as escalatory and disrespectful, saying the rhetoric had become increasingly aggressive and amounted to a“hidden threat”against Denmark and its semi-autonomous territory. Greenland’s newly elected Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen has urged the islanders to unite and make clear that“we do not belong to anyone else”and will never come under Washington’s control.",

    "title": "Prince Harry makes surprise trip to Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Prince Harry has made a secret trip to the city of Lviv in western Ukraine, which was only announced to the public after he had left the country. Also known as the Duke of Sussex, Harry is the second member of the British royal family to visit Ukraine since the escalation between Moscow and Kiev in February 2022. Last year, Sophie, Duchess of Edinburgh, traveled to the country. The prince came to Lviv on Thursday as the founder of the Invictus Games Foundation, which has staged sporting events for wounded war veterans since 2014. During the trip, he toured a rehabilitation facility for wounded Ukrainian troops, called the Superhumans Center. He also talked to patients and doctors, and observed an operation to restore hearing to one of the injured servicemen. “This is my first visit to Ukraine and it certainly will not be the last,”Harry said in a clip shared by the Superhumans Center on its Facebook page on Friday. The Invictus Games Foundation will support the Ukrainian team“as long as needed,”he added. Invictus Games Foundation CEO Rob Owen said in a statement on Thursday that Ukraine has been“a vital part”of the foundation since first competing in the Invictus Games in Toronto in 2017. Harry’s trip to Lviv“underscores the Invictus Games Foundation’s broader commitment to supporting recovery and rehabilitation for wounded, injured, and sick service personnel and veterans, even in the most challenging environments,”Owen said. The Duke of Sussex lives in California, and flew to Ukraine from London where he attended a two-day hearing in an effort to restore state-funded security for him and his family, which was revoked after Harry and his wife Meghan Markle announced that they were stepping back from royal duties in 2020. The prince claimed in court that he needed protection while staying in the UK because his“life was at risk.” In 2023, Harry and Meghan were filmed at one of the Invictus Games events together with Yulia ‘Taira’ Paevskaya, a former Ukrainian Azov neo-Nazi volunteer battalion member. Moscow described Paevskaya as“a terrorist cutthroat whose hands are covered in the blood of the elderly, women, and children,”accusing her of taking part in atrocities carried out by Azov in the Donbass. The Ukrainian authorities sent troops into the region in 2014, which refused to recognize the results of a West-backed coup in Kiev.",

    "title": "Iran could offer ‘interim’ nuclear deal – Axios",
    "article_text": "Iran could pursue an interim nuclear deal with the US as a stopgap solution until the two countries thrash out a broader agreement, Axios has reported, citing an anonymous European diplomat and another unnamed source. Washington and Tehran are set to hold negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program in Oman on Saturday. US President Donald Trump has claimed the talks will be direct while the Islamic Republic maintains that they will be conducted through an intermediary. White House envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to lead the US delegation, with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi heading the group of Iranian representatives. In an article on Thursday, Axios quoted its sources as saying that Tehran has deemed it unrealistic to work out a comprehensive accord within the two-month timeframe set earlier by the White House. The media outlet speculated that an interim agreement could see Iran suspending some of its uranium enrichment activities as well as diluting its 60% enriched uranium stockpile and providing UN inspectors with better access to the country’s nuclear facilities. Tehran, in turn, could demand that Washington suspend its“maximum pressure”sanctions campaign against the Islamic Republic. On Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian made it clear that his country is“ready for engagement … but this engagement must be indirect, dignified, and accompanied by clear guarantees, because we still do not trust the other side.” The official also rejected Western claims that Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear weapons program. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Wednesday, Trump said that he viewed the upcoming meeting in Oman as the beginning of a process, noting that“we don’t have much time.”He also insisted that“we’re not going to let[Tehran]have a nuclear weapon.” When asked whether he would use force against Iran if the talks failed to produce the intended result, Trump replied that he“absolutely”would. Earlier this month, the US president ordered a buildup of US military forces in the Middle East and threatened to bomb Iran if a nuclear deal was not reached. In 2015, Iran signed a UN-backed agreement known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), curbing its nuclear activity in exchange for sanctions relief. Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the deal during his first term as president in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.",

    "title": "China dismisses US tariff ‘numbers game’",
    "article_text": "China has likened the United States’ tariff policy to a ‘numbers game’ with no practical meaning after the administration of US President Donald Trump imposed multiple rounds of duties on Chinese imports over the past few weeks. In a statement on Friday, the Chinese government accused Washington of using tariffs as a weapon for bullying and coercion, while hitting back with its own reciprocal trade duties. ”Even if the US continues to impose even higher tariffs, it would no longer have any economic significance and would go down as a joke in the history of world economics,”a spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said, as cited by Reuters. The US has imposed four major tariff hikes on China in just over two months, with the latest escalation on Wednesday bringing the duties from an initial average of 20% to a cumulative rate of 145%. China has retaliated, announcing its latest reciprocal hike to 125% on all American imports on Friday. The Ministry of Commerce said Beijing would not retaliate any further, indicating that it may turn to other ways of responding and vowing to“fight to the end.” Trump argues that the increased duties are needed to address trade imbalances and stop China from“ripping off the USA.”Earlier this week, he opined that the“proud”Chinese would have to“make a deal at some point.” China has also filed a lawsuit with the World Trade Organization challenging the latest US tariff hike, asserting that Washington’s actions have significantly disrupted the global economy. The trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies has caused extreme volatility in global stock markets, sent oil prices to four-year lows, and caused concerns regarding global supply chains.",

    "title": "Xi warns US will isolate itself",
    "article_text": "The United States risks isolating itself by pursuing unilateral trade restrictions, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned on Friday during a visit of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to Beijing. The administration of US President Donald Trump has launched an escalating tariff war with China, imposing a total of 145% in duties on Chinese imports this week. Beijing has retaliated by hiking tariffs on American goods to 125%. “There are no winners in the tariff war and standing against the world ultimately results in self-isolation,”Xi said, as cited by Xinhua news agency. Xi called on China and the European Union to“jointly resist unilateral bullying”in order to protect their legitimate rights and interests, and uphold international rules and order. The EU, which has been targeted with a 20% tariff by the US, has warned of significant global economic repercussions and has vowed to take countermeasures. Earlier this week, Trump declared a 90-day pause on reciprocal duties for most US trading partners, including the EU, allowing a window for negotiation. Brussels has adopted a policy of“de-risking”towards Chinese imports, balancing protective trade measures such as tariffs on electric vehicles with efforts to maintain constructive economic relations. The Chinese president also stated that regardless of changes in the external environment, the country would remain steadfast, focused, and would efficiently manage its own affairs. ”For over seven decades, China’s growth has been fueled by self-reliance and hard work, never depending on favors from others and never backing down in the face of unreasonable suppression,” Xi explained. Trump argues that the increased duties are needed to address trade imbalances and stop China from“ripping off the USA.”Earlier this week, he opined that the“proud”Chinese would have to“make a deal at some point.” China has slammed Trump’s“abnormally high tariffs”on Chinese products as“unilateral bullying and coercion.”The move by the US president represents“a serious violation of international economic and trade rules, as well as of basic economic laws and common sense,”Beijing stressed.

    "title": "Zelensky offered US rare-earths deal under Biden – Blinken",
    "article_text": "Former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said he sees nothing inherently wrong with his country benefiting from Ukrainian rare-earth minerals, but claimed that the current administration under Donald Trump is taking the wrong approach to achieve this. In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, Blinken confirmed that an offer from Kiev on minerals had been on the table during his time as secretary of state under President Joe Biden. The current US administration is working to finalize a deal with Ukraine, which President Trump claims will enable American taxpayers to recoup funds spent over the years supporting Kiev’s war effort against Russia. The agreement does not offer security guarantees to Ukraine. According to Blinken, the Biden administration took a different approach to the rare-earths deal offered by Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky. “Part of the victory package that [Zelensky] put on the table in the last six months of our administration included us working with them on rare earths, on critical minerals,”he told journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. Blinken said the Biden administration had aimed to promote investments in Ukraine for the mutual benefit of both nations. However, he criticized the Trump administration’s proposal as“basically a protection racket without the protection.” The document submitted by Washington in March reportedly grants American businesses broad access to the Ukrainian economy but without security assurances. The White House contends that vested US interests would serve as a de facto form of protection. Zelensky has sought Western security guarantees as a precondition for signing a peace treaty with Moscow. Among his proposed options were immediate NATO membership, the acquisition of nuclear weapons by Kiev, and the deployment of long-range Western missiles on Ukrainian territory, aimed at Russia. Negotiations for a minerals deal began during the early weeks of the second Trump presidency, with at least two draft proposals being abandoned. The two countries appeared close to finalizing an agreement during Zelensky’s visit to Washington in late February. However, the planned signing was canceled after Zelensky publicly questioned Trump’s approach to Russia, leading to the Ukrainian delegation being asked to leave the White House.",

    "title": "Kamala Harris eyes new political role – NYT",
    "article_text": "Former US Vice President Kamala Harris is considering a run for California governor in 2026, according to the New York Times. The newspaper noted that Harris has kept a relatively low profile since her loss to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, and reported that she is still processing the defeat while evaluating her political future. Harris became the Democratic presidential nominee after then-President Joe Biden withdrew from the race less than four months before Election Day. Biden faced increasing pressure to step aside due to concerns over his mental and physical health and ultimately endorsed Harris as his successor. Despite the endorsement, Harris was defeated and failed to carry any battleground states. Sources familiar with her thinking told the newspaper that Harris is seriously exploring a gubernatorial bid. The position will become open as current Governor Gavin Newsom is set to leave office, with the election scheduled for November 3, 2026. Harris reportedly believes that leading California – the most populous Democratic stronghold – would offer her a powerful platform to counteract Trump-era policies. Harris has recently begun to reengage with the public. At the Leading Women Defined Summit earlier this month, she spoke of a growing“sense of fear”in the US and criticized institutions for“capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats”– a thinly veiled reference to recent actions by Trump. Less than 100 days into his second term, Trump has eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, authorized widespread federal employee layoffs, and enacted broad global tariffs that have roiled financial markets. Should she enter the race for governor, Harris would likely forgo a second presidential campaign in 2028, although that possibility remains on the table, the NYT reported. Her advisers believe the Democratic primary race for the White House will be highly competitive and could include current California Governor Newsom among the contenders, according to reports. Although she has yet to announce a decision, polling suggests Harris would immediately become the front-runner in the California gubernatorial race. “Let her run,”Trump said in a recent interview referring to Harris’ potential candidacy for California governor.“One thing she’s going to do, she’s got to start doing interviews.” Several other Democratic contenders, including former US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and former Representative Katie Porter, have already launched their campaigns. Harris has reportedly indicated she will make her decision by the end of the summer. Some within the party have expressed frustration over Harris’ delay, arguing that early leadership is crucial in such a consequential race.",

    "title": "Ukrainians no longer believe they are fighting for justice – former PM",
    "article_text": "An increasing number of Ukrainian men are dodging the military draft because they do not believe they are defending a just state anymore, former Prime Minister Anatoly Kinakh has said. Ukrainian enlistment officers have adopted increasingly harsh recruitment methods amid military setbacks and mounting losses in the conflict with Russia. Numerous videos on social media have shown men being forcefully transported to enlistment centers, while there have also been reports of injuries and deaths among men who have resisted attempts to be sent to the front. Kiev’s mobilization drive is facing“very serious problems,”Kinakh, who now heads the Ukrainian League of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (ULIE), acknowledged in an interview with the Superpozitsia YouTube on Thursday. The former prime minister said he recently held discussions with representatives of Ukraine’s General Staff responsible for the psychological condition of troops, and“asked them a question: why in 2022 there were queues at military recruitment centers and today the enlistment officers are catching people in the streets like animals?” “And we came to the same conclusion: some people have stopped believing and some doubt that they live in and protect a just state,”he said. According to Kinakh, who headed the Ukrainian government between 2001 and 2002,“this problem is even more acute on the front line”with Russia. Earlier this week, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Aleksandr Syrsky, called for the ramping up of mobilization efforts, saying that the country needs to draft at least 30,000 troops every month to be able to sustain resistance to Moscow. Kiev has recently launched a new voluntary military contract program targeting those aged 18–24, which offers young men not subject to mobilization one-year contracts with a 1 million hryvnia ($24,000) payout – four times the standard rate – plus monthly combat bonuses starting at 120,000 hryvnia ($2,880), along with other benefits. Unlike Ukraine, which declared a general mobilization and barred most men aged 18 to 60 from leaving the country, Russia has avoided a full nationwide draft during the conflict. Following a partial mobilization in the fall of 2022, Moscow has largely relied on contract soldiers to fill the ranks of its military. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in December that in 2024 more than 1,000 volunteers were joining the country’s armed forces every day.",

    "article_text": "China will raise tariffs on American goods coming into the country from 84% to 125%, officials in Beijing have said. There will be no further hikes of import duties no matter what Washington does next, they added. On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump raised the tariffs on Chinese products to 125% in response to measures Beijing had imposed over Washington’s previous protectionist economic moves. Trump stressed that the increased duties are intended to make China realize that“ripping off the USA and other countries is no longer sustainable or acceptable.” The Customs Tariff Commission of the Chinese State Council said in a statement on Friday that tariffs on US goods will be raised for the last time, to 125%, starting from Saturday in response to the duties announced by Trump. “In view of the fact that under the current tariff level, there is no possibility of market acceptance of US goods exported to China, if the US side continues to impose tariffs on Chinese goods exported to the US in the future, the Chinese side will ignore it,”the statement read. The commission also slammed Trump’s“abnormally high tariffs”on Chinese products as“unilateral bullying and coercion.”The move by the US president represented“a serious violation of international economic and trade rules, as well as of basic economic laws and common sense,”it stressed. After Trump’s announcement of sweeping tariffs caused a sharp drop in US stock prices last week, he declared a 90-day pause on reciprocal duties for US trading partners, lowering them to a 10% baseline. China became one of the few exceptions, and instead saw tariffs against it increased even further. According White House officials cited by the media, the 25% duties will also remain in place for car manufacturers and steel and aluminum producers in Mexico and Canada.",

    "article_text": "The US is seeking a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict, in contrast to the EU and UK, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said. Russia has said any long-term settlement with Ukraine would only be viable if it addresses the“root causes”of the crisis, including Kiev’s aspirations to join NATO. During a press conference on Friday, Lavrov said US President Donald Trump“every time”stresses his desire to stop the fighting between Moscow and Kiev. “We see that, unlike [Western] Europe… which completely ignores the root causes of the current situation, in the US there is a desire to get to the bottom of this issue,”he stated. The foreign minister noted that“President Trump has repeatedly said in public that drawing Ukraine into NATO – despite many years of warnings from Moscow against doing so – was a mistake that probably played a decisive role in the current events.” Washington“also understands that a return to Ukraine’s 1991 borders, which is still being demanded by [Ukraine’s Vladimir] Zelensky, is impossible,”Lavrov added. Earlier on Friday, Axios reported that Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, had traveled to Russia to hold a meeting with President Vladimir Putin. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later confirmed that Witkoff had arrived in the country, but added that there would be a separate announcement if talks between Putin and Witkoff take place. According to services monitoring air traffic, a plane associated with Witkoff traveled from Florida to St. Petersburg overnight. Putin has“a regional trip”to an undisclosed location on his schedule for Friday. If a meeting is held, it would be the third between Putin and Witkoff since Trump initiated the normalization of relations with Moscow and reiterated plans to find a settlement to the Ukraine conflict following his inauguration in January.",

Witkoff was also part of the US delegation that took part in senior-level talks with Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in March. The discussions, held in Riyadh, centered on the Ukraine conflict.

Look, he’s sitting here and I don’t care. I don’t need Elon for anything other than I happen to like him,”Trump said.“But I’m telling you, this guy did a fantastic job.” Trump: Elon has done a fantastic job. I don’t care. I don’t need Elon for anything other than the fact that I happen to like him. I don’t need his car. I actually bought one. He makes a great carpic.twitter.com/kQg3yU8DT6 The president said that he even bought a Tesla car he doesn’t need – not for himself, but to let his office staff drive around as a show of support for Musk.“They said, oh, did you get a bargain? No. I said, give me the top price,”Trump quipped. Musk, in turn, credited the“fantastic leadership”of Trump and his Cabinet, announcing that DOGE anticipates that it will be able to save $150 billion in fiscal year 2026 by reducing fraud and waste in federal spending. “Some of it is just absurd – like people getting unemployment insurance who haven’t been born yet,”Musk said. Musk’s high-profile advisory role in Trump’s administration has attracted many critics, accusing him of alleged conflicts of interest and political bias in his companies’ operations and federal contracts. A group of Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to the White House calling for Musk’s removal, arguing that his“erratic behavior”and past controversies undermine public trust. The White House has so far stood by Musk, with Trump making clear on Thursday that he has no intention of parting ways with his government’s waste hunter. The US president said he hopes Musk’s team will stay on beyond this initiative, praising their tech-savvy approach. “Your people are fantastic… They’re great. Smart, sharp... finding things that nobody would have thought of,”the president said.“We’d like to keep as many as we can. In fact, hopefully they’ll stay around for the long haul.”",

    "article_text": "The European Union is prepared to impose bloc-wide tariffs on major US tech companies, such as Meta and Google, if negotiations with Washington fail to resolve the escalating trade dispute, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned. Following US President Donald Trump’s decision to pause further tariff hikes for 90 days, EU exports to America will still face a“baseline”10% import duty instead of the planned 20% under his new trade regime. Nevertheless, the European Commission has announced it would temporarilysuspendits countermeasures, pending further negotiations. Speaking to the Financial Times on Thursday, von der LeyensaidBrussels was ready to deploy its most powerful trade measures, potentially targeting American digital service providers and the advertising revenues of Silicon Valley giants. “We are developing retaliatory measures,”von der Leyen said, adding that these could include the first use of the EU’s anti-coercion mechanism to hit services rather than goods.“There’s a wide range of countermeasures... in case the negotiations are not satisfactory.” “An example is you could put a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services,”she added, outlining a measure that would apply across the bloc’s entire single market – on top of digital sales taxes set individually by member states. While the EU remains committed to seeking a“completely balanced”agreement during Trump’s 90-day tariff freeze, von der Leyen made clear that Brussels would not hesitate to act if talks fail. The EC is also considering tariffs on US scrap metal exports, as well as protective measures to prevent Chinese goods – targeted by prohibitive145% US tariffs– from flooding European markets. Von der Leyen has described Trump’s tariff war as a“turning point”for global trade, saying there would be no return to the“status quo”between the EU and the US. She claimed that Brussels had attempted to negotiate with Washington in recent months but was told to wait until Trump’s April 2 announcement, which imposed a 20%“reciprocal”tariff on the EU. While both sides have agreed that reform of the World Trade Organization (WTO) is needed, von der Leyen warned that the economic chaos unleashed by Trump’s tariffs was already inflicting heavy costs on global markets. “There are no winners in this, only losers,”she said.“Today we see the cost of chaos... the costs of the uncertainty that we are experiencing today will be heavy.” Von der Leyen confirmed that the EU would pause its plannedretaliationagainst US steel and aluminum tariffs during the negotiations but stressed that Brussels would not negotiate over its“untouchable”rules on digital content, market power, and other“sovereign decisions.”The bloc also will not negotiate its value-added tax (VAT), which US officials – including Trump – have lambasted as“discriminatory”against American exporters, even though both imported and locally produced goods are taxed equally.",

The pastel-coloured plates come with small, numbered compartments that make eating less overwhelming for children. Mum-of-one Rachel Raeburn was so frustrated that her then-four-year-old daughter was a slow and fussy eater, that she designed a plate that would help children better enjoy eating. (Photo: Rachel Raeburn; My Story Plate; Art: Chern Ling) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Mother-of-one Rachel Raeburn recalled when her daughter, Oia Tan, was four years old and mealtimes would be a dreadful experience. “Oia was easily distracted and would take an hour to finish her meals, and even then, often not finishing the contents on her plate. She didn’t like mushy food and green leafy vegetables with stems,” said the 49-year-old. The founder of her public relations firm, Relish PR, would be tearing her hair out, coaxing Oia to finish her meals. The girl is now nine years old. Serving meals on different coloured plates didn’t help either. Raeburn also noted that as the surfaces of many plates were flat, it was difficult to scoop up food with a spoon, more so for young children who are just learning to use a spoon. “Generally, plates do nothing to encourage children to eat, other than to contain and present the food,” said Raeburn. She did, however, notice that when she counted down the number of spoonfuls of food left on the plate, Oia would be motivated to eat. “I could see that she would make an effort to chew and swallow her food to take on the next spoonful.” The observation led Raeburn to wonder if a plate with numbered ‘pods’, which allowed food to be served in smaller portions, would appear less intimidating to children. Finding nothing of the sort available on the market, Raeburn decided that she would create one herself. “I was thinking, ‘if only the compartments were numbered, they could guide little kids like Oia to eat continuously,” recalled Raeburn. So she decided to sketch out her idea and run it by one of her ex-clients who is a designer. “I’ve always had an entrepreneurial mindset and would think of solutions to everyday issues,” said Raeburn. That was in January 2020 when Raeburn and her designer started developingMy Story Plate. They came up with a prototype that had 10 pods. Raeburn tested out the prototype with a group of parents and their children. While the parent focus group, which comprised eight parents with kids from two to six years old, loved the idea, they didn’t like that there were so many pods. “I also had feedback that the base of the pods was too flat, which made it difficult for kids to scoop up their food,” said Raeburn. It was back to the drawing board. This time, the number of pods was reduced to five and the pod sizes were increased accordingly. Raeburn told CNA Women that most children’s plates have three compartments, a larger one for carbohydrates and two others for meat and vegetables. My Story Plate, on the other hand, has five pods, so it further portions food into smaller amounts to make it appear less overwhelming for young kids. “We had to make sure that all five pods fit, and each pod was not too small, but sizeable enough to hold a standard plate of food when combined,” said Raeburn. Priced at S$39, each plate measures 34cm by 23cm, with 6cm-wide pods. The designer also made the base of the pods round to aid the scooping process, particularly for little ones who are just learning to hold and use a spoon. As a food introductory plate that can hold various food types separately, My Story Plate works well as a baby’s first weaning plate. The pods are numbered in ascending order, from one to five. “These numbers guide children, especially slow eaters, to eat continuously to finish their meal. Children might get distracted so the numbers remind them of the continuity from one to five, after which they are done,” said Raeburn. As kids grow up and consume bigger portions, the plate can be used to hold meat and vegetables while a separate plate or bowl contains the carbohydrates. My Story Plate comes in blue or pink with cute illustrations, and to make mealtimes more fun, Raeburn has also incorporated storytelling elements into the design, giving the product its name. Oia was instrumental in the graphic design of the plate. “Besides the graphic designs of the plate, she loves that the plate portions food into smaller amounts, which makes eating less overwhelming,” added Raeburn. The pink plate tells the story of Blossom the unicorn, who is disappointed when it rains as she cannot go out to play. The blue plate features Charlie, a little car in a racing competition. “Children are attracted to cute designs and learn through storytelling. My intention was to have a story to take the child through the eating process, as he/she eats from pod one to two and finishes at pod five,” said Raeburn. She added: “Each character encounters a challenge at the start and perseveres through it to emerge with a positive outcome. For a young child, some of their challenges could include eating food that is unfamiliar or not to their preference.” Most children’s plates are made of either melamine ware or silicone, both of which are plastic-based. My Story Plate is made from bamboo fibre. “I wanted to make a plate that is not only eco-friendly but non-toxic and safe for children to use. Seeing that a bamboo fibre bowl that was given to my daughter for her first birthday was solid and well made, I decided to use bamboo fibre as well,” said Raeburn. Not only is bamboo fibre sustainable, but it is also non-toxic and has natural anti-bacterial properties. The plate is also dishwasher-safe. My Story Plate took three years from ideation to the final product, which was launched in 2022, thanks in part to the pandemic, which delayed communications with the manufacturer in China, and the production and shipment of samples. Oia was seven when My Story Plate was launched. Mealtimes were shortened to 15 to 20 minutes, down from an hour. Whereas she was afussy eaterbefore, Raeburn said Oia is now more adventurous at meals. The primary school student now eats well and is now more willing to try food that she is unfamiliar with. “And if she is not a fan of what is cooked for her, she would at least eat a decent portion of it, which makes mealtime so much more pleasant,” said Raeburn. “Oia still uses My Story Plate occasionally as it can hold quite a lot of food. Whenever she eats with the plate, she eats her meals faster, even faster than me,” said the proud mum. About 100 plates have been sold since its launch,and Raeburn has received many positive reviews from parents. One parent shared that her six-year-old would always have leftovers but now eats everything on her plate. Another parent, who has three children below the age of four, said that the plates have cut down mealtime for her kids by half. A mum of a five-year-old said that the plate kept her child focused on eating and so he stayed seated throughout his meal when he used to get off his seat to walk around. Parents of toddlers have shared that their kids are more engaged during mealtime and are able to handle a spoon easier due to the rounded base of the pods. Another parent said that her son eats a whole fruit when served in My Story Plate – when he doesn’t usually eat his fruits at breakfast. “It’s heartening to know that kids are encouraged to eat more balanced meals with the plate,” said Raeburn.

    "title": "Life on wheels: The campervan trend is rolling across Malaysia as Singaporeans hop onboard",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Living Living Living Obsessions Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Dining Women Dining Dining Experiences Trending Living Experiences Living Living The country’s RV industry is beginning to take off while interest from Singaporeans grows. David Ang and Estelle Toh, with their sons Aether and Zephyr, in their campervan. (Photo: David Ngiau) This audio is generated by an AI tool. When they became parents, David Ang and Estelle Toh wanted to ensure that their two sons had a bond with nature. Ang, a 36-year-old Singaporean doctor, always loved the outdoors while Toh, a 41-year-old nurse he met through work, grew up in the picturesque west Johor village of Ulu Choh before going to school in Singapore and starting her career. They named their sons Zephyr and Aether, now six and eight, respectively. The young Singapore-based family tasted “van life” when they toured New Zealand in an RV – or recreational vehicle – in 2018, and the experience stuck with them. Then the COVID-19 pandemic struck, leaving them feeling a little trapped. Three months after the Causeway reopened in April 2022, the family moved to East Ledang, a Johor neighbourhood near Legoland popular with Singaporeans and other expats, to enrol their sons in an international school nearby. The exchange rate would allow the young family greater latitude while Ang would still work at a Singapore clinic three days a week. Noticing RVs rolling about west JB, and with their fond RV memories, the couple thought: Why not get a campervan of our own? A few months later, buoyed by the fact they’re living in a land with broader horizons, they bought a parallel import Toyota Camroad from Japan from a Johor-based dealer. “We do a lot of road trips around Malaysia and always look forward to the next one,” said the 36-year-old Ang. “We found that besides hotels and resorts, it was easy to get affordable Airbnbs but they weren’t always ideal for us. An RV would be more secure, we wouldn’t be restricted to staying in small towns, and could visit more heritage sites too.” With RVs not allowed on Singapore roads, Ang and Toh are part of a wave of Singaporeans buying campervans and parking them in Johor. RV love is growing fast among Malaysians, too, with one Facebook group of enthusiasts having 113,000 members as of writing. For Shamsul Rosli, the idea of a home-on-wheels was irresistible. Peering and pondering led to planning and plotting and, over a decade ago, the Seremban-based outdoor events producer flew to Europe with his wife and rented an RV, also known as a motor home, campervan, or caravan. He was instantly hooked. Morning Gais .. salam buat semua .\n\nPertamanya buat anda yg mahu berbincang membina campertruck buatan company Abg Sham... In 2018, the 60-year-old imported one to Malaysia and began touring the country and Thailand. The obsession grew and he set up Camper-V in 2021 to convert vehicles (such as buses, vans and trucks) into RVs. COVID-19 restrictions on hotel stays provided an unexpected boost as Malaysians started looking at the growing number of RVs rolling through quiet kampung lanes as an alternative. The Ziarah - Malaysian made EarthRoamer Today, Sham is one of the leading figures in the country’s growing campervan scene, promoting a culture that taps into Malaysians’ existing love for the outdoors and working with government agencies to set up supporting infrastructure for a fast-growing industry. Numerous dealers started appearing around the same time Sham imported his RV while individual enthusiasts started DIY conversions of vans into campervans. Sam Tee, founder of VR Motorhomes near Subang Jaya, participated in PLANMalaysia meetings along with other industry players and is encouraged by the government’s growing support for the sector. Tee started VR Motorhomes in 2019 with his wife after importing his first RV. Seeing the potential of RVs, he quickly transitioned away from sales and distribution of lorries and other heavy vehicles. “That first RV post on Mudah.com got way more inquiries than any prior post,” said Tee, who estimated that he received 100 responses within a few weeks. By 2021, VR Motorhomes started building their own proudly made-in-Malaysia RVs with locally manufactured fibreglass bodies mounted on repurposed Toyota Hilux trucks. Tee and company have since settled on a Ford pickup, their third iteration, with the aim of producing a minimum of 30 this year. Besides selling their custom-built RVs, VR Motorhomes rents their campervans for around RM1,000 (S$302.89) for the first day, with subsequent days going for nearly half after discounts. Bumblebee Ranger \nSiap sekali dengan kereta dalam RM 200,000😍😍\nNak booking untuk modify cepat2 contact kita... As you would expect, the industry is centred in the Klang Valley around Kuala Lumpur at the moment, with few RV dealers setting up shop further afield. Johor, for instance, has only one dealer based near Muar. This September, Melaka will host the Caravan Jamboree, timed to fall on this year’s World Tourism Day. State chief minister Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh said at January’s launch of Camper Rally Melaka 2025 that the event, co-organised with the Malaysian Campervan and Motorhome Association, will attract 155 delegations from around the world with plans for 1,000 campervans to converge at the city’s Dataran 1Malaysia square. Meanwhile, foreign players have already joined the fray. In 2022, Europe’s leading RV manufacturer, Knaus Tabbert AG, was awarded Malaysia’s first Vehicle Type Approval certificate to start manufacturing, selling and distributing Outdoor Motor Vehicles (OMVs) in the country. That was soon followed by a visit to Malaysia, hosted by the East Coast Economic Region Development Council (ECERDC), of Knaus Tabbert and three other German RV makers, RV component manufacturers and a caravan trade fair organiser. With growing public interest, Malaysian authorities are ramping up efforts to support the RV industry with infrastructure. Unlike in North America and Europe, where RVs have been on the roads for decades, Malaysia lacks a network of dedicated RV parks and campgrounds complete with electric, water and sewage hookups. Fortunately, more modern campervans require much less such support, especially with roof-mounted solar panels now a standard de rigueur feature, and removable compact waste tanks that can be emptied in a lavatory. Many smaller caravans even forgo on-board WCs with users relying on public toilets. Last year, the Department of Town and Country Planning (PLANMalaysia) took the lead in developing comprehensive guidelines for RV usage and addressing regulatory and infrastructure gaps, such as the lack of dedicated grounds for RV parking and camping. At present, such RV parks have been set up by individual states and cities such as Melaka. Parallel to the rising popularity of RVs is the growing “vanlife” community of more DIY-minded individuals inspired by counterparts in the United States, a group brought in focus by the 2021 Oscar-winning film Nomadland. Even a few young Singaporean couples have joined the new wave. COVID-19 cut short the endeavours of a number of more popular channels such as trailblazing 24 Hour Travellers, underlining the tenuousness of young communities and industries. A post shared by 👫 Martin + Jacinda 🚐 (@mjroadtrippin) With the industry at a nascent stage and governmental guidelines still being firmed up, some interested consumers have reported frustration with certain dealers citing overcharging and lack of after-sales service. A few RV dealers/rental companies seemed wary of publicity beyond their own social media outreach. It’s to be expected with new terrain being explored, as Ang and Toh are finding out themselves on a more literal note. “One thing is that I didn’t realise that motorhomes aren’t that suited for steep mountain roads,” Ang recalledof their maiden RV trip in New Zealand.“There was a night when I wanted to reach a town before it got too late and took a shortcut. That was a bit scary, there was just enough horsepower to get us over some steep slopes. “I think some drivers stuck behind us were a bit upset because we took our time, going slowly. That was a lesson.” Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport UDINE, Italy :AC Milan coach Sergio Conceicao praised the way Udinese fans applauded Mike Maignan when he had to be carried off on a stretcher following a collision with AC Milan teammate Alex Jimenez in the second half of their 4-0 win on Friday. Milan were up 2-0 at Udinese in Serie A when Maignan left the box and clashed heads with Jimenez while trying to block the ball in the 51st minute. Maignan was a victim of racial abuse the last time Milan travelled to Udinese in January 2024 and the French keeper briefly walked off the pitch after being subjected to racist chants by the local fans. \"It impressed me. The player on the ground, the chaos around him... I have to compliment the Udinese fans,\" Conceicao told Sky Sport. \"The player is one thing, and the man is another. They can boo the player, but not the man. That applause was an incredible gesture, in 40 years of football I have seen few gestures like that. Now Mike is in hospital for tests.\" Milan players urgently gestured the team's medical staff to attend to Maignan, who appeared to be unconscious for a brief moment. The Rossoneri sit ninth on 51 points with six games left to play in a largely disappointing campaign. \"Today we were a team, but it's only three points,\" said Conceicao, whose side have won only three of their last eight games. \"Now we immediately think about Atalanta. In any case I saw a solid and a balanced team, as well as physically available. There was time to work on it, it was important to have 2-3 weeks to work.\" Milan host third-placed Atalanta next weekend before facing Inter Milan in second leg of their Coppa Italia semi-final, which remains their best bet to secure European football next season. Conceicao remained tight-lipped when asked if the team still believed they could secure European action. \"We're thinking about working tomorrow, we shouldn't talk too much,\" he said. \"In the end what matters are the results of each day (of training), the rest comes as a consequence in the game.\" Get our pick of top stories and thought-provoking articles in your inbox Stay updated with notifications for breaking news and our best stories Get WhatsApp alerts Join our channel for the top reads for the day on your preferred chat app Copyright© Mediacorp 2025.

    "title": "Tips for travellers entering the US now: Check your visa, turn off your phone",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences With increasing news reports of travellers being denied entry, understanding what might prompt extra scrutiny is key. Here’s what to know. Los Angeles International Airport. (Photo: Stellalevi/iStock) At airports and land borders across the country,tourists and other visitors coming to the United Stateshave reported being caught up in the Trump administration’s campaign of “enhanced vetting.” Even legal immigrants, like green card holders, and naturalised citizens have been pulled aside for additional questioning and searches. This has prompted questions about best practices for crossing into the United States, travellers’ rights at the border, and the legality of device and luggage searches. Here are some things to know before you visit or return to the United States, as a tourist, legal resident or citizen. According to theAmerican Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), US border officials have “wide-ranging discretion” to deny entry. That decision can be made based on suspicion that the person is entering the country for a purpose other than what their visa or Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) says — for example, they have a tourist visa, but it seems like they may be planning to work. “We’ve seen people detained just for saying they’re ‘Open to Work’ on LinkedIn,” said Michael Wildes, the New Jersey-based immigration lawyer who handled Melania Trump’s immigration to the United States. “That serves as proof that they’re not just going to Disneyland or to a wedding.” Cheryl David, an immigration lawyer in New York City, stressed that no rules have changed when it comes to entering the United States, but she said, there is now a clear “zero tolerance policy.” This year, the family of Becky Burke, a 28-year-old British tourist, saidshe was stoppedat the US border in Washington State on her way to a work-exchange trip, where she planned to trade house chores for free accommodations. While no money changed hands, those arrangements could still be seen as work, which would violate the terms of a tourist visa. Ms. Burke ended up detained for 19 days before she was deported to Britain. While detaining prospective tourists is rare, deportations because of incorrect travel documentation is not. If questions arise regarding passengers’ travel documents, border officials can pull them out of line and submit them to additional screening, at which point luggage and electronic devices such as laptops and cell phones can be searched. Even green card holders and naturalised citizens may be subject to more screening. US citizens and lawful permanent residents cannot be denied entry to the country for refusing to hand over their devices, but such a refusal could still lead to a longer customs process, the ACLU said. Catherine, 67, a naturalised citizen who moved to the United States 45 years ago, said she had never been selected for additional questioning when coming through immigration, but that since the start of the Trump administration she has been stopped twice for reasons that remain unclear to her. Catherine asked to be identified by only her middle name, because of her fears that her naturalised status could be revoked for speaking out. Most recently, Catherine was returning from Argentina when she and her husband were stopped at an airport in Dallas. Border control there was automated, with passengers scanning passports to get through gates, but when it came time to take a photograph, a big red X flashed on the screen for Catherine. Her husband spoke to border officials, and the couple eventually got through. Because border control technically exists outside the United States, travellers with visas or those with ESTAs have limited ability to push back against searches of their electronic devices, according to the ACLU, and if they do, they risk being denied entry. There are generally two types of searches of an electronic device: manual and advanced, said Tom McBrien, a lawyer with theElectronic Privacy Information Center, an internet privacy nonprofit in Washington. Manual searches involve looking through an unlocked phone. Courts have generally seen this as equivalent to going through luggage and have allowed manual searches to proceed without obtaining a warrant, Mr. McBrien said. An advanced, or “forensic” search, involves hooking up an external device to your phone to scan its contents. Some federal districts require a warrant for this, while others do not, Mr McBrien said. Mr McBrien and other privacy experts recommend deleting anything you wouldn’t want someone to read or see from your device before your arrival. Mr McBrien also said that he recommends his clients disable the Face ID or Touch ID features on their iPhones, so that it takes more than an officer waving a phone in front of their face or placing their finger on it to open it. Even better, he said, is to turn off your phone before going through border control, because phones tend to require your full passcode when turned back on. If you refuse to unlock your phone when asked, authorities can seize it and will most likely need to obtain a warrant to open it, he added. However, visitors can be denied entry to the United States for refusing to unlock their phone. However, Mr Wildes, the New Jersey-based immigration lawyer, said that the main thing border patrol officers look for is consistency. If a forensic search shows a deactivated social media account, officials may ask for it to be reactivated, Mr. Wildes said. If an email account was recently deleted, they can request to access it. Social media has become a major issue, he added, for “so many people who don’t realise how actionable it can be.” Ms David, the immigration lawyer, recalled a client with a student visa who was denied entry to the United States during the Biden administration because he had photos on his phone of him posing with guns, which officials interpreted as a threat to the United States, she said. The best thing to do, Mr Wildes said, is to be honest and also be aware of the laws. If you do get in trouble at the border, he said, the best move for visitors may be to withdraw your intention to enter the United States. In most cases, you can return to your home country.

    "title": "Everything We Know About ‘Highest 2 Lowest,’ Spike Lee's Long-Awaited Reunion With Denzel Washington",
    "article_text": "It’s official:Spike Lee’s new film,Highest 2 Lowestwill premiere May 19th at theCannes Film Festival. The movie—a reinterpretation of Akira Kurosawa’s 1963 crime procedural/class parable morality playHigh and Low—reunites Lee with his longtime (and arguably greatest) collaborator,Denzel Washington, who’ll walk Cannes’ red carpet for what festival chief Thierry Fremaux points out is “the first time ever.” Lee has a long history with the festival, and the 5/19 date is pregnant with meaning for the filmmaker. It’s the 36th anniversary of the Cannes premiere of Lee’s classicDo the Right Thing, the first of five Lee films that have screened there. Lee also previously served as Cannes’ Jury President in 2021, and his last time on the Croisette with a feature film in competition, 2018’sBLACKKKLANSMAN, he won a Grand Prix (and six subsequent Oscar nominations), though this time out his film won’t be in competition. Highest 2 Lowest, an Apple and A24 collab project, has been highly anticipated since it was announced early last year. It’s Lee’s second remix of an international classic from a master, following his 2013 take on Park Chan-Wook’sOldboywithJosh Brolin, Elizabeth Olsen andSamuel L. Jackson.Highest 2 Lowestarrives amid a late-career resurgence for Lee, and features a cast seemingly ripped from my imagination: Denzel (re-teaming with Lee for the first time in nearly two decades, and their fifth time overall) plus the GodJeffrey Wright, Dean Winters, Ice Spice, andA$AP Rocky. Kurosawa’s original—itself based on the 1959 cop novelKing’s Ransomby Evan Hunter—is a tense and patient film that is largely about men in rooms making difficult choices after being put in dire positions. It interrogates the hierarchies of class and the corrosive effects of capitalism on individuals apart from and within the social fabric of early ‘60s Japanese society. Toshiro Mifune—who made sixteen films with Kurosawa between 1948 and 1965 and is basically the Denzel to his Spike Lee—plays Kingo Gondo, a shoe executive fighting for the integrity of the products his company produces. As Gondo is preparing to push back against the forces of cynical corporate immiseration by committing his entire net worth to a hostile takeover, a case of mistaken identity throws his life and value system into chaos. He gets a call from a kidnapper who claims to be holding his son; when it’s discovered that the kidnapper has actually taken the son of Gondo’s chauffeur—but still wants 30 million yen for his safe return—Gondo is forced to choose whether to sacrifice his career and his wealth or the life of his employee’s child. Lee has been guarded about details from the film, but has left some bread crumbs along with a few context-clue shots leaked from the set, includingan image of A$AP Rocky posing defiantly in a prison jumpsuit. Leehas described Rocky’s character—who, with Spike’s typical subtlety, is named “Yung Felon”—as “the main role in the film.” Denzel’s character—the Mifune part—is now a “music mogul,” and an ultra-gentrified and price-gouged contemporary New York City stands in for postwar Tokyo. So this is pure speculative fancasting, but Yung Felon sounds suspiciously like a rap moniker. What I’ll guess—in a Friday afternoon blog post you’ll hopefully have forgotten by the likely summer release of this film if I’m wrong—is that like Ginjirô Takeuchi, the devious and envious kidnapper living a life of poverty in Kurosawa’s original, Rakim plays an artist whose career has gone wrong, and holds Denzel’s music exec responsible. Seems likely that Jeffrey Wright plays the chauffeur whose son has been kidnapped by accident and Dean Winters is a nefarious executive trying to ruin Denzel’s record label in an echo of Rappaport’sBamboozledrole.In a just-released image from the film, we see Denzel on the subway, sitting next to a black bag; it’s likely a reprise of the scene from Kurosawa’s film in which Gondo [spoiler alert for a 62-year-old movie] ultimately decides to pay the ransom, putting it in two briefcases and throwing it from a moving train. The film looks like a natural fit for themes and ideas that Lee has been pursuing his entire career: How race and capitalism shape culture in America, preserving integrity in a society full of institutions designed to rob it from us, and our responsibilities to one another in this barrel of crabs. But we won’t know for sure if any of this amateur guesswork is on the money until extremely lucky critics start firing off obnoxious hyperbolic missives from France in about a month.",

    "title": "10 Best Brooks Running Shoes for Every Kind of Athlete",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. If you run, there's a good chance you've owned a pair of the best Brooksrunning shoes. Brooks shoes are consistently best-sellers atrunningstores, and our contacts in the biz tell us that it's for a simple reason: Brooks shoes just work. We all run differently, have different feet, hit the ground in a different way, but Brooksshoesrenders those intricacies null via mesh and foam. The Ghost might be the most well-known, but a full rundown of the best Brooksrunning shoesreveals a deeper bench. Brooks earned itsfootwearknowhow the same way the best endurance runners do—by putting in the time. Brooks has been makingshoesfor more than 100 years, but in the early days it was ballet flats, bathing shoes, roller skates, and cleats. It wasn't until the '70s that Brooks went all-in on running and released a string of showpiece shoes like the Villanova and Vantage before beginning to develop innovations like Podular Technology and MoGo. It's all history now, so welaced upin the current lineup to find out what the best Brooksrunning shoesare today. Brooks Brooks Weight: 10.2 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 10 mm Everyday running shoes are what Brooks has proven itself best at making, and the Glycerin 22 is the best of that bunch. The magic is in the midsole, a sweep of foam made of DNA Tuned, a type that features small nitrogen bubbles inside for cushion and bounce; Tuned includes larger bubbles in the back for more cushion and smaller ones up front for an energetic toe-off. You can feel the formula on the run—in all our testing, the Glycerin felt poppy and energetic, so much so that it seems lighter than it is. On top of that (literally), the double jacquard knit upper is accommodating and snug through the midfoot and heel, if a little warm. (It could probably use a little thinning and cut some weight in the process.) The sum total is an excellent shoe that doesn't only handle everyday runs, it makes you excited to lace up. Brooks Brooks Weight: 9.5 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 12 mm When we mentioned how some Brooks shoes just seem to work for any runner, we had the Ghost in mind. While not the flashiest running shoe out there today, the Ghost has everything a runner needs for casual loops around the neighborhood: a comfy and accommodating upper, a durable and grippy outsole, and soft midsole made of DNA Loft v3 foam that doesn't hide any surprises. It's the perfect shoe for beginners and infrequent runners who want a sneaker for walking around in too, and it comes in a range of widths and sizes. Brooks Brooks Weight: 7.1 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 8 mm The Hyperion 2 weighs less than some of the tip-top $250 marathon running shoes. It's not meant to run with that crowd, but still, it gives you a sense of what Brooks was going for here. With a platform made of the company's DNA Flash v2 midsole foam, the Hyperion 2 is made to be responsive, and it is—while the shoe can take on a wide range of paces like the best everyday running shoes out there, it really proves its point when the going gets fast. In testing, the shoe was fully capable of throwing down, but the best part is that it achieves all this without feeling overly minimal; the upper is quite comfy and well-cushioned. Our one deduction goes to the tongue, which is gusseted on one side and can bunch on the other. Brooks Brooks Weight: 9.1 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 6 mm It'd be easy to say that the Hyperion Max 2 is simply a Hyperion with more beneath it. But that'd be a big oversimplification—this is entirely its own shoe. It has the same responsive DNA Flash v2 foam, sure, but there's more of it, and there's a Pebax SpeedVault plate at work too,andRapidRoll rocker is here to keep things moving forward. Both are great at speed, but the Hyperion Max feels more appropriate for long hauls, and that's what we kept choosing it for during testing. That extra foam, the stability of the plate, and the rocker-enabled roll all made those later miles feel a little more enjoyable. One thing to note is that even though this is a max cushion shoe, the DNA Flash v2 feels firm; it's meant to be more responsive, not a giant underfoot pillow. It's not a bad thing, just something to keep in mind. The only thing to say about the upper is that it's great—lightweight, breathable, snug up high and roomy in the toes; top marks. Brooks Brooks Weight: 10.5 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 6 mm Brooks has a few high-cushion shoes with the last name \"Max,\" but none are as pleasantly squishy as the Glycerin Max. Some maximalist shoes are all squish, but the Glycerin Max manages to combine soft landings with a responsive push into the next step, an unlikely combo made possible by the DNA Tuned foam underfoot. A rockered outsole shape also helps keep things moving along. The shoe could probably lose a tiny bit of weight, but running in it—at any length or speed, really—still feels energetic. Pick up a pair if you want a do-everything Brooks shoe with the most cushion. Brooks Brooks Weight: 7.2 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 8 mm Brooks has been behind other brands in the race day category, but the Hyperion Elite 4 PB is a big stride into the pack. The previous Hyperion Elite 4, no \"PB,\" was similar with its ultralight mesh upper and ARRIS carbon fiber plate that came tuned to each size of the shoe (rather than just shrunk or expanded). But the PB packs a key difference: the foam. Now with PEBA DNA Gold underfoot, this version of the Hyperion Elite has the same pep the other super shoes have been working with for a long time. (Side note: One thing we like that the Hyperion Elite 4 PB has that most of the rest don't is a heel loop to help you get the darn thing on.) Brooks' entire pro marathon team set personal bests at the 2024 Chicago Marathon in this shoe, so it's not a bad choice if you're looking to up the ante yourself—if you can get a pair. Brooks Running Brooks Running Weight: 10.7 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 10 mm Brooks has been experimenting with form-correcting design interventions since its early days in the running shoe world. The company's latest on the matter is GuideRails, a support system that's meant to keep you inside your body's natural path of motion. The GTS in the name of this version of the Glycerin lets you know that this one comes with those GuideRails. And the shoe is similar to the Glycerin in ethos: it's an everyday trainer with soft nitrogen-infused foam. In our testing we found that it's notexactlylike the regular Glycerine though; it's a touch heavier, and feels more rigid—the GuideRails don't feel drastic like some stability features can but you can tell they're there, helping with overpronation and keeping the run moving forward and straight. Still, they had that familiar Glycerin responsiveness when we picked up the pace for some strides. Brooks Brooks Weight: 10.6 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 6 mm Trails dig up a list of variables not found on roads that make designing a high-cushion shoe less straightforward. Just a little wobbliness can lead to twisted ankles, and too much foam can dull a runner's sense of the terrain. The Caldera 8 has the thickest platform of Brooks' trail lineup but it avoids these pitfalls entirely. Instead, the wedge of DNA Loft v3 foam underfoot makes a ride that's comfy and responsive but still planted and even nimble. The TrailTack outsole proved plenty grippy too. All this made the Caldera 8 our favorite trail running shoe from Brooks—for all kinds of runs and specifically for long runs—despite some issues with the fit of the upper that cause occasional rubbing and sliding. Brooks Brooks Weight: 11.1 oz Heel-to-Toe Drop: 8 mm In the Brooks trail shoe lineup, the Cascadia fills the same role as the Ghost. It runs down the middle with a good mix of responsiveness and cushion and doesn't lean more towards one or the other. You can wear it on technical trails and gravel paths but it's probably best for the single track that makes up the ground in-between. The Cascadia 18 feels great at moderate paces but a little sluggish going faster with the extra heft it carries, but you're getting this shoe for reliability, not flash. You might also be getting it for hiking, because all of its features make it great for that, too. Proprietary Cushion Technology:The secret sauce for anyrunning shoecompany is the midsole foam, and Brooks calls its recipe DNA. You'll come across different versions of it and Brooks' team of developers is constantly updating and adjusting the formula to make it softer, firmer, more responsive, or longer lasting. One you'll come across often is DNA Loft v3, which is a lightweight nitrogen-infused EVA that Brooks uses in its high-cushion shoes. DNA Flash v2 is also a nitrogen-infused foam, but it's made to be more responsive. You might also come across DNA Tuned, where the nitrogen bubbles are different sizes in different parts of the midsole to create effects like more cushion in the heel and more spring in the toe. Recently, Brooks created PEBA DNA Gold, a highly responsive and lightweight foam for the Hyperion Elite PBracing shoe. GuideRails for Stability:GuideRails are a component that Brooks debuted in 2013 with the Transcend. The idea behind them is that rather than correct a runner's form, stability features should aim to keep runners within their unique \"habitual motion path\" aka their body's default form. In practice, GuideRails are extra \"plates\" of firmer foam on top of the midsole that cradle the foot from the sides—the idea is that these address overpronation when it happens but not otherwise. Brooks makes versions of most of its popular running shoes with GuideRails; just look for GTS in the shoe's name (that stands for Go-To Stability). Brooks uses a few other proprietary design features in its shoes:",

    "title": "7 Best Mattress Toppers of 2025 for a Serious Sleep Upgrade",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. If you’re shopping for one of the best mattress toppers, then chances are that either yourmattresshas seen better days or maybe you’ve got a new one that just isn’t cutting it. We take sleep seriously around here—big or small upgrades (see ourGQ Sleep Awards 2025) are totally worth the investment. That’s why mattress toppers can be just as key as yourpillows,sheets, and mattress itself. Comfort and support is entirely subjective, which is why an extra layer of fluff of your liking can be the missing piece to a quality night’s rest. Whether it’s memory foam, latex, down, or acoolinglayer, the right topper adds that “just right” feel. We’ve combed through countless reviews, tested toppers along the way, and put together a hand-picked selection of the best mattress toppers for your upgrade. To get right to the core of the story, here's a quicklist of our favorites that we've tested and parsed out below. The Company Store The Company Store Materials: Cotton shell and polyester fillCare: Spot clean or professional dry cleanWarranty: Lifetime guaranteeSleepTrial: None Considering this brand’s century-long track record, they clearly know a thing or two about sleep. Case in point: this down-alternative mattress topper. It’s plush and supportive with a four-inch gusset that lifts up like a cloud. Baffled quilting keeps everything evenly distributed (no weird lumps or shifting). Our GQ tester said it was “soft enough for side-sleeping but firm enough for back support” and gave it bonus points for no funky off-gassing smell and an easy three-minute setup. If you’re looking for a way to make your bed feel more luxe, this is the move. The one downside is that the care is spot-clean or professional dry clean only, but with a lifetime guarantee, it makes up for it. Linenspa Amazon Materials: Gel memory foamCare: Dry clean onlyWarranty: 3-year warrantySleepTrial: None Every now and then, the ‘Zon delivers a sleeper hit (literally). With over 120,000 ratings and near-perfect reviews, this Linenspa memory foam topper is a rare breed: highly rated, wildly affordable, and available in basically every size imaginable (yes, even Short Queen). At just under $60, it's an easy way to breathe new life into a tired mattress without going full-send on a new bed. The gel-infused memory foam molds to your body for personalized comfort, while the cooling gel helps dissipate heat. Whether you go for the two-inch or three-inch profile, you’re getting that plush, pressure-relieving feel that makes a too-firm mattress instantly more forgiving. Bonus: It's CertiPUR-US certified, meaning it meets safety and durability standards, and setup is a breeze—just unroll, let it expand, and crash. Parachute Parachute Materials: Sateen cotton shell, European down and feather fillCare: Dry clean onlyWarranty: 3-year warrantySleepTrial: None If you’re the type who swears by a down comforter and won’t rest your head on anything but a down pillow, consider this your next essential upgrade. Parachute’s ultra-plush topper is fluffy, cloud-like, and downright luxe. Stuffed with premium European white down and feather fill, this topper adds an extra layer of softness to any mattress, especially for those who find their bed just a little too stiff. One reviewer said the plushy layer made their too-firm mattress feel just right—just be sure to give it a good fluff every time you change the sheets. The three-inch gusset height and baffle box construction keep everything lofted and evenly distributed, while the 100% cotton sateen shell keeps things feeling ultra soft. If you’re chasing that melt-into-your-bed feeling, this is your kind of topper. Tempur-Pedic Tempur-Pedic Materials: Tempur-Material foamCare: Removable, washable coverWarranty: 10-year limited warrantySleepTrial: None A sleep giant in the mattress world, Tempur-Pedic has garnered all kinds of hype for its proprietary foam since its inception way back when. It’s actually one of the reasons I ended up buying one of their mattresses in the first place. I’ll admit that I initially thought adding a topper to our already-comfy mattress was overkill, but my partner insisted on the cooling-layer version, and I’m glad he did. As a side sleeper who sometimes flips onto my back, this three-inch layer of Tempur-Material offers a great mix of plush softness and structured support, easing pressure on my hips and joints while still keeping my spine aligned. The performance fabric makes it much more breathable than other heat-trapping foam mattresses (and was a major plus for my partner who runs hot.) It also stays put, is dust-mite and allergen-resistant, and comes with a removable, washable cover for those who appreciate an easy clean. Overall, you really can’t go wrong with the Tempur-Adapt. Saatva Saatva Materials: Natural latexCare: Spot clean onlyWarranty: 1-year limited warrantySleepTrial: 180-night trial Things we can appreciate just as much as the mattress itself? A 180-night sleep trial and a one-year limited warranty. These kinds of perks come into play with something like a mattress topper that’s totally subjective in terms of lasting comfort. And when you opt for a crowd-favorite brand like Satvaa (a staple in much of our sleep ‘best’ lists), you at least know you’re getting top-notch quality. This 1.5-inch layer of hypoallergenic latex foam has a buoyant feel and responsive support without losing its shape over time, thanks to the natural durability of the latex material. Corner straps keep it in place, and the breathable design ensures you stay cool throughout the night. Birch Birch Materials: Cotton, wool, latexCare: Spot clean onlyWarranty: 10-year limited warrantySleepTrial: 100-night trial A prime example of “you get what you pay for”: this well-crafted organic mix of cotton, wool, and natural latex come together for a topper that’s two inches of premium comfort. Sure, it’s an investment, but a good one—especially when it comes to a good night’s rest. It’s marked at $500, but the 10-year limited warranty and 100-night sleep trial ease the blow. It’s plush and body contouring but still has the buoyancy you typically find with latex. It’s great for those who have sensitivity to materials or allergies and sustainable (so you feel good about what you’re sleeping on). One GQ tester speaks to its cooling prowess, saying “the breathability was definitely noticeable for dissipating body heat on warmer nights.” Eight Sleep Eight Sleep Materials: Polyester, cotton cover and proprietary tech Care: Spot clean Warranty: 5 years SleepTrial: None We're joining the ranks of celebs and pro athletes who swear by theEight Sleep Pod 4cover—so much so, it earned a spot in ourGQ Sleep Awards 2025. Not all sleep tech lives up to the hype, but our tester says this one definitely does. It fits right over your mattress like a fitted sheet, and the app-controlled features put it in a league of its own. Built-in tubing heats and cools based on your body temperature, keeping you at your desired temp all night long. Plus, it tracks your sleep quality, heart rate, breathing patterns, and other sleep metrics—both for you and your partner. Our tester was impressed by its quiet operation and how well it improved sleep quality, noting that it helps you fall asleep faster and stay in a deeper, more restful sleep. One thing to note: it comes with a “hub”—a water tank central processor—so you’ll need to find a spot for it in your room. The ultimate goal? A better night’s rest. But to get there, it’s about more than just fluffing up your bed. It’s about considering how you sleep (side, stomach, back), the material, and, of course, the price. Materials generally fall into three categories: memory foam/foam, latex, or down/down-alternative. While a topper won’t replace a worn-out mattress (sometimes, it’s just time to invest in a new one), it can definitely give you a serious upgrade for sleep. Here’s what to keep in mind: if your mattress is too firm, go for something plush like down. A soft mattress? A firmer topper like latex is your best bet. If you’re after something in the middle—soft yet cradling—memory foam might be your go-to. With so many options, narrowing down the material and feel you’re after is key. And don’t forget the care instructions: spot clean, dry clean, or machine washable? Make sure you pick a topper that stays in place and is easy to maintain. Lastly, check for a warranty or sleep trial so you have a safety net after you buy. We sifted through hundreds of reviews, tested a handful along the way, and handpicked only the brands that stood up to the real test of comfort and durability. We considered a variety of factors: cost, warranties, sleep trials, and a mix of popular, top-quality materials—from down and down-alternative to latex and foam/memory foam—to cater to every comfort level. For those who love all things tech forward (you know who you are), we threw in a smart option that’ll have you geeking out over your sleep metrics. No fluff, just quality toppers that check all the boxes for a better night's sleep.",

    "title": "20 Best Light Jackets for Men: For Spring and Beyond",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. There exists a sequence in our genetic code thatpredisposes us to love light jackets. Show us even just a couple of the best light jackets for men and it’ll trigger a primal, physiological response worthy of David Attenborough’s narration. We become giddy, emotional, and practically ungovernable in our financial decisions.Another unlined poplin jacket?Yes. Always yes. Why is this? It’s simple. From April through November—that’s more than half the year—light jackets handily beat all their outerwear competition. In the transitional months, they’re a cinch to throw over a knit sweater or a hoodie. And come high summer, they’re light enough to ball up and toss into your tote until the sun goes down and your arm hairs prick up. What adds to our light jacket obsession even more is the myriad of styles and options to choose from. From sporty windbreakers to ruggedharrington jackets, hybrid shirt jackets toclassic truckers, the lightweight outerwear section is full of tasty options. If you’re struggling with choice paralysis, we can relate. Which is why we’ve broken down the best lightweight jackets for men so you can breeze through the options and clear the way to your next style evolution. TheHarrington jacketis a menswear signature often associated with style god Steve McQueen and hence, his legions of stylish followers. Originally crafted as a wind and water-resistant jacket for golfing, it’s since taken on a life of its own off the fairway thanks to its functionality and downright flattering proportions. (Like bomber jackets, harringtons are cut with a roomy yet cropped silhouette—see:menswear’s golden ratio). Typically, Harringtons are made from a lightweight fabric like poplin or gabardine, and come with elastic cuffs and hems. But in cooler months, lined versions can provide extra heft and insulation. They’ve got a preppy feel which makes them look great with a button-down shirt and slacks, but also ultra cool oversized with a graphic tee and baggy jeans. Baracuta Amazon J.Crew J.Crew Kapital Mr Porter Barbour Nordstrom Jackets built for withstanding hard manual labor might not sound like the kind of thing you’d wear for late-Spring cocktail hour. But it turns out they’re actually the perfect layer to enjoy just that. They’re often built with sturdy canvas or denim which provide structure and a beautiful drape, and just the right thickness to keep you warm in the evenings. Whether it’s a chore coat or a cropped style like the classic Dickies Eisenhower jacket, awork jacketis a time-tested silhouette that’s essentially a cheat code for looking more rugged and capable. Just make sure to opt for a style that doesn’t come with a heavy winterized lining. Knickerbocker Knickerbocker Isabel Marant Nordstrom Dickies Amazon Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Dig into menswear’s history books and you’ll notice one statement piece shared between some of the most swaggy guys to ever grace the earth: adenim jacket. From James Dean to Kendrick Lamar, trucker jackets and denim jackets have evolved far beyond their workwear origins to become veritable must-haves for every guy, style-conscious or not. Denim is the perfect medium for getting fits off during the temperate season and, unlike most other fabrics, it actually gets better with age. The denim jacket’s western connotations makes it perfect with worn-out jeans and cowboy boots, but it also looks great over a plain tee, a pair of chinos, and loafers (a.k.a., the perfect transitional outfit). Levi's Levi's Fullcount Blue In Green Maison Margiela Mr Porter Stussy Stussy Here’s a secret: sometimes the best jacket is actually just another shirt.Overshirtsare like Hannah Montana. (We listen and we do not judge.) You get the best of both worlds—extra weather protection of a jacket with the lightness of a shirt. It’s the way you choose to wear it that determines what the garment actually is, but typically, overshirts are cut in a relaxed silhouette—great for this golden era of baggy pants, but also for layering (it’s in the name, afterall). Overshirts often also come with a few pockets for whatever trinkets you happen to find on your vintage-hunting excursions, and often look almost exactly like a regular shirt. So if you’re wondering, yes, you can just wear another, looser button up over your existing button up. Filson Filson Stone Island Mr Porter Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Mr P Mr Porter Technical windbreakers and rain shells used to be reserved for the outdoorsy homies among us. You know, the guy whose IG main feed is nothing but mountain trails and camping. It makes sense: they’re lightweight and ultra-packable, and ideal for outdoor activities with uncertain weather forecasts. Off the trail, however, their utility is undervalued. Nowadays, brands are increasingly savvy about making gorp-y shells that not only look fly but don’t feel like you’re wearing a trash bag. Hell, some of them are even light enough to pack into themselves, so you can keep them easily on your person or in your workbag for when conditions change on a dime. Be sure to look for ones treated with water-resistant or water-repellent coatings to ensure the maximum value — and to get an all-around technical jacket that looks just as good as it performs.

    "title": "Burn Your Brown Dress Shoes",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. You can do so much better than brown dress shoes. Starthereinstead. Wedding season is fast approaching, bringing with it a litany ofstyle-related headaches. Invited to a ceremony with a ‘rustic formal’ dress code? Ignore it. In fact, consider this all the excuse you need to ignore any confounding,quirky-cute dress codesentirely—in the real world, there are only two pieces of fashion etiquette you need to adhere to. The first is obvious: don’t wear a white dress. The second flies a bit under the radar, but represents a faux pas no less devastating: don’t wear caramel-colored dress shoes. You know the type of shoes I’m talking about, even if you’ve never given them much thought; there are hundreds of Pinterest boards rife with these exact atrocities. (If I could slap them through the screen, I would.) Don’t want to take my word for it? Take it from my eagle-eyed colleague Eileen Cartter, who threw down the gauntlet a whole year ago inGQ’sdefinitive guide to the nuptials circuit. “I believe,” she declared then, “that all the caramel-brown dress shoes that I’ve seen grooms and their groomsmen wear with their navy suits are going to age the way the poofy bridal gowns of the ’80s and ’90s did: like milk.” Truer words have never been spoken. And though there are few hard-and-fast rules in menswear these days, this one of them. Beckett Simonon Beckett Simonon Alden Nordstrom What should you wear instead? Easy—simple blackdress shoes. Boring? Au contraire, brother. They’re classic, widely available, and work with every color of suit you care to name.Navy suit? Black shoes. Tan suit? Black shoes. Lime-green suit? Please, no—but also…black shoes. On the contrary, the mocha-hued monstrosities I’m railing against here break up the visual continuity of your outfits, immediately dragging eyes down to your feet. No matter how much you want to divert attention away from your mug, they’re not the solution. They’re also less formal (evenfundamentally unserious), and thus inappropriate for the occasion at hand: celebrating the everlasting union of your closest pals. Thom Browne SSENSE Allen Edmonds Nordstrom It’s not like you can never wear brown dress shoes again. The right pair will look incredible with a nubbylightweight blazerand billowycuffed trousers. But that’s an expert-level move best left to the pros, and, frankly, you’re probably trying to cruise through the wedding gauntlet on beginner mode, anyway. That’s completely fine—as long as you recognize that your sister’s wedding isn’t the time to test out tricks you haven’t mastered. I don’t mean to be heavy-handed, but I’m speaking from experience here. So learn from my mistakes, and those of countless guys before me: stick to black and you’ll be the sharpest guest at the party. If you can’t get the happy couple a decent gift, the least you can do is avoid ruining their photos. Mr P. Mr Porter Our Legacy SSENSE",

    "article_text": "“Well, this hatmight fit your style, sir.” I am at Lock & Co. Hatters at 6 St. James's Street in London. The store proudly claims to be the world's oldest hat shop and the world's34th-oldest family-owned business. It’s also “a Royal warrant holder,” whatever that means. The salesperson before me—an assistant manager named Maxwell, I’ll learn later—is holding out a gray cap that reminds me of the movieNewsies,or theBBC showPeaky Blinders,depending on which era (or cinematic mood) is more your cup of tea. I’m not sure what “style” of mine he’s referring to, exactly; I’m wearingjeans, aT-shirt, and a beat-up flannelwork coat. Maxwell, on the other hand, has style to spare, dressed in a sharpsuit, expensive spectacles, and a beret-esque flat cap worn cocked to one side of his head. On me, Maxwell’s outfit would look ridiculous, but something about his confidence—or maybe it’s simply his English accent—makes it seem as natural as a second skin. Itfit,in every meaning of the word. “I don’t really regard myself as having much style,” I confess to him, almost sheepishly. I look down at the cap he’s holding—I have yet to take it from him. An old skit byAdam Sandlerplays somewhere in the distance of my mind: “They're all gonna laugh at you!” But Maxwell’s voice, here in reality, brings me back. “Well, let’s see if we can do something about that, shall we?” I have neverbeen considered fashionable. Growing up, my clothes were mostly hand-me-downs from my half-siblings, or donations through the Catholic charity my parents and I were housed by when I was young and living in Boston. By the time we moved out to the woods in north-central Massachusetts, any “new” clothes I got came from the Salvation Army one town over from where we lived. I remember picking through racks of clothes with my ma, looking for something that would keep me warm without hurting her pocketbook. Now, I’d love to tell you that the secondhand (or sometimes third- or fourthhand) clothes still found a new life with me—that I altered them with fabric paint, or that my ma and I tailored them into new, exciting shapes and cuts. But we didn’t. Nor was I filled with jealousy over my classmates’ puffy Starter Jackets or name-brand sneakers. First, most of the other kids in the area where we lived didn’t have those things either. But even those that did? Clothes just never moved me in that way. There was never a deep emotional connection with style or fashion, especially not enough of one to inspire envy or desire. Clothes were practical. Functional. Nothing more. I wore heavy, rough clothes for work and chores. When I got a scholarship to a nearby boarding school at the age of 14, I packed a bag of hand-me-down button-ups and two old suit jackets that my father had outgrown. My classmates loaned me—and taught me how to knot—their ties. When I later picked up an interest in skateboarding, I didn’t long for Alien Workshop long-sleeve tees or DC shoes; I just started getting bigger clothes at the Salvation Army to allow for more body movement. The author wearing one of his once-signature flip brim hats. That was the closest I came to any type of style. I dressed like a skater throughout my teen years and into my 20s. When I worked at a motorcycle metal bar in San Francisco, my outfits remained the same, only blacker. Eventually, I took to wearing a flipped-brim baseball hat—West Coast punk style—which was a questionable fashion choice (especially for someone who grew up in New England) at 24, let alone at 28, or 31 when I moved back East and continued dressing like a Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater NPC well into my mid-30s. It wasn’t until I was approaching 40 that I realized something had to change. I was going for long walks more often than I was riding my board at that point. I was ordering liquor from the shelf, not the well. A woman I was dating—who would eventually become my wife—had won a war waged against my flipped brim hats (with the help of many far-too-honest friends, the closest I’ve ever come to knowing what an intervention feels like). Maybe it was time for an upgrade in other parts of my wardrobe too. Well, not an upgrade but more any attempt at trying at all. Now, If I'mbeing honest, I'd had a few moments like this in the past. Once, after a few too many Lone Stars in Houston, I impulse-bought a big, beautiful black Stetson in a cowboy store called Cavender's. After my purchase I made my way to the West Alabama Ice House, a great divey outdoor watering hole with metal fans that blow mist from melting ice blocks. It was a swelteringly hot day, but still I wore that hat, proud of my new accessory. When I walked into the place, I saw a large old-timer wearing a wide-brimmed cowboy hat sitting with his dog at the bar. The man looked like he hadn't moved from that barstool in 30 years, and he and I are the only folks wearing cowboy hats in the whole establishment. The man noticed me in the mirror as I walked by, and he gave me a nod. I love a good nod. Receiving a nod from other riders while on my BMX bike or skateboard—or during the brief stint in my 20s that I owned a motorcycle—often had the power to make my entire day. So a nod from a giant, hard-drinking cowboy? I was thrilled. Which is when I heard, “Hey there, Tex….” I turned around, despite never being called “Tex” in my entire life. The old timer is looking at me in the mirror, not even bothering to turn around. Still, the initial thrill from that nod is buzzing through my body. Is he about to buy me a beer? Ask me to sit down and take a shot with him? “It's on backwards.” I didn't understand, and I said as much. “I’m sorry?” “Your cowboy hat, Tex. You're wearing it backwards.” Somehow the old-timer's laughter expanded to fill the entire bar, despite it being outdoors. A few of the bartenders caught the whole exchange, and proceeded to call me \"Tex\" for the rest of the night. Needless to say, the cowboy hat didn’t stick. But theideaof a hat? There’s still something appealing about it to me. Like dipping your toes into the shallow end of the fashion pool, without fully jumping in. A few years had passed since the cowboy hat incident, and I found myself thinking of hats as an entryway into style once again. I thought about who I looked up to when I was growing up. Robert Redford. Paul Newman.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kidis still my favorite movie (which probably led to the situation in Houston, now that I think of it), but up there for me as well isThe Sting.Redford in the floppy, slightly oversized newsie cap. Newman often rocking caps in a similar style both on and off the screen. But before there were movie stars, there was my father, and before him, his own father. Both 100% Irish. Both often wore wool flat caps, which means I also tried to pull off this style of hat at different times in my life. Ten years old. Fifteen. Nineteen. Twenty-two. Twenty-eight. Thirty-two. Always just a stolen hat from my father's closet. It never worked. I always put the hat back after trying it on. To be honest, I spent most of my life doing my damnedest tonotseem like either man, but I think I finally might be old enough to pull one off. Which is howI found myself in London looking for the perfect hat—trying not to think about what my Catholic, IRA-supporting grandfather would make of my spending money on the wrong side of the Irish Sea. The popularity of flat caps amongst the working class, both in the UK and in Ireland, can be traced back to an Act of Parliament passed in 1571, which required all males over the age of six but below the rank of “gentleman” (i.e., excepting “maids, ladies, gentlewomen, noble personages, and every lord, knight, and gentleman of twenty marks land”) to wear woolen caps, described as “a cap of wool, thicked and dressed in England, made within this realm, and only dressed and finished by some of the trade of cappers,” on Sunday and holidays. Commonly called the “Cappers Act” or “Cap Act,” it was a thinly veiled attempt to boost the lagging British wool trade, and carried a fine “upon pain to forfeit for every day” one didn’t wear a cap. The law was repealed a mere 26 years later, but the hats that eventually evolved into flat caps had already become a part of the culture, remaining a beloved and practical staple of UK fashion ever since. It’s worth mentioning that the caps back then were referred to as “bonnets,” and that the Scots still call this style of cap a “bunnet” to this day. I’m sure my grandfather would also like me to mention that the late 1500s was around the time the British started to claim full English rule in Ireland—but at this point, we’re sailing into waters of both regional and fashion history that is well above my pay grade. In hindsight, it seems clear to me that having lost the Battle of the Flip Brim probably prompted me to start my new fashion journey with headwear. A hat still seemed like the easiest place to start. A phrase had been bouncing around in my head for a few weeks: “Dignity Era.” It’s what I wanted the back half of my life to look like, after a pretty egregious front half. What better a place to find a hat that matched that phrase than London? So I scoured England’s capital looking for the perfect hat. Camden Market seemed as good a place as any to start, flitting between the stalls with my friend, the comedian Kyle Kinane, who was in town to do a few shows. I explained my mission to Kyle as he watched me try on one hat after another. “I went through a big phase with those hats a while back,” Kyle shared as we munched on some free samples from the food stands. I remember that time, over a decade ago, when you could almost call the flat cap a signature staple of Kyle’s wardrobe. My friend Franz Nicolay—a man known for his hats—had said the same thing practically verbatim the day before. Franz was, I shit you not, also in London playing shows with his band the Hold Steady. It was as if the Ghost of Flat Caps Past and Future were guiding me on my journey. Kyle pointed at my full head of hair in between hats and said, “In a way, by wearing one of those things, you’re committing stolen valor against bald dudes.” An early contender in the search for a flat cap… …and a straw boater tried on as a joke. Kinane wasn’t the only one not keen on the idea. My wife was in London on business and I was tagging along. When I told her that I was looking for the perfect hat, and that it had turned into a new three-day journey walking around the markets and hat stores of London, she said, “It’ll age you by 20 years. I’m all for you not dressing like a sixth grader who smokes Camel Lights in the school restroom at 42, but maybe we don’t have to rush to Nursing Home Chic?” On the third day of hat hunting, now on my own, I started posting pics of me in the hats on my Instagram Stories—partially out of boredom, and partially because I didn’t trust my own taste. My friendBrian Abbottwho tends bar at Old Town in Manhattan and also spent years on the West Coast, DMed me, “You either die a punk rock hero or live long enough to buy one of those hats.” When I mentioned my wife’s resistance to my friendMikael Kennedy, he responded, “She’s right, my brother. You gotta be 70.” Other comments included, “The goal is to stay married, right?” and, “Are you joining a ska band?” Maybe the most insulting was when I jokingly tried on a straw boater hat with a blue bow ribbon and author Samantha Irby earnestly responded, “I love this, but it’s also giving barbershop quartet (which I also love, do not listen to me).” I was considering a foolish hat, sure, but a boater’s hat? I hadn’t completely lost my mind. But as many people had jokes—or earnest comments that made me seem completely off my rocker—so, too, did compliments start to trickle in. “I love the blue one.” Or, “The brown one is it,” followed quickly by, “No, wait!Thishat fits your face better.” People who were familiar with the UK gave shop recommendations. Which is how I found myself at Lock & Co. Hatters, trying on the hats that Maxwell pulled off the shelves for me, like we were in some magical boutique, except instead of potions or enchanted swords they were flat caps in all types of shapes, sizes, and color. While I was trying on ascot caps, coppolas, newsboy caps, and even a few panama hats and one skipper cap, I learned that Lock & Co., “home of hats since 1676,” claims to be the originator of the bowler hat. I also learned that a “a Royal warrant holder” is somebody who provides goods and/or services to the royal family. The shop I was in is the official “Hatter to the Prince of Wales”—now better known as King Charles III—and also had a royal warrant from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. (That is, until his death in 2021. Hats are apparently no longer needed once your body’s underground.) I posted pics of each hat to my Stories, and a flood of feedback came in, along with a bit of anticipation. “Why am I on the edge of my seat?” one person commented. “You’re only buying a hat!” I had taken to calling my journey The Great British Hat Hunt™️, but after close to four days of walking the city on the definition of a fool’s errand, it was time to make a decision, and it was clear Lock & Co.was the place to make my purchase. The three finalists of The Great British Hat Hunt™️. Three front-runners had emerged. There was the gray newsboy cap that Maxwell had handed me within moments of when I first walked in. The man was extremely good at his job, and it was probably the hat I myself most liked. Then there was a classic, wool green flat cap, which seemed to be the people’s choice. I had put the top three up to a vote, and “#2” was the #1 response by a mile. Lastly, there was a blue suede cap, which I cocked on the side of my head, the same way Maxwell wore his. I wasn’t jaunty enough—artistic enough—for this cap yet, but maybe I could grow into it. “Why don’t you take a little time to think on it,” Maxwell suggested. There was a bar called the Red Lion—reputedly London's second-oldest pub—next door. “There’s a Cornish Pale Ale, called Tribute, which I think you might like.” Maxwell was, of course, right. As I sipped on the fantastic beer, and the St. James's after-work crowd filled the Red Lion, I thought about which hatIwanted. If I was hoping to start my Dignity Era, I should make the choice myself. Not leave it to a crowdsourced decision, nor take the recommendation of a hat seller—no matter how good he is at his job. Which hat spoke to me? If fashion is an expression of self, what was it I thought I had to say? “You know, a lot of guys get into those hats, buy them, and then they sit in the back of their closet for the rest of their lives,” one comment came in. They weren’t wrong. But hell, even if that happened, like my buddy Mikael said, I can bring it out of the back of the closet and dust it off when I’m 70. I returned to Lock & Co., five minutes before close. “Did you make a decision?” Maxwell’s patience hadn’t wavered in the slightest. What a gem. “I have,” I said. Fashion is supposed to be an expression of self, and the truth is I’m still trying to figure out exactly who it is I am—or, better put, who I’m planning to be. Or, even better put, allowing myself to express myself in many different ways. Trying ’em on for size, if you will. “I’ll take all three.” Maxwell didn’t bat an eye. “Very good,” he said, and bagged the hats and had me out the door with a minute to spare. Savoring a brew in one of the winning caps. I put the gray cap on and walked back to the Red Lion. The after-work crowd had doubled in my absence. There were men in suits and blue-collar workers drinking pints and laughing. I sat down in the corner, not so much trying the hat out as feeling how I felt in the hat. And, frankly, I felt good. I sat up a little straighter and cocked the hat to one side of my head. I’m no Redford or Newman, but I got a few nods while ordering another pint from the bar. Nobody called me “Tex”—or whatever its Brit equivalent might be. I would go on to bring all three caps back to America with me. My wife still doesn’t like ’em, but she admits they’re better than my flipped-brim baseball hats. I even wore the jaunty one to a wedding recently (yes, I was flying solo that evening). I managed to stay in it the whole night, and liked the way I looked in photos after. I have dipped my toes in the shallow end of the pool that is fashion and lived to tell the tale. Maybe my Dignity Era is just beginning. But before all that, I was simply sipping on a Tribute at the Red Lion, when a man walked in leaning on a polished Blackthorn cane with a metal tip. “Now that looks dignified,” I thought to myself. Maybe it’s time to find myself a walking stick.",

    "title": "Why Harlem Is the Menswear Capital of the World",
    "article_text": "For the first time in more than two decades, this year’s Met Costume Institute spring exhibition and Gala focus exclusively on menswear. TitledSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style, the exhibit explores the stylistic inheritance of Black dandyism with a showcase of ensembles byGrace Wales Bonner, Foday Dumbuya,Virgil Abloh, andPharrell Williams, among others. Promising to be a jewelry box of drip, the show situates contemporary menswear in a context that stretches back to the 18th century. Gold L’Enchanteur accessories and sequined Theophilio trousers will appear in conversation with the zoot suits of the Savoy Ballroom and an ornate purple livery worn by an enslaved man in Maryland in the 1840s. How the garments relate to one another, forming a constellation of Black cultural and sartorial identity, is a story largely written, according to the panel at Tuesday's preview conversation, in Harlem. “Harlem is Black culture incarnate,” said panelist and Harlem-born bandleader Dandy Wellington. “It’s where the hoi polloi are us.” Monica L. Miller Dandy Wellington Hosted at 125th Street’s historic Victoria Theater, the conversation brought togetherSuperfineguest curator Monica L. Miller, whose 2009 book inspired the show, with leaders of Harlem’s contemporary creative scene: National Black Theatre executive artistic director Jonathan McCrory, fashion icon Lana Turner, and Wellington in a characteristic double-breasted waistcoat. In focus was Harlem’s role as a nexus of Black style, art, and culture: a place where residents have invented and remixed fashion as a form of self-definition and power. “People imagined 7th Avenue being our own Champs-Élysées,” said Turner, who was raised in Harlem. She recalls the parades of debonair ballroom-goers sailing down the avenue in the evenings. Today, Turner sees the tradition upheld in shows of Sunday morning finery: “It doesn’t really matter whether you go to church or not, but if you’re out on the street on a Sunday morning, you should pay a little attention.” For McCrory, personal dress acts as a connective tissue between the wide-ranging histories of a diasporic culture. “We’re creating portals with the way we adorn ourselves,” he said, highlighting his vintage jewelry. “I’m holding my grandmother close to me, I’m holding a warrior shaman onto me.” Jonathan McCrory Lana Turner The panel’s reflections on style as an expression of both legacy and identity touch at the thematic heart of the exhibition, which opens May 10. “Superfine,” said Miller, refers not only to a physical material but to a “mood and attitude related to feeling especially good, fantastic even, in clothes that profoundly express the self.” After thelong-awaited “Men Gala”theme was announced in the fall, Costume Institute curator Andrew Bolton toldGQ’s Samuel Hine that the show seeks to redress the racial imbalance in menswear scholarship at the museum, which has acquired 150 pieces by designers of color since 2020. The conversation was one of a number of events that will bring the exhibit’s themes and stories to life beyond the front steps of the Met’s 5th Avenue home. Anotherpreview conversationwill be held on April 24 at The Billie Holiday Theatre in Brooklyn.",

    "title": "‘The Studio’ Is Bringing Pratfall Comedy Back",
    "article_text": "The Studiois a chatty show. Averychatty show. Each scene comes at the audience with a torrent of dialogue at screwball pace and impeccable comic timing. That energy is matched by great directing, from starSeth Rogenand his longtime creative partner Evan Goldberg. Inspired by Robert Altman’sThe Playerand its extended opening shot,almost every scene inThe Studiois done in a single, dynamic long take, with the camera constantly moving and whipping around to stage the action and enliven the comedy. It often feels like watching a great high-wire juggling act, appearing chaotic and balletic simultaneously. Then, at the climax, Seth Rogen—playing Matt Remick, the likably buffoonish, newly-appointed head of Continental Studios—has a baseball cap thrown at his face by Ron Howard and trips over a snack cart full of M&M’s and pretzels in a pitch-perfect pratfall. It’s Rogen as both studio exec and circus clown. Physical comedy doesn’t need any defense. The Pope is Catholic and a guy slipping on a banana peel is funny. It’s the lowest form of comedy, but almost certainly the oldest, thepurest. Low does not mean easy, though, and there’s a reason names like Chaplin and Keaton loom large. They were artists, filmmakers, performers, who understood the inherent tensions that make physical comedy, and slapstick especially, work on screen. Slapstick exists at the intersection between the shocking surprise of violence and the acknowledged trickery of performance. Its name is derived from the slap stick—two wooden slats hinged together, like a clapper—used in 16th century commedia dell'arte to lend loud sounds to onstage punches and pratfalls. A character tripping over is the surprise, the falseness transforms the tragedy of violence into comedy, and if you get the staging and timing just right, the audience laughs. Rogen is better known for onscreen improv comedy in theApatovianmode, which involves throwing a lot of funny bits at the wall and seeing what sticks. Sometimes that’s included physical comedy, particularly during action sequences, but as he joked to me in an interview last month, “Early on in our careers, our movies were generally shot with two or three cameras pointing at us, and generally actors were standing there and not moving in any way, shape, or form.”The Studiomarks a departure for Rogen into a far more cinematic style of comedy filmmaking. Rather than set up simple scenes for actors to throw around lines, the long-take shooting style of the show necessitated a lot more planning. In particular, not having the benefit of editing to adjust the timing on jokes required that Rogen company carefully think through every line and every movement. Episodes of the show are structured as a series of escalations. The show’sWhiplash-like, rat-a-tat jazz score keeps the rhythm, while Remick’s hopeless attempts at wrangling his warring desires—to make real art, and also not get fired—get more and more absurd, until everything finally comes to clash. That’s when the show often deploys its moments of great slapstick. As the scripts layer comedic setups toward a cacophonous series of sudden payoffs, the action crescendos into pratfalls. In the second episode, Remick’s intrusion on the set of a Sarah Polley movie results in constant screw ups in her own attempt at a long take. Running through the set after one particularly egregious fuckup, Remick bumps into a crew member and trips over a side table, falling on his face, and winds up with a bloody nose. “Can you believe how hard he just fell?” Greta Lee asks, to which Polley, dead serious, responds, “Yes, it was very funny. Go, go, go.” Only a few minutes later, having screwed up the take again, Rogen is once again running through the set and out the door to get to his car, bumping into a production assistant who spills iced coffee all over him. It’s a moment they had to film upwards of twenty times due to a malfunctioning camera attachment, changing shirts every time. Worth it for the comedy. Rogen’s face-off with Howard happens in the third episode. In this week's episode, Rogen tackles a crazedOlivia Wildeto stop her destroying a reel of exposed film negative and the two roll down a hill for a comical length of time before co-star Ike Barinholtz gets hit by a car. Later in the season, Rogen collapses on tables, and somehow trips over a balloon string. In another episode, Barinholtz gets a door to the face before throwing a breakfast burrito and causing a hilariously timed on-set catastrophe, complete with Wilhelm Scream. Other guest stars join in on the physical comedy fun in future episodes, as well. These moments are all brief, but never gratuitous or lazy. They’re punctuation, like exclamation points at the ends of long, exciting sentences, tying everything together with a laugh. IfThe Studio, in its escalating cringe-comedy, resemblesCurb Your EnthusiasmandThe Larry Sanders Show, it sets itself apart in its filmmaking. Rather than let the writing and performance do the bulk of the work, the actors standing around, not moving much, Rogen and Goldberg leverage the camera itself to physicalize the space and the comedy. It’s a perfect case of form meeting content, and fertile ground for excellent slapstick.The Studiois also great comedy filmmaking in the lineage of Ernst Lubitsch, Mel Brooks, ZAZ, and the Farrelly brothers, who all understood that when words fail, there’s nothing like a guy falling down.",

    "title": "The One Thing That Would Make ‘The Pitt’ Better",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the weekly newsletter Tap In, GQ senior associate editor Frazier Tharpe’s final word on the most heated online discourse about music, movies, and TV.Sign up here to get it free. When most people are recommendingThe Pittto a friend—and, if the timeline is any indication of real viewership, a lot of you have been—the go-to reference point isER, for obvious reasons. It’s Noah Wyle scrubbing back in to the procedural format that made him a household name in the ‘90s, even re-teaming with one ofER’s showrunners, John Wells—but in a series that feels more distinctly 2025 in its brutality, even as its pacing hearkens back to that old network-TV feeling. (I guess—I’ve never watchedER.) ButThe Pittgot me on the bandwagon early, and kept me more locked in and committed than any other medical series ever has, because of its central conceit: The fifteen-episode season covers a single emergency-room shift, one increasingly hellish hour at a time. As the emergencies stack up with a relentless, often savage pace, the show I was reminded of most was24, an early-aughts gem that helped redefine what network TV could do—and whose peak-era seasons still feel fresher and more engrossing than most of the sludge streamers throw out today. Over the course of its first season,The Pittmore than lived up to the promiseI saw in the pilot, and with a second season already greenlit and lightly conceptualized (Pitt crew vs Independence Day, lfg), I’m leaving season 1 with very few notes for improvement. Except one. To fully embrace its real-time chaos,The Pittneeds a24-style countdown clock. Look, I know one ofThe Pitt’scampaign promises is itsrealism. The story may be as melodramatic and as low-key conventional as TV drama was in 1994—that’s kind of the secret of the show’s appeal—but thestorytellingis as no-frills as possible. No opening theme song, no pomp-and-circumstance endings, just a slow fade to black and roll credits. What I’m proposing would not be a big upset to the vibe. We don’t need the full-on doom-intoning seconds-tickdown that became24’ssignature. But those episode-ending and act-break bookends weren’t 24’s only trick. Real ball-knowers remember that throughout any given hour, in place of the split-screen on occasion, the time would just flash at the bottom of the screen just to give viewers an anchor of where we were on the clock. And for super-heavy moments, like the loss of a fan-favorite character, the big counter would tick silently, the better to let viewers sit with the gravity of what they’d just witnessed. Right now,Pittepisodes end unceremoniously—almost too much so. The conclusion of each episode almost comes as a surprise—like “Oh,thisis where we’re ending? Ok.” That doesn’t matter much when the last scene is Dr. Robby crumpled in a corner in the throes of a meltdown or Dr. McKay getting arrested, but when it’s, say, Dr. Collins breaking up a fight between a pro-life mother, her pregnant daughter and her interloping sister, that’s a little less sexy. A few silent seconds ticking away would help tie a (still-unfussy) bow on it, and flashing that clock at the bottom of the screen every now and then would go a long way to casually making things even more tense at any point in any given episode. Don’t ask me why, but time makes us anxious, and time is one ofThe Pitt’smain gimmicks. Why not lean a little harder into it? A flashing clock just inherently ratchets up adrenaline. My mind is already spinning around the different ways knowing exactly what time it is could enhance season 2’s planned July 4 conceit; just imagine the seconds ticking down on an hour when the inevitably disgraced Dr. Langdon makes an uninvited but still welcome return to the ER when he’s needed most. Or when Dana comes back to man the ship, six or seven episodes after being absent long enough for viewers to believe she’s really gone.24used to make a meal out of dramatic encores for previously departed fan favorites too. Incorporating some more DNA of its network forebears could be the hack that makesThe Pittjust as generational as those shows were.",

    "title": "‘The Pitt’ Finale: In Praise of Dr. Robby, the Ache at the Heart of a Hospital Hit",
    "article_text": "There's a small moment near the end of episode 13 ofThe Pittthat I’ve gone back to several times since it aired two weeks ago. I keep going back to it because—actually, you know what? Let me start this differently. Let me start this with this: There are a lot of things that I love aboutThe Pitt, Max’s brilliant medical drama, whose first season concluded last night. I love the premise of the show—we follow one medical staff during one shift at an under-resourced emergency room in Pittsburgh, with each hour-long episode serving as an actual hour in their day. It is a clean and concise and compelling set-up. (Incidentally, it’s also an elevating one. StructuringThe Pittthis way removes the case-of-the-week network procedural feel the show could’ve had, and positions it alongside shows likeThe Wire, andThe Sopranos, andSuccession, which is always a good place to be.) And I love the cast—Shanaba Azeez, Patrick Ball, Isa Briones, Taylor Dearden, Fiona Dourif, Gerran Howell, Tracy Ifeachor, Katherine LaNasa, Supriya Ganesh and a handful more all give wonderful, nuanced performances in what I assume will become career-defining roles. (I found myself saying “Okay, that's my favorite character on the show” at some point about literally every single person I saw on screen during these first 15 episodes.) And I love the way the writing and the acting and the directing all marry together, each component magnifying and heightening the other two. (I greatly enjoy the thing that happens occasionally in each episode where two people are having a conversation in one area, then that conversation finishes, and the two people wander off, and the camera just pans over and picks up a new person walking by and follows them to whatever conversation it is that they’re about to have. It takes the overwhelming, relentless nature of the emergency room and places it right into the chest of the audience.) And I even love, for a final example, the way the show tips its hat to medical dramas past. (The only people who seem to not love this aspect of the show are the people running the Michael Crichton estate, which attempted to sue Warner Bros, claiming thatThe Pittwas an unauthorized derivative work ofER, an argumentThe Pittproved baseless about ten minutes into its first episode.) Again: There are a lot of things that I love aboutThe Pitt. A lot. The thing I love the most aboutThe Pitt, though—the thing that takes it from being a very good show and turns it into something truly special—isn’t a thing at all. It’s a person. More specifically, it’s this person: That's Noah Wyle’s Dr. Michael “Robby” Rabinovitch, the guy in charge of running the emergency room and also one of the most captivating TV characters of the past decade. I tried for the past several weeks to pinpoint precisely what it is that makes Dr. Robby so affecting. I thought, briefly, that it was because he's tall. Tall people feel important. Tall people feel impactful. If a tall person says something, I tend to believe it, and I tend to trust it, unless that tall person is Dwight Howard, who has always seemed to me like the type of guy who would lie to you about something unimportant for no reason at all. There was also a time, even briefer than that, where I thought that it was because he has the beard of a man who only has a beard because it’s not worth it to spend time shaving, not the beard of a man who has a beard because it looks cool, which is a trait I have always found appealing. I also thought—and this is the one that I’d settled on for the longest—that it was because of how paternal he is; the way he guides all the little younger-doctor ducklings around, gently correcting them when they need to be gently corrected and sternly correcting them when they need to be sternly corrected; the way he dotes compliments on the underappreciated support staff every chance he gets; the way he exudes an all-caps AUTHORITY FIGURE-ness while somehow also exuding an extremely warm YOU WILL ALWAYS BE SAFE AROUND ME-ness. I thought that's what it was. But it’s not. Nor is it the timbre of his voice (knowing but never condescending), or the way he tilts his eyebrows up when he's trying to decipher the meaning behind something someone has just said to him, or the consideration in his eyes. What it is, is this: It’s the ache. There's an ache in Dr. Robby—a profound, undeniable, inescapable ache. It’s largely due to the countless patients he’s seen pass away under his care during his years in the emergency room, but it’s catalyzed in season one by the lingering guilt he feels about having not been able to save his mentor during thepandemic. (Season one takes place on the anniversary of his mentor’s passing.) It informs everything he does, and everything he says. It’s why he knows exactly what to tell fourth-year medical student Dennis Whitaker when Whitaker loses his first patient. And it’s why he responds the way he responded when Dr. Heather Collins tells him about the abortion she chose to have when she was pregnant with his child. And it’s why in episode 13—when Jake, his surrogate stepson, lashes out at him for failing to save Jake's girlfriend’s life when she's brought to the hospital as one of the many victims ofa mass shooting, and the weight of everything Dr. Robby's carrying inside him finally becomes unmanageable—he breaks. The way that scene plays out is: Dr. Robby and Jake are standing in a makeshift morgue, because Jake wants to see the body of his now-deceased girlfriend. As he stands there staring at her, he asks Robby why he wasn’t able to save her. The circumstances of the situation—Robby not being able to save a person he was personally connected to—trigger in his brain the memory of not being able to save his mentor during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. He begins to spiral. “We’ve had dozens of shooting victims,” says Robby, grasping desperately at the last strand of ribbon tethering him to sanity. “You’ve seen it. The fact that we’ve saved as many people as we have is… a fucking miracle.” “But you didn’t save Leah,” responds Jake, his voice soaked with pain. And the strand snaps. “No… no I didn’t, ” says Robby, his eyes now suddenly wet, his words beginning to tumble out of his mouth like cars piling up in a freeway crash as he delivers the rest of his lines through tears. “And I don’t know how many people I’ve helped today but I can tell you every other person who has died. There was a man named Mr. Spencer who died in front of his children… and an 18-year-old who… who was brain dead from a fentanyl overdose. And a guy with a heart condition, and a little girl who drowned trying to save her sister…” And that's when he gets to Leah. “And I’m gonna remember Leah long after you’ve forgotten her.” And as soon as he says that out loud—as soon as he finally allows himself the tiniest possible space to process what he’s experiencing—he immediately regrets it. Because despite the fact that in the course of this day he’s been stretched and pulled and torture-racked more than anyone should ever have to endure, he still believes that all of the available grace in that moment is owed to Jake, not to himself. “Oh fuck,” he says, fully past the abyss, realizing he’s moments away from cratering and not wanting Jake to be there when he does. “Oh fuck! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! You gotta go, man!You gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go, you gotta go…” He ushers Jake out of the room, hands Jake off to a passing nurse for her to take him away, then closes the door, and then sits on the floor and cries uncontrollably. What a scene it is. What a devastating, dazzling, incredible scene it is. And tucked away inside of it, that's where that small moment is that I mentioned at the start of this essay. It’s after he’s absorbed the blow from Jake (which is so piercing that it causes Robby literally to wince), and after he’s given his unbelievable monologue where he recalls the patients of his who died earlier in the day. It’s when he gets Jake into his wheelchair (Jake got hit in the leg by some shrapnel during the mass shooting), rolls him out into the open area, and then hands him off to the passing nurse. It’s hard to catch, but if you turn the volume up you can hear pretty clearly him say to the nurse, “Can you put him back in his bed please?” He is dangling off the edge of Earth, nothing but empty desolation in front of him, and still: “Can you put him back in his bed please?” Not a demand. Not a yell. Not even a curtness. A request with a helpless and hopeless “please” tacked onto the end of it. Again: It’s a small thing. But it’s only a small thing in practice. It’s a gigantic thing in theory. We have, for the past however long, been inundated with TV characters who have taken the hurt that they’ve felt, or the fear that they’ve felt, or the shame that they’ve felt, and used it as an excuse to hurt others. InThe Pitt, Dr. Robby—and, by extension and through example, those under him—Dr. Robby uses it as the inspiration for empathy. Even when that empathy precedes his own ruination. It’s heartbreaking to watch. But beautiful to see.",

    "title": "The Real-Life Diet of Stephen Malkmus, Who Likes One Shot of Tequila Before the Gig",
    "article_text": "Welp, it’s finally happening. Stephen Malkmus, king of indie rock, slacker dad of the century, is finally getting a gut. It’s only a small belly, he clarifies, but nevertheless—Father Time comes for us all. The frontman of Pavement, Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks, andThe Hard Quartetis calling us from the back of a tour bus stationed outside Union Transfer in Philly, where the Quartet will be performing cuts from their stellar self-titled 2024 debut. From there, they’ll head to Brooklyn, whereMalkmuswill have a homecoming of sorts, having recently snagged an apartment with his partner in the Chinatown neighborhood of Manhattan. Between the gut, the New York digs, permanent residence inChicagoafter almost two decades in Portland, and life on a bus, things are still changing for Malkmus as he quietly approaches retirement age. “I'm more used to taking a couple of vans, one with gear, one with bodies of the band, and then driving four hours each day, maybe finding something weird to eat and listening to music together in a communal way or zoning out,” he explains. Back then, before gigs, he would roam around cities looking for cheap barbecue or something else to quell his stomach. Now? He hangs out on the bus, looking for a nearby coffee shop and something light to coat his gut before indulging in a small amount of alcohol; before each gig, he’ll take a shot of tequila orwhiskey, something to quiet the nerves and keep the cobwebs from settling. This boozy treat aside, Malkmus’s diet is pretty straightforward. He and his partner do a lot of cooking; his kids love carbonara, he loves turning roasted chicken dinners into taco lunches. Snacks are chips or leftovers, though he doesn’t always indulge. Sparkling waters are procured by the dozens, and though he may be navigating the New York grocery-store experience more than ever before, nothing can get in the way of La Croix diehards getting their fix. (My wife and I routinely put away at least a dozen a week, turning the heavy lift up four flights of stairs into a fitness competition.) Malkmus is one of the easiest guys to talk to, the perfect blend of self-deprecating, astute, and endlessly funny.GQcaught up with the rock legend to chat about The Hard Quartet, Alex Ross Perry’s buzzy meta-documentaryPavements, and, of course, how he maintains that slim frame. Stephen Malkmus: It's young. It's young and vibrant. College-aged, just a freshman. It's going fine. Yeah, there's always a little bit of ‘What did I get myself into?,’ at least for me, and I think everyone feels that way, unless you’re a dedicated road dog or something. I'm with new people and their friends and stuff. We share some mutuals, but there are different people backstage and stuff. It's kind of interesting. I'm worried. I don’t takenootropicsorlion’s maneand I'm not a gym guy. But maybe you should have people like me to represent in theGQdemographic. The real ones. This time around, yeah. We’re on a bus. It's maybe a little more expensive. I'm more used to taking a couple of vans, one with gear, one with bodies of the band, and then driving four hours each day, maybe finding something weird to eat and listening to music together in a communal way or zoning out. When you wake up, you're in front of a venue and you crawl half formed out of a puddle and then quickly form into yourself over the next hour trying to find coffee or whatever. Some people are better at it than others, and some people probably drink more and they're worse at it. There are people on this tour that brought their pajamas. They have little coffee units. If the weather's nice, it's good. We started in the Mid-Atlantic in some nice college towns. Atlanta was nice. Sometimes you have a car and now you can take Ubers, but back in the day there was no rideshare thing. You'd be stuck. I’d try to rent a car. I would just drive around Tulsa and look at the architecture or something by myself, get away from the band, maybe go find a cool cheap-eats place, barbecue or something. It’s still possible with the bus, but I’m more likely just to stick around the venue. There’s a balance to it. Maybe it’s a subconscious thing. I just can't really eat french fries and burgers over and over. I love them. Barbecue and fried food I'll devour as well. I have no guilt and I don't feel it or anything. I'm skinny, basically. I’m getting a tiny belly, finally, now that I'm almost 60, so there must be some subconscious thing that tells me it’s time to have vegetables or tofu. I almost don’t have to think about it. Not really. Maybe. I mean, I like chips and at home, but when you eat at home, you're just more in control. It's just healthier. Even if it’s from the most basic supermarket store—that a GQ man shouldn’t eat from—it's still better for you. I eat chips and when I get hungry I'm just looking around, digging into leftovers; things that are not too gnarly. It's pretty basic, dude. There aren’t many surprises. I had nothing to do with it. I just like sparkling water. I’ll have San Pellegrino or La Croix or something. I like some whiskey or tequila. I like to take one shot before I go on stage and shake out the cobwebs. I saw a whole roasted chicken on there. That's kind of nice. Jim, the drummer, has in the past asked for organic vegetables and even raw meat to be cooked, because sometimes he makes food on a hot plate. We’re sort of basic. My partner likes La Croix. There are Italian ones that are great and I like Topo Chicos for the different bubbles. I like those more than she does. They're smaller bubbles or something. But she’s a pamplemousse La Croix drinker. I like Polar. It has some weirder flavors, just to spice it up. They have better packaging. It looks a little more appetizing. At a certain point I was sort of burnt out on it all after 15 years. I don’t know about much in Chicago. We eat at home a lot. We don't have expense accounts and we got kids so it's a lot of cooking. We rarely get takeaway. We’ll maybe eat out for dinner once a week, lunch once or twice a week. Oh yeah, yeah. We love that. That's from the Zuni Cafe Cookbook, I think. It's an automatic, you can always make that. Maybe you don't have ricotta in the refrigerator, but almost everyone has frozen peas and bacon and parmesan and pasta. You're checking to see if the ricotta has green on it from the last time. We roast chickens once a week and then the next day I will often fry it with onions and make tacos, just crisp the shit out of it and make USA tacos. That's comfort food. They're not Trumpy. Yeah, I walk. We have an exercise bike in the house in Chicago. It gets snowy and you don't want to move sometimes and I'll ride that for 45 minutes watching a pirated TV show or something, likeWhite Lotus. Then I walk the dog. That's an hour. I play tennis. That's my main older guy exercise. I can do that without even feeling like I'm exercising because you sweat your ass off. Then I do yoga, too. The one close to me is this hot yoga studio. I did that a long time ago, so I bought their intro package. This yoga feels like it’s pretty much for addicts, recovering addicts, and addictive personalities because it's so intense and so hot. You just suffer pretty much for 60 of the 90 minutes. You feel really good afterwards, but you're also fucking beat up like you’ve been in a dryer. But it's also kind of awesome. I just can't really vouch for it a hundred percent. It's not for everyone. I almost don't want to admit I'm the Bikram hot yoga guy, but I do like it. I would love it if it was like 10 degrees cooler. If it came from a different tropic of India, just a little further north, would have been good. Matt [Sweeney, Hard Quartet guitarist] would have a lot of opinions about that. He was involved with Superiority Burger and stuff like that. It would be with a New York thing, I think. I hang around below Canal Street.Dimes Squareis basically my office, dude. Just kidding. But I have an apartment near there. Everyone likes dumplings and they're cheap and rock and roll is cheap and everyone loves rock—not everyone loves rock and roll. They love good rock and roll. Everyone loves music. Music’s cheap. Dumplings are cheap and we could just do something fun. It would be with North Dumpling, the one on Essex. The ladies there would just be like, “What?” It's a real small little operation there. No one would be able to get in and it's all high school kids because it's cheap. He had to bow out. It was too competitive. I still do it, but I don't do it hard. In the early 2000s there were four years where I was actually winning everything and that becomes addictive. It was variance, it wasn't like I was so good. It happens with gamblers too. You don't want someone to go in the casino for the first time and put a silver dollar in a slot machine and get three sevens because they'll be chasing that high into bankruptcy and addiction. I realized that after a while. You can grind your ass off and win some of these games, but it was a lot of luck and once I realized that I backed off and I just let the computer pick my team. But doing baseball this year, I don’t recognize as many players. I know who Ohtani and some of the big players are, but the drop off is pretty fast after the stars. I picked Soto. He’s on one of my teams. I got Lindor on a team. Vientos, too. And a guy named Winkler [Jesse Winker], but I might have to drop him. No, I never really liked them. I stuck with the Dodgers. I also just liked the teams that were good. In the late seventies I was into, perversely, the Milwaukee Brewers. They had players like Paul Molitor and Robin Yount. I liked that they were called the Brewers. They just seemed weird to me. I also liked the Pirates back in the ‘We are Family’ era when they were the most vibey team in the world and their uniforms were really cool. That's kind of how I rolled. I liked the Dodgers, but I never liked the Yankees and I liked the Red Sox more than the Yankees. I learned to despise the Red Sox too as time went on. I don't like the Braves. I'm more of a hater, I guess. I don't like the Cubs. I like the Mets, but some teams give me bad feelings. The Giants don't give me bad feelings, but I don't really like 'em.That's how it works. I always feel like home is where my bands were first appreciated more than other places, and I always felt at home there. Most bands might say that if they're just talking about getting a good guarantee and playing bigger rooms, but I really did feel like that's where I lived when the Pavement stuff started. There's current day concert footage and maybe some backstage stuff, but there aren’t interviews. There are some other kinds of gags that we're in, but it's sort of like we're justthere. We're not acting. We're not even supposed to know the camera's there. That's sort of how I treated it. I don't know what the final edit will look like. If Matador was there and they said, ‘Steve, we’re going out,’ I would go with them. They go out on so many meals. That's basically what they do. That's what being a record label is, as far as I can tell—it’s just eating good food. I would maybe try to go with them wherever they went to get free food and talk to them, or I would get sushi. Something light, really, something that I feel good eating. Yeah. You don't really want to, but sometimes I've made the mistake of going to the steakhouse with Matador before the show and getting theMad Menmartini or something, and then you just focus on making it through. You survive instead of thrive.",

    "title": "Why Rolex’s New Land-Dweller Is Such a Big Deal",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterBox + Papers,Cam Wolf’s weekly deep dive into the world of watches.Sign up here. Rolex is famously known as one of the most conservative watch brands in the industry—and rightfully so. Their steady hand on the wheel is at least partially responsible for the Crown routinely lapping its competitors. Clientslikethat Rolex is unchanging: it means the Day-Date, Submariner, and Daytona that Lyndon Johnson, James Bond, and Paul Newman, respectively, wore decades ago are not all that different from the ones they themselves are buying in 2025.That long lineage is what made last week’s debut of the Land-Dweller,only the brand’s second new collection since 2013, such a mammoth deal. Rolex, which typically counts new color dials and a couple of millimeters trimmed on or off as novel, revolutionized everything for the new Land-Dweller. On a surface level, the Land-Dweller is completely distinct in the Rolex catalog. The case is new, the bracelet is new, and the way these interact is also unique among the current pieces. If we got evenoneof these updates in any other year, it would have been a big deal. Last week, we got all the aesthetic tinkeringandthe Crown just happened to rethink the two-plus-century-old mechanism that’s still used by basically every watchmaker in Switzerland. “Rolex had something really innovative this year,” said Paul Boutros, the Head of Americas for Phillips auction house, “and it'll take a lot of time for the majority of people to understand how significant what they put out is.” Well, how rude. I haven’t even introduced you two. The Land-Dweller, in case you’ve been phoneless doing ayahuasca withAaron Rodgers while he teases the Pittsburgh Steelers, is Rolex’s brand new model. This is the third in the Crown’s lineup for Dwellers of all stripes: those who attend to the Sea or the Sky both have dedicated watches. The Land-Dweller is meant for those shuffling around our familiar terroir. Or, as Rolex epically puts it, “The Oyster Perpetual Land-Dweller is designed for those well-grounded men and women who build their own destinies, seeing opportunity in every moment.” While the watch’s design shares similarities with several hype watches of this decade—the Patek Philippe Nautilus, Audemars Piguet Royal Oak, and even Vacheron Constantin’s more recently reintroduced, but just as sexy, 222—it takes after Rolex designs dating all the way back to 1969. Bloomberg’s Chris Rovzar, in a rare behind-the-scenes look inside Rolex, detailed that the Land-Dweller project started five years ago when “the office of general management” disseminated a brief outlining what they wanted in the new model. The brief cited two watches specifically, according to Rovzar: a 1969 Rolex that used quartz and a 1974 variation of the Datejust with a bracelet very similar to the one on today’s Land-Dweller. “It is important to say that the new watch is not a revival,” Rolex head of heritage Christophe Carrupt toldBloomberg. “But it is inspired by the DNA of the brand.” While Boutros believes the magnitude of what Rolex is doing with the Land-Dweller might take time to sink in, it seems that the design made an immediate impact. At least it has among astute observers like Paul Altieri, founder and CEO of Bob's Watches, which specializes in Rolex pieces. “It’s one of the most significant departures Rolex has made in years,” he wrote me over email. “The case design is bolder and more angular than anything in the current lineup, which breaks from the brand’s traditionally conservative approach.” The distinct shape of the case is a classic watchmaking strategy to draw attention to the innovations buried inside. (Think of the TAG Heuer Monaco, introduced in 1969. Its big square design was meant to tell customers that there was something novel inside, too—in that case, one of the first automatic chronographs ever put on the market.) When Rolex was first using these blockier designs in the 1970s it was mainly for its Oysterquartz line, which featured a movement that was totally novel to the Crown at the time. Now, Rolex is re-introducing this shape just as it stamps another achievement in watchmaking. But before we get there… For Rolex, the bracelets are just as iconic as the watches. The brand is known for three: the standard Oyster that comes on a large majority of its sport (or “professional,” in Rolex parlance), the pretty five-link Jubilee most associated with the Datejust, and the Day-Date’s signature Presidential. The Land-Dweller is adding a whole new bracelet to the current catalog. Rolex calls this new design the “Flat Jubilee.” Each row on the “regular” Jubilee is comprised of five components: two longer outer pieces and three beaded internal links. The new “Flat Jubilee” is, in my opinion, great looking but, during my appointment at Watches and Wonders, the Rolex representatives showed me what makes it even cooler. If you want a preview of the new bracelet, anyone who owns a Datejust can basically find it on their existing watch. If you simply look at the underside of the standard Jubilee, you’ll find its flat Land-Dwelling sister there. What’s even more special about the bracelet is the way it flows straight into the new case. The Land-Dweller is what’s known as an “integrated bracelet.” This means that the new Flat Jubilee hooks directly into the case without the use of lugs (those arms that typically poke out from the four outermost corners of other watches and hook onto a bracelet). This is another big-deal move from Rolex because it puts the brand firmly into competition with its blazing-hot contemporaries. “The integrated bracelet gives it a more contemporary, almost sport-luxury feel—think Royal Oak or Nautilus territory, but in a Rolex way,” Altieri said. Dynapulse, dynapulse, dynapulse—even if it weren’t a revolutionary little piece of watch tech, I’d still have to give Rolex credit for coming up with ridiculously fun names to say. (The last innovation Rolex made in this arena is called the Chronergy escapement.) OK, so this is the section where we get real nerdy, but it’s also the most important piece of the entire Land-Dweller pie, so stick with me to the last bite. “It’s huge to create an all new escapement on their own and now put out a watch with it,” said Boutros. That is massive for a big brand.” The biggest update in Rolex’s new movement, the caliber 7135, is to the escapement. What’s an escapement? It is the part of the movement that meters out power to the rest of the watch, allowing it to tell accurate time. Once upon a time, the British watchmaker Thomas Mudge invented what is known as the Swiss level escapement. The mechanism uses a small fork that seesaws back and forth. Each time one prong of the fork lifts, it enables a toothy gear (the escapement wheel) to tick the seconds hand forward. Mudge invented this in the1750s,and nearly 300 years later, it’s still the mechanism nearly every mechanical watch is built upon. The Swiss lever escapement is clearly effective, but not without its drawbacks. The chief issue is that the fork has to slide in and out of the gear so quickly and frequently—252,288,000 times per year on a typical Rolex—that it creates a lot of friction, which can wear over time. So, Rolex’s solution to the 270-year-old Swiss level is what it’s calling the Dynapulse escapement. The Crown uses two interconnected escapement wheels that take turns swatting a two-pronged fork back and forth. The other end of this fork controls the timekeeping. The new device runs faster than the old one so timekeeping is more accurate. Rolex is also making the wheels out of silicon so they won’t wear over time. “It's an all new escapement, which is so hard to do,” Boutros said. “Rolex took their own path here.” At Watches and Wonders, the brand created this blown-up and slowed-down model of how it all works. The most dramatic difference the movement makes is that it’s much smaller than what Rolex was previously working with. When I tried the watch on in Geneva last week, it was incredibly wearable and thin. Of course, customers are paying attention to what Rolex is doing. “We’ve already had some interest from clients—especially collectors who are drawn to the novelty of Rolex releasing a completely new line,” Altieri said. “The Land-Dweller name alone is generating buzz, and people are curious about where this fits into the broader Rolex lineup. While we haven’t seen widespread demand yet (since it’s so new), the early inquiries suggest this model is striking a chord, particularly with those who’ve been hoping for something different from Rolex.” With the Land-Dweller, Rolex rethought everything, including a centuries-old way of keeping time. What could be more different than that? See all of our newsletters, includingBox + Papers,here.",

    "title": "'The Pitt': Which Doctor Had the Craziest First Day?",
    "article_text": "Your first day at a new job can be rough. But arguably no one has ever had a rougher first day than the new students and residents clocking in for their first 15-hour shift working the ER onThe Pitt. HBO Max’s sleeper-hit series follows one crazy day at Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital ER where a crop of new doctors and veterans led byNoah Wyle’sDr. Michael “Robby” Robinavitch have to treat everything from broken bones, to drug overdoses, to victims a mass shooting at a music festival. Dr. Robby’s first day triggered a full-blown panic attack, so it’s no surprise that the four fresh-faced doctors and medical students—Dr. Mel King (Taylor Dearden), Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones), Dennis Whitaker (Gerran Howell), and Victoria Javadi (Shabana Azeez)—had struggles of their own. Now that season one ofThe Pitthas come to an end, let’s see which ofThe Pittnewbies had the craziest first day. Of the newbies, Dr. King comes intoThe Pittthe most prepared, having worked in a VA hospital as a second-year resident. Still, she is in for one hell of a first day in The Pitt. Early in the shift, she confidently diagnoses a leg fracture—but misses signs of a compartment syndrome that turns into a near amputation, which rattles her. Dr. King also must contend with the brief disappearance of her elderly patient’s caretaker, a single daughter exhibiting signs of caretaker fatigue. She also has to break the news to Bella, a five-year-old girl, that her older sister drowned saving her after she fell into a pool. This is particularly devastating for Dr. King, as she is the primary caregiver for her autistic younger sister, but her experience makes her the best person to deliver the horrific news. Dr. King’s first day isn’t only sob stories, however. She bonds with senior resident Dr. Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball), who knows his way around The Pitt maybe a little too well (more on that later). They share an unexpected, teachable moment when Dr. King is able to connect with an autistic patient, Terrence, in a way that Dr. Langdon can’t because she herself is neurodivergent. When a mass shooting occurs, Dr. Mel volunteers for triage and donates her own blood to keep a patient with liver damage alive when the hospital’s blood bank has run out. At the end of her shift, King is confronted by a surprising ethical dilemma when a young boy is brought in, having contracted measles and probably acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and is in desperate need of a spinal tap. His parents, particularly his mother, are staunchly against the procedure. Dr. Mel ends the day picking up her younger sister. Confident to the point of cocky, Dr. Santos comes into The Pitt as a new intern, raring and ready to go. She quickly learns she’s got a lot to learn about bedside manner. She pokes fun at new medical students Victoria and Whitaker, giving them the mean-spirited nicknames “Crash” and “Huckleberry” that play on their insecurities. But soon, Dr. Santos gets a dose of her own medicine, when her overeagerness leads to her dropping a scalpel into surgical resident Dr. Yolanda Garcia’s (Alexandra Metz) foot. Smooth move, Santos. However, her confidence and intuition are spot-on with Dr. Langdon. Santos noticed that the pill count wasn’t adding up for patients that Dr. Langdon had worked on, leading her to believe that Dr. Langdon was stealing pills from the hospital for personal use. It didn’t help matters that Dr. Langdon clearly wasn’t a fan of Dr. Santos or her brash attitude. At first, Dr. Santos missteps and tells Dr. Garcia about her theory that Langdon is stealing pills, only to be met with rage and a warning to watch her step as a new resident. Sure of herself, Dr. Santos brings up Dr. Langdon and the potential pill thievery to Dr. Robby, who, following Dr. Santos’s advice, questions Langdon and discovers she was right all along. She’s also an incredibly skilled doctor who makes some crucial, lifesaving calls over the course of her first day. Dr. Santos makes a quick call to stop an MDMA overdose patient from seizing, injecting them with saline, and angering Dr. Langdon, but saving the patient’s life. With no senior physicians available, she takes the initiative to perform a resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) to stop a patient’s bleeding, which gets her a reprimand from a night-shift senior attending Dr. Jack Abbot (Shawn Hatosy), as well as praise for the procedure’s success. While Dr. Santos’s demeanor might not make her the most popular intern in the hospital, by the end of her first day, we get deeper insight into why she is so intense. Earlier in the day, Santos goes rogue and verbally threatens a male patient with a neck injury whose wife had been drugging his coffee with estrogen because she believed that he was molesting their daughter. By the end of the season we learn that Dr. Santos is a survivor of abuse, and lost a friend to suicide. Has anyone gone through more scrubs in one day than fourth-year med student Dennis Whitaker? He gets a number of gross substances—blood, pee, vomit, you name it—all over his scrubs, causing him to go through four pairs in a single day. That’s gotta be a hospital record. If that weren’t enough, Whitaker experienced a traumatic event to kick off his first day. After bonding with his first patient, a jovial man named Mr. Milton, Whitaker finds him unresponsive in the hallway. Whitaker and Dr. Robby can’t resuscitate Mr. Milton, and he dies, giving Whitaker his first experience losing a patient. It rattles the young aspiring doctor from Nebraska, who Santos dubs “Huckleberry” because of his humble upbringing. But that upbringing proves handy when he is able to capture and kill a rat scurrying around the hospital with his bare hands. Whitaker’s confidence grows after a shaky start. In a touching corollary to Dr. Robby coaching him through losing that first patient, Whitaker lends Dr. Robby a hand when he himself has a panic attack after losing a patient, his pseudo-son Jake’s girlfriend. He even receives an apology from the unhoused man who peed on him and brought rats into the hospital. The apology and the experience inspire Whitaker to get involved with The Pitt’s street team, which provides services to the unhoused. By the season’s end, it turns out that Whitaker and the unhoused man have more in common than you’d initially believe. At the end of their 15-hour shift, Dr. Santos discovers that Whitaker has been squatting at the hospital for the last month because he has nowhere to live. Thankfully, Dr. Santos offers Whitaker the spare room in her apartment. A crazy day to be sure, but at least it ended with a new place for Whitaker to crash. Speaking of crash, Javadi’s day began with a bang, or rather, a thud, when she hit the ground after fainting at the beginning of her shift, earning her the nickname “Crash.” A 20-year-old med student, Javadi’s not old enough to drink, but she’s old enough to provide treatment—and faint—at the sight of a degloved foot. After the fainting, everything is going relatively smoothly for Javadi until her colleagues learn that her mother is Dr. Eileen Shamsi (Deepti Gupta), a senior attending at the hospital. Victoria is forced to contend with trying to prove herself as a doctor in her own right while simultaneously being patronized by her mother. To make things even more complicated, Javadi finds herself falling for Mateo Diaz (Jalen Thomas Brooks), a handsome nurse who works in The Pitt. Personal drama aside, Victoria quickly proves that she’s got what it takes to be a doctor in her own right. She independently diagnoses a patient, Dolores Walker, who is experiencing severe abdominal pain. While her mother attributes the symptoms to Crohn’s disease, Victoria discovers that the pain was caused by a black widow spider bite, impressing her mother. By the end of the shift, she’s gotten Mateo to ask her out and is drinking a beer in the park with her colleagues. While you can make a case for any of the four doctors’ difficult days, Whitaker gets our vote for most distressing first go-round at The Pitt, partly because of all those foul scrubs. While Dr. King gained confidence, Dr. Santos softened up, and Javadi grew up a bit, Whitaker processed the loss of his first patient and got a new home by the end of his shift. That’s a pretty eventful first day on the job. Now thatThe Pitthas been renewed for season two, there may be a newer crop of newbies scrubbing in on July 4: What could go wrong?

    "title": "Marco Rubio Basically Admitted Why the Trump Administration Arrested Columbia Student Mahmoud Khalil",
    "article_text": "Secretary of StateMarco Rubioproduced a notablyslender one-and-a-half-page memoas evidence for the Trump administration’s attempt to deportMahmoud Khalil. An immigration judge is set to rule Friday whether the government can continue detaining him during immigration proceedings. The memodelivered Wednesday, in response to a Louisiana immigration judge’s order, states that Khalil—a legal permanent US resident and Columbia University graduate student who served as a campus activist spokesperson duringpro-Palestinian demonstrations—engaged in “otherwise lawful” activities. But it went on to cite an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, which it claimed empowers the secretary of state to “personally determine” whether Khail should have remained in the country. Rubio’s memo also noted that US foreign policy “champions core American interests and American citizens” and that the protests Khalil participated in “would severely undermine that significant foreign policy objective.” Johnny Sinodis, one of Khalil’s lawyers,argues that the memodoesn’t meet the evidentiary standard required under immigration law. “The Rubio memo is completely devoid of any factual recitation as to why exactly Mahmoud’s presence in the United States is adverse to a compelling US government interest,” he said on Thursday. Arrested early last month by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Khalil was detained briefly in New Jersey before being sent to Louisiana, where he has remained since. Rubio said he’d revoked Khalil’s green card after the fact. Now, presented with the opportunity to provide a legal basis for his deportation, the administration has—whether or not they intended to—seemingly proven that thereisnolegal basis for his removal. Khalil is just one victim of Trump’s broad, legally dubious crackdown on free speech. As of mid-march, at least 50 universities, including Cornell and Yale, wereunder investigationby the Education Department for allegedly promoting DEI policies. The administration has alsohaltedfederal funding for numerous schools, like Northwestern and Cornell, over allegations of antisemitism and racial discrimination. Meanwhile, students who participated in pro-Palestinian demonstrations, fromStanfordtoUniversity of Michigan, have come under disciplinary action and even criminal punishment. In a letter sent from jail last month, Khalilstatedthat his being targeted “was part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent.” “Knowing fully that this moment transcends my individual circumstances,” he wrote. “I hope nonetheless to be free to witness the birth of my first-born child.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "RFK Jr. Bought a $4.4M Georgetown House Per Cheryl Hines’ “Demands”—the Misogynistic Press Was Free",
    "article_text": "Health and Human Services Secretary-slash-anti-vaxxerRobert F. Kennedy Jr.recently plunked down $4.43 million for a 125-year-old, four-bedroom home in Washington, DC’s tony Georgetown neighborhood, multiple outlets report.According to CBS, Kennedy closed on the property on Friday, April 4, days after conducting a final walk-through with his team. ADaily Mailstory cites sources who claim that the purchase signifies that Kennedy has “caved in” to the demands of Cheryl Hines, his wife andCurb Your Enthusiasmstar, so she can “keep close tabs on the serial Casanova\" following hisalleged relationship with reporterOlivia Nuzzi. Representatives for Kennedy did not immediately respond toVanity Fair, and Hines, through a representative, declined to comment. “Cheryl was furious and made her demands very clear,” the source told theDaily Mail. “She told Bobby in no uncertain terms she wanted to live in Georgetown, in one of its spectacular row homes and she was very bossy about it, giving him an ultimatum to move her to DC forthwith, or face the wrath of God.” Women, am I right?! Sheesh. FormerCurb Your Enthusiasmactor Hines, 59, and Kennedy will have dominion over the 4,876-square-foot townhouse’s four bedrooms, three-and-a-half bathrooms, chef’s kitchen, reading nook, terrace, wine cellar, two laundry rooms, wet bar, and more, in a home described in the listing as “the epitome of Georgetown elegance.” There’s apparently only one parking space, so that could be a future pain point. Kennedy is the latest to participate in theHamptonsification of DC, spurring the run on luxury real estate that came with the secondDonald Trumppresidency. In March, Meta CEOMark Zuckerbergspent $23 million on a DC mansion, reportedly the third-highest sale price in DC history, trailing Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnick’s$25 million purchaseof Fox News’Bret Baier’s former digs. Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentwill be a Kennedy neighbor, having already purchased his own Georgetown home earlier this year for $12.5 million, and crypto guyDavid Sacksbought his own $10.25 million penthouse in the neighborhood in December. Of course, there’s the potential for awkwardness if Kennedy runs intoformer FDA employee Dr.Peter Marks, mastermind of the Project Warp Speed initiative to develop and deploy the COVID-19 vaccine, who also lives in the area. In a fun bit of historical rich-people trivia, Kennedy isn’t the first of his family to set up in Georgetown: John F. Kennedy and Jackie Kennedy also occupied a few addresses in the area, and the late Sen. Ted Kennedy did as well. In fact, the same agent whoin 2018 listed an estateTed Kennedy once rented was the listing agent for RFK’s new acquisition, and brokered Zuckerberg’s recent deal. Unsurprisingly, the world of all-cash, multi-million dollar real estate deals is a small one.

    "title": "Why the Supreme Court Put Its Foot Down on One Lawless Trump Deportation",
    "article_text": "Nearly one month has gone by sinceKilmar Armando Ábrego García, a Maryland husband and father whom an immigration judge had expressly allowed to remain in the United States years ago, was taken from his family, put on a plane, and sent to a so-called “terrorism confinement center” in El Salvador. The Trump administration did this in our names by mistake and without legal authority, acknowledging in a court of law that an “administrative error” had caused this unlawful disappearance. Worse, in his petition to the Supreme Court, where the government has forcefully resisted a judge’s order and deadline to bring Ábrego García back home, the new solicitor general,D. John Sauer, took a hard line againsteveryjudge in the nation who dares set timelines for the government to comply with commitments and laws it has broken. “If this precedent stands,” the newly confirmed Sauerwrote, “other district courts could order the United States to successfully negotiate the return of other removed aliens anywhere in the world by close of business. Under that logic, district courts would effectively have extraterritorial jurisdiction over the United States’ diplomatic relations with the whole world.” Once a person is out of the country and in a foreign gulag, in other words, there’s nothing the courts can do. Late on Thursday, the Supreme Court of the United States did notorderthe Trump administration to bring Ábrego García back immediately. Yet in a kind of compromise, which all the justices endorsed, the court did agree that a judge’s order to “facilitate and effectuate” his return could stand but needs “clarification”: What did the Maryland federal judge,Paula Xinis, mean by the wordeffectuate? This lower court, the Supreme Court said, “should clarify its directive, with due regard for the deference owed to the Executive Branch in the conduct of foreign affairs.” The Court added: “For its part, the Government should be prepared to share what it can concerning the steps it has taken and the prospect of further steps.” This is a qualified victory for Ábrego García, and his lawyers are rightfully thrilled. “The rule of law won today,”Andrew Rossman, one of his lawyers,saidlast night. “Time to bring him home.” Xinis moved right along, issuing an order Thursday evening asking the Trump administration to dothree things, two of which the government should already be doing, and to let her know in a court filing by this morning where things stand. The administration must tell the judge “the current physical location and custodial status” of Ábrego García; “what steps, if any,” the government has already taken in response to her initial order; and “what additional steps Defendants will take, and when, to facilitate his return.” But if the government’s recent conduct in this case andothersis any guide, the Trump administration is expected to drag its feet again. Indeed, just minutes before the Friday deadline for an update,Drew Ensign, the same Justice Department lawyer who has been handling aseparate casechallenging the summary deportation of Venezuelans the government deems “alien enemies”—more on him and that case later—filed what can be fairly described as a last-minuteobjection. Too fast, too soon, Ensign complained: Give us more time. He even stopped short of accusing Xinis thatsheis the one not following the Supreme Court’s new order; the judge was none too pleased. In a swiftorderon Friday morning, she told the department that the need for an extension “blinks at reality,” and rejected the suggestion that she’s not following the Supreme Court’s directive. “Nothing,” she wrote, “could be further from the truth.” The Justice Department insisted on having the last word,respondingpast the judge’s deadline that the government is “not in a position” to share an update: “That is the reality.” At a combative afternoon hearing on Friday, Ensign hadnothingof substance to offer the judge. All of this writing was already on the wall. JusticeSonia Sotomayor, joined by JusticeElena Kaganand JusticeKetanji Brown Jackson, underscored how extreme the Trump administration’s ultimate position in the Ábrego García case has been from the start: The government had asked the justices to leave him stranded in an El Salvadoran prison, withoutanylegal recourse at all. “The only argument the Government offers in support of its request, that United States courts cannot grant relief once a deportee crosses the border, is plainly wrong,” Sotomayor wrote. But she also touched on how the administration’s position could be used to justifyanyone’s rendition to a far-away nation: “The Government’s argument, moreover, implies that it could deport and incarcerate any person, including U.S. citizens, without legal consequence, so long as it does so before a court can intervene,” she wrote. “That view refutes itself.” As the liberal justices reminded readers of the court’s shortorder, that’s the view the Trump administration is also taking in another case,J.G.G. v. Trump, where a group of Venezuelan migrants is challenging their designation of “alien enemies” subject to a centuries-old wartime statute that hasn’t been invoked since World War II. There, the Trump administration’s conduct is even more indefensible:anyonesubject to a presidential proclamation declaring them enemies of the state can be summarily deported, without a hearing. And the deportations can been masseand maybe even in secret, as happened with hundreds of people who were boarded on planes and sent to CECOT—the name of the prison in El Salvador—without a chance to even contest the government’s actions. As Sotomayorwroteearlier this week in that case, the “government’s resistance to facilitating the return of individuals erroneously removed to CECOT only amplifies the specter that, even if this Court someday declares the President’s Proclamation unlawful, scores of individual lives may be irretrievably lost.” The reason no one should celebrate the Supreme Court’s ruling for Ábrego García is that, throughout this and other cases, the government’s conduct has been far from exemplary. Just last weekend, as the administration was rushing to appeal the judge’s order to return Ábrego García, two experienced Justice Department lawyerswere put on administrative leavefor being too candid with Judge Xinis. One of them had a hard time answering straightforward questions and at one point conceded that his “client”—the US government—could not give him “satisfactory” answers about the circumstances surrounding the Ábrego García case. Attorney GeneralPam Bondidefended the moves. “You have to vigorously argue on behalf of your client,” she told Fox News. And in the case of the Venezuelan migrants who were disappeared without a hearing, the Justice Department has done everything but cooperate with the courts. The Trump administration has, among other things, invoked the state-secrets privilege, all but tellingthe judge assigned to the case,James Boasberg, that he’s not entitled to know anything about the Venezuela-bound planes he ordered returned; has accused him of misconduct and requested a new judge; and has claimed that Article II of the Constitution doesn’t allow judges to inquire about what kind of arrangements the administration has made with the government of El Salvador. At a hearing last week, BoasberggrilledEnsign for how the government conducted itself early in the litigation—especially on the day he ordered the planes returned and the Trump administration ignored him. The judge said there is a fair likelihood that “the government acted in bad faith throughout that day.” Taking stock of all this behavior in theJ.G.G.case, including the government’s response to Boasberg’s due diligence, Sotomayor—joined by Kagan, Jackson,andJusticeAmy Coney Barrettin dissent—was simply appalled. And she faulted the majority led by Chief JusticeJohn Robertsfor turning a blind eye to it. “The Government’s conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law,” she wrote earlier this week. “That a majority of this Court now rewards the Government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a Nation and a court of law, should be better than this.” The only time to celebrate will be when Kilmar Ábrego García is back home with his family.

    "title": "No! Sleep! For Bloomberg! How the Media Giant’s Joe Weisenthal and Tracy Alloway Survived a Manic Week",
    "article_text": "Joe Weisenthalloves “watching the line go up on a chart,” andTracy Allowayhas “existential angst” about the state of the world. Together, the financial journalists—who cohost Bloomberg’sOdd Lotspodcastand cowrite anewsletter—were ideally situated to cover the market meltdown caused byDonald Trump’stariff rolloutandabrupt reversal. Both of them have been working on very little sleep, with Alloway telling me she’s been staying up till around 2 a.m. each night. On Tuesday, Weisenthal got about four hours of sleep, accidentally crashing on the couch in the middle of refreshing his Bloomberg app for updates, as he recalls. “Then at some point my alarm clock went off at 4:30 a.m,” he says. He admits that after several days without any Zyn nicotine pouches, he “finally cracked” on Wednesday night. “I crash really hard every night, and I’m really exhausted and like, I hate my life,” Weisenthal says, adding, “Then the next day I'm like, I love this. Let’s go. So it’s just been that. I would like some break from that, but that has basically been my cycle.” The duo is very much aware that their audience size and content engagement are inextricably linked to poor market conditions, like the volatility seen as a result of Trump’s trade wars, and they’ve upped their usual three weekly episodes, posting content basically every day to keep their audience up to date on the lightning-speed developments. The “Odd Lots” newsletter, one of Bloomberg’s fastest-growing subscription newsletter offerings, has so far seen a 142% increase in sign-ups this month compared to the average in March, according to the company. Additionally, the podcast has seen a nearly 72% week-over-week increase in downloads since the tariff plan was announced last week. Generally, the podcast reaches more than 1 million downloads per month. “I’m pretty sure our download traffic is correlated with the VIX volatility index,” Alloway quips in our interview. “Anytime there’s massive interest in these things,” Weisenthal tellsVanity Fair,“it’s never once been during a period of economic tranquility.” Weisenthal has also been posting incessantly on X throughout the past week, giving frequent updates to his more than 400,000followers. The showing marks a brief return to the relentless pace Weisenthal kept up more than a decade ago, whenTheNew York Timesprofiledthe “market obsessive” and his ubiquity on social media. Weisenthal had since scaled back his posting on weekends, but these days, he says, “it’s just nonstop.” Alloway, who boasts nearly 200,000followers, was also regularly dropping news and insights throughout the week. “This is a form of news that lends itself very well to headlines and charts, which is an amazing thing that the Bloomberg terminal has in spades,” Weisenthal adds. “So it is not an accident that all of what’s happening right now is playing out on social media.” This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Vanity Fair:You wrote [Wednesday morning] that all Trump has to do issnap his fingersand this will all go away. Well, he kind of did. What happens now? Joe Weisenthal:I was kind of being facetious in that piece because there are all these underlying anxieties that haven’t gone away. Just go back to a few months ago, all this anxiety about the decline of Tesla relative to BYD, DeepSeek, high interest rates, etc. So it’s funny because he did kind of snap his fingersa few hours laterand a bunch of tariffs were pulled, and we got this brief respite in the market, and everyone cheered. And all these people think, Oh, brilliant, art of the deal. And now we’re here again, and I guess it’s Thursday at 1 p.m. and the market’s tanking again, because we realized that we have a minimum 90 days more of uncertainty and massive tariffs against thisgigantic trading partnerthat’s huge for consumer goods. So I thought we were going to get a little rest. I thought it was going to be like, Oh, finally. But no. No rest for us. Tracy Alloway:It’s not just that, though, because he reversed a bunch of the tariffs, excluding China, but the one thing he can’t reverse is the uncertainty or the threat of the tariffs. I know there have been a lot of analogies recently, like, you can’t unring the bell on the threat of tariffs; you can’t put the tariff-threat toothpaste back in the bottle. And that’s also weighing on markets today. Your coverage this week has been unrelenting. Are either of you sleeping? Weisenthal:Tuesday night, I got, like, four hours of sleep. I was in my bed, and then I was like, I’m not gonna be able to fall asleep. So I went to the couch, and I just kept refreshing my Bloomberg app on my phone as the 10-year rate kept going higher and higher. Then at some point my alarm clock went off at 4:30 a.m. So apparently I fell asleep during then. I crash really hard every night, and I’m really exhausted and like, I hate my life. Then the next day I’m like, I love this. Let’s go. So it’s just been that. I would like some break from that, but that has basically been my cycle. Alloway:I’ve been staying up till, like, 2 a.m. every day this week. I don’t know why. I think I have existential angst about everything that’s going on in the markets. Weisenthal:This is the dynamic that we have, which is that Tracy takes things very seriously in the world, whereas for me, it’s just like, I love watching the line go up on a chart. We’re really good complements for this reason. Because I was like, “Oh, the line is moving this direction,” that gets me going. And Tracy’s like, “No, this is really serious stuff that actually matters.” But this is our balance here that we achieve and these two approaches to thinking about the news. How do you get through intense coverage weeks like this? Any specific coping skills? Alloway:The great thing aboutOdd Lotsis, the longer we do it—we've been going for 10 years—the easier it kind of gets. So for instance, this week, obviously the tariffs are in the news. We did a bunch of supply chain episodes back in 2020, when there were all those disruptions. We spoke to truck drivers, shippers, logistics people, a lot of manufacturers, so now we can just call them up pretty easily and have them back on the show. So that’s been great. Weisenthal:I had gone about four or five days without any Zyn, and I finally cracked last night. Has anything changed about the podcast schedule as a result of the fluctuations this week? Alloway:Yeah, we’ve basically gone daily. We used to be three times a week. There’s so much going on, so many people we want to talk to. We’ve been pushing out stuff every day, and I don’t know when that’s going to stop at this point. Weisenthal:Prior to COVID, it was a once-a-week podcast, and then COVID kicked it into a twice-a-week podcast. And now this week—we’re not going to stay at five days a week. It’s completely unsustainable. It’s not going to continue like this forever, knock on wood. But we have been doing an extremely rigorous, intense pace of episode turnaround on a very strained production staff. Are there any specific recent highlights from your coverage that you think were particularly prescient given recent news? Weisenthal:We did a goodepisodetwo Mondays ago;Nick Dentonwas in town, the Gawker Media founder. He’s leaving town and he’s selling his place, and he’s like, “I’m basically short the US de facto.” That was very good. We don’t often try to coordinate an episode at the market call or whatever. But that episode has held up quite well in the one and a half weeks since it was published. We do not give financial advice onOdd Lotsever. We’re just a news operation. But if someone made an informed decision because of an episode we did, we’re always happy to supply people with more information. I think I saw one of you make a joke that you know it’s bad when you’re on cable news. Can you speak to that? And also, what are your thoughts when the news dial switches to your beat? Weisenthal:Anytime there’s massive interest in these things, it’s never once been during a period of economic tranquility. So the fact that people are reading all that, or we see our download numbers spike in general, that never happens in the good times. Alloway:I’m pretty sure our download traffic is correlated with the VIX volatility index, Wall Street’s spirit gauge at this point. I will say the surreal thing for me this week is, people talk about stocks on prime time at a reasonable, regular pace, but this week it was all about the bond market, and that felt interesting and new to me. Like, going on MSNBC and talking about what’s going on in bonds and why it’s such a huge deal, and all these trades that were potentially blowing up, and why foreign investors might be shying away from buying US debt—that was quite different. I’ve noticed a significant number of people tuning in to both of your work, specifically social media updates during all of this. How much do you think, on average, you posted this week? Weisenthal:I don’t know the numbers. I was actually proud of myself, like, six months ago. I remember thinking to myself, You know what, I don’t post as much as I used to, and I’ve slowly ebbed away from my Twitter. Alloway:This is true. Weisenthal:I stopped posting on the weekends. Like, Oh, this is progress I’m making on my mental health and my unhealthy addiction to posting on social media. Now it’s just nonstop. And look, things are moving so fast, there are updates every second. All these prominent people are posting, including the president and all the various hangers-on around him, who want to have his ear. This is a form of news that lends itself very well to headlines and charts, which is an amazing thing that the Bloomberg terminal has in spades. So it is not an accident that all of what’s happening right now is playing out on social media. Since the 90-day pause, Trump, the White House, and his followers have declared victory in a sense. What do you make of that? Weisenthal:The NASDAQ is down 6.3% as we’re speaking [on Thursday afternoon]. The market is significantly lower than it was before he revealed that big, infamous tariff chart in the Rose Garden. Ten-year rates are higher than they were. This is against the stated goal of the administration, to get lower rates. We know already that there’s a massive uncertainty and now guaranteed to be at least three more months of uncertainty. None of this is a judgment on whether it’s good or bad. This is literally just stats and objective things that are happening in the world. It’s hard to see what the victory is at this point. Alloway:By the administration’s own benchmarks—Joe mentioned some of them—they haven’t hit that scorecard. They’ve explicitly said they want to lower mortgage rates. They want to make housing more affordable, preferably see stocks go up. Higher interest rates also means higher borrowing costs for the US government, and that is potentially happening at a time when Trump says he wants to reduce US debt and he wants to refinance at cheaper rates. But just going back to the uncertainty point, Trump says he wants to increase manufacturing. He wants to reindustrialize the country—that's a really expensive process. You need a lot of money to build basic factories, and you probably need even more money to build advanced-tech factories. And the past week or so, he’s kind of destabilized every single form of capital out there—bonds, stocks, domestic, international—and it’s not clear to me who is going to come in now and pay for all of this.

    "article_text": "WhenDonald Trumpbacked off most of his tariff regime earlier this week, there was a brief moment of…well, I won’t call it hope—that’s too strong a word in these troubling times. Respite, maybe? A sense we could take a breather when it came to impending economic meltdown, even as the administration’s assault on United States democracy and constitutional rights continued apace? Alas, after markets rallied Wednesday following histariff turnabout, chaosreigned once againThursday as Trump escalated his trade war with China, clarifying that Chinese goods exported to the US would now face a minimumtariff rateof 145%. In response, first, Beijingannouncedretaliatory tariffs—125% on all American goods—designed toinflict significant pain on consumers. Then, thedollar dropped, andso did US stocks. The volatility continued as markets opened Friday, with what analysts called a “confidence crisis” in the US: “The global safe-haven status is in question,”Priya Misra, a portfolio manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management,toldtheNew York Timesthis week.” To put that in Trumpese: People have “been getting a little yippy.” That was the president'sstated reasonWednesday for suddenly calling off many of his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs—at least for 90 days. And, after the markets swung back in response to his apparent de-escalation, he took a victory lap: “It was the biggest day in history, the markets,” hesaidThursday, touting the stock rebound from the plunge he personally caused. “So we’re very, very happy with the way the country is running.” But you could say that people are still yippy, as it were: His unpredictability—the sense that he could impose or pull back on these policies at any time, as he’s already done at several points not even three months into his presidency—has weakened America’s reliability. “This is the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen an administration impose on a well-functioning economy,” former Fed chair and Treasury SecretaryJanet Yellensaidon CNN Thursday. Are Trump's actions the result of a misguided belief he can bend markets to his will the way he has with the US political system? Or is this intentional market manipulation in service of grift, as it appeared to be when he told Truth Social followers it was a “great time to buy” Wednesday morning—just before he sent markets soaring with his trade war reversal? Whether it’s one or the other or some combination of both—I would suspect it is most likely the latter—the chaos reinforces the need forrealchecks and balances on this administration. Even a handful of Republicans, normally so deferential to (and afraid of) this president, have signed onto a bill that would reassert congressional oversight of the chief executive’s tariff powers. “For too long, Congress has delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,” RepublicanChuck Grassley, a cosponsor of the legislation,saidin a statement, calling for lawmakers to “have a voice in trade policy.” But it’s not easy to claw back power once you give it up: Trump has said he’d veto the bill. “Reckless improvisation is not a strategy,” as former Treasury SecretaryLarry Summersput itthis week, after Trump reversed course. “We are far from being out of the woods.” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Trump Adds Thousands of Living Immigrants to Social Security’s “Death” File: Report",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is reportedly adding thousands of living people who previously had temporary legal status in the US to a list of dead people maintained by the Social Security Administration,The New York Timesreports. In adding them to the so-called “death master file,” the administration is treating these people, whose legal immigration status the Trump administration revoked, as if they’re dead, invalidating the social security numbers they use to work and live. As acting secretary of the SSA,Lee Dudek, put it in an email to staff, according to theTimes, their “financial lives” are effectively “terminated.” Already 6,300 names have been added to the list, according to theTimes. The administration says these people are either criminals or terrorists, but the rest of Trump’sslapdash, error-riddledimmigrationenforcementsuggests disastrous mistakes are inevitable. “The potential for errors can be very consequential,”Jason Fichtner, who worked for the Social Security Administration underGeorge W. Bush, told theTimes. In a statement to theTimes, a White House spokesperson said that President Trump is “removing the monetary incentive for illegal aliens to come and stay” and that the move was meant to “encourage them to self-deport.” But, in this case, the people in question came to the country under President Biden’s parole program, which granted them temporary legal status and social security numbers that enabled them to work. According to theTimes, a software engineer working forElon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency sent the Social Security Administration the list of 6,300 people to be added to the death file on Tuesday—the very same day their legal status was revoked. While the engineer reportedly said all of the names were on “the terrorist watch list” or had “F.B.I. criminal records,” a source told theTimesthe list also included several minors, including one as young as 13. That DOGE is heavily involved in this high-stakes effort is particularly notable, given its well-documented track record of misinterpreting data. Dudek has already had to walk back Elon Musk’s claims of 150-year-olds collecting social security benefits. “The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record,” Dudeksaidin February. “These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits.” DOGE has also made aseries of errorsin reporting supposed government savings on its so-called “Wall of Receipts.” It is one thing for DOGE to mistake an $8 million contract for an $8 billion contract (as it once did). It’s another thing entirely to mistake an innocent person for a terrorist. And as this administration has made abundantly clear, it’s not particularly interested incorrectingits mistakes.

    "title": "Black Mirror “USS Callister: Into Infinity” Goes Boldly into the Tech Broligarchy",
    "article_text": "It’s just likeBlack Mirrorto take a happy ending and twist it into a nightmare. “USSCallister,” the Emmy-winning fourth-seasonBlack Mirrorepisode, ended on an uncharacteristically uplifting note. But a new film-length sequel, “USS Callister: Into Infinity,” plunges its characters back into a dystopian hell that feels even more resonant in 2025 than when the original premiered in 2017. ThatepisodefeaturedJesse Plemonsas Robert Daly, a programming genius and incel who feels disrespected at his own video game company by both his colleagues and his attention-grabbing partner Walton (Jimmi Simpson). Daly takes his frustrations out on his workmates by stealing their DNA and imprisoning their cloned avatars in his private virtual game world. Here he can humiliate and sadistically punish his colleagues turned lackeys, who serve as the crew of the retro spaceship USSCallister—a scenario modeled on Daly’s childhood favoriteStar Trek–ish TV series,Space Fleet. Every evening after coming home from the office, Plemons reigns as Captain Daly, a demonic twist on Captain Kirk, whose every wish must be obeyed for fear of torture. When the cloned version of quiet coder Nanette (Cristin Milioti)refuses him, Daly seals up her face so that she can’t talk back or breathe. Daly is the embodiment of arrested development, fandom gone berserk. But it is the equally nerdy Nanette—in the real world, she coos admiringly over Daly’s sublime programming architecture—who figures out how to escape the private server in which USSCallisteris trapped and steer the spaceship into the full multiplayer game. It’s a triumph of female ingenuity over male malice. ButBlack Mirrorcouldn’t just let it be. “USSCallister:Into Infinity” finds Nanette still on deck. Daly may be permanently banished from his virtual creation, but she and the crew are increasingly exhausted by a new set of digital dangers—among them, the game’s 30 million players. “When we were trapped on Daly’s computer, we only had to deal with one sociopath,” Nanette complains. “Now, we’ve got a whole universe full of them.” They’re also forced to rob players in order to get enough in-game currency to keep the spaceship afloat. Call it a “cost-of-existing crisis,” quips Elena (Milanka Brooks), the receptionist turned blue-skinned crew member. The gang’s one form of relaxation is watchingThe Real Housewives of Atlanta, which somehow they can access for free. Meanwhile, real-life Nanette stumbles upon clues to what’s been going on and convinces Walton to enter the game with her, bringing them face to face with their alter egos. “I look socapable,” the real Nanette marvels on encountering her formidable spaceship doppelgänger. “You being shocked by that does us both a disservice,” space-Nanette scolds. LikeSeverance, the episode plays with our ideas of consciousness and selfhood. Is the digital clone of Nanette (her “innie,” inSeveranceparlance) a real person? Do her virtual-world feelings and pain count for as much as her fleshy counterpart’s? Is it possible for Walton to be an asshole in reality and a mensch inside the game? Some ethical lines have already been drawn in theBlack Mirroruniverse: The cloning technology, apparently created by the porn industry to make virtual fuckbuddies, has been legally banned. But in our real world, AI’s growth spurt has combined with the malign rise of tech broligarchs, heralding a sinister future. The gap betweenBlack Mirror’schilling visions and present realities feels like it’s shrinking every day. And at a moment when some members of American society are being framed as more disposable than others, this episode hits a nerve. A littletooobviously sometimes, as when outie Walton enters the game and starts shooting at his cloned employees—calling them “illegal” because they haven’t paid for game subscriptions. One of the most unsettling scenes flashes back to Daly’s origin story, in which he’s been cruelly exploited by Walton. That doesn’t make Daly any less sadistic—but it does make him a little more human. “I’m a nice guy,” his clone repeats over and over to Nanette at one point, just as so many abusive men have promised. “I’m not that guy.” But we already know that heisthat guy—or soon will be. Daly utterly lacks empathy, seeing the spaceship crew as Barbie and Ken dolls to be mutilated and discarded. Sometimes it feels likeBlack Mirroris gradually assembling a virtual universe of its own, a singularity where all the plots converge and fuse. The series loves to embed references to past episodes in its scripts. A character in this season’s “Hotel Reverie” episode wears aSpace Fleetshirt, and a TV news banner on “USSCallister:Into Infinity” refers to the British prime minister being forced to have sex with a pig in season one. But the most notable Easter egg in this episode might be San Juniper Hospital, a reference to“San Junipero.” That wasBlack Mirror’smost joyful episode, a tale of romance between two elderly women who will “live” indefinitely as their youthful selves thanks to a virtual reality company.Charlie Brooker,the show’s mastermind, oncetold mehe had no plans to write a “San Junipero” sequel because “we want to keep [the characters] happy there. You wouldn’t want anyone at that company opening the wrong email attachment, and suddenly, the whole place is held hostage by ransomware.” But this second USSCallisterinstallment suggests thatBlack Mirror’sstories never really end—they just get creepier. That’s a sensation that reverberates uncomfortably in these days when you wake up every morning, check your phone, and wonder, “How can this be reality?” Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle Usha Vance’s “Very Lonely, Lonely World” The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Trump Wants to Rewrite History at the Smithsonian. It’ll Be an Uphill Battle",
    "article_text": "PresidentDonaldTrumpwasn’t always at loggerheads with the museums that make up the Smithsonian Institute. In February 2017, he arrived at the brand-new National African American Museum of History and Culture for a tour with its director,Lonnie G. Bunch III,and told Bunch he’d been looking forward to it. His wife,Melania,had recently toured the museum with the first lady of Israel,Sara Netanyahu.After the visit, both women decried “the historic plight of slavery, which the Jewish and African American people have known all too well.” Trump had brought along SenatorTim Scottand Dr.Ben Carson—the latter, a neurosurgeon and former Trump primary opponent who had an exhibit at the museum dedicated to his career—his daughterIvanka,and the niece of Martin Luther King Jr.,Alveda King,who had supported Trump in the 2016 election. If the remarks after the tour are to be taken at face value, Trump had a pretty great time. “This museum is a beautiful tribute to so many American heroes—heroes like Sojourner Truth, Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, Rosa Parks, the Greensboro students, and the African American Medal of Honor recipients, among so many other really incredible heroes,” the then-and-future president said. And then, singling out the museum’s then director, Trump said, “I am very, very proud of Lonnie Bunch. The work and the love that he has in his heart for what he’s done is—I always talk about, you need enthusiasm, you need really love for anything you do to do it successfully. And, Lonnie, you are where? Come on. Where’s Lonnie? You should be up here, Lonnie. Come on.” A different anecdote from the day’s tour stood out to Bunch years later. As he recalled in his 2019 memoir,A Fool’s Errand,at one point during the day, the president stood in front of a display that described in detail how the Netherlands contributed to the first 200 years of the transatlantic slave trade. Trump stared at the text on the wall, then turned to Bunch. “You know, they love me in the Netherlands,” Trump said. “Let’s continue walking,” Bunch replied. “I was so disappointed in his response to one of the greatest crimes against humanity in history,” he went on to write in the book (which carried the subtitle “Creating the National Museum of African American History and Culture in the Age of Bush, Obama, and Trump”). “Here was a chance to broaden the views and the understanding of the incoming president and I had been less successful than I had expected.” While the Netherlands episode didn’t merit much of a response from the White House when the book was released, it’s now at the center of an effort by the administration to infiltrate the heart of the Smithsonian, and rid it of, what it recently called, “This revisionist movement [that] seeks to undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” That choice quote comes from “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,” an executive order issued by Trump late last month that explicitly asked Vice PresidentJD Vanceto remove “improper ideology” from the Smithsonian through his perch on the institution’s Board of Regents, via statute. News coverage of the order anticipated the worst. Dictating the programming of an independent cultural organization would be completely unprecedented, like so much is these days, e.g., the private universities and law firms that have acquiesced to Trump’s demands. Perhaps the leaders of the Smithsonian would as well? But Bunch, who has served as secretary of the Smithsonian since 2019, was not ready to fold. Days later, he sent a memo to staff saying, “As always, our work will be shaped by the best scholarship, free of partisanship, to help the American public better understand our nation’s history, challenges, and triumphs.” “Lonnie Bunch is a Democrat donor and rabid partisan who manufactured lies out of thin air in order to boost sales of his miserable book,” Trump’s smashmouth attack dogSteven Cheungtold theTimes.“Fortunately, he, along with his garbage book, are complete failures.” That’s a long seven years removed from “very, very proud.” (A representative for Bunch declined an interview request for this story, citing his schedule.) It seems like a scary time at the Smithsonian. Last week, the NMAAHC, known colloquially as the Blacksonian, announced thatKevin Young,who succeeded Bunch as director, was stepping down permanently after spending the last few weeks on leave. (Young is also the poetry editor at fellow Condé Nast titleThe New Yorker.) Early in the administration, at least two museums closed their diversity departments. The Art Museum of the Americas canceled a show organized byAndil Gosine,the artist and author of the textEnvironmental Justice and Racism in Canada,and also canceled a show featuring artists from the African diaspora. But can Trump actually steamroll through the Smithsonian and call in die-hard loyalists to eliminate “ideology” from the programming? Can he send 22-year-old culture-ignorant DOGE staffers into the redbrick Gothic Castle that James Renwick built in 1855 and have them start gutting the place à la USAID? In what counts as good news these days, it might be tough for Trump to pull it off. Here’s why: The Smithsonian is firewalled from changing administrations, protecting it from the vicissitudes of the executive branch—very much unlike the Kennedy Center, which has a board handpicked by the president, and now has a US president as its chair. Congress appoints the Smithsonian’s governing regents, who are expected to serve years—and sometimes decades—long terms. “The Smithsonian is much more insulated from presidential oversight or control than an administrative agency in the executive branch would be,” saidRichard H. Pildes,the Sudler Family Professor of Constitutional Law at the NYU School of Law. “The president’s theory behind his effort to assert control over the Smithsonian is: The Smithsonian is part of the executive branch, and the president should be understood to have full control and supervision over the running of the executive branch. But the Justice Department has concluded many, many times over the years that the Smithsonian isnotpart of the executive branch, that it’s a unique entity from a legal perspective.” One could argue that hasn’t stopped Trump before. He could just act as a king and flout the law by declaring himself the new secretary of the Smithsonian and presiding over the board of regents. But that would likely face heavy legal headwinds. “There would be legal challenges,” Pildes said. “The fundamental point is that the Smithsonian is not part of the executive branch—as the Justice Department has recognized for decades and decades.” And so the parliamentary procedures must be followed, and that’s an uphill battle for Trump. There are 17 members on the Board of Regents, and 6 are congressional figures: 3 senators selected by the President Pro TemporeChuck Grassleyand 3 representatives chosen by Speaker of the HouseMike Johnson.Regents generally stay in their positions until they leave office and are reappointed upon reelection—SenatorPatrick Leahyserved a full two decades, from 2001 to 2021. The current senators areJohn Boozman, Catherine Cortez Masto,andGary Peters—who announced he won’t run for reelection, meaning a seat on the board will open in 2027, and the administration can pressure Grassley to appoint the MAGA-iest senator they can. (Not that Grassley is a rubber stamp on the president’s agenda.) The three House members on the board are of course up for reelection, and could hypothetically be replaced by Johnson regardless of whether they win—though, if the Democrats take the House asoddsmakers are predicting, it would presumably beHakeem Jeffrieswho will have the appointment power once their terms end and can slot in Democrats to take the place of the current Republican reps on the board,Adrian SmithandCarlos Giménez. Then there are citizen members of the board. This is central to the Trump team’s plan to seize Smithsonian power. The executive order claims that Vance will “work with the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate Majority Leader to seek the appointment of citizen members to the Smithsonian Board of Regents committed to advancing the policy of this order.” There are several current regents who are set to step down when their six-year terms end at various points over the next 18 months. Even if all six regents with terms ending in 2026 get replaced with right-wing cultural hardliners, they will get outvoted 10-7 when joined by Vance. Say, hypothetically, Trump tells the board to cancel a contemporary art show at the Hirshhorn that, when seen through Trumpvision, has “come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,” as the order vaguely states. In that scenario, they get outvoted. Got all that, Mr. President? Is there a way for Trump to get around this? One scenario that was suggested to me by a source is quite alarming: Because there’s no statute claiming that the citizen members of the Board of Regents can only be fired for cause, Congresscouldvote to replace all nine citizen members with people who pass for cultural heavyweights in MAGA world—yourSteve WynnsandLee GreenwoodsandKid Rocks. Again: Trump can’t just snap his fingers and make this happen like he did with the Kennedy Center; it has to go through Congress. The margins are already razor-thin—and you would have to assume that Smith and Giménez would not vote to kick their current fellow regents off the board. The votes determining the citizen regents who serve the Smithsonian are so bipartisan that it might not even be close. In 2023, when the House voted to reappoint three citizen regents—LACMA directorMichael Govan,former News Corp. executiveToni Bush,and former Fed vice chairRoger Ferguson—the tally was 390 yeas and only 10 nays. (RepresentativePaul Gosar,the guy who posted an anime video of himself murderingAlexandria Ocasio Cortez,was one of the nays. After Gosar was censured by his House colleagues and removed from two committee assignments, he said, “There is no threat in the cartoon other than the threat immigration poses to our country. And no threat was intended by my staff or me.”) But if Trump decided to make this a priority, he could force Johnson to whip the votes in the House to kick out the citizen regents and install lackeys. That’s way harder than using executive power to dismantle an agency, and he’d have to activate what’s proven to be an extraordinarily ineffective Congress. But it’s still a possibility, and with the nine Trump-chosen citizen regents and Vance, they would outvote the holdovers 10-7. One major bulwark against the dissolution of the Smithsonian is that a Trump executive action trying to treat it like his personal plaything will inevitably meet a fusillade of lawsuits, which could wind up in the Supreme Court—where the Chief Justice happens to be on the Board of Regents. The Smithsonian Board is effectivelyrunby Chief JusticeJohn Roberts,who has served as chancellor since his 2005 appointment to the highest court in the land. Roberts calls most meetings to order, and in September 2016, he was on hand to deliver opening remarks at the NMAAHC, sandwiched betweenAngela Bassett, John Lewis, Oprah Winfrey, Will Smith, Robert De Niro,andBarack Obama,with musical performances interspersed throughout. “Thank you, Lonnie, for scheduling meright afterStevie Wonder,” Roberts deadpanned to Bunch as he started his speech. It didn’t appear that Roberts thought a museum that highlighted the plight of African Americans would, as Trump’s order put it, “undermine the remarkable achievements of the United States by casting its founding principles and historical milestones in a negative light.” After solemnly detailing the Supreme Court cases that curtailed Black freedom in the US, Roberts recommended that, if you want to learn about the history of race in America, you should visit the museum. “This museum provides a place for us to learn what life was like for those individuals who brought those cases to the Supreme Court,” he said. “If you want to know what those cases were about, you need to meet Dred and Harriet Scott, Plessy and Oliver and Leola Brown, and you can do that in this new museum.” ​​Your crib sheet for the comings and goings in the art world this week and beyond… …Daniel Arsham,last seen making a terrifying sculpture ofZuck’s wife, is suing the rapperQuavo,formerly of Migos, for allegedly including his artworkQuartz Eroded 1961 Ferrari GTin a music videosanspermission. The complaint was filed last week in the Southern District of New York, and it’s an extremely fun read. Things get started with that patented Arsham modesty: “Mr. Arsham is a New York based visual artist. He exhibits his work in galleries, fairs, and museums around the world. He is one of the most well-known contemporary artists in the world.” At one point, the complaint makes the case that, look, Arsham licenses out his artwork all the time, casually listing his collaborators: Tiffany & Co., Rimowa,Pharrell, Usher, Jay-Z, Gunna, The Weeknd,andNas.It also mentions that “some of Mr. Arsham’s work—including the Artwork—sell for many hundreds of thousands of dollars.” That all said…Quavo maybe could have asked permission? (A rep for the rapper did not respond to a request for comment.) …Busy week for our guy—Arsham is also out this week with a New Era collabo making New York Yankees ballcaps. Daniel Arsham, New Era, the Yankees…sounds like a right fit for everybody. …The art market fell by 12% in 2024, according to the annual Art Basel and UBS Global Art Market Report released this week. A total of $57.5 billion in art was sold, significantly down from the $67.8 billion achieved in 2022. Some key stats: Public auctions are down a staggering 25% from the prior year, while sales of works above $10 million dropped by 39%. The good news is: It can only go up from here…right? …But a down art market can’t stop…gala season! The big bash of the weekthis weekwent down at the Temple of Dendur in The Met Monday night: the annual YoungArts New York Gala, hosted by the organization’s board chairSarah Arison,who has made sure that YoungArts can offer creatives in their late teens incredible residencies and support, now in its fifth decade. At The Met, I spotted a dizzying number of high profile artists, a few in no particular order:Taryn Simon,KAWS,Titus Kaphar,Camille Henrot,Julia Chiang,Glenn Ligon,andKennedy Yanko.There was a smattering of YoungArts alums who performed throughout the night. There were ballet legends from two generations—Mikhail BaryshnikovandMisty Copeland—and two generations of MoMA directors: the outgoingGlenn Lowryand the incomingChristophe Cherix.And there were many other galas! The Bronx Museum and the Jewish Museum galas on Monday, the Public Art Fund Gala Wednesday, and the SculptureCenter Gala on Thursday.

    "article_text": "Days afterPrince Harrymadean appearancein a London courtroom, he traveled to Ukraine with a contingent from the Invictus Games Foundation for a surprise visit. During the Thursday trip, the prince met with wounded servicemembers at Superhumans Centre, a rehabilitation organization in Lviv that provides military personnel and civilians with free medical and psychological support. According to a spokesperson, Harry’s visit came at the invitation of the organization’s CEOOlga Rudneva,who was present at the Invictus Games in Vancouverin February, and the Invictus Games group was joined by four veterans who have recovered from similar injuries. During his time at the center, Harry met with athletes who have participated in previous Invictus Games and spoke toNatalia Kalmykova,Ukraine’s Minister of Veterans Affairs. He also reunited withYuliia \"Taira\" Paievska,a Team Ukraine competitor whose story was featured on the Duke’s2023 Netflix docuseriesHeart of Invictus. The prince spent Tuesday and Wednesday at the UK Court of Appeals in London, attending the latest hearing inhis ongoing battleover security when he visits the United Kingdom. This week, Harry’s lawyerShaheed Fatimaarguedthat the government unfairly singled Harry out when it changed his security arrangements in 2020, following his andMeghan Markle’s decision to step back from their royal roles that January. In response, the government’s lawyer,Sir James Eadie,argued that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s situation was “unique set of circumstances,” perthe BBC, and the government committee responsible for VIP security behaved appropriately considering the challenges. In her closing remarks Wednesday, Fatima said that Harry has pursued these legal challenges because he believes his safety is at risk. “There is a person sitting behind me whose safety, whose security and whose life is at stake,” she said, as the prince sat two rows behind her in the court room. “There is a person sitting behind me who has been told that he is getting a special, bespoke process, when he knows and has experienced a process that is manifestly inferior in every respect.” Meet the Impressive2025 Cannes Film Festival Lineup Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle The Last of UsEnters Its Sophomore Slump The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "article_text": "As the Trump administration’s attacks on university funding—and student freedom—escalate, the White House is nowreportedlytrying to direct a federal judge to enforce any deal it reaches with Columbia University under a consent decree, which would impose legal oversight over the school’s compliance with Trump’s agenda for years to come. Columbia has already yielded to PresidentDonald Trump’s will after he revoked $400 million in grants and contracts from the university, alleging that the school had failed to protect Jewish students from antisemitism on campus. The administration has also targeted for deportation students who participated in last year’s protests against the war in Gaza. On Friday, a court in Louisiana issetto rule on the release of one such former graduate student, a green card holder namedMahmoud Khalil, who wasarrestedin early March. The administration has not made anycriminalclaims against Khalil. Instead, it has said in court documents that his removal is based on “past, current, or expected beliefs, statements, or associations that are otherwise lawful,” but which Secretary of StateMarco Rubiobelieves “compromise a compelling US foreign policy interest.” Yet in the face of these attacks on its funding and student body, Columbia has still bent over backward to appease the Trump administration,agreeingto overhaul its protest policies and install oversight of its Middle Eastern studies department, among other things. But those concessions have, so far, been voluntary. A consent decree would make them legally binding—a move that one historian of higher education toldThe Wall Street Journalwould be “unprecedented in its expansiveness.” Columbia would need to voluntarily enter into a consent decree. But when millions of dollars in federal funding are held for ransom, its decision isn’t necessarily voluntary. While the Trump administration is clearly trying to make an example of Columbia, it’s far from the only university facing this kind of financial coercion. Just this week, the administrationfroze$1 billion in funding for Cornell University and another $790 million for Northwestern University.

    "title": "Why Wall Street Is Worried for Trump Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s Future",
    "article_text": "As American stock markets fell Thursday morning, it became clear that the previous day’s rally was more likely the eye of the economic storm whipped up byDonald Trump’s chaotic tariff policy rather than its total passage. While investors had cheered Trump’s decision to pause “reciprocal” tariffs for 90 days, Wall Street’s optimism was doused by the administration’s announcement that tariffs on Chinese imports would remain, with the White House clarifying Thursday that China was facing a rate of 145%. Top finance executives I spoke to reacted to the latest market gyrations with a mix of anger, exasperation, and fear. “Everyone feels this is unsustainable. Trump is irrational,” a private-equity executive said Thursday morning. Wall Street prizes stability, which is why Trump’s shambolic tariff rollout has wiped out trillions of dollars of market value. Executives say the on-again, off-again tariffs are evidence of a civil war engulfing Trump’s economic policy team. According to sources close to the White House, Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentand Commerce SecretaryHoward Lutnickhave been at odds over a tariff plan, with Bessent urging discipline and Lutnick encouraging Trump to go big. “The real war is between Howard and Scott,” one of the sources said. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Bessent and Lutnick entered the tariff debate with a complicated history: The twocompetedfiercely for the Treasury secretary post. They also have vastly different styles. Sources say Bessent, a bespectacled former trader atGeorge Soros’s hedge fund, has a deliberative and analytic approach to finance. Lutnick, the former CEO of investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald, is a bombastic MAGA showman. “Scott worked for Soros. He’s a student of Soros’s bookThe Alchemy of Finance.He studies capital flows and currencies,” said one finance writer who has covered Bessent for years. Sources said Bessent worked hard to wrest control of the tariff debate from Lutnick. On Sunday, Bessentreportedlyflew to Florida to lobby Trump to hone his tariff policy messaging and focus on making trade deals. Sources told me that Bessent broke through to Trump when he warned the president on Tuesday that the bond market was flashing red, with dangerous echoes of the 2008 financial crash. Wall Street executives worry that Bessent, the proverbial grown-up in the room, could quit in frustration over Trump’s tariffs. Those fears were stoked last Friday when MSNBC’sStephanie Ruhle,a former finance executive herself, reported onMorning Joethat her sources were talking about Bessent possibly quitting over tariffs. “Some have said to me, ‘He’s looking for an exit door to try to get himself to the Fed,’ because in the last few days he’s really hurting his own credibility and history in the markets,” Ruhle said. However, a person close to Bessent dismissed any idea that he is unhappy in the job. “He and the president are very close. They have a great relationship,” the source said. Bessent declined to comment. Of course, none of this has come as a surprise to Bessent. “He knew what he was signing up for,” one senior bank executive said.

    "article_text": "Eric Dane,best known for playing emotionally tortured hunks on shows includingGrey’s AnatomyandEuphoria,has been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Just days ahead of his April 14 start of filming on the long-gestatingthird season of HBO’sEuphoria,Dane toldPeoplemagazine: “I have been diagnosed with ALS. I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter.” ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a rare neurodegenerative disease that weakens a patient’s ability to control muscle movement, speak clearly, and, eventually, breathe independently. There is no cure for ALS, and people typically live for two to five years after diagnosis, according to theALS Association. However, some patients can live for a decade or more beyond that window. The 52-year-old is married to fellow actorRebecca Gayheart,with whom he shares two daughters—15-year-oldBillieand 13-year-oldGeorgia.“We are best of friends. We are really close,” Gayheart toldE! Newsa day before Dane publicly shared his diagnosis. “We are great coparents…. I think it’s important to not look at a relationship that ends as a failure.” Gayheart filed for divorce from Dane in 2018, butfiled to dismissthe petition just last month. “We were married for—I mean, we are still married, but together for 15 years, and we had two beautiful kids,” she said. “So I think that’s a successful relationship, and that’s how we look at it.” Dane, who found fame playing hotshot plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (a.k.a. McSteamy) onGrey’s Anatomy,went on to lead the TNT naval seriesThe Last Shipand appear in films includingBurlesqueandBad Boys: Ride or Die.His most prominent recent role has beenEuphoria’s Cal, the closeted, embittered father ofJacob Elordi’s Nate. “I don’t know what it’s like to be Cal, but I know what it’s like to live a double life,” DanetoldVanity Fairin 2022. “I’ve had my own experience with drug and alcohol abuse. That’s a double life.” He hasbeen openabout his experience with addiction, voluntarily entering rehabin 2011for a dependency on painkillers following a sports injury. “Trying to keep that secret is tough,” Dane continued. “Eventually everything always catches up with you.” Dane will now return to the part after another life-changing event. “I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to [the] set ofEuphorianext week,” he toldPeople.“I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time.” Meet the Impressive2025 Cannes Film Festival Lineup Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle The Last of UsEnters Its Sophomore Slump The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "Anthony Carrigan Keeps Milking Bit Parts for All They’re Worth",
    "article_text": "InAlways Great, Awards Insider speaks with Hollywood’s greatest undersung actors in career-spanning conversations. In this installment,Anthony Carriganexplains how he pulled off his mostly silent, scene-stealing role in the new A24 filmDeath of a Unicorn—and describes the personal breakthroughs that led to major roles inBarry,the upcomingSuperman,and more. There’s a scene inDeath of a Unicornthat Anthony Carrigan feels particularly proud of, though he’s hardly its focus. It’s a tense moment involving a wealthy patriarch named Odell (Richard E. Grant), his scheming wife Belinda (Téa Leoni), their butler Griff (Carrigan), and as you might surmise from the title, some unicorns. The camera holds on Belinda for the most part, hopeful and in awe of her husband seemingly asserting his dominance. But direct your eye to Griff, lurking in the background, and you’ll find that Carrigan’s expression is one of palpable terror. He solely, completely changes the mood of the scene, even as he’s just helplessly watching on. “I’m really milking the most out of these little bit parts,” the actor says with a laugh. In just a few years, Carrigan has turned literal instances of scene-stealing into a personal signature.Unicorndeploys his gifts deftly: He’s mostly silently reacting until, more than halfway into the movie, his character’s sneaky Scottish accent really reveals itself. This is an actor who’s learned how to calibrate a supporting performance. The Massachusetts native didn’t grow up as the most obvious candidate to run away with star-studded comic films and series. He has alopecia, which caused hair loss from an early age; as a kid, he felt shy and reluctant to express himself. He hated making eye contact. But Carrigan’s first experience in children’s theater showed him how to channel that insecurity. “I wanted to be an actor, but I also didn’t want people to notice my alopecia. It created this interesting schism,” Carrigan says. “It took a while to actually get to the point where I was okay with being seen.” That happened well after Carrigan decided to pursue acting, going on to graduate from Carnegie Mellon’s drama school. When he first started going on auditions, he felt lost, somewhere between his own strengths as an actor and what he assumed casting directors were looking for. “It’s just the absolute worst, in part because it’s a big trap to try to give them what they want,” he says. “It’s almost designed that way.” Around the time he turned 30, he reached a breakthrough when going out for a bruiser-villain role on The CW’s TV version ofThe Flash.He remembers it as the first time he decided to embrace his condition and go completely hairless for a role. “It was a real risk for me to take that leap and try,” he says. “I was so convinced that anyone who saw my alopecia would immediately reject me.” On one hand, great reviews started coming in. On the other, his fear wasn’t totally unfounded. People in several corners of the internet told Carrigan that he should quit acting: peers he admired, producers, even casting directors. “Especially as a young actor, it can be very discombobulating, because you hold the people who are looking after you in very high esteem,” he says. “I was told that I wasn’t attractive anymore. You begin to see very clearly just what it is that people are projecting onto you. It became quite clear to me that I was seeing the limitation of their vision and their scope.” Though the feedback was sometimes cruel, it actually freed Carrigan up. In auditions, he stopped worrying about what the room wanted from him. “The trick is you actually have to take the ball away from them and you have to show them your version,” he says. “It might not be the right thing for them, but it’s going to be unique. It’s going to be different—and you’ll have made it your own.” Carrigan’s wild take on the Batman villain Victor Zsasz inGothamproved a prime example. In his mind, the character—very loosely drawn from the comics—was “an exercise in going in whatever direction I felt like in any given moment.” It helped that Victor was completely out of his mind. The performance resonated as terrifying, hilarious, and endlessly unpredictable. And yet its roots, for Carrigan, were deeply personal. “The way that I would look at people as Victor Zsasz was my version of how people used to look at me and see a spot on my head or an eyebrow missing,” he says. “You go from someone who’s looking at you as a person to, then, someone who’s looking at you as a thing.” Intended as a guest spot, Carrigan kept getting invited back, ultimately appearing in 20 episodes across most ofGotham’s five seasons. It’s not the last time a one-off turned into something much more for Carrigan. Carrigan remains—and may always remain—best known for his indelible, Emmy-nominated turn as the Chechen mafia associate NoHo Hank inBill Hader’s dark hit man comedyBarry. Initially, the character was supposed to get killed off in the first episode. But from day one shooting the pilot, Carrigan really understood the show’s unusual tone—and to anyone watching, it was clear he was doing something special. “One of the sound guys was mic-ing me up the [second] day, and just under his breath, he just goes, ‘Hey, man,’” Carrigan recalls, a reference to Hank’s iconic first line in the show. “They were all saying it around the set. I was like, ‘Oh boy. Okay, we’re onto something here.’” Hank wound up being a pivotal part ofBarry’s DNA through to its endgame. With each season, the character deepened, especially after embarking on a surprisingly warm (then tragic) queer romance. Carrigan could feel the scripts being tailored to his take on the role. “You’re reading it and it already sounds like something that you would say,” Carrigan says. “But Bill is also a big believer of doing it once on the page, and then just having fun and seeing what comes of it. I was so game, and I was so ready. I showed up to work and said, ‘I don’t know where we’re going to go today, but let’s have fun.’” That show seems to have coincided with Carrigan starting to make a name for himself in movies. His first memorable feature role was as an insecure robot inBill & Ted Face the Music—yes, a pretty ideal descriptor for Carrigan’s skill set—and he will next star inAdulthood,a dark comedy directed byBill & TedstarAlex Winter.WithDeath of a Unicorn,Carrigan was welcomed into the A24 stable while holding his own amid big starsPaul Rudd, Jenna Ortega,andWill Poulter.Carrigan gets to show off his accent work, his deftness for physical comedy, and his ability to shine even when he’s deep in the background of a given shot. “It required me to be present, to know when to step back, but then, if something was needed, to follow the impulse,” he says. Carrigan has found a knack for that. Surely the next role where this will come into play is his part inSuperman,James Gunn’s revitalization of the DC franchise. Carrigan is playing Metamorpho, a shape-shifting archeologist who has a heroic role in the story—a much-deserved break from Carrigan’s string of endearing if unhinged villains. It’s the first time this specific character is going from the comics to the big screen. “You don’t want to let the fans down. You want to rise to the occasion. But the only way that you can really deliver is by finding something that is true within yourself and within this character—that meeting point,” Carrigan says. “I think that’s what people will see, hopefully.” In a sign of the changing times for Carrigan, he was sought out for the role. “I’m trying to not talk about this too much, because I hear about these camera tests of the other characters. My God, it sounds like they went through the wringer,” Carrigan says. “It’s like four, five different tests and chemistry reads, this huge process. I’m just over here grateful that I got to just go in for James and read this little scene. That was it.” And why was that? Because Gunn was a fan of Carrigan’s work inBarry. “It’s kind of a trip every time someone brings it up,” Carrigan says. “I just say to myself, ‘Oh yeah—I’m in that movie.’” Meet the Impressive2025 Cannes Film Festival Lineup Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle The Last of UsEnters Its Sophomore Slump The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "How Screwed Is Hollywood Now That Trump Is Playing Chicken With China?",
    "article_text": "It’s official: China isreducing the number of Hollywood filmsallowed to play in the country as part of its ongoing trade war withDonald Trump.Earlier this week,Bloombergreported that China was considering a full-out ban onallHollywood films, so maybe movie executives here should feel lucky that it will only “moderately reduce,” as Bloomberg reports, the number of US movies it imports. “The wrong action of the US government to abuse tariffs on China will inevitably further reduce the domestic audience’s favorability toward American films,” the China Film Administration said in a statement. What films will be targeted? And how many? That remains to be seen. While Trump put many of his global tariffs on pause, he remains resolute on keeping enormous tariffs on China, having announced that they will be increased to 125% from the initially proposed 104%. Some analysts have argued that China is no longer a major player in the global box office, but try telling that to last year’sAlien: Romulus,which grossed approximately $110 million there, accounting for about 30% of its total global gross, according to Box Office Mojo. Without China,Romuluswould have been a moderate success, but not a surprise hit. Just last week, Warner Bros. and Legendary’sA Minecraft Movieopened number one in China with sales of $14.5 million,according to Deadline. In 2024, the biggest US release in the country was another team-up from Warner Bros. and Legendary,Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire,which grossed $132 million. These numbers are a lot more than rounding errors when it comes to calculating a film’s success—and its chances for a sequel. Sequels, of course, are still what most Hollywood execs dream about at night. In the past, studios have agreed to tweak their films to access the Chinese market.Transformers: Age of Extinction,whose world premiere took place in Hong Kong, inexplicably features a Chinese ATM in a scene that takes place in Texas. China has been clamping down on Hollywood releases in the country for well over a decade, instead focusing on building its own film industry. Just this year,Ne Zha 2,a Chinese animated adventure film, grossed a staggering nearly $2 billion at the global box office. Even if the government has only partially limited the number of Hollywood films it will exhibit, it’s striking a blow to the upcoming blockbuster summer season. The most worrisome issue here is that there isn’t much Hollywood can do to appease the Chinese government. In the past, studios have agreed to make changes to their films to gain access to the Chinese market.Transformers: Age of Extinction,whose world premiere took place in Hong Kong, inexplicably features a Chinese ATM in a scene that takes place in Texas. Warner Bros. Discovery president and CEODavid Zaslavinitially praised Trump’s election, saying that his policies could offer “a pace of change and opportunity for consolidation.” This probably isn’t the change Zaslav wanted to believe in. Marvel, which will releaseThunderbolts*in May and the revampedThe Fantastic Four: First Stepsin July, has had issues with its films releasing in China before;Spider-Man: No Way Homewas barred from release. On the other hand,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3did get a release in China and wound up grossing over $86 million there—which ain’t nothing at a time when a beleaguered Hollywood will takeanything. Marvel just released aThunderbolts*international poster announcing an April 30 release date in China, but that could change if China decides to give the movie the axe as it reduces imports. This summer, the Marvel Cinematic Universe is at an inflection point. WithThunderbolts*andFantastic Four,the studio is introducing new characters it hopes audiences will connect with enough to energize its Phase Six series of films—most notably withAvengers: Doomsday,now in production. With this much on the line, the thought of a bump in the road may be enough to make Hulk go smash. In July, Universal is soft-rebooting (is that what it’s called?) itsJurassicfranchise with theScarlett Johansson–ledJurassic World Rebirth.TheJurassicseries has done major business at the Chinese box office.Jurassic World: Dominionmade over $157 million there,Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdomover $261 million, andJurassic Worldover $228 million. It could have great implications on the future of this relaunch if it cannot get a release in the country. The Mount Everest of recent box office success in China is, of course,Avatar: The Way of Water,which was the country’s second-highest-grossing film of 2022, making over $245 million in China alone. WithAvatar: Fire and Asharriving this December, Disney surely wants to replicate those numbers. It’s too soon to tell if the trade war will make that impossible.

    "title": "Kaitlan Collins Is CNN’s “Joyful Warrior” Covering Trump 2.0",
    "article_text": "Around 15 minutes to airtime,Kaitlan Collinsgot some breaking news out of the White House.Donald Trump’s team was seeking to clarify hisremarksearlier that day regarding an executive order invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members, the subject of yet another court fight early in his presidency. Collins, wearing a vibrant fuchsia suit and pointed-toe nude pumps, read the White House statement aloud at CNN’s Hudson Yards studios, indicating to her production team to quickly integrate it into the top of that evening’s show. CNN senior legal analystElie Honig,who was seated at a nearby table, preparing to offer his thoughts on the developments for viewers, quipped that the Trump administration’s actions were “straight out ofVeep.” Moments later, the crew was counting down, and Collins was on air, opening her9 p.m. showwith her signature line “straight from the source tonight” and the news that Trump was claiming he “didn’t sign what might be his most controversial order yet.” Such is life in a Trump news cycle, which Collins, 33, has been steeped in now for nearly a decade. After covering Trump’s 2016 campaign and his early days at the White House for the conservative Daily Caller, Collins decamped to CNN and emerged as one of cable network’s standout correspondents during the first term. Collins, just a few years out of the University of Alabama, showed remarkable composure in challenging Trump during those years and dealing with his“fake news” retorts.Jeff Zucker,the former CNN CEO who hired Collins, suggests she may be “the last great star that cable news produces.” As the TV news industry contracts, and bloated salaries for star anchors are looking like athing ofthe past, Collins’s multiplatform prowess—breaking news online, doing live hits throughout the day, anchoring at night, and sharing verticalvideosoutside the White House on Instagram—certainly looks like a model for a next-generation cable news star. Collins, whomovedto New York to cohost the short-livedCNN This Morning,has lately been anchoringThe Sourcefrom Washington DC in order to perform her duties as a prime-time anchorandas CNN’srecently namedchief White House correspondent. It’s in the latter role that she’s continued enduring Trump’s wrath, like when sheinterjectedin a February press conference to ask if he trusts Russian presidentVladimir Putin.“Nobody watches CNN anymore. Because they have no credibility,” he shot back. As Collins tells me, “Trump’s response was to criticize me and then criticize CNN, even though it was a totally legitimate question,” she says, “which I think is a distraction technique.” More recently, Trumpsnappedat Collins as she pressed him on Signalgate: “Excuse me, I didn’t pick you.” Despite public clashes with the 45th and 47th president—or, partly, because of them?—CNN executives have kept Collins front-and-center in the Trump era.Chris Licht,who briefly succeeded Zucker, assigned Collins to moderate aninfamous Trump town hallin 2023, while current chiefMark Thompsonhas tasked her with covering the second term. “Kaitlan is not just a brilliant prime-time anchor but one of our very best reporters—fair, well-sourced, and not afraid to stand up to anybody,” Thompson says. Collins recalls the CNN boss telling her that she’d be returning to the White House after the November election. “I was like, ‘Oh, for 100 days or something?’” Collins had asked. “No,” Thompson replied. “Four years.” I met Collins on an absurdly windy day in March for lunch at Locanda Verde, steps away from CNN’s Hudson Yards headquarters. Walking into the restaurant, I looked as though I just went skydiving. When Collins appeared, however—in a chic denim set, paired with a sage green Bottega Veneta woven leather bag—not a single strand of hair was out of place from her signature shiny blowout, which was tucked behind slim tortoise shell Celine sunglasses perched on top of her head. Not only that, but she told me that before she flew in from DC that morning, she had already worked out. Collins acknowledges her “crazy” schedule, which includes typically boarding a 9 a.m. train for Washington on Monday in the event of an afternoon White House daily briefing. “I like to just be there because even if there’s nothing on the schedule, something will inevitably happen,” Collins says, adding that “the worst thing that would happen is me not being there.” She spends weekdays reporting from the White House, before heading in the evening to CNN’s Washington bureau to anchorThe Source.“When I’m leaving the White House, I have this head fake where I feel like I’m leaving work, like I’m done, and then I’m like, wait, I’m going to my other job,” she says. Then there are thereallyexhausting days. Collins recalls one Friday in February when she flew back to New York in the morning, before the White House announced a press conference later that day with Japanese prime ministerShigeru Ishiba.So Collins flew back to Washington for the 2 p.m. presser, during which sheaskedTrump whether he planned to fire FBI agents who worked on January 6 cases, and then flew to New York to tapeThe Source. When I ask about fears of burnout, Collins explains that her passion for her work overrides the exhaustion. “The more you do, the more energy you have,” she tells me. “Her work ethic is second to none,” Zucker says. “She is incredibly committed to her work and her profession. That’s why this idea of her anchoring a daily show and also being the chief White House correspondent shouldn’t phase anyone. That’s just par for the course for Kaitlan.” CNN’sWolf Blitzer,who Collins considers her “buddy” and a “huge mentor,” also had high praise for the young chief White House correspondent, a role he once occupied himself, telling me that the job “is one of unique history and responsibility—which can be overwhelming, but I never worried about that with Kaitlan. She’s relentless, in the best possible way.” Collins describes herself as a “joyful warrior,” who is willing to follow the news wherever it takes her, whether that be the White House, Israel, Ukraine, or anywhere there is a story to cover. “I go where they tell me,” she says. For all the president’s grumbling about Collins’s questions and the supposed bias of the network she’s now affiliated with, her path to covering the White House notably began on the right, under the guidance of one of the president’s most influential media boosters. “If I hadn’t worked at the Daily Caller, I don’t know if I’d be covering Trump,” says Collins, who credits her former boss, Daily Caller cofounderTucker Carlson,with encouraging her to report on the 2016 election. Working at the Daily Caller, she says, “was helpful to me in covering Trump because it was all these Trump-ish people, people who went on to become huge Trump supporters, including Tucker, and I worked with him every day.” She continues, “I have never been like, opinionated or ideological, but I could see the shifting on the right of, being like, they didn’t love Trump either, and then totally embraced him when they realized that he was gonna be the nominee.” It was in April 2017 that Collins’s CNN career began to come into focus. She recalls attending the network’s brunch the morning after the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, a Sunday soiree populated by hungover journalists. But Collins had turned in early due to a TV appearance that morning and arrived at brunch “fresh as a daisy,” as she puts it. Colllins recalls chatting with media reporterOliver Darcy,who had recently joined CNN, when she spotted Zucker and introduced herself. But Collins had already made an impression on Zucker, who tells me he noticed her work for the Daily Caller. “She was very young, and she was very impressive within the White House press briefing room and at press conferences,” he says. “She showed an extraordinary amount of poise for someone so young.” Later, at brunch, Zucker introduced Collins toVirginia Moseley,CNN’s executive editor, which “jump-started my interview process,” she says, and an offer followed soon after. Collins also impressed her colleagues in the briefing room and was elected to serve as president of the White House Correspondents Association for the 2024–25 term. She relinquished the post when landing the New York–based morning show job, though she is, of course, concerned about rifts between the president and the press corps. The WHCA, which will hold its annual dinner later this month, is in a beleaguered state, with the White Housetaking overone of its key roles (running the daily press pool) andreportedly planningto grab another (briefing room seating). The White House has alsobannedthe Associated Press for sticking with “Gulf of Mexico,” a move Collins describes as “obviously retaliatory in nature” and likens the experience to her gettingbarredfrom covering a Rose Garden event in 2018. “It’s like what they tried to do to me,” she says. At the time, Collins recalls members of the WHCA having her back, singling out Fox News’sBret Baierfor his support. “It meant a lot,” she says. She rejects the idea that the current WHCA is “leaving people out” and notes that the Daily Caller, which was critical ofBarack Obama,joined the group during his presidency. “I’m all for more people coming in,” she says, adding, “But when you start taking people away, or removing people or banning them, that is where it’s dangerous territory. That’s kind of the moment we’re at now.” Collins praises MSNBC’sEugene Daniels,the current WHCA president, as having done a “good job” in a “tough moment to navigate,” adding that he’s “negotiating with [the White House] while covering them.” As we spoke over multiple cups of coffee, Collins seemed somewhat uncomfortable with being on the other side of an interview and having to talk so much about herself, repeatedly giving credit to her team and others for her success. Though she casually mentioned texting withCharles Barkley,playfully taunting the famed Auburn alumni about March Madness, she can also seem blissfully unaware that appearing daily on television has given her celebrity status. Look no further than theDaily Mail,which, in addition to publishingdozens of storiesabout things Collins has said on CNN, or what others in media and politics have said about her, has also coveredher dating life. Still, Collins appeared shocked and touched when a fan, who identified himself as a former journalist from Panama, came over to the table to introduce himself and ask her for a photo. “I have to say that I admire you so much,” he told her. Collins was gracious in her response and seemed genuinely interested in the man’s story. (CNN assured me the moment wasn’t a setup!) Collins isn’t the only young star on the network: 36-year-oldAbby PhilliphostsCNN NewsNightat 10 p.m. hour. And other CNN correspondents have rankled Trump—most notably, now former correspondentJim Acosta. But Collins’s role in this new Trump era, encompassing dayside White House reporting and nightly hosting duties, appears distinct. She is also serving as a moderator for major political events,includingThursday night’s battleground-states town hall alongsideJake Tapper. Recently, alongside all her other responsibilities, you might see Collins sharing her reporting from the White House in cell-phone videos promoted by CNN’s social media profiles. The initiative excites her, saying Thompson is “leading CNN through a really crazy time and a difficult time, but also an important one.” The digital strategies that Thompson is “implementing and incorporating are so smart because it’s how we get our news these days,” Collins says. As Thompson tells me, “Kaitlan is a digital native who is as accomplished joining a live chat or updating the audience on vertical video as she is occupying the chair at 9 o’clock.” After lunch, Collins races over to CNN’s offices to meet with her New York–based production team for the first time in three weeks, given that she’s been spending much of Trump’s first months in office in DC. The pace may have taken a toll on her team, as her executive producer,Kristin Donnelly,abruptlyresignedfrom the role in February. When I ask about the departure, Collins’s response reflected the amount of work expected of not only her job, but of those behind the camera, saying, “There are no days off. You can’t have a chill Friday. If you ever think it’s going to be chill, it’s guaranteed to not be.” On any given night, Collins is tackling the latest revelations out of the White House and their reverberations on Wall Street or around the globe. She’s managed to book guests of varying political views, whether that’s independent senatorBernie Sandersor Republican senatorMarkwayne Mullin,as well as people from inside the Trump administration, including Secretary of CommerceHoward Lutnick.Sometimes the show can get “heated, but it’s always substantive and informative,” Collins said. “No one gets to come on and just do talking points.” She recalls aninterviewwith Lutnick that went “off the rails on vaccines” before the election. “There’s a moment in the interview where I was like, ‘Okay, I did not think that we were going here,’” Collins says, adding, “You can’t just go back to having a normal conversation after that because the viewers would be like WTF?” On challenging Lutnick, Collins tells me, “You have to follow where the news goes, but also balance it by keeping it on track and not letting them dictate where it goes.” Occasionally, newsmakers push back against the anchor on the basis of their perceived issues with the mainstream media or CNN specifically. When I ask whether it bothers her, Collins says: “Let them. If they do that, or if they say, well this is not what this interview is supposed to be about, then I already know that I’ve won because they’re deflecting. They don’t know how to answer the question because if you have an answer, you’d give it.” And when the criticism is coming from the president, she says, “My feeling is to not take it personally because if you respond to that, then it’s getting away from the point of the question we’re asking, which is way more important than a conflict with the president of the United States.” Meet the Impressive2025 Cannes Film Festival Lineup Karen Read’s Second Murder Trial Is Already a Spectacle The Last of UsEnters Its Sophomore Slump The WatchThat Links the Kennedys to Kim Kardashian—and a Real Housewife AsTwin PeaksTurns 35, theMystery Is Still the Message Dying for Sex: The True Story of a Cancer Patient TurnedSexual Explorer Tom Hanks Is Supportive of HisDaughter’s Revealing MemoirAbout Her Troubled Childhood DidBiden’s AidesCover Up His Mental State—or Was It Group Delusion?

    "title": "The Pitt’s Taylor Dearden on That Moving Finale and Building a Nuanced Neurodivergent Character",
    "article_text": "Thefirst seasonofThe Pittintroduced dozens of characters who work at the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Hospital, but none have broken out quite likeTaylor Dearden’s Dr. Melissa “Mel” King. The second-year resident is highly capable, emotionally attuned, and somewhat insecure as to whether she has the “special sauce” to become a great doctor. But in Thursday’s season finale, she makes some bold choices that prove she’s well on her way—specifically, fast-tracking a life-saving spinal tap operation for a child with measles, even though his anti-vaxx mother disapproves of the procedure. Mel has also resonated as a nuanced portrait of a neurodivergent professional in large part thanks to Dearden, who herself is neurodivergent.The Pittsubtly pushes back on some clichés while allowing the actor—previously best known for her turns inAmerican VandalandSweet/Vicious—to flesh Mel out over 15 episodes, each of which covers an hour in a nightmarish ER shift that culminates ina mass-casualty event. The endeavor was not always easy, given the wayThe Pittwas developed by creatorR. Scott Gemmill,writer and starNoah Wyle,and the rest of its producing team. In conversation withVanity Fair,Dearden looks back on the “anxious” making of season one and ahead to what she hopes to get out of season two—which is comingsooner than you think. Vanity Fair:Are you in production on season two yet? Taylor Dearden:No, we start bootcamp June 1. We know literally nothing, which is making me very, very anxious. Tell me about bootcamp. For season one, it was two weeks, and it was going over everything standard when a trauma comes in: “Here are the things that happen. We’ll just randomly assign you to scenes that will take place, like you’ll do the ultrasound.” So we knew what ultrasound meant, where we go, how you hold it, and all of it so that they could just do shorthand with us and not have to teach us every single time. They went over the first half of the injuries that were going to come in. But I really wish there was another bootcamp in the middle of the season to do the last injuries, because then we had to learn again. I heard season two bootcamp is only one week. We all were like, “Can we please have two weeks?” Dearden inThe Pitt. In the finale, your character performs a spinal tap on a child who’s contracted measles. Did you feel prepared for that? How did you do it? I stayed after shooting to learn how to do it in one day. I was like, “It sounds scary,” but all the doctors went, ’You do these all the time.” And I went, “Really? Because it sounds terrifying.” What a great rig they had there. Our makeup department is insane. It was a fake back that had IV packages inside, and so you’re puncturing the fake skin, and then you could literally feel the second puncture—which is great, because there are two puncture feelings with a spinal tap. Mel is performing this quickly, against the clock, because the child’s mom is against the procedure. It’s definitely the first time you see Mel be sneaky for a patient’s benefit. At the beginning of the shift, I don’t know if she would’ve been this sneaky. By the end, having seen what happens, I think she’s like, “Sometimes you’ve got to break the rules.” I thought it was really fun to show that. The show has dealt with so many timely issues. How did you feel that Mel’s final arc surrounded a thorny conversation around measles and— —anti-vaxxers? Yeah. It was great. I remember just reading that there have been many outbreaks.Kids die. They die. And it’s just such a strange—I can’t get into that mindset. I have no idea why they feel that way, especially when they talk about neurodivergence. Like, “All of a sudden, this shot gives you autism.” Really, you think that? Okay, I’m just going to walk away from this conversation. It’s all really bizarre, especially when it’s something like measles that is easily eradicated if you just have your shots. Seeing especially how fast things move during the mass-casualty [event], Mel was the one that suggested, “What if we start donating our blood” Already knowing protocol—knowing that that’s so not allowed—and going, “Fuck it, we have to do it.” I like that evolution of Mel’s character, of becoming so much more of an advocate for the patient. It’s less about getting it done legally and with permission, and more about saving lives. You’ve talked about pitching Noah on an idea for Mel early in the season, drawn from your own experiences with neurodivergence. Did you feel confident from the jump to advocate for your character like that? Not really. They had all the scripts written, but we didn’t get to see them or know what happens. So we were like, “If I do this, will it make sense for the next few episodes?” On individual days, you could pitch something, and usually, if it made sense, they’d hear you out. And maybe you could do a few versions your way and then the other way. With Noah, I was just like, “I don’t think it’s a good character choice to have a mumbly-fumbly, constant anxiety person. Then it’s just comic relief, as opposed to real character.” I was trying to think of ways to build confidence, and I pitched what is a very real ADHD thing, which is we are just amazing at emergencies. Something in our brain clicks. We can do things that we read about once freshman year. All of a sudden, we can pull it out. This is an actual medical thing. We are overrepresented in emergency departments and firefighters, because there is some weird part of the ADHD brain that clicks into the perfect emergency person. My dad[Bryan Cranston]has ADHD, too, so if I’m ever sick or anything, I just call him. Did they tell you why they didn’t want you to know what happens from episode to episode? With Noah, he went, “That works.” I went, “It does?” He was like, “By this episode you should start getting more and more confident.” But I don’t know. I think there’s an idea from the writer-producer perspective of, “How cool would it be if they don’t know?” But every actor goes, “It would be great if we knew everything, actually!” With plays, we know absolutely everything about the playwright. We’ve researched every part of not only the actual play itself, the script, but everything about the history of the time. We can tell you exactly how everyone would stand during a period piece, and it still looks like we’re surprised at the end. I will always be better if the actors know more than less, if they know the whole script. It actually has a cohesive start, middle, finish. If you don’t know, then you can’t do much layering. Do you have hopes that that will change in season two? Oh, God, yes. Do you expect it to change? No. We have no clue. I see Noah and I’ll go, “How’s it going? Anything you can say?” He’s like, “Nope.” It’s like, “Are you kidding me?” Going back to that example of pitching Noah, did you find there was some level of educating the writers or producers on neurodivergence, and how to depict it? Because it was all written already, it was tough to get anything else. I do hope in season two that there’s more obviousstimming. It’s something that people will see—like repeating words, or liking patterns and textures and stuff. But they don’t know that there’s other stuff involved—something tactile. You’d be watching the lava lamp while having a worry stone or something that you could touch at the same time. Stuff like that, it’s what I know I do. It’s just really specific and accurate. But they were really good about listening and trying to take in different things. It’s one thing writing after you’ve researched some, but a lot of stuff gets missed if you’re either not around someone constantly or don’t have that yourself. Dearden with Noah Wyle and Brandon Mendez Homer. Mel’s emotional connection to her patients felt particularly gratifying to me as a viewer—pushing back on stereotypes of neurodivergent people you often see on screen. Yeah, I don’t know why the usual depiction is without any emotion or empathy. It’s like robots. It’s got to be just people watching and judging. The thing that is never shown, that is definitely most of the difficulty I have with my neurodivergence, is overwhelm. I won’t be able to have the right intonation on this sentence because I’m overwhelmed; we get angry or whatever because of being overwhelmed, usually. Hopefully, I did a decent job of showing that it’s not robotic. That’s the totally wrong version of it. Things are happening in our heads so much faster and more intensely than everyone else that it’s hard to be able to focus on how it comes out of your mouth when you’ve got eight billion other things going. Our brains are working way faster. Viewers have connected with Mel in a pretty profound way. How have you experienced that? I’m not very good at social media. I actually genuinely forget I have a phone most times. Every time I do, I go, “Oh, I should check this,” and it’s a good overwhelm to see messages of other neurodivergent people reaching out. It’s great to see, and I just hope I can continue doing right by my community. There’s a show on right now that definitely has a very judged neurodivergent character, and it’s just the same kind of robot, numb feeling. If they get in trouble, they just pretend like they don’t understand anything. It’s like, oh, my God, no. We’re usually panicked that we hurt someone. We don’t know how we can change it, we don’t know what it was that did that. Really, it’s just so annoying to see that. Mel has been in the ER for 15 hours, and she seems as together as anybody there. At one point, Dr. Mohan asks her how she’s still standing. Where did you feel like Mel was by season’s end? How did you want to play her in the finale? Mohan feels like she’s got this high. She could go all night. And then she has that crash—and I think Mel’s crash is much less of a crash. The time it took to drive from the hospital to the adult care facility to pick up her sister was enough time to go, “Oh, I could really sleep right now if I could.” But I think still there’s so much energy in her that it just clicks in. It was nice to see Mel get her last moment in the season out of the ER, with her sister. It was weird because everyone but me andPatrick [Ball, who plays Dr. Langdon] went to Pittsburgh to shoot, and we were just here. It was the first time we were out that wasn’t the ambulance bay at St. James, and it was really nice. It reminded me of what I have usually filmed, which is on location, pretty much. I like any time when you can see what Mel is like when the anxiety is lessened, when she’s actually much more comfortable. She is different—not so dramatically different that you can’t recognize her, but she’s more relaxed. Because Mel’s had this long day and we had a long shoot, it really was easy to get into the mindset of, “I can’t worry as much, I just have to get this done.” It’s how I felt too—being so anxious for the first Lord knows how many episodes, and by the end being like, “I can barely talk or walk.” It accidentally worked really well. What was the source of the anxiety for you at the beginning? We don’t have a lot of rehearsal at all, and it’s stuff that we’ve never ever done before. It was going really, really fast. Trying to put together very specific choreography, and a bunch of Greek and Latin terms that don’t really mean anything to you at the same time as having maybe half a rehearsal, then starting filming—it’s beyond anxiety-invoking. Mel and Langdon don’t get a final moment together in the finale, but their bond has been one of the sweetest parts of the show. What did you make of that—how they’re leaving each other for the day, given that Langdon’s fate at the hospital is so up in the air? I definitely think Mel thinks that, next shift, she’ll see him—and the audience knows she won’t. Mel has no idea. So what’s your hope for season two? I would love to see some friendship, to have something more on the peer level, or someone who genuinely tries to understand Mel’s neurodivergence. With me, it’s so helpful to have either a partner or friends who know what your neurodivergence is so that, when I will inevitably put my foot in my mouth, they’ll be able to come in and go, “She means this.” To not have any ally like that at work with such an intense job would be really tough—to just constantly be misunderstood, without anyone trying to understand. I’d love to see someone get it and latch on. This interview has been edited and condensed.

    "article_text": "But Director of Health Dr Ronald Lam defends annual expenditure as necessary for early warning system and to ‘safeguard the southern gateway of China’ Health screenings at Hong Kong’s border control points must be maintained to identify early threats of infectious diseases, authorities have said, after lawmakers questioned the need to spend more than HK$200 million (US$25.77 million) on such measures annually when the Covid-19 pandemic was over. Director of Health Dr Ronald Lam Man-kin insisted on Friday that the screenings, which included monitoring the body temperature of arrivals, at the city’s 13 border control points was necessary. “To prevent the import of infectious diseases to Hong Kong, health screenings at the airport and other border control points are very important to help identify the risks,” Lam told a Legislative Council meeting. “Hong Kong must safeguard the southern gateway of China.” Even a single patient could become a disease superspreader, he cautioned. Lawmakers questioned whether the HK$205 million spent on health screenings in the past financial year was excessive. Last year, 4,214 travellers with a fever were identified by the system, while another six who fulfilled the reporting criteria of a major infectious disease were referred to public hospitals for further check-ups. “As the global epidemic situation has become stable and our resources are rather tight, would authorities consider cancelling or scaling down the screening work, and use the resources on areas that are in greater need?” Chan Pui-leung, from the Election Committee constituency, said.",

The city’s tourism minister had on Thursday cautioned against building more infrastructure at the High Island Reservoir East Dam, which is part of the city’s Unesco Global Geopark in Sai Kung East, because of the potentially harmful impact on the environment. The wider location has become a popular hotspot for visitors and is promoted on various mainland Chinese social media platforms. Images posted online showed hundreds of visitors waiting at the geopark to get minibuses during public holidays. “The site is located in a restricted area where visitors can only walk, or take minibuses or taxis to reach the location, which may result in many people waiting to leave in the evening,” lawmaker Stanley Li Sai-wing told a radio programme on Friday. “I hope minibus operators can extend their service hours to handle the long queue of visitors.”",

    "title": "Bulldozers to move in on 'Scotland's Chernobyl'",
    "article_text": "A derelict housing estate dubbed \"Scotland's Chernobyl\" for its eerie ghost-town like appearance is finally about to be razed to the ground. The tenements at Clune Park in the Inverclyde town of Port Glasgow were built a century ago as housing for shipyard workers but have lain mostly abandoned for years. A stand-off between private landlords and the local council has thwarted redevelopment, leaving the site frozen in time with just a handful of tenants remaining. Demolition contractors are expected on site within days, preparing to take down a third of the buildings, including a fire-damaged school and crumbling church, after they were condemned as structurally unsafe. The run-down estate has in recent years become a magnet for urban explorers and photographers, forcing the authorities to step up security patrols and issue danger warnings. Comparisons have often been made with the Ukrainian city of Pripyat, abandoned after the 1986 explosion at the Chernobyl nuclear plant led to a huge radiation leak. Clune Park was first described as Scotland's Chernobyl more than a decade ago, and the name has stuck. Local politicians say it was an easy badge to apply to the area because of its desolate nature. Beyond superficial appearances, though, their stories are very different. The red sandstone-fronted tenement blocks radiating off the town's Robert Street were built just after World War One by shipbuilder Lithgows to house its workforce. Back then the waterfronts of Port Glasgow and neighbouring Greenock were filled with shipyards. It was densely packed housing - 430 bedsits and flats, mostly in four-storey blocks - but there was a church, a school, local shops and a sense of community. Former resident Karen Thomson and her husband Allan bought their first flat together as a married couple in Wallace Street in 1992, and stayed for six years. \"It was lovely - the neighbours were nice. It was a nice area, it was very friendly - everybody knew everybody,\" recalled Karen. \"It was very busy and the houses were sought after. It was very hard to get one of the houses in the area.\" But Clyde shipbuilding had long been in decline, people were moving out and the cheap flats were increasingly bought up as rental investments. Karen said: \"The area was starting to fall down, they weren't keeping maintenance on it - the area started going to pot. I don't think they were putting money into it.\" Clune Park fell into a spiral of decline, with property values plummeting further as it acquired a reputation for drug use and crime. Retired forestry worker Marshal Craig, 73, is one of a handful of remaining residents. He's lived at Clune Park for 20 years and his current rented flat on the edge of the estate is in far better condition than most. He describes it as the \"posh end\". Some years ago he was hospitalised from smoke inhalation caused by one of the frequent deliberate fires in the abandoned buildings. But as a keen reader, guitar player and nature lover, he values the quietness. \"There's seventeen different species of tree across the road,\" he said. \"At night you've got the foxes and owls and all the rest of it. I love that.\" His block is not yet scheduled for demolition and his landlord is in no hurry to sell, so for the moment Marshal is staying put. His home is well-decorated, boasts a large bay window and a Chesterfield sofa - all in stark contrast to the dereliction of the empty flats just a stone's throw away. \"People go how can you live there, are you not scared?\" he says. \"I'm not scared. I'm a big guy - or I used to be. It suits me but it doesn't suit everybody and it doesn't suit the council.\" A regeneration plan drawn up more than a decade ago proposed total demolition and rebuilding but ran into the buffers when some owners mounted a successful legal challenge. Since then the council has steadily bought up the flats to the point where it now owns about two thirds of the properties. The first phase of demolition will see the church, the school and 15 of the 45 tenement blocks taken down, 138 flats in total - but the plan is for them all to go eventually. The former Clune Park Primary School is one of the oldest buildings on the site, founded in 1887 - the year of Queen Victoria's jubilee. Busts of Victoria and Prince Albert jut out from either side of the doorway, while higher on the wall is the Port Glasgow coat of arms, a three-masted sailing ship and the Latin motto \"Ter Et Quater Anno Revisens Aequor Atlanticum Impune\". It translates as \"Three and four times a year revisiting the Atlantic with impunity\" - a reference to the ships that once fetched huge logs from Canada, to be seasoned in the \"timber ponds\" of the Clyde before being used for shipbuilding. The demolition contractors say they will try to preserve the best stonework features by removing them by hand. When the school closed in 2008, former pupils reminisced on social media about the grand staircase, the comforting smell of wooden floors and favourite teachers. The building is B-listed - meaning it has regional importance. Under the council's original regeneration plan, the frontage would have been retained and the site developed into an energy centre, providing low emission heating. Buta fire in 2023 gutted the schooland it is now deemed beyond repair. Next to the school stands the shell of Clune Park Church, built in 1905 from red sandstone in the late Gothic \"Modern Movement\" style of architecture. It has an ornate art nouveau-style window and, like the school, is B-listed by Historic Environment Scotland. But the building's decay is now so far advanced, permission has been granted for demolition.  The roof is long gone and huge timber roof trusses that once supported it have been stacked up in the street outside. The Clune Park tenements are unusual in the west of Scotland in that they have flat concrete roofs which the council says are suffering from \"corrosion swelling\". Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe says back in the 1990s refurbishment was considered but no funding was available and a complete rebuild was thought better value. But he says the council has faced a long \"war of attrition\" to identify owners and buy up the properties, with valuations often coming in at just a few thousand pounds. Ultimately the plan is to replace the 430 flats with 165 new affordable homes with the investment coming from a social landlord. \"The start of the demolition will be a real sign that we're getting there and we will ultimately demolish all of those properties,\" said McCabe. \"That will be a day for celebration\". But with around 100 flats still in private hands there's no clear timescale for when that will happen. The demolition contractors expect to start taking down the first buildings later this month. While it marks the beginning of the end for \"Scotland's Chernobyl\" it may be some time yet before a new Clune Park rises from the rubble. The development site is close to land where Universal is planning on building a theme park. Often dubbed \"Scotland's Chernobyl\", only a handful of residents remain in Clune Park in Port Glasgow. One of the men had to be treated in hospital after being freed by the emergency services on 15 March. Scotland's publicly-owned ferries procurement firm says it has to be fair to overseas bidders. The restoration is one of a number of projects aimed at improving the town centre.",

    "article_text": "It's the closest I've come to feeling like I'm actually playing a game of football in a videogame. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Every now and then a game comes along that seems unassuming at first but totally blows away all of your expectations and reveals itself to be something special. Rematch is one of those games. Yes, it's football, but it's far closer to the likes of Rocket League and Overwatch than it is to FIFA and is all about action and teamplay. Trailers really don't do this game justice (although you can watch the latest one above). Watching people run around a pitch, even when extremely stylish, can't capture just how good this feels to play. Rematch is the closest I've come to feeling like I'm actually playing a game of football. Instead of playing as a whole team like in FIFA and other football games, you control just one player in a team of three to five people. You need to run and react to every pass and tackle, and really work hard to aim your shots and score a goal. Even if you're not a fan of football, I'm confident that the fast-paced drama will win you over. Rematch is being made by Sloclap, creators of martial arts games Absolver and Sifu, and it shows in the sense of bodily control and opportunities for reaction. We were trying to get to that core essence of at least part of what makes football so much fun and a beautiful sport. \"We want you to feel like an amazing athlete,\" creative director Pierre Tarno told PC Gamer at a recent studio visit in Paris. \"We want players to feel the high stakes pressure of football. We were trying to get to that core essence of at least part of what makes football so much fun and a beautiful sport.\" Put most simply by the developer: FIFA is a football simulation, while Rematch is a footballplayersimulation. Rematch will launch later this summer with four modes—3v3, 4v4, 5v5, and a ranked 5v5 with other modes to be added in later seasons. Matches last about six minutes, but can spill into overtime and for now things are multiplayer only, with bots for solo play being worked towards for season 3 in 2026. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"For me, where the game strikes the best balance of action, engagement, and tactical gameplay is 5v5, and that's why I think it makes sense to have it as the main competitive game mode,\" Tarno said. \"But new game modes, even fun ones, if they're popular enough and deep enough could find their way into competitive queues. We're very open to mixing things around.\" I played a few rounds of 4v4 and 5v5—the pitch changing sizes slightly to create more heated games when there are fewer players. By my third match, I was hooked. The simple act of connecting with the ball and making things happen feels amazing. Chasing it down after the opposing team fumbled a shot then passing it further upfield to line up a shot made me feel like a hero just as much as getting in a few cheeky goals. As I got deeper into it, I started picking up more techniques like overhead passes and volleys. There's also a stamina bar that allows you to put on extra bursts of speed to really launch yourself into every charge and a short 'extra effort' opportunity to push yourself to the limit. You can also swap playing positions on the fly during a match—goalkeepers aren't locked in and are encouraged to step out of the penalty box to become a part of offensive pushes. If things start to go a bit wrong anyone can step in to play keeper, too. It's down to whoever reaches the backend of the pitch first to take up the gloves. You'll be randomly assigned a spot at the start of each game, but you never have to stick to it—if someone else prefers to play goal it's a very quick changeover and means that no one has to feel left behind or pressured into any position. When in possession of the ball you're particularly vulnerable to having it stolen from you via tackles so you'll need to try to push it ahead of you and keep passing to keep up that frenetic tempo. The drawback of online play, however, and a side effect of all that pressure is that people's 'passion' for the game might bubble over in unsavoury ways. Encouraging healthy teamplay is a design problem, says Tarno, and one hope is that the setting will encourage friendly behavior. Rematch takes place in an \"optimistic future\" that has embraced clean energy sources such as solar and wind farms, a \"colorful and cheerful\" world that's about \"the joy of playing with friends.\" The developer has also noticed that teamwork tends to emerge naturally, because whoever has the ball is in danger of having it taken from them. \"There's more of an advantage to defense than to offense,\" Tarno said. \"So vulnerability in possession is something that spontaneously generates team play. When we ran load tests, we were playing games—solo queuing against randoms who didn't know each other—and they were passing the ball. It was one thing that really was a relief. Because I was a bit scared of every time somebody gets the ball, they try to be the hero and be the star of the show etc. But since it's a risk to dribble and the winning strategy is to construct an action and a team play.\" And if all that fails there's always mute and block options and Sloclap will be monitoring griefing techniques—they've already made sure that the goalkeeper can't just catch and chuck a ball into their own goal to annoy their team. Rematch will be out on June 19 for $30—it's got aSteam page here—and there are opportunities to play it in invite-only betas before then.

    "article_text": "On Tuesday, April 15, we're all returning to Faerûn. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Larian has finally announced a date for Baldur's Gate 3 patch eight, an enormous update to our 2023 game of the year andTop 100champion. The update will go live on Tuesday, April 15, with a special launch stream on Larian's YouTubeChannel From Hellset for the following day. All of BG3's numbered updates have been quite substantial: Patch five at the end of 2023 introduced thepermadeath Honour mode, while the most recent patch sevenexpanded BG3's evil endingswith new cutscenes. Taken together, they add up to a sort of \"Definitive Edition\" final pass, much as Larian did with its Original Sin games. Patch eight is one of the biggest yet. The photo mode might have excited me more back when we were desperate for Baldur's Gate 3 thumbnails on PC Gamer dot com, but the new subclasses are like Christmas and my birthday rolled into one: A new way to play the game for each of BG3's core classes, which has alreadyset the power gaming sicko in me into overdrive. Consensus from the playtest is that theHexblade WarlockandBooming Bladespell are the new hotness. I've finally settled on a Hexblade 1 / Swashbuckler 11 as my first build to tackle patch eight, though I also have a very dear fondness for theArcane Archersubclass from its various forms in D&D videogames over the years. The back half of April was shaping up to be pretty quiet ahead of May's deluge of new releases likeDoom: The Dark AgesandElden Ring Nightreign, but now Larian's gone and lobbed a grenade right in the middle of it. Not that I'm complaining too much, I just wish I'd wrapped up my replay of the OG Baldur's Gates in time for it.

    "title": "Trump’s Kiev envoy clarifies proposed ‘zones of responsibility’ in Ukraine",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, has rejected the notion that he proposed partitioning Ukraine like post-WWII Germany, accusing The Times of misrepresenting his remarks about a Cold War-style post-ceasefire security arrangement. Kellogg told The Times in aninterviewpublished on Friday that British and French – but not American – troops could lead a Western military force positioned west of the Dnepr River, while Ukrainian forces would hold territory further east. He also suggested establishing a demilitarized zone (DMZ) roughly 18 miles (30 kilometers) wide along the current lines of control to prevent direct clashes with Russian forces. “You could almost make it look like what happened with Berlin after World War Two, when you had a Russian zone, a French zone, and a British zone, a US zone,”said Kellogg, a retired US Army lieutenant general who was appointed by Trump to deal directly with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. Kellogg acknowledged that the Kremlin“might not accept”the proposed zones of control, and claimed that a DMZ would create conditions for a“sustainable”ceasefire and would“not be provocative at all”to Moscow. The British newspaper ran its story with the headline“Trump envoy: We can divide Ukraine like postwar Berlin,”prompting Kellogg to accuse the publication of taking his words out of context. “The Times article misrepresents what I said,”Kellogg wrote on X on Friday evening.“I was speaking of a post-ceasefire resiliency force in support of Ukraine’s sovereignty. In discussions of partitioning, I was referencing areas or zones of responsibility for an allied force (without US troops). I was NOT referring to a partitioning of Ukraine.” The Times report, however, noted that Kellogg’s idea implies that any final settlement would involve Kiev relinquishing claims to territories already controlled by Russia – a point that echoes proposals recently floated by Trump’s Russia envoy, Steve Witkoff. Witkoff, who met Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg on Friday, had previously argued that recognizing Moscow’s ownership of Zaporozhye and Kherson regions and the Lugansk and Donetsk people's republics was the swiftest path to halting the conflict. The suggestion, reportedly voiced during a White House meeting last week, has triggered internal debate within the Trump administration, with Kellogg allegedly pushing back against full territorial concessions. Kiev’s backers remain split regarding a proposed“reassurance force”that could potentially be deployed to Ukraine after hostilities end. Following the latest meeting of the“coalition of the willing”– composed of some 30 predominantly EU and NATO member states – in Brussels on Thursday, only six Western nations expressed a readiness to send troops, according to AFP. Moscow has repeatedly warned the West against deploying troops to Ukraine under any pretext, specifically objecting to forces from any NATO countries ending up in the country. Last month, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, currently deputy chair of the country's Security Council, said that the potential emergence of any NATO“peacekeepers”in Ukraine would mean a war between his country and the bloc.",
