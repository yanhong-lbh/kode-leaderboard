    "article_text": "WNBA star Sophie Cunningham spoke to Fox News Digital about her offseason trade to the Indiana Fever and her hopes for the upcoming season. TheIndiana Feverare off to a red-hot start to the 2025 WNBA season, taking down the Chicago Sky, 93-58, behind Caitlin Clark’s triple-double. Clark picked up right where she left off in 2024. The reigning Rookie of the Year did it all for a new-look Fever team on its home court in Indianapolis. Clark finishedthe game with 20 points after shooting 6-for-13 from the field with four made 3-pointers, adding 10 rebounds and 10 assists to lead her team to victory. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark shoots in the first half against the Chicago Sky at Gainbridge Fieldhouse.(Trevor Ruszkowski/Imagn Images) She was also doing it on the defensive end, too, registering four blocks and two steals in 32 minutes. And while Clark was the team’s leading scorer, she had help from her fellow starters, including guard Kelsey Mitchell, whose savvy with the ball in her hands led to 15 points on 6-for-12 shooting. ANGEL REESE, CAITLIN CLARK HAVE HEATED EXCHANGE AFTER HARD FOUL DURING SKY-FEVER GAME Aliyah Boston, who built great chemistry with Clark during the 2024 campaign, also had a double-double, picking up 13 rebounds and 19 points on 8-for-12 shooting. Natasha Howard proved to be a problem in the paint for Chicago, scoring 15 points with five rebounds, two assists and three steals. Chicago starAngel Reese struggled to begin the season. She was just 5 of 14 from the field, though she led the game with 17 rebounds. She finished with 12 points.

The team shot 29.1% (23-for-79) to the Fever’s 46.7%. This is the way new head coach Stephanie White wanted to kick off the season, using Clark to anchor an offense with multiple scoring options. There was a moment during the game, however, where tensions ran high and Clark was called for a flagrant foul after intentionally fouling Reese hard in the paint. Reese did not take it lightly either, getting up off the court and going at Clark, who wasn’t looking for a confrontation.

Referees looked at the play and determined Clark used her left hand to shove Reese to the floor. They upgraded the personal foul on Clark to a flagrant foul. And Reese and Aliyah Boston of the Fever were issued technical fouls. \"Nothing malicious about it, just a good take foul,\" Clark told ESPN's Holly Rowe. It seemed to be another chapter in the rivalry between Clark and Reese. The two had an intense rivalry during their time in women’s college basketball.

[We] come out here and play the same way every night, but [a rivalry] gets the fans involved, and they love it.\" Clark’s history with the Sky began last season. Clark took a series of questionable fouls from Reese's Sky throughout the 2024 season, including one from Reese June 16. Clark also took an infamous illegal hip check from Chicago Sky forward Chennedy Carter June 1. Then, in late August, Chicago's Diamond DeShields committed a hard foul on Clark, who went flying across the floor. The foul was later upgraded to a flagrant violation, and DeShields later posted screenshots of hate messages she had received from the foul.

    "title": "Nearly half of Gen Z admits to lying on job applications, survey finds",
    "article_text": "'The Five' co-host Dana Perino discusses her new book and how AI is changing the job market on 'The Story.' New survey data indicates that one in four job applicants has lied, exaggerated or provided inaccurate information on their applications in some way, shape or form — and Gen Z leads the trend. Thefindings from career.io— a career services platform — indicate nearly half (approximately 47%) of the age group admitted to falsifying some aspect of their job applications to fit the mold they think employers are looking for, followed by 38.5% of millennials, 20.4% of Gen Xers and 9.4% of baby boomers. A spreadsheet detailing the survey data, provided toFox News Digital, indicates that a majority of zoomers (slang for Gen Z) lied in key areas such as \"work experience\" (22.97%), and job \"responsibilities\" (28.38%), with \"job title\" coming in third at 17.57%. The large percentages indicate some survey participants falsified more than one area of their job applications. Across all generations, \"work experience\" and \"responsibilities\" ranked the highest out of all falsified categories, but to a lesser degree than zoomers. GEN Z BRANDED AS THE 'MOST GULLIBLE GENERATION' AFTER NEW ANALYSIS OF MEDIA HABITS Jobseekers may falsify parts of their applications to appear more appealing to potential employers.(iStock) Certified Professional Career Coach (CPCC) Amanda Augustine told Fox News Digital the prevailing reason for the falsehoods is that young applicants with limited experience are desperate to make a good first impression and get their foot in the door. \"You hear so much of people complaining about this big resume hole their applications have fallen into, and it's out of sheer desperation that they're trying to enhance their experience in a way that will hopefully land them at least that interview,\" she said Tuesday. Augustine has worked with multiple clients over the years to help them reach their full professional potential. She has heard many of these clients say they would be great for a role, even if they don't appear perfect on paper, and they only need the chance to prove themselves. \"I think it's that sentiment across all generations, but especially this younger generation that has not necessarily had to face the job market before, is really fueling some of these white lies, some of these flat-out lies that they're putting on applications,\" Augustine said to Fox News Digital. GEN Z BRANDED AS 'THE GHOSTED GENERATION' AS DATES, COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS KEEP SAYING 'NO' Signage for a job fair is seen on 5th Avenue after the release of the jobs report in Manhattan, New York City, September 3, 2021.(Andrew Kelly/File Photo) The data appears to reflect a desperation to appear \"experienced\" that steadily declines with age, indicating those still relatively new to the job market are uncertain about the navigation techniques they need to employ to find work. The dropoff between zoomers and millennials who admitted to lying with regard to job responsibilities was approximately 8 percent, with Gen Xers and baby boomers continuing to dial back the intensity. In the \"work experience\" area, zoomers' 22.97% still sat a few points higher than millennials' 18.70%. Compare that to Gen Xers and baby boomers at 9.51% and 3.59%, respectively. Augustine says some of the falsehoods, such as lengthening the time worked at a specific location, are done to mitigate the stigma of employment gaps, something job applicants are forced to confront from time to time. \"I think people are really trying to find ways to do little stretches of the truth that they believe will land them that interview so that those small inconsistencies will just kind of be swept under the rug and ignored if they make a great impression during the interview process,\" she said. COVID 5 YEARS LATER: IMPACT ON THE WORKPLACE Gen Z leads the pack when it comes to lying or stretching the truth on job applications, according to a survey.(Wealth of Geeks) But lies and fabrications can lead to big problems and have done so in some high-profile cases. Veritas Software CFO Kenneth E. Lonchar for instance,lost his positionafter an investigation uncovered that he had falsified his academic records and USPS vice president of corporate communications William (Bill) Whitman Jr. was fired shortly after being hired for falsifying information about his academic background and work achievements. Augustine says, for those with limited experience who want to appear as capable as possible for a role, focus on taking an inventory of your skills. \"There is such a greater emphasis placed on the soft skills such as collaboration, communication, problem solving. I mean, who doesn't need a creative problem solver for their business these days? I can't think of an industry where that wouldn't be helpful in some shape or form,\" she said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP But providing examples of times you have had to use the skills you profess to have or closing skill gaps through means such as taking an online course or learning from free demos are also important, she noted. Then there's networking — another useful tool in your tool belt if you're trying to get your foot in the door. \"I can't say it enough. Especially in this current economy and job market, networking is always going to be key. I don't care if you just graduated from school, or you have 30-plus years of experience. Everybody has a network, whether they realize it or not — that is your classmates, your mentors, your career advisors, your professors, people you've mentored in the past, people that you've worked with previously… If you aren't connecting with those people on LinkedIn and growing your professional network and investing in managing those relationships, you are doing your job search a major disservice.\" Taylor Penley is an associate editor with Fox News.",

    "article_text": "Founder of Live Action, Lila Rose, told Fox News Digital that President Donald Trump's move to pull funding from Planned Parenthood is a \"positive step\" but a \"small step forward,\" as the nonprofit receives hundreds of millions of dollars annually. Astonishing footage of awoman assaulting a pro-life activiststunned the internet in early April, when the young advocate was conducting man-on-the-street interviews in New York City before being attacked by a pro-abortion subject. Savannah Craven Antao was assaulted by a woman who consented to an on-camera conversation regardingabortion issues. \"Savannah was having these conversations,\" Lila Rose, founder and president of Live Action, a pro-life anti-abortion nonprofit organization, told Fox News Digital. \"One of them obviously went really south in that the woman that she was speaking with certainly engaged her, seemed pretty friendly but ultimately ended up getting very angry.\" PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST ASSAULTED, BLOODIED DURING STREET INTERVIEW ABOUT ABORTION Lila Rose, who founded the pro-life organization Live Action when she was 15, says the Trump administration's move to withhold tens of millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood is a \"small step forward.\"(Live Action) A video captured by Antao’s husband, the cameraman, caught the woman, Brianna J. Rivers, 30, throwingsucker punches.Rivers was later arrested on one count of second-degree assault, according to a report by the New York Post. Antao was left bleeding and in need of stitches. She was taken to the emergency room for treatment. \"This woman kind of just marched off yelling profanities,\" Rose said. \"You can’t just go punching and assaulting people and sending them to the emergency room for stitches.\" The response by social media users was divided as some submitted comments in favor of the assaulter, while others were horrified by the attack and feared for their own safety as pro-lifers. ‘ABORTION PILL' FOUND TO HAVE ‘SEVERE ADVERSE EFFECTS’ FOR 1 IN 10 WOMEN, STUDY FINDS \"It was really troubling to see the response by some, not by all, but by some people,\" Rose said. \"There were again people that supported abortion who said basically Savannah had what was coming to her. How dare she talk to people about this issue? She's going to get hit in the face. As if physical violence for a conversation is somehow justified.\" However, Rose is hopeful that basic discourse with restraint and without physical violence is still valued among Americans. \"There is, I think, a growing group of people who think that violence against people you disagree with politically is okay,\" Rose said. \"And particularly who, because they support the violence of abortion, they think that it's okay then to be violent to people that are born, too, who you disagree with.\" Abortion issues, a discussion point which has gained inconsistent notoriety among both Republicans and Democrats, were a focal point of the 2024 presidential elections where PresidentDonald Trumpran as a pro-life advocate. ABORTION ON DEMAND: THESE 6 STATES ALLOW WOMEN TO GET PREGNANCY-ENDING DRUGS BY PHONE OR ONLINE A young pro-lifer, Savannah Craven, was assaulted on camera while asking New York City locals their opinions on abortion issues.(Screenshot/\"Live Action\" YouTube) In late March, PresidentTrump withheld tens of millionsof dollars in Planned Parenthood funds for possible violation of civil rights laws, according to reports. \"I thought this was a great step in the right direction,\" Rose said. \"Planned Parenthood claims that they are about planning parenthood, but they do the exact opposite. They destroy parenthood.\" \"The fact that the Trump administration has removed some funding, I think, is a very positive step. The reality is that, though, the recent action by the Trump administration is only, we’re talking about the tens of millions of dollars when there's$700 million that Planned Parenthoodis receiving. This is a small step forward but what we need to see from the federal branch is more responsibility and accountability to stop funding abortion providers.\" In 2024, it was reported that \"an estimated 1,038,000 abortions were provided by clinicians in states without total bans in 2024,\" according to the Guttmacher Institute, a non-governmental organization funded, in part, by Planned Parenthood. DEMS WILL MAKE STATE SANCTUARY FOR KIDS' GENDER TRANSITIONS, ABORTION OVER GOP PROTEST Among those who obtained abortion care in 2021-2022, 53% of them paid out of pocket and 30% used Medicaid to fund their treatments, according to the source. \"A common rebuttal from, certainly, pro-abortion Democrats, is saying, ‘Well, we’re not funding taxpayer abortions. We’re just taxpayer-funding abortion providers and the reality is the money is fungible,’\" Rose said. \"Planned parenthood is billing Medicaid and getting government funds for basically all of their other operational expenses and many other of their procedures that ultimately prop up their abortion business.\" Medication abortionsmade up 63% of the clinician-provided abortions in 2023, according to Guttmacher. \"We need to see the abortion pill, which lands 1 out of every 10 women that take it with serious health consequences including emergency room visits,\" Rose said of the pill, mifepristone, used in combination with another medication, misoprostol, to terminate pregnancies.

Franklin Graham dedicates new mobile homes in Swannanoa, N.C., telling families displaced by Hurricane Helene that ‘God loves them.’ (Credit: Samaritan’s Purse) In the mountains ofwestern North CarolinaFriday, two families that lost nearly everything to Hurricane Helene stepped into brand-new homes donated by Samaritan's Purse. In an exclusive look provided to Fox News Digital,Rev. Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan’s Purse, dedicated the first mobile homes completed as part of a massive rebuilding effort aimed at restoring hope to families devastated by the storm. \"We’re grateful that they have a new home,\" Graham said. \"But, more importantly, we want these families to know that God loves them, and He hasn’t forgotten them.\" PRESIDENT TRUMP'S VISIT TO NORTH CAROLINA 'GAVE PEOPLE HOPE': REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM Rev. Franklin Graham greets a young mother outside her new mobile home after Samaritan’s Purse dedicated the house to her family, one of many Hurricane Helene victims.(Courtesy of Samaritan’s Purse) Graham, who grew up just down the road from Swannanoa, called it a \"full-circle moment\" while standing near the same stretch of land where floodwaters swept through mobile home communities last fall. \"To see these families move back into a real home again ... wejust thank God,\" he said. At the first dedication, a young mother stood on the threshold of her new home, clutching her baby and wiping away tears. Her family had been living in a cramped camper ever since their trailer was destroyed by floodwaters. Just days earlier, she had welcomed a newborn into the world. \"God has provided shelter for me,\" she said softly. \"He helped us get closer as a family. It’s been such a long journey, but I kept clinging to faith and patience.\" She thought Samaritan’s Purse might help rebuild her old trailer. What she got was something far beyond what she expected: a completely new, fully furnished home.

The family had been displaced since Hurricane Helene destroyed their previous home.(Courtesy of Samaritan’s Purse) \"I didn’t think they were going to bring us a new trailer,\" she said, her voice cracking. \"But this was way better. I feel really emotional. It’s hard to lose a house and all the stuff you worked hard for. But seeing this one, it brings me excitement. I’m ready for me and my family to go in and finally have our place back.\" Earlier that morning, another mother and her three children stepped inside their new home for the first time. Their previous mobile home had been crushed by a falling tree during the hurricane, leaving them displaced and uncertain about the future. A young girl smiles as she walks through her family’s new home, provided by Samaritan’s Purse, after they lost their previous home in Hurricane Helene. Rev. Franklin Graham joined the family for the dedication.(Courtesy of Samaritan’s Purse) Both homes were built with reinforced walls, weather-resistant features and a firm foundation designed to last for years. Each one came furnished and move-in ready. Every family received not only the keys to their new home but also a Bible, a gesture Graham said reflects the heart of the mission. \"These are homes built by God’s people, in Jesus’ name,\" he said. \"We want these families to know He hasn’t turned His back on them. He loves them.\" Samaritan’s Purse is building dozens of new homes across the region and delivering upgraded mobile units to survivors. The homes weigh 7,000 pounds more than standard models and are reinforced from top to bottom — roof, windows, walls and floors. \"These homes are the first two of many,\" Graham said. \"And we are ready to provide hundreds more if needed.\" A sign on the exterior of a new mobile home says\"Given in Jesus’ Name by Samaritan’s Purse.\"(Courtesy of Samaritan’s Purse) Before the rebuilding began, nearly 35,000 Samaritan’s Purse volunteers poured into western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. They cut down trees, cleared debris, tarped roofs and mucked out flooded homes. The ministry also conducted the largest civilian airlift in U.S. history, delivering more than 700,000 pounds of aid on 358 flights. In addition to housing, the organization has replaced hundreds of vehicles and helped thousands of families with grocery assistance and basic needs. But it’s the personal moments — the quiet prayers, the tears of relief, the joy of children stepping into a bedroom again — that define the mission. \"We thank everyone who gave,\" Graham said. \"Thousands and thousands contributed. But, most of all, we thank God. Because He’s the one who makes all of this possible.\"CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP To apply for help or to volunteer, visitsamaritanspurse.org.

I think I was 19 when I did \"The Social Network,\" and then little jobs and stuff after that.\" Dakota Johnson recalled how her father, Don Johnson, had cut her off after she was denied acceptance to Juilliard.(Getty) \"For a couple of years it was hard to make money,\" she admitted. \"There were a few times when I’d go to the market and not have money in my bank account or not be able to pay rent, and I’d have to ask my parents for help – I’m very grateful that I had parents that could help me and did help me. But it certainly was not fun. The auditioning process, as you know, is the f------ worst.\" DON JOHNSON CUT OFF DAUGHTER FROM 'FAMILY PAYROLL' WHEN SHE REFUSED TO GO TO COLLEGE Dakota told Pascal thatapplying to Juilliardwas also really challenging. One of the most elite performing arts schools in the world, The Juilliard School in New York City only accepts about 10% of applicants. \"That f------ process was so awful and terrifying,\" Johnson recalled. \"When you get accepted for an audition, it’s a two-day long chorus-line thing. You’re supposed to get called back for a second audition, and I didn’t.\" \"It was fine, I really didn’t want to go to college,\" she continued. \"And because Juilliard felt so small – the idea of being in a classroom with the same group of people, and figuring out how to be a human in that environment, after growing up surrounded by so many different kinds of people and immersed in different cultures through traveling all over. . . . It just felt really wrong to lock myself in one place.\" Johnson didn't apply to any other colleges.(FREDERIC J.

Don and Griffith first married in 1976 but divorced six months later.The \"Miami Vice\" starand the \"Working Girl\" actress tied the knot again in 1989 and welcomed Dakota that year, but they split again in 1996.

At one point, I went to an all-girls Catholic boarding school.

Key finds will also include fragments, shrapnel and device components, to help reconstruct the method of detonation. \"Whether this was a single large device or multiple smaller ones, those answers will come from detailed lab testing and scene reconstruction—not just visual assessment,\" Pack said.

JERUSALEM –Just hours afterPresident Donald Trumpconcluded his Middle East visit, Iran’s Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday launched a tirade against America and Israel, charging that Trump is a liar and calling for the destruction of the Jewish state. \"Trump said he wants to use power for peace. He's lying,\"wrote Khamenei on X, adding, \"Some of the remarks made during the US President’s trip to the region aren’t even worth a response at all. The level of those remarks is so low that they are a source of shame for the American nation.\" Washington has designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since the 1980s. The rabidly anti-Western and antisemitic ayatollah called the Jewish state—America’s key ally in the Middle East — a \"cancerous tumor\" that must be uprooted. According to the Trump administration, Khamenei’s regime is the world’s leading state-sponsor of antisemitism. TRUMP PRAISES SAUDI ARABIA IN FIRST STOP ON MIDDLE EAST TRIP Khamenei also took aim at the Sunni Arab countries that are allied with the U.S. in the Mideast, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar. \"This failed model, where Arab states are told they can’t survive ten days without US support, is being imposed again. But it will collapse, and America will leave this region.\" The wily 86-year-old revolutionary Islamist said that Washington aimed to promote Sunni Arab dependency on Washington. \"The US wants these countries unable to function without it — that’s the message in their behavior and their proposals.\" Khamenei also accused America of using its resources to attack the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip. \"The US has used its power to massacre in Gaza, to stoke war wherever possible, and to arm its mercenaries,\" said Khamenei. The U.S.-designated terrorist movement, Hamas, is a strategic partner of Iran’s regime. Hamas invaded Israel on October 7, 2023, and slaughtered over 1,200 people, including many Americans.

Alireza Nader, a Washington, D.C., expert on Iran's regime, told Fox News Digital that Iran \"has been dealt a severe military setback by Israel, and the Iranian public desires the regime’s overthrow.

    "article_text": "Board-certified rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani discusses how weight training could reduce the risk of dementia on ‘America Reports.’ Exercise is known to reducecancer risk— but that doesn’t have to mean hard-core gym sessions or long runs. A new study led by Oxford researchers reveals that casual walking and otherlight-intensity activitiesare enough to lower cancer incidence. The number of steps was found to be more important than the pace of the walk, they found. JUST 4 MINUTES OF INTENSE DAILY ACTIVITY COULD SLASH CANCER RISK AMONG ‘NON-EXERCISERS,’ STUDY FINDS Those who walked 7,000 steps per day had an 11% lower cancer risk compared to those taking 5,000 steps per day, and the risk was 16% lower for those taking 9,000 steps per day, according to a press release from the Oxford Centre for Early Cancer Detection at the University of Oxford. Even shopping and performing household chores have been shown to reducecancer risk. A new study led by Oxford researchers reveals that casual walking and other light-intensity activities are enough to lower cancer incidence.(iStock) Overall, those who had the highest total amount of daily physical activity were 26% less likely to develop cancer compared to those with the lowest amount, after adjusting for lifestyle factors, body mass index (BMI) and otherhealth conditions.

CANCER DEATHS AND TAX RATES LINKED IN SURPRISING NEW STUDY: HERE'S HOW They then compared that data with future cancer diagnoses in 2,633 participants over a nearly six-year period. While previous studies have used self-reported exercise to determine reduced cancer risk, this one used \"more precise data\" based on wearable activity trackers. \"Our research highlights the importance of allforms of movement,\" senior study author Aiden Doherty, professor of biomedical informatics at Oxford Population Health, said in the release. \"Whether it’s increasing daily steps, engaging in light activity or incorporating moderate-to-vigorous exercise, any level of physical activity appears to contribute to lower cancer risk.\"(iStock) \"Whether it’s increasing daily steps, engaging in light activity or incorporating moderate-to-vigorous exercise, any level ofphysical activityappears to contribute to lower cancer risk.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Our findings support and enhance current national and international physical activity guidelines, showing that people who often engage in simple low-intensity activities, such as walking, have a lower risk of developing cancer.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Dr. Marc Siegel, clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Health and Fox News senior medical analyst, pointed out that cancer is linked to inflammation, which is linked to sedentary behavior. \"All kinds of activity, including walking, increases metabolic function and decreases inflammation.\"(iStock) \"All kinds of activity, including walking, increasesmetabolic functionand decreases inflammation,\" Siegel, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"The results of this study are not surprising and are in keeping with previous and ongoing research.\" For more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health In addition to Oxford Health researchers, experts from the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute participated in the study.

There have been no reports of injuries or deaths connected to the fire. Fire crews worked to extinguish the flames with water reportedly being poured onto the rubble as long as 18 hours after the fire started,according to Fox 8. As of Saturday, the cause of the fire was still under investigation. \"Some staff members stated they had gone into the museum and there was smoke. When they returned, the whole room was in flames,\" Iberville Parish President Chris Daigle told Fox 8, adding that it was \"a total loss.\" Fire crews move in a line around the now fully engulfed the Nottoway Plantation on Thursday, May 15, 2025, in White Castle, La.(Michael Johnson/The Advocate via AP) 2 DEAD AFTER HOUSE BURNS DOWN IN NEW JERSEY FOLLOWING 'GIGANTIC EXPLOSION,' CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY Daigle noted in a post on the Iberville Parish Government’sFacebook pagethat \"The loss of Nottoway is not just a loss for Iberville Parish, but for the entire state of Louisiana.  It was a cornerstone of our tourism economy and a site of national significance.\" The 64-room mansion was built by John Hampden Randolph in the late 1850s, according to multiple sources.

A grandmother in the U.K. who was arrested for holding a sign outside anabortion clinicis sounding the alarm against further attacks on free speech as lawmakers move to expand so-called \"buffer zones\" outside such facilities. Rose Docherty, 74, was arrested in Glasgow, Scotland near the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in February for holding a sign that read: \"Coercion is a crime, here to talk if you want.\" Docherty was the first person to be arrested and charged under the Abortion Services (Safe Access Zones) Act, which went into effect in September,the BBC reported. The law prohibits any protests or vigils from taking place within 200m or 656ft of 30 clinics offering abortion services in Scotland, butthe law specifiesthat the Safe Access Zone could be extended if considered appropriate. Docherty’s arrest came just days afterVice President JD Vancehighlighted the law as an example of free speech being under attack in the U.K. Rose Docherty, 74, was arrested in Glasgow, Scotland near the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) in February for holding a sign that read: \"Coercion is a crime, here to talk if you want.\"(Rose Docherty) UK WOMAN THREATENED WITH FINE FOR PRAYING WITHIN ABORTION FACILITY'S ‘BUFFER ZONE:’ ‘ GROSSLY ORWELLIAN’ Now, Gillian Mackay, the Green Party parliamentarian responsible for introducing the buffer zones legislation, has now suggested that the Scottish government consider expanding the area of prohibition on \"influence\" outside hospitals, according to ADF International, a Christian legal advocacy group. Docherty has rejected a formal warning from the Crown Office - arguing that it was \"unjust\" - and is waiting to find out what action may now be taken against her. In her first broadcast interview since her arrest, she told the BBC she had \"no reason to regret\" the incident, noting it was an \"alarming\" and \"surreal\" experience. She said she had read the law and believed her actions did not violate the legislation. \"I gave consideration to what I was doing…I looked at the law and saw what it said I couldn’t do, and thought, OK, well, this is what I can do…I can offer to listen, and if anyone wants to come and speak to me, they can do so, only if they want to come and speak with me,\" she toldBBC’s Scotcast. She said she is prepared to go to prison over the offense. Docherty has also said that the government essentially wants to stamp out any opposition to abortion. \"I believe it wouldn’t matter where we stood…it wouldn’t matter how far they pushed the ‘buffer zone,’\" she toldADF International, a Christian legal advocacy group.

But merely offering conversations near a hospital is not a crime.\" Dr Greg Irwin, a doctor at the QEUH, was pictured confronting a groupof protestersin February 2023, saying that they \"cause emotional upset to patients, but also to staff members,\" per the BBC. Groups have been protesting outside the hospital for 10 years, leading to the passing of the Safe Access Zones Act. Mackay said patients and staff had told her that they still had to pass the protesters when attending the QEUH leading to distress. \"I think it's appropriate that we take those concerns seriously and the government take a look at whether an extension is appropriate or not,\" Mackay told the BBC.

    "title": "Trump’s Middle East trip handed Israel a historic opportunity — if it chooses to act, experts say",
    "article_text": "'Call Me Back' podcast host Dan Senor discusses details of potential nuclear agreements with Iran. TEL AVIV – As PresidentDonald Trumpwrapped up his high-stakes Middle East tour on Friday, many media outlets portrayed his decision to bypass Israel as evidence of a rift with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, while Air Force One did not landin Israel, experts say Trump’s visit advanced policies that align closely with Israeli interests and presented a strategic opportunity that Jerusalem has yet to seize. Avner Golov, vice president at MIND Israel and a former senior director of Israel’s National Security Council, told Fox News Digital, \"Israel sees a massive wave approaching to sweep across the Middle East — a wave of momentum and change. The decision it faces is whether to ride it or be crushed beneath it.\" TRUMP MAKES HISTORIC UAE VISIT AS FIRST US PRESIDENT IN NEARLY 20 YEARS President Donald J. Trump, left, and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attend a bilateral meeting at the Saudi Royal Court on May 13, 2025 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images) Throughout the visit, Trump emphasized points that directly reflect Israeli priorities. On Tuesday, he condemned the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, called for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords and warnedIran over its nuclear ambitions. On Wednesday, he even extended the normalization initiative to Syria. When asked aboard Air Force One about skipping Israel, Trump said, \"This is good for Israel. Having a relationship like I have with these countries... I think it's very good.\" In Doha on Thursday, Trump went further, stating: \"I want to see [Gaza] be a freedom zone. And if it’s necessary, I think I’d be proud to have the United States have it, take it, make it a freedom zone.\" According to two Arab officialsquoted by The Times of Israel, U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff told mediators in Doha that Washington does not intend to pressure Israel into ending the war in Gaza — aligning with Prime Minister Netanyahu’s firm stance. On Friday, President Trump was asked in an interview with Fox News Chief political anchor, Bret Baier on Special Report, if he was frustrated with Netanyahu. Trump responded, \"No, look, he's got a tough situation. You have to remember there was an October 7th that everyone forgets, it was one of the most violent days in the history of the world. Not the Middle East, the world, when you look at the tapes. And the tapes are there for everyone to see.\" Israel Defense Forces troops re-enter the Gaza Strip following the collapse of the ceasefire.(IDF) A readout released on Thursday by the State Department of a call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Prime Minister Netanyahu, also showed continued support for the Jewish state. \"The Secretary stressed the deep U.S. commitment to its historic relationship with Israel and the ironclad U.S. support for Israeli security,\" adding \"The Secretary and Prime Minister discussed Syria following President Trump’s historic meeting with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia. The Secretary and Prime Minister also shared their mutual commitment to make sure Iran never possesses a nuclear weapon.\" TRUMP SIGNS AGREEMENTS WITH QATAR ON DEFENSE AND BOEING PURCHASES Channel 12 chief political correspondent Amit Segal told Fox News Digital, \"There is an uncomfortable experience from an Israeli perspective to see Air Force One flying over us on its way to countries, some of which are outright hostile and others semi-hostile. If you are not at the table, you are on the plate.\" \"But this isn’t personal. It’s not about Netanyahu and Trump,\" Segal added. \"Trump has full support for Israel — but when American interests come first, he acts accordingly. It’s America First.\" Dan Senor, host of the podcast \"Call Me Back\" and a former state department official, agreed that despite headlines suggesting tension, policy tells a different story. \"There’s always noise in the press,\" Senor told Dana Perino, co-anchor of Fox News Channel's \"America's Newsroom.\"\"But policy right now is very strong. We’re seeing maximum pressure on Iran, no public criticism of Israel — even as dozens of Israeli tanks are positioned near Gaza.\" President Donald Trump, center, meets with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 14, 2025.(Saudi Press Agency/Handout via REUTERS) TRUMP SAYS HE'LL DROP SANCTIONS ON SYRIA IN MOVE TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS \"What I found problematic in past administrations — especially under Obama — was when private criticism became public,\" Senor added. \"That gave others a green light to pile on Israel. This administration, even if it disagrees, isn’t airing it. And that matters most.\" On Friday, in a proclamation marking Jewish Heritage Month, Trump stated, \"I believe there has never been a greater friend to the Jewish people than my Administration.  We will never deviate from our conviction that anti-Semitism has no place in the greatest country in the world.  As the 47th President of the United States, I will use every appropriate legal tool at my disposal to stop anti-Semitic assaults gripping our universities.  We will proudly stand with our friend and ally, the State of Israel.  I will never waver in my commitment.\" Tamir Haiman, former head of Israel’s Military Intelligence and now director of the Institute for National Security Studies, said the Israeli government feared being caught off guard. \"This is a player so strong that sometimes, without intending to, he can throw a small player off the field — like a giant who’s spinning and accidentally knocks someone out of his way with his shoulder,\" Haiman told Fox News Digital. However, he emphasized that the developments inSaudi Arabia, Qatar and Syria are not inherently bad for Israel — unless the government fails to act. \"The missed opportunity here is enormous,\" he said. \"There were two major levers Israel had — Israeli consent to U.S. arms deals with Saudi Arabia and American consent to lifting sanctions on Syria. Both could have been used to advance key Israeli interests: normalization with Saudi Arabia andensuring Syria’s developmentfollows a non-jihadist path. And we [Israel] lost both.\" President Donald Trump, left, is presented with the Order of Zayed, the UAE's highest civilian distinction, by UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on Thursday, May 15, in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.(AP/Alex Brandon) TRUMP SAYS US HAS GIVEN IRAN PROPOSAL FOR NUCLEAR DEAL The sense of urgency grew last week when Trump abruptly paused U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-backed Houthis just days after a missile landed near Ben Gurion Airport. Reports soon followed that Washington had dropped its demand for Israeli-Saudi normalization as a prerequisite for a U.S.–Saudi nuclear pact — a strategic goal long championed by Netanyahu. Reuters later confirmedthe shift. Meanwhile, Saudi officials made clear that progress on the Palestinian issue remains a prerequisite for any nuclear deal — something seen as unlikely while the war in Gaza continues. \"After the Saudi story, where we were thrown under the bus, I said we need to stop and investigate,\" Haiman said. \"We shouldn’t just say it’s the president’s whims. We need to ask, ‘What depends on us? What needs to change?’ I’m not sure they’re doing that.\" The sharpest potential rift remains Iran. Jerusalem views a nuclear-armed Tehran as an existential threat. Haiman calls this \"a historic window\" to stop it, by force if needed. \"The American interest is to finish wars, not enter them, and to seal a deal better than Obama’s,\" he said, warning that a diplomatic track pursued over Israel’s head could soon limit Israeli military options. Edan Alexander meets with his extended family following his release.(IDF) Monday’s release of 21-year-old American-IsraeliEdan Alexander, freed after direct talks between Washington, Qatar and Hamas, added to some fears of Jerusalem being sidelined. Israel played only a logistical role. Within Israel, the Gaza war continues to divide strategists over whether to keep pressing Hamas or stop the war for a hostage deal. Haiman called the current \"fight, deal, fight\" rhythm \"boiling the frog,\" but acknowledges that without a hostage deal now, the 21 living hostages might not survive. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Golov believes it is time for Israel to stop reacting and start shaping events. He urged Jerusalem to push Washington to demand that \"Qatar must stopfunding Hamas, stop Al Jazeera’s incitement, and pay a price for interfering inside Israel.\" Israel, he argued, does not have the leverage to do that alone. \"It must anchor itself in a regional bloc — with the Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan — states that are just as terrified of a Muslim Brotherhood resurgence.\" To get there, he said, Israel must climb aboard the wave Trump has already set in motion.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump sits down with ‘Special Report’ anchor Bret Baier to discuss his visit to the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine war and more. A Russian drone strike hit a passenger bus innortheastern Ukraineon Saturday, killing nine people and injuring four others, Ukrainian officials allege. The attack came just hours after Russian and Ukrainian officials held their first direct peace talks in years, although the two sides failed to reach a ceasefire agreement for the conflict that began with a February 2022 invasion by Moscow. Ukraine’s national police released photos showing the aftermath of Saturday's strike in the city of Bilopillia in the Sumy region. The city is about six miles from the front line and border with Russia. \"This is another war crime by Russia — a deliberate strike on civilian transport that posed no threat,\" the Sumy regional administration said on Telegram.

Local community chief Yurii Zarko called the day of the attack \"Black Saturday.\" The passengers on the bus were being evacuated from Bilopillia when the drone struck, according to local media outlet Suspilne. Authorities were working to identify some of the victims, most of whom were elderly women. The injured victims were transported to a hospital in Sumy, the regional capital. Three people were listed in serious condition. On Saturday morning, Russia's defense ministry claimed its forces hit a military staging area in the Sumy region, around 31 miles southeast of Bilopillia, but did not mention any other attacks in the area. It was not immediately clear how the strike would affect peace efforts. On Friday, Russian and Ukrainian officials met in Turkey in an attempt to reach a temporary ceasefire, but the talks ended in less than two hours without a truce. The negotiations were the first face-to-face talks between the two countries since the early weeks of the war. Russian and Ukrainian delegations attend talks at the Dolmabache palace, in Istanbul, Turkey, Friday, May 16, 2025.(AP) Both sides agreed on a large prisoner swap, but remained far apart on key conditions forending the conflict. One condition for Ukraine, which has the backing of its Western allies, is a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement. Russia, however, has pushed back against the truce, which remains elusive. In Turkey, Russia and Ukraine agreed to each exchange 1,000 prisoners of war in what would be their biggest such swap, according to the heads of both delegations. Both sides also talked about a ceasefire and a meeting between their heads of state, according to chief Ukrainian delegate, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov. An aide to Russian President Vladimir Putin said both sides also agreed to provide each other with detailed ceasefire proposals, with Ukraine requesting the heads of state meeting thatRussia took under consideration.

    "article_text": "Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., discusses rebuilding trust in the Democratic Party on 'The Story.' The Democratic Party is finally saying the quiet part out loud: \"Biden should not have run again.\" Revelations about PresidentJoe Biden'scognitive decline and his administration's alleged cover-up have returned to the national conversation ahead of next week's release of CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios political correspondent Alex Thompson's book, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\" Rep.Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a 2024 presidential campaign surrogate for PresidentJoe Biden, and considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, acknowledged on Wednesday that Biden should not have run for a second term. And Beto O'Rourke, one of Biden's 2020 Democratic primary competitors and the former congressman from Texas, joined the criticism this week, accusing Biden's re-election campaign of failing future generations of Americans. REP RO KHANNA TEES UP 2028 RIVALRY DURING POINTED SPEECH IN JD VANCE'S HOME STATE Former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke (left) and potential 2028 presidential candidate Rep. Ro Khanna said President Joe Biden should not have run for re-election in 2024.(Getty Images) When pressed by Martha MacCallum on\"The Story\"on Wednesday about campaigning for Biden in 2024, Khanna said he hadn't had the full picture of Biden's health and mental acuity ahead of his disastrous debate performance, but he admitted, \"We should be honest as a party that we made a mistake.\" DEM RISING STAR EYES VANCE AS KEY LONG-TERM THREAT: 'NEEDS TO BE DEFEATED' \"I do think it's important that, given what has come out, that we take accountability,\" Khanna said. \"Obviously, he should not have run,\" Khanna said. Responding to a series of interview clips from early 2024, when Khanna affirmed Biden's intention to run for re-election and described the president as \"fully coherent,\" Khanna said he had been telling the truth. \"Of course, I didn't have the full picture,\" Khanna added. Khanna was a campaign surrogate for Biden in 2024 before he dropped out of the race.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) O'Rourke took Khanna's call for Democratic accountability a step further on \"Pod Save America\" this week, calling Biden's decision to run for re-election in 2024 a \"terrible mistake.\" \"Just to be clear: Biden should not have run again. And to be even more clear: He failed this country in the most important job that he had,\" O'Rourke said. \"In fact, the entire rationale for his presidency the first time, and the rationale he tried to sell us on for his attempt to run for re-election, ‘Only I can stop Donald Trump.’ And he failed to do that, and it's not just you and me, but our kids and grandkids and the generations that follow that might have to pay the price for this. We might very well lose the greatest country that this world has ever known,\" O'Rourke said. Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke speaks to attendees during a \"Our Fight, Our Future\" rally at The Millennium bowling alley on October 2, 2024, in Austin, Texas(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) An excerpt from Tapper and Thompson's bookreleased by Axiosthis week revealed that Biden's declining health was \"so severe that there were internal discussions about putting the president in a wheelchair, but they couldn't do so until after the election.\" In hindsight, Khanna and O'Rourke agreed that Democrats should have had an opportunity to launch their own presidential bids. And now that PresidentDonald Trumphas returned to the White House, and an already crowded field of potential 2028 Democratic candidates are mulling presidential campaigns, they said it's important to take accountability for 2024. \"Obviously, there should have been an open primary. And, I don't think that's very difficult that Democrats should just be straight up that he should not have run, now that we have all the facts. There should have been an open primary. I think to move on and move forward, it's important to take accountability and be straightforward with the American people,\" Khanna said. O'Rourke said America's future could be in the balance \"in part because of the decision that Biden, and those around him, made to run for re-election instead of having an open primary where the greatest talent that the Democratic Party can muster could be on that stage to have a competition of ideas, and track-record and vision and really excite, not just Democrats, but the people of this country who did want change. I mean, if anything was clear coming out of 2024, they wanted change.\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., was a campaign surrogate for President Joe Biden in 2024.(Getty Images) The once-2020 Democratic presidential candidate, who is 52 years-old, said the Democrat's Biden failure creates a credibility problem. \"I think that credibility problem is going to persist up until when Democrats say, ‘We f---ed up, and we made a terrible mistake,'\" O'Rourke said. Despite O'Rourke's comments this week, he said in an email to supporters through his voting rights organization, Powered by People, last February that, \"Donald Trump is the single greatest threat to our democracy. Our best chance to defeat him is to support Joe Biden in this election.\" \"Amy and I voted for him in the Texas primary . . . and are looking forward to voting for him again in November,\" he added. \"This president has done an extraordinary job of improving our economy, confronting the climate crisis, reducing childhood poverty and fending off the very worst of Donald Trump and the Republican Party’s mounting attacks on our most fundamental freedoms.\" Former National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan defended his former boss this week, while acknowledging that Biden's disastrous debate performance was shocking.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) Another young Democrat and Biden's former National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, continued to defend his former boss atPolitico's Security Summiton Thursday, dismissing an allegation that Biden had forgotten his name, and defending his leadership as commander-in-chief.

    "article_text": "RealClearPolitics co-founder Tom Bevan joins ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ to discuss the newly released Biden-Hur audio and comments from former administration officials who claim they were unaware of President Biden’s mental decline. Former President Joe Biden lashed out against special counsel Robert Hur over a report in which he described the longtime lawmaker as a \"sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" The part of Hur’s report that most angered Biden was the suggestion that the then-president could not remember when his son, Beau, died. However, new audioobtained by Axiossheds light on Biden’s lapses in memory. In February 2024, Biden and several high-profile Democrats — as well as media personalities — attacked Hur. During a press conference on Hur’s report, Biden said, \"There’s some attention paid to some language in the report about my recollection of events. There’s even a reference that I don’t remember when my son died. How in the hell dare he raise that?\" Audio from then-President Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur reveals that he, and not the special counsel, brought up Beau Biden's death.(Getty Images) CONSERVATIVES REACT TO LEAKED BIDEN AUDIO ON SOCIAL MEDIA: 'THIS IS PAINFUL' Then-Vice PresidentKamala Harrisslammed Hur in February 2024, saying his report was \"gratuitous, inaccurate and inappropriate.\" She also suggested that it was \"clearly politically motivated.\" Harris recalled Biden’s alleged sharpness at the time, noting that Hur’s interview took place on Oct. 8, 2023 — just one day after Hamas’ attack on Israel. Harris said she was \"in almost every meeting\" with Biden and that he was \"in front of and on top of it all.\" Reps. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., and Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.,grilled Hurwhen he testified on Capitol Hill in March 2024. Both lawmakers attempted to get Hur to say that his report \"exonerated\" Biden — which he did not do. Then–Rep.

On Friday, Axios published a bombshell report that included audio recordings from Biden’s interview with Hur, something the previous administration refused to release. The audio includes long pauses in which Biden struggled to recall the dates of several major events, including when PresidentDonald Trumpwas elected to office for his first term, his son’s death or his exit from office as vice president. (AP Newsroom) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Since his report was released, Hur has seen two key moments of vindication aside from Friday’s report. The first came when the transcript of his interview was released in March 2024. At the time, the White House refused to release the audio, citing fears of AI deepfakes. Hur appeared to receive further vindication when Biden had his disastrous debate against then-candidate Trump in June 2024. Less than a month after the debate, Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race and endorsed Harris. Rachel Wolf is a breaking news writer for Fox News Digital and FOX Business.",

Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., on burning the midnight oil to work through President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' and a new provision to remove tax-exempt status from terrorist-supporting organizations. EXCLUSIVE:The top tax-writer in the House of Representatives is arguing that PresidentDonald Trump's\"big, beautiful bill\" will be \"big\" for American taxpayers as well – including seniors. House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., and other Republicans on the panel spent months negotiating behind closed doors on how to enact Trump's tax policies. Among those is an added $4,000 deduction for Americans aged 65 or older. Seniors with income of less than $75,000 as single filers, and less than $150,000 as joint filers, would be eligible for the full deduction, which then would begin to phase out. \"So, that’s on top of their guaranteed deduction, and that’s per person . . . anyone who has total earnings of $75,000 a year or less is going to be made completely whole, so all the low-income and middle-income seniors on Social Security will be paying zero on Social Security in the long run,\" Smith told Fox News Digital, while adding of others, \"most of them will be paying much less.\" ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION President Donald Trump is pushing Republicans to pass his \"big, beautiful bill\"(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process, which lowers the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51 for certain pieces of fiscal legislation, to advance a vast bill full of Trump's priorities on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. Because the House already operates under a simple majority, reconciliation allows the party in power to pass sweeping legislation while sidelining the other side, in this case, Democrats. Trump has directedcongressional Republicansto permanently extend his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), as well as implement new policies eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and retirees' Social Security. But the law that established the reconciliation process, the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, also specifically forbade direct changes to Social Security via the process. Smith said Republicans' had added $4,000 tax deduction as a way to make them \"completely whole.\" BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., is helping craft the tax portion of the bill.(Tom Williams) Rather than seeing thattax reliefmonth-to-month, however, Smith said it would come in people's yearly tax returns. He argued that it was more beneficial for lower-income seniors as well, giving added relief to those whose incomes were too low to pay Social Security taxes in the first place. \"Under the rules of reconciliation, you cannot touch Social Security directly. What we did is to make sure that they get . . . tax relief for any senior who makes less than $75,000 per year,\" Smith said. \"It's not that we didn’t want to do it, it’s that it cannot be done under the rules of reconciliation, or you wouldn’t qualify for the 51-vote threshold over in the United States Senate.\" \"But the tax relief they will receive is an added tax cut, and that will make up for what they have paid in Social Security tax.\" The White House also endorsed Smith's plan despite its departure from Trump's initial campaign pitch. \"The one, big, beautiful bill not only delivers permanent tax cuts and bigger paychecks, but it secures a historic tax break for seniors on Social Security,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said. \"This is another promise made, promise kept to our seniors who deserve much-needed tax relief after four years of suffering under Bidenflation.\" The $4,000 tax deduction, which would be in effect from the 2025 through 2028 tax years, would be on top of the higher standard deduction that people above age 65 already receive. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It would not be a tax credit, reducing tax liability directly regardless of tax brackets. A deduction reduces taxable income and is dependent on the taxpayer's rate. But for single seniors making up to $75,000, and married seniors making less than $150,000, qualifying for the $4,000 deduction, it would likely provide some relief for millions of taxpayers across the country. \"It’ll be a wash of what their Social Security tax would’ve been,\" Smith said, adding later in the interview: \"Failure’s not an option.

The trip concluded with a series of major trade deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, a policy shift on Syria, and a stark message for Iran. PresidentDonald Trumpspent his 17th week as commander-in-chief visiting theMiddle East,marking his first major overseas trip of his second term. The president left Washington, D.C., Monday forSaudi Arabia,followed by a visit in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The president’s trip comes amid the continuing war between Israel and Hamas, ongoing U.S.-Iran negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, and his plans to broaden his first administration’s Abraham Accords, which normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab League nations such as the United Arab Emirates. TRUMP CONDEMNS 'INTERVENTIONALISTS,' PITCHES 'MORE HOPEFUL FUTURE' IN MIDDLE EAST SPEECH Trump arrived in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, early Tuesday morning, with the nation sending fighter jet escorts to welcome Air Force One to the ground and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman greeting Trump on the tarmac, which was adorned with a lavender-colored carpet.

The president, during a speech in Riyadh shortly after meeting with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, vowed to continue America’s partnership with the Saudi Arabian government, but also called for peace in the Middle East, urging the region to pursue economic development rather than Iran’s \"self-destructive\" path. \"If the responsible nations of this region seize this moment, put aside your differences and focus on the interests that unite you, then all humanity will soon be amazed at what we will see here in the geographic center of the world, and the spiritual heart of its greatest faiths,\" Trump said. \"Before our eyes, a new generation of leaders is transcending the ancient conflicts and tired divisions of the past, and forging a future where the Middle East is defined by commerce, not chaos; where it exports technology, not terrorism; and where people of different nations, religions, and creeds are building cities together, not bombing each other,\" he added. Trump's speech came after he and Salmansigned several economic agreementstotaling $600 billion in trade deals. The agreements could help create up to two million U.S. jobs, Trump said. Several of the agreements tracked with previously stated ambitions by both Washington, D.C., and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, particularly when it comes to defensive deals. President Donald J.

Trump had announced a 60-day time frame to reach an agreement with Iran over its illegal atomic weapons program. The first U.S. negotiating session with Iran commenced April 12. President Donald J.

TRUMP HITS IRAN’S POCKETBOOK AS HE DANGLES A CARROT IN MIDDLE EAST SPEECH The nuclear talks were \"difficult but useful,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations, offered more, describing the talks as being both indirect and direct, The Associated Press reported. An \"agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements,\"the U.S. official said. \"We are encouraged by today’s outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future.\" The Trump administration has said the flawed 2015 Obama-era Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), also known as the Iran nuclear deal, did not prevent Iran from building an atomic bomb. Trump, throughout his visit, made stark warnings to Iran — verbally, and through sanctions. Just shortly after dangling a carrot of a \"brighter future\" for Iran, the Treasury Department gave a taste of Trump’s \"maximum pressure\" campaign and sanctioned more than two dozen firms operating in Iran’s illicit international oil trade. TRUMP HITS IRAN’S POCKETBOOK AS HE DANGLES A CARROT IN MIDDLE EAST SPEECH Trump said Iran has the nuclear \"proposal.\" \"But more importantly, they know they have to move quickly or something bad — something bad is going to happen,\" the president said.

Bush's trip in 2008. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest building in the world, was illuminated in red, white and blue in honor of President's historic UAE visit.

Green argues that, contrary to what many believe, there does not need to be a constitutional crisis in order to impeach a president. Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, was removed from the House chamber for disrupting Trump's speech.(REUTERS/AP) HOUSE DEMOCRAT ANNOUNCES ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST TRUMP On Thursday, he filed H. Res. 415, \"Impeaching Donald John Trump, President of the United States, of high crimes and misdemeanors.\" In the articles of impeachment, Green claims that Trump has engaged in authoritarian rule, violated due process, denigrated federal judges and ignored court orders, including ones from the Supreme Court. He also claims that Trump condoned \"untruthful statements\" against the Court’s opinion regarding the deportation of accused MS-13 member Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Trump gives his joint address to Congress and is interrupted by Rep Al Green protesting his cuts to multiple government programs.

The constitutional law that authoritarian President Trump would have Congress use to impeach a federal judge for ruling against him (Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution) is the same law that has been used, and can be used, to impeach him again for making his threats to democracy a reality,\" Green wrote in thearticles of impeachment, He then vowed to \"use that law again.\" Green is the second member of Congress to issue articles of impeachment against Trump in the president’s second term. Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., also called for Trump’s impeachment, but he later withdrew the bill after getting backlash from party leadership. Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., reportedly called the bill \"idiotic,\"according to Axios. However, Nadler was previously a sponsor of the measure.

As for me, I stand where I have stood on impeachment, which is a question of conscience, even when the odds are against me — it is better for me to stand alone than not stand at all — it won’t be the first time,\" Green wrote. Green has never been silent about his opposition to Trump, even making multiple attempts to impeach the president during his first term. In March 2025, he was removed from Trump’s address to ajoint session of Congressafter he heckled the president. He was eventually censured for the protest.

    "title": "Minor's lawsuits against adult sites show new state law is working as intended to protect kids: state AG",
    "article_text": "Texas high school student Elliston Berry joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss the House’s passage of a new bill that criminalizes the sharing of non-consensual intimate images, including content created with artificial intelligence. Four first-of-a-kind lawsuits in Kansas were filed Monday aiming to hold porn websites accountable for violating state law, which mandates they use adequate age-verification systems. There are no federal laws requiring porn sites to verify a user's age. The suits, filed by the National Center on Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) and a Kansas law firm on behalf of a minor child and the child's mother, are groundbreaking. It is apparently the first time a minor is seeking a legal remedy through the provisions of state age-verification laws for pornographic sites, according to NCOSE's general counsel. Kansas isamong roughly 20 other states that have enacted age-verification laws for porn sites. Louisiana becamethe first in 2023. SOCIAL MEDIA GIANT HIT WITH SCATHING AD CAMPAIGN AMID ANGER OVER AI CHATBOTS SEXUALLY EXPLOITING KIDS \"The Kansas law also allows for a private right of action, meaning that private individuals and organizations can bring cases against offending companies or websites,\" Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach told Fox News Digital. Kobach filed Kansas's first lawsuit in January against a porn site over a lack of age-verification mechanisms, a case that is ongoing. \"I think the combination of my office's first action followed by this private action shows that the law is operating as the legislature intended,\" Kobach said. Four first-of-a-kind lawsuits in Kansas were filed earlier this week aiming to hold adult websites accountable for violating state law mandating they use age-verification systems.(Getty Images; Fox News) NCOSE sued on behalf of a minor child, whose mother took numerous measures to ensure her 14-year-old child would not be exposed to pornographic websites but later learned her child was using an old laptop to access the sites. Online algorithms and content-curation processes from these sites' parent companies, or from contractors working for the sites, drovethe teenagerto at least two of the sites, according to the initial complaints filed with NCOSE. According to NCOSE, pornography is harmful to children because it disrupts the natural formation of children's sexual functions and maturation. Studies have also shown links between pornography and sexual violence and a litany of other health and well-being issues. GOP LAWMAKERS TARGET ONLINE PORNOGRAPHY, PROPOSE INTERSTATE BAN ON OBSCENE CONTENT Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach said the four lawsuits against porn sites for lacking adequate age-verification measures prove that a state law aiming to require such technology is working as intended.(AP Photo/John Hanna) \"The parents in this instance thought they did everything right,\" NCOSE General Counsel Benjamin Bull said. \"It's not enough just to try to prevent children from gaining access. It's just a question of when children will gain access. \"They'll find a way. It'll either be the kid next door with a kid in school, or an old, you know, thrown-away computer up in the closet some place. And, so, unless theseonline platformsactually install age verification, this boy's … what's happened to him and what's happened to hundreds of thousands of others is just going to continue and get worse.\" According to the lawsuits filed Monday on behalf of the 14-year-old, at least one of the four pornographic sites being sued, Chaturbate, ostensibly has anage-verification mechanism,but it can be easily manipulated, and that does not satisfy Kansas' law. Multi Media LLC, Chaturbate's parent company, insisted to Fox News Digital the site \"is fully compliant\" with Kansas law, calling the lawsuit against it \"completely baseless.\" PORN CASE IN THE SUPREME COURT THIS WEEK IS ABOUT PROTECTING CHILDREN, SAYS REPUBLICAN AG The parent company of one of the adult sites being sued called the lawsuit \"frivolous\" and \"completely baseless.\"(iStock) \"As we explained in great detail to the plaintiff’s counsel back in November, the company thoroughly investigated the claim and found the individual was never able to view any explicit content on the company's platform. The platform's ID verification age gate functioned exactly as expected, and the individual's attempts to view adult content without first proving he was an adult were entirely thwarted,\" a company spokesperson for Multi Media LLC told Fox News Digital. \"The company takes very seriously its responsibility to ensure that the platform only publishes material created and viewed by consenting adults,\" the spokesperson added. \"Since the law went into effect, the company has displayed an 'age gate' page to any visitor who arrives on the site from an IP address that is geolocated in Kansas and who has not previously been verified as an adult, by requiring the individual to provide a government issued photo ID.\" The spokesperson added that Multi Media LLC intends \"to seek sanctions\" against the plaintiff over its \"frivolous complaint,\" noting that when the company was first contacted about the allegations by the plaintiff in November, Multi Media LLC explained why suing it was baseless. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP But AG Kobach said the lawsuit brought by the mother and son, along with another unidentified \"friend\" of the family, shows state law is doing its job. \"I think the really important point, at least from my perspective, is that laws are working, and companies are being taken to task for marketing this material in a way that minors can get it when there are nowtechnologies out thereto prevent that from happening,\" Kobach told Fox News Digital. The 14-year-old and his mother, with the help of NCOSE and others, are seeking statutory damages of no less than $50,000 per violation in each of their four lawsuits. They are also seeking actual damages, attorney fees and any \"further relief\" that the court considers fair.",

    "title": "James Carville dismisses Democratic Party's record-low polling: 'We're winning elections'",
    "article_text": "Veteran Democratic Party strategist James Carville warned Democrats that they need to ditch jargon that confuses or even offends persuadable voters. Despite a flurry of polling so far this year indicating the Democratic Party's favorability sinking to record lows, veteran Democratic strategist and punditJames Carvilleremains optimistic, as he points to recent ballot box victories by his party. \"You can't discount people winning elections,\" Carville told Fox News Digital this week. Carville spoke the day after a new survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research was the latest to spell trouble for the Democratic Party, six months after they suffered setbacks up and down the ballot at the hands of now-PresidentDonald Trumpand Republicans. The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's elections, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black and Hispanic voters as well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base. ON THE RISE: NEW POLL INDICATES TRUMP'S APPROVAL RATINGS EDGING UP Then-Vice President Kamala Harris delivers her presidential nomination acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 22, 2024. The latest public opinion polls indicate the Democratic Party sinking to new favorability lows.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) According to the survey, only about one-third of Democrats are very or somewhat optimistic about the future of theDemocratic Party. That's a steep decline from last July, when around six in 10 Democrats said they were optimistic. The survey, conducted May 1-5, points to an increase in optimism among Republicans, with 55% more optimistic about the future of the GOP, up from 47% last summer. HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING Since Trump's return to power earlier this year, an increasingly energized base of Democrats is urging party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration. And their anger is directed not only at Republicans, but also at Democrats they feel aren't vocal enough in their opposition to Trump. And that's fueled the plunge in the Democratic Party's favorable ratings, which have hit historic lows in several recent surveys. The Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the most recent Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21. (Fox News ) That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower thanthat of the GOP,which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable. The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys. The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey — 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable — conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier. And national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and in March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows. Confidence in the Democratic Party's congressional leadership sunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month. The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023. And the semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived. \"I don’t doubt any of that’s true,\" Carville told Fox News. \"But there’s one thing: We’re winning elections left and right as we’re talking about how the Democratic number or image is low.\" John Ewing, Jr., the Democrat-aligned mayoral candidate in Omaha, Nebraska, seen here shaking hands with voters on May 8, defeated the Republican-aligned longtime mayor to become the city's first Black mayor.(Megan Nielsen/Omaha World-Herald via AP) John Ewing, Jr., a Democrat, this week ousted a longtime Republican mayor in Omaha, Nebraska, a blue dot in a reliably red state. Ewing will become Omaha's first Black mayor. Last month, the Democrat-aligned candidate comfortably defeated the Republican-aligned candidate in a Wisconsin state Supreme Court election. The high-profile and expensive campaign grabbed plenty of national attention and outside money. Democrats have also performed very well so far this year inspecial elections, including flipping red state Senate seats in Iowa and Pennsylvania. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In addition to looking back, Carville also pointed ahead to November's gubernatorial election in Virginia, where Democrats hope to win back the governor's office in Richmond. \"Let's see what's going to happen in Virginia,\" said Carville, who first grabbed national attention for his work as a lead strategist on former President Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign. And Carville predicted that \"we’re going to win that.\" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire. He covers the campaign trail from coast to coast.\"",

Axiosreleased audioon Friday from Biden's interviews with Hur in which the then-president appeared to struggle to remember when his son Beau died, when he left office as vice president, what year President Donald Trump was elected to his first term or why he had classified documents that should not have been in his possession.

FormerPresident Joe Biden,in newly leaked audio of his interview with special counsel Robert Hur, admitted he likely kept a classified document related to Afghanistan after he left the vice presidency for \"posterity’s sake.\" Biden first said he didn’t recall why he had the document when asked about it by Hur, who told him it was found in the library of his lake house. \"I don’t know that I knew,\" that he had the document, Biden answered, \"but it wasn’t something I would have stopped to think about.\" Hur noted that Bob Woodward and Jules Witcover both wrote about the document in their books about him, asking if he wanted to hang onto it because it might be the subject of reporting or \"history.\" BIDEN STRUGGLES WITH WORDS, KEY MEMORIES IN LEAKED AUDIO FROM SPECIAL COUNSEL HUR INTERVIEW \"I guess I wanted to hang on to it for posterity’s sake. I mean, this was my position on Afghanistan. I’ve been of the view from a historical standpoint that there are certain points in history, world history, where fundamental things change using technology,\" he said. \"So, there are a lot of things that I think are fundamentally changing how international societies function, and they relate a lot to technology.\" After the 80-year-old continued on that subject for a while, Hur interrupted him to get back to the topic of the document. \"No, I’m sorry, that’s why I wanted it,\" Biden answered. \"It had nothing to with Afghanistan.\" One of the former president's lawyers then interrupted Hur to say, \"For the purposes of a clean record,\" he wanted to avoid \"getting into speculative areas,\" mentioning that Biden at first answered the question about the document by saying he didn’t recall why he had it. At that point, Hur answered, \"I think we should take a break.\" Former President Joe Biden(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) In other sections of the audio, Biden seems confused, asking what year his son, Beau Biden, died, and what year he left the vice presidency. HOUSE JUDICIARY SUES GARLAND FOR BIDEN AUDIO THAT HUR SAYS SHOWS HIM AS 'ELDERLY MAN WITH A POOR MEMORY' The audio, related to an investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents while vice president, came out after more than a year of congressional lawmakers demanding its release amid questions about the former president’s memory lapses and mental acuity. The House Judiciary Committee sued Attorney General Merrick Garland in July for the audio recordings, stressing the importance of the \"verbal and nonverbal context\" of Biden's answers that could be provided by the audio recordings, especially considering Hur opted against charging Biden after the interview, partly because Biden was viewed as\"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" Hur opted against charging Biden after the interview, in part, because Biden was viewed as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\"(Getty Images) The committee argued at the time that the audio recordings, not merely the transcripts of them, are \"the best available evidence of how President Biden presented himself during the interview.\" That lawsuit was filed beforeBiden dropped out of the 2024presidential race in July after he struggled in a June debate with Trump. Biden had exerted executive privilege over the audio recordings while president. Hur, whoreleased his reportto the public in February 2024 after months of investigation, did not recommend criminal charges against Biden for mishandling and retaining classified documents, and he said he would not bring charges against Biden even if he were not in the Oval Office.

GOP House Oversight Committee Chairman and other Republicans are raising concerns about whether formerPresident Joe Biden'scognitive functions were good enough to authorize aides to use an autopen tool to sign important documents on his behalf. On Friday evening, Axios released exclusive audio footage of Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, which reveals clues about Biden's cognitive functioning while president that the interview's transcript did not elucidate. Biden can be heard slurring his words, muttering and taking long pauses. Meanwhile, he failed to recall the date of his son Beau's death or the year Trump was first elected. \"It questions who was actually making the decisions,\"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky.,said Friday night on Fox News Channel's \"Hannity.\" \"Clearly, from that interview, which was many, many months prior to the heavy use of the autopen, Joe Biden wasn't capable of making decisions.

According to Comer, among other important things, the autopen tool was used to grant presidential pardons to Biden's family members. \"It does call into question these pardons – the use of autopen, and I think it may actually open the door – I'm not a lawyer – but I'd imagine Trump or his administration may try to make some arguments to federal courts about actions Joe Biden took because now we've got more information coming out, and they're reasonably going to determine, ‘Yeah Joe Biden couldn’t remember anything.

    "title": "Bumpy Weather Over Newark: House Democrats could face consequences for Delaney Hall incident",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the clash surrounding potential legal action against three Democratic lawmakers on ‘Special Report.’ What’s dicier these days? Flying intoNewark Liberty Airport? Or finding yourself near the front gate of an ICE detention center in Newark? To the mind of famous bandleader Raymond Scott – you’re in for \"Bumpy Weather Over Newark\" either way. That’s one of Scott’s most famous compositions. It ranks right up there with \"Powerhouse\" and the scores to 120 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies cartoons. A trio ofHouse Democratsscuffled with federal law enforcement officers last week at Delaney Hall in Newark. It’s possible they could face discipline from the House for the fracas. Or worse. REPUBLICANS STRUGGLE WITH TRUMP'S MIXED SIGNALS ON 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Fox is told that arrests could be in the offing for Reps. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., Robert Menendez Jr., D-N.J., and Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J.(Getty Images) Fox is told that arrests could be in the offing for Reps. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., Robert Menendez Jr., D-N.J., and Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J. \"What happened on May 9th was not oversight. It was a political stunt that put the safety of our law enforcement officers, our agents, our staff, and our detainees at risk,\" said Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemto a House hearing Wednesday. \"The behavior was lawlessness. And it was beneath this body.\" Noem should know something about that. She served in the House for eight years. On her way into the hearing, Noem said that an investigation is underway. \"I think that arrests are still on the table for this,\" said Homeland Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin on Fox. \"If it was a typical U.S. citizen and they tried to storm into a detention facility that's housing dangerous criminals or any person at all, they would be arrested. Just because you are a Memberof Congressor just because you're a public official does not mean you are above the law.\" Democrats argue they did nothing wrong. They had a right, under the law, to request an inspection of the facility. That comports with their oversight responsibilities. ButHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., assessed videotape of Democrats tangling with federal agents. He determined that wasn’t oversight. \"It looked like a battery to me,\" said Johnson. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., saw it differently. U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) speaks during his press conference at the U.S. Capitol on April 28, 2025, in Washington, DC.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) \"There is zero basis to hold any Member of Congress accountable,\" said Jeffries. \"No videos have been produced suggesting that they've engaged in any inappropriate activity. And if those videos existed, certainly they would have been put into the public domain by now. Those videos haven't been released because they don't exist.\" Chatter about possible arrests or sanctions for the Democrats rattled around Capitol Hill all week. McIver and her aides bowled past a wall of reporters en route to the Noem hearing Wednesday. \"Are you worried about being arrested potentially?\" asked yours truly. McIver’s aides pushed arms and hands holding microphones out of the way. \"Excuse me! Excuse me!\" ordered McIver, never breaking stride. \"The Speaker has talked about censure, Ms. McIver. Do you have any response to that?\" I asked. The Congresswoman disappeared behind a doorway to the House Homeland Security Committee, never responding. TRUMP PUSHES TAX HIKES FOR WEALTHY AS 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' DEADLINE LOOMS Colleague Dan Scully tried valiantly to get McIver to comment on Thursday. But no dice. \"(Interim U.S. Attorney for New Jersey) Alina Habba said she was going to announce an investigation. Was there any sort of deal made between you and what happened over there? Do you care to comment on that at all?\" asked Scully. Silence from McIver. \"Has anyone from DOJ reached out to you?\" asked another reporter. Crickets. \"Congresswoman, do you regret shoving officers? Did you think you would get away with that?\" asked another scribe. Nada. \"Do you have any comment at all?\" queried Scully. It’s doubtful that even the resourcefulness of TV’s MacGyver could have pried loose any response from McIver. Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., introduced a resolution to strip McIver, Menendez and Watson Coleman of their committee assignments. \"Keep your hands off of Members of Congress,\" warned Jeffries. Yours truly followed up with Jeffries at his press conference Tuesday. \"What happens if they were to go and arrest these Members, or if they would try to sanction them in the House first?\" I asked. \"They’ll find out,\" replied Jeffries. \"What would you do?\" I followed up. \"They’ll find out,\" repeated Jeffries. \"What resource?\" I countered. \"They’ll find out,\" he said again. \"Doesn’t that broach…?\" \"They’ll find out.\" \"Does that go against…?\" \"That’s a red line,\" said Jeffries. \"What’s the red line?\" I asked. TWO PLANES DO 'GO-AROUNDS' TO AVOID MILITARY HELICOPTER NEAR REAGAN WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT \"It’s a red line. It’s very clear. First of all, I think that the so-called Homeland Security spokesperson is a joke. It's a joke. They know better than to go down that road. And it's been made loudly and abundantly clear to the Trump Administration. We're not going to be intimidated by their tactics,\" said Jeffries. \"There are clear lines that they just dare not cross.\" An arrest of these lawmakers would spark a firestorm on Capitol Hill. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution generally shields lawmakers from charges – so long they as they are conducting official Congressional business. A lawmaker isn’t off the hook if they shoot someone. But the Founders were mindful of how politically-motivated arrests could undercut the work of Congress. So, they crafted what’s known as the \"Speech or Debate\" clause to inoculate lawmakers when conducting business. \"They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place,\" reads the provision. \"I don't think that's Speech and Debate clause,\" said Johnson about the rhubarb in Newark. \"We have to set a standard here. You cannot have Members of Congress pushing law enforcement officials around and that's exactly what everybody saw on the videotape.\" Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wondered how a prosecution might short-circuit Congressional prerogatives and privileges. \"I think it's a sign of weakness to instill fear,\" said Pelosi. \"It does definitely step on the Speech or Debate Clause.\" Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., wondered how a prosecution might short-circuit Congressional prerogatives and privileges.(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite) One Democrat involved in the Newark skirmish said prosecution wouldn’t surprise her. \"The rule of law means nothing to them,\" said Watson Coleman. \"I think the majority of this country will see that this is not American. This is not upholding the Constitution.\" House Republicans would like to censure the triumvirate of New Jersey Democrats who were at Delaney Hall. Censure is one of the official modes of discipline in the House, just short of expulsion. That requires a vote on the House floor. The House voted to censure Rep. Al Green, D-Tex., after he hectored President Trump during his speech to a Joint Session of Congress in March. Like all things, it’s about the math. And Fox is told the House likely lacks the votes to discipline the Members or oust them from committees. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for criminal charges? Those remain to be seen. But actually arresting a Member of Congress would undoubtedly trigger some \"Bumpy Weather Over Newark.\" And a political firestorm in Washington, DC.

    "article_text": "A Greenville County, South Carolina, judge on Friday denied bond for Samuel Theodore Cain, who is accused of threatening Rep. Nancy Mace. Mace spoke after the bond hearing. (WHNS) Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., praised a South Carolina judge Friday after bond was denied for the 19-year-old transgender activist accused of threatening to assassinate her. She also shook the hand of the suspect’s father. Samuel Theodore Cain, who identifies as transgender and uses the name \"Roxie Wolfe\" online, was arrested May 15 by state agents for allegedly posting graphic threats targeting Mace and her children. Cain remains in custody, and a trial date has not been set. The judge cited the seriousness of the threats during a hearing. \"Mr. Cain, I do believe that you are a credible threat, and I'm going to put you in on a no bond,\" the judge said. \"The only condition bond I'm going to put on you right now is no contact with the victim.\"EXCLUSIVE: NANCY MACE UNLOADS AFTER ARREST OF TRANS ACTIVIST WHO ALLEGEDLY THREATENED TO 'ASSASSINATE' HER Samuel Theodore Cain is escorted by a prison guard at the Greenville County Detention Center in Greenville, S.C., Friday, May 16, 2025.(WHNS) Mace flew in from Washington, D.C., to deliver a victim impact statement in court Friday morning and speak to reporters afterward. \"I come before you today not just as a victim, but as a sitting member of the United States House of Representatives who has been the target of a direct and credible threat on her life,\" she told the judge. She described how the threats forced her to change her routine, seek shelter and request increased law enforcement patrols for her home and congressional offices. \"This meant I was vulnerable. My staff was vulnerable. And my children were vulnerable,\" she said. \"Threats like these are acts of terror meant to shake the foundations of democracy.\" REP.

I'm 5-foot-6, 115 pounds. He’s twice my size. It was scary. \"As a mom, this was heartbreaking. All I could think about was his family. And my kids. My kids live in fear about being murdered.\" She said she was surprised but thankful for the judge’s ruling. \"I’ve seen how women are treated in this state. I hope this gives women hope,\" she said. \"If there’s a mentally ill man coming after us, we need to stand up for our rights. That’s what I saw the judge do today.\" After the hearing, Mace approached Cain’s family and shook the hand of his father. \"I shook the hand of a father whose son threatened to kill me, not out of forgiveness, but out of grace,\" she later posted on X. \"Strength is about standing your ground and we can be humble with humanity.\" \"I want to thank Samuel Cain’s family,\" she said during her remarks for the media. \"Their humility meant a lot to me. As a mom, it meant something to see them show up. We’re all human. But threats like this have to come with consequences.\" Mace said the threats were discovered by Capitol Police and were serious enough that her staff and law enforcement begged her to get to a safe location. \"This was serious. Nobody knew where he was,\" she said. \"Law enforcement told me to go inside immediately. That’s how real it was.\" She described the toll the threats have taken on her daily life. Rep. Nancy Mace(Getty Images) \"I face threats every day. This is the second person this year. But I receive death threats from trans activists and trans people every single day. And not a single U.S. attorney in the state of South Carolina or anywhere in the country has taken them seriously.\" She warned that continued inaction could be deadly. \"One day, someone’s going to pull the trigger. Someone’s going to get a bullet. Someone’s going to die.\" She also highlighted a broader pattern of violence and called out what she sees as a lack of accountability from Democrats. \"This case isn’t just about one man’s threats. It’s about aculture that tolerates violenceagainst elected officials, especially women who speak up,\" Mace said. \"We do not accept terror. The normalization of threats against public servants corrodes democracy from within. \"Not one Democrat has spoken up to say it’s wrong,\" she added. \"Only Democrats blame the victim.\" On social media, Mace shared a photo of Cain in an orange jumpsuit. \"This is not Roxie Wolfe, this is not a woman, and threatening my life is not a joke. Look at his smirk,\" she posted. Mace ended her statement in court with a final plea for justice. \"I pray this young manfinds God,who alone can change hearts of stone into hearts of flesh,\" she said. \"Letting him walk away sends the message that threatening to kill a member of Congress is just another day without consequence.

    "article_text": "Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss her concerns and the benefits stemming from injectable weight loss drugs as Biden's drug plan aims to provide Medicare and Medicaid coverage for the medications. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), medications that help controltype 2 diabetesand obesity, can have a profound impact on physical wellness – but what about mental health? Some examples of these medications include semaglutides, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, and liraglutide, like Victoza and Saxenda. Various studies have pointed toward GLP-1 RAs causingmental health complications,such as anxiety and depression. WEIGHT-LOSS DRUGS' IMPACT ON CANCER RISK REVEALED IN NEW STUDY The National Institutes of Health (NIH) published research in June 2024 that considered the correlation between semaglutide therapy and \"exacerbating mood disturbances.\" The study highlighted the association of negative mood changes in patients with type 2 diabetes with ahistory of depression,warning healthcare providers to be aware of this \"potential risk.\" Studies have debated the correlation between GLP-1 RA drugs and mood changes.(iStock) But a morerecent study,published in the journal Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, suggested that these mood changes were linked to genetic variations across diverse populations and ancestries within the U.K. Biobank. While GLP-1 RA variants had \"consistent cardiometabolic effects\" across all groups, the researchers said the negative impacts on mental health were \"more varied,\" concluding that any behavioral changes are \"likely not acting directly through [the medications].\" SEMAGLUTIDE FOUND TO HAVE SHOCKING BENEFIT FOR LIVER DISEASE PATIENTS IN NEW STUDY Dr. Brett Osborn, a Florida neurosurgeon who often prescribes GLP-1 RAs to his patients, believes that there is \"no consistent causal relationship\" between these medications and mental illness. \"Researchers assayed genetic markers across almost half a million people from different backgrounds in search of a link between the gene behind GLP-1 receptors and mental health problems likedepression, anxietyor suicidal ideation — and they didn’t find it,\" he summarized. GLP-1 receptor agonists have been linked to mood changes, patients and doctors have reported.(iStock) Peoplewho are obeseor battling type 2 diabetes are \"often already depressed\" without the medication, the doctor pointed out. \"These conditions take a toll – physically, emotionally and socially,\" he said. \"So, yes, a large portion of patients starting GLP-1 drugs are already dealing with mental health struggles. But that’s not because of the drug — that’s because of the disease.\" HERE'S WHY BELLY FAT IS MORE COMMON AS WE AGE, AND 3 WAYS TO PREVENT IT Once these individuals begin dropping weight, blood sugar stabilizes and energy improves, which usually lifts their mood as well. \"GLP-1 drugs help people reclaim their health,\" Osborn noted. \"They reduce inflammation. They lower blood sugar.

    "article_text": "The ‘CyberGuy’ explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams. Got an old computer collecting dust in a closet or tucked under a desk? You're not alone. Many people hold on to aging desktops and laptops, either as backup machines or because they still run \"just fine.\" But here's the catch: if that PC is no longer receivingWindows updates, it could be a security risk, even if it seems perfectly functional. Janet from East Wakefield, NH, recently wrote to us about this very dilemma: \"We need to update our computer due to Windows 11 not running on our older computer. We have two older computers, one we are upgrading and the second one I would like to continue to use on occasion. Do I run the risk of incursions into my software since I will no longer get security upgrades? Any advice on what I should remove (ie, finance info.)? Also, any advice for the older tower? Runs perfectly with solid state SSD. We are loath to put it into the recycling bin.\" The good news is you don't have to toss it just yet. With a few smart steps, you can use it safely or transform it into something completely new and useful. Let's look at how you can breathe new life into your old computer.

A woman working on her older laptop.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) First of all, once Microsoft stops supporting your version of Windows, your PC no longer receives security patches, bug fixes, updated drivers, or browser support. Even if the system still runs smoothly, it becomes more vulnerable to cyber threats likemalware,ransomware,phishing attacksanddata theft. An outdated operating system is like an unlocked door. Hackers and malicious software often target these systems specifically because of their weaknesses. If you plan to keep using an older computer, especially with internet access, it's time toupdate your operating system. BEST ANTIVIRUS FOR PCS — CYBERGUY PICKS 2025 If you still plan to use your PC occasionally, you can minimize the risks with these simple but effective steps: 1. Use it offline only:The easiest way to stay secure is to keep your old PC off the internet entirely. You can still use it for: Without internet access, you remove most external threats. 2. Remove all sensitive data:Even if you’re only using your computer for basic tasks, it’s important to scrub any personal or financial information from the system. That includes: One effective way to securely wipe all personal files at once is to use the built-in Windows reset option, found under Settings > System > Recovery. This will remove your files and restore the system to a clean state. For step-by-step instructions, check outMicrosoft’s guide to resetting your PC.

Disable browsers (or use a safer alternative):If you need occasional internet access, avoid using outdated browsers like old versions of Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. Instead, tryprivacy-focused alternative browsers. Or better yet? Disable browsers altogether and connect to the web on a newer, supported device. 4. Install strong antivirus software that supports legacy systems:Even an offline PC can be exposed via USB drives or transferred files. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strongantivirus softwareinstalled on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Before installing antivirus software, make sure your older computer meets the minimum system requirements. Check for supported operating system (OS) version, RAM, and processor architecture (32-bit or 64-bit). Most providers list these on their site.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices 5. Keep important files on external storage:Avoid saving sensitive files directly on the old PC. Instead: This keeps your data portable, protected and off the aging hardware. That way, your files are safe even if the old computer fails, and you can access them from newer devices anytime. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? A man working on his PC.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) TRANSFERRING DATA FROM AN OLD LAPTOP TO A NEW ONE While this guide focuses on Windows PCs, many of the same principles apply to older Macs, especially if your system is stuck on unsupported macOS versions like High Sierra or Mojave. The best way to stay safe is to limit internet use, remove sensitive data, use supported browsers and install reliable antivirus software. That said, older Macs have a few unique considerations: WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE If the system still has a working tower, especially an SSD (Solid-State Drive), which provides fast storage and efficient performance, it could be perfect for a modern, low-cost makeover. Linux is a free, fast, and secure alternative to Windows that works especially well onolder computers. It's still actively supported and great for basic tasks like browsing the web, checking emails, editing documents, streaming videos or even learning to code. You don't need to be a tech expert to install it, as most versions come with easy, step-by-step installers. Here are some beginner-friendly Linux versions (called \"distributions\" or \"distros\"): For example, Zorin OS lets you choose a desktop layout that looks like Windows, so you don't have to relearn everything. Ubuntu is famous for its reliability and the huge number of tutorials available online, which is helpful if you're new to Linux.

Your old PC can become the backbone of your home network. A few creative uses: This keeps your old machine useful without needing daily interaction. Before you get rid of your old PC, consider whetherselling or recyclingis the best fit for you. Both options are eco-friendly and can be rewarding if done right. Here's how to handle your PC responsibly: If you're done with it, let someone else benefit: Be sure towipe the hard drivebefore donating. Consider using adata erasure tool or disk-wiping softwareto securely erase the entire hard drive. However, alwaysback upany important files before wiping your drive. Always, confirm that you are targeting the correct storage device during the process to avoid accidental data loss. If you’re unable to securely erase sensitive materials from your hard drive, consider removing the drive before donation and recycling it separately.

These are budget-friendly fixes that can significantly improve speed, stability and longevity. 1. Add more RAM:If your system has 4GB or less, upgrading to 8 GB+ can significantly improve multitasking and responsiveness, especially with Linux. Look up your PC’s model number on the manufacturer’s website to find compatible memory. Many desktops (and some laptops) let you upgrade RAM by simply opening the case and inserting the new memory sticks into available slots. 2. Upgrade to an SSD:If you're still using a traditional hard drive, switching to a solid-state drive can dramatically reduce boot times and make your PC feel brand new. For most older machines, look for SSDs labeled \"2.5-inch SATA\", which are the most widely compatible and easy to install. Some newer systems support faster NVMe SSDs, which connect directly to the motherboard. Check your PC model or open the case to see which type your system supports. Be sure to back up your files, then either reinstall the operating system manually or clone your current drive before replacing it. 3. Clean out the dust and refresh thermal paste:Older desktops tend to overheat, which can slow things down or cause random shutdowns. Open up the case and: 4. Swap out the battery or power supply:If your laptop battery no longer holds a charge, or if your desktop randomly shuts off, consider replacing the battery or power supply unit. Just because a computer is old doesn’t mean it’s useless. Whether you’re turning it into a writing station, a media server, or giving Linux a try, your old PC can still be a valuable tool. The key is security. Unsupported systems can be risky if used online, but with a few precautions or by repurposing them entirely, you can keep your data safe and extend the machine’s life in meaningful ways.

    "article_text": "'The Ingraham Angle' panelists Lisa Boothe and Matt Towery discuss the 'somber' night following the audio release of the former president's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur. Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr. was even more demented than we knew.Last night, excerpts leaked from Biden’s October 2023interview with Robert Hur, the federal prosecutor who investigated him for possessing classified documents.They are awful. They show a man in severe cognitive decline. Biden couldn’t recall even basic facts, like when elections are held. Yes, Joe Biden — who had lusted for the presidency his entire life — thought Donald Trump had won in November 2017, not 2016. It wasn’t a verbal slip. He didn’t know. An aide had to correct him. BIDEN REPEATEDLY SAYS ‘I DON’T REMEMBER' REGARDING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IN NEWLY RELEASED HUR INTERVIEW AUDIOEven that summary doesn’t capture Biden’s struggles.What he says is bad. How he says it is worse. His voice is weak and whispery. He goes silent for stretches, loses his train of thought, offers oddly emotional asides about his son Beau — though he could not remember when Beau died. He seems not to remember being vice president; he speaks of being a senator and then jumps to running for president. Audio from then-President Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur reveals that he, and not the special counsel, brought up Beau Biden's death.(Getty Images) In the end, the classified documents investigation went nowhere. (Like the similar case involving Donald Trump, it shouldn’t have). But along the way, Hur — a well-respected prosecutor who had been the U.S. Attorney for Maryland in Trump’s first term — discovered something far more important: proof of Biden’s incapacity. The Hur interview is so crucial because Biden and his handlers went to such lengths to protect Biden from press or public scrutiny even before the 2020 election.Biden used teleprompters for his speeches, of course. His press conferences were rare and closely scripted. He had been told what questions would be asked in advance. Biden’s few unscripted, live interactions visible to the public generally came when he left the White House to walk to Marine One. He would occasionally stumble over to the \"gaggle\" of reporters yelling questions at him and speak for a few seconds. Hunter Biden, son of U.S. President Joe Biden and U.S. first lady Jill Biden leave the federal court after the jury finds him guilty on all three counts in his trial on criminal gun charges, in Wilmington, Delaware, U.S., June 11, 2024.(REUTERS/Hannah Beier) Hur’s interview with Biden was likely the only time during Biden’s entire presidency when he faced lengthy questioning he could not control. It shows why Biden and his handlers tried so hard to avoid similar situations.Hur wrote in his report on the investigation last year that Biden was \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" The audio suggests that description was kind.You wouldn’t trust the guy in this interview to drive to the grocery store.Biden had the nuclear codes.Still worse, Hur interviewed Biden in 2023. If Biden and the people around him had had their way, he would have been president through January 2029. The interview suggests he’ll be nearly vegetative by then — if he lives that long.When the Justice Department released Hur’s report on his investigation in February 2024, the legacy media immediately downplayed its importance and attacked Hur’s motives. … the legacy media is only the second-most important villain here.It was Biden and the people around him, most notably his wife Jill and son Hunter, who insisted that he was fit to serve, and would continue to be until he was 86. \"In what is supposedly a legal document, these inclusions certainly looked gratuitous—to say the least,\" the New Yorker wrote in an article about Biden’s \"righteous fury\" over the report.Two days later, the Washington Post would claim in a headline Hur had a \"five-hour face-off\" with Biden and write:\"Hur’s description of Biden’s demeanor as that of a \"well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory\" would infuriate Biden’s aides, who saw it as sharply at odds with what occurred as the president sat for voluntary questioning.\"Sharply at odds, huh?I have written before about the media’s dereliction of duty in covering Biden’s decline, both before and after the Hur report, which continued until his disastrous June 27 debate in Atlanta made covering for him impossible. And I will come back to the media’s failure. Hur’s report made clear that Biden’s cognitive impairment was severe and the White House was covering it up. That scheme should have been the story of the 2024 campaign from the moment the report became public.This is not 20/20 hindsight on my part. On Feb. 9, 2024, the day the report came out, I wrote that it actually might be WORSE for Biden than an actual indictment.Most of the media looked the other way, even as Biden’s flubs and lapses visibly worsened in the spring of 2024 despite the protective cocoon around him. But the legacy media is only the second-most important villain here.It was Biden and the people around him, most notably his wife Jill and son Hunter, who insisted that he was fit to serve, and would continue to be until he was 86. Both Jill and Hunt had their reasons. Jill’s lust for the trappings of power would be almost comic in its nakedness if it weren’t so dangerous; Hunter has champagne taste and a beer budget (or, more accurately in his case, cocaine taste and a meth budget).But, of course, all of them, including Biden, knew the truth. If they hadn’t, they wouldn’t have gone to such great lengths to hide it. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONImagine if Biden had won. Imagine if he had somehow found his way through his debates with Trump and then gone back to the presidential cocoon. Imagine if the media had insisted through Election Day that the videos showing his decline were merely \"cheap fakes\" - as it did throughout the spring. We’d be approaching a Constitutional crisis. Our system is not parliamentary; it has no way to replace an unfit President quickly or easily. And in running for a second term when he did not have to, Biden showed that he would not give up power unless he was forced to do so.Robert Hur spoke truth to power. He’s a hero.

    "title": "DR MARC SIEGEL: Presidential fitness and what we deserve to know",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel compares President Trump and former President Biden’s health on ‘Hannity.’ Everyone knows an elderly relative or friend with a failing memory. It is one of the least pleasant experiences in life, and as dementia progresses, and the person reaches for memories that are no longer there, feelings of frustration and uncertainty increase. Relatives and caretakers worry and may feel helpless, even as the patient themselves denies a problem and may also vary in mental acuity from one day to the next or even from one moment to the next. Gait may be affected depending on the specific diagnosis, and falls become more frequent. Most people would agree that there is a difference in seeing the symptoms of dementia or cognitive slipping occur in someone’s relative versus the president of the United States. The concern with the president of course is demonstrating a continuing ability to execute the duties of the office at the highest level. The president’s yearly physical has become a yardstick to gauge that ability. This is why Dr. Kevin O’Connor, White House physician during PresidentJoe Biden’sterm is under scrutiny for his reports that reassured the American public that Biden was in excellent health and fit to serve. In February 2024, he wrote, \"An extremely detailed neurologic exam was again reassuring in that there were no findings which would be consistent with any cerebellar or other neurological disorder, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s or ascending lateral sclerosis, nor were there any signs of cervical myelopathy. This exam did again support a finding of peripheral neuropathy in both feet.\" But missing from this letter, as from previous letters on President Biden’s health, was any mention of an MRI of the brain or or neuro-cognitive testing. Peripheral neuropathy or sensory loss in his extremities would hardly be a cause for concern about fitness. Further, even if there was a discussion about possible use of a wheelchair among White House insiders, as a new book, \"Original Sin,\" by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios’ Alex Thompson suggests, this would also not be a reason to question fitness.FDRfamously served from a wheelchair during World War II, even if he tried to hide it so as not to show weakness to the Nazis. JONATHAN TURLEY: BIDEN NOT THE ONLY LOSER REVEALED BY SHOCKING HUR AUDIO Biden’s gait or feebleness would only have mattered when he was president if it were tied to a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which Dr. O’Connor was claiming it wasn’t. But was this assessment entirely accurate or comprehensive? We don’t know. But what we do know, now that Special Counsel Robert Hur’s audiotapes have finally been released, is that Biden was clearly suffering from periods of profound disorientation and memory loss while president involving very important events such as when his son died or when he left office as vice president. Hearing these moments on tape, as opposed to reading them on a transcript, are very sobering and are enough to question his fitness in and of themselves. Yet nothing was done except for apparent obfuscation and coverup. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION There has been a long history of obscuring presidential health, from Woodrow Wilson to FDR to Eisenhower, even toRonald Reagan, where there is still some debate about whether he began to show mild signs of cognitive impairment in his second term. But this tawdry history of lack of disclosure doesn’t make it right. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We still don’t know what former President Biden suffers from. He had brain aneurysms and a bleed back in 1988 which were repaired by an open method (craniotomy) which could lead to long term cognitive problems, and he suffers from atrial fibrillation (irregularly irregular heart beat), which recent studies have shown increased risk ofcognitive decline. There is a risk of vascular dementia. Whatever the underlying cause of his periods of disorientation and memory lapses we wish him well. But we also wish the country an era of greater disclosure and transparency especially when it involves our highest office. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

    "title": "Beyond anti-DEI: The case for a durable civil rights compromise",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Will Cain and journalist Batya Ungar-Sargon expose the depths of DEI 'indoctrination' in the federal government on 'The Will Cain Show.' In just a few short years, the tides have turned against racial preferences, in areas ranging from college admissions to corporate hiring. TheSupreme Courthas taken a far more skeptical stance toward the practice. The second Trump administration has launched an all-out war on DEI, which stands for the once-popular euphemism \"diversity, equity, and inclusion.\" These moves align federal policy withpublic opinion, the principles of nondiscrimination and meritocracy, and the actual text of our key antidiscrimination laws. But their supporters should ask what comes next—how to maintain these victories in the years and decades ahead as political winds inevitably shift. In a new report for the Manhattan Institute, I review how we got here and ask what a durable compromise on civil-rights law might look like. I propose ways to fight racial bias, regardless of group targeted, while encouraging the use of transparent, objective, fair processes. WHITE HOUSE VOWS TO IMPLEMENT 'SYSTEM OF MERIT' IN US, DISMANTLE DEI 'STRANGULATION' Our core antidiscrimination statutes, passed in the 1960s, clearly prohibited racial discrimination in employment, housing, and programs receiving federal funds (which includes most colleges). They didn’t make exceptions for so-called \"reverse\" discrimination. It was executive agencies and courts, not the people’s representatives, that took the lead in legalizing such efforts. In employment, for example, look to the Supreme Court’s decisions inUnited Steelworkers v. WeberandJohnson v. Transportation Agency, or the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’sguidance on affirmative-action plans. In college admissions, look toUniversity of California v. Bakke, which began the line of higher-ed cases the Supreme Court essentially overturned in 2023. Somewhat more complex is the doctrine of \"disparate impact,\" which the Supreme Court endorsed in its 1971 decisionGriggs v. Duke Power, but which Congress wrote intoAmerican employment lawtwo decades later. Under this rule, employment tests and other selection methods are presumptively illegal if different demographic groups pass them at different rates—which is inevitable in a world with tragic racial gaps in academic achievement and obvious sex differences in physical strength. This saddles employers with the burden of defending their tests on a highly technical level amid the stigma of discrimination lawsuits, while praying courts will take their side, even if there is no evidence whatsoever of ill intent. That, in turn, creates a clear incentive for employers to choose their hiring practices based on their racial effects to begin with. With this history in mind, recent developments in the Supreme Court and the Trump administration are worth celebrating. The Court was right to strike down preferences in higher ed, and the Trump administration is right to enforce the written law against DEI-practicing companies and colleges. Regarding disparate impact, private litigants may still pursue cases rooted in the doctrine, but the Trump administration has publicly vowed todeprioritizesuch cases in its own enforcement efforts—a defensible approach to a bad andarguably unconstitutionalrule. But let’s not kid ourselves: The political winds will shift back eventually, and victories won through the executive branch are particularly fragile, as any future administration can undo them. Even the balance of the Supreme Court will flip someday. And elites on the left have always been favorable to racial preferences even if the public has not. MERIT OVER MANDATES: TRUMP SHOULD LOOK TO COLLEGE SPORTS AS HIS WINNING MODEL FOR DEI Are there ways to make these victories a little more resilient? I propose that the key might lie in a broader colorblindness agenda. Conservatives have long chafed at affirmative action, for good reason. But a level of anti-Black bias persists today, too, and this may present an opportunity for a lasting compromise. DEI MADE DIVERSITY A DIRTY WORD. BUT THE CONCEPT MADE AMERICA GREAT Yes, this bias is far weaker than it once was, and it’s hardly a full explanation of America’s ongoing racial gaps in important outcomes such as earnings and imprisonment. But as I detail in my report, there’s good evidence that some employers still do hire whites more easily than they hire blacks. Indecades’ worthof \"audit\" experiments, for instance, otherwise-similar applicants of different races have applied to jobs to see if employers favor those of one race or another. Like all social science, this body of work has its flaws. For example, there are signs of \"publication bias,\" in which some studies with undesirable results are simply never published; also, many studies rely on stereotypically \"white\" or \"black\" names to signal applicants’ race, but these names cansignal social class as well. But in my view, considering the literature as a whole, this work suggests that being black can still be a moderatedisadvantagein some segments of the job market. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION I believe that conservatives’ anti-DEI efforts will succeed best if paired with a sincere campaign to stop this kind of behavior. In the short term, theTrump administrationshould be sure to pursue and publicize traditional civil-rights cases amid its war on DEI, to drive home a message that fair, evenhanded enforcement is the goal. In the longer term, Congress—if it’s even capable of passing laws on controversial topics anymore—should fix the statute books. Clearly ban affirmative action and minimize disparate-impact liability in all areas of the law, while funding rigorous audits and other measures to address disparatetreatmentby race, regardless of which race is targeted. If nothing else, a bill of this nature would force its opponents to explain what’s wrong with colorblind policies backed by thorough enforcement. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For too long, American civil-rights law has actively discouraged meritocratic hiring, while making it effectively legal to discriminate against whites and other \"overrepresented\" groups. Good riddance. But bringingthe DEI erato an endpermanentlywill require reforms that are both broader and deeper. Robert VerBruggen is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute.",

    "title": "Harvard's discrimination problem runs deep. Are they willing to fix it?",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Bill Bennett joins ‘Fox News @ Night’ to discuss Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s letter condemning Harvard University. With theTrump administrationthreatening to cut off its federal support, Harvard recently released its long-awaited internal report detailing rampant national-origin discrimination on campus – especially against Israelis and Jews. The administration claims thatHarvardis rotten to the bone, hollowed out by ideological one-sidedness and an emphasis on social-justice activism rather than genuine inquiry. The university has countered that while it is working on rooting out discrimination, the administration has \"overreached\" to target the substance of what is studied and taught. The report, prepared by the Presidential Task Force on Combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias, puts the prestigious university in a difficult position. Its leadership has never denied that it has a serious discrimination problem, which has been substantiated in multiple reports compiled by the Task Force, alumni groups, and lawmakers. Nearly a year ago, the Task Force recommended that Harvard take \"substantive disciplinary action\" against those contributing to the \"dire\" conditions for Israeli students, in particular. No disciplinary action has been taken. Instead, a Harvard Law student who was videoed assaulting an Israeli classmate recently received a $65,000 school-sponsored fellowship to work at the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Rather than expel the harassers and assaulters, Harvard has gone on the offensive. While admitting that it can improve its anti-discrimination efforts, it has accused the Trump administration of using antisemitism as an excuse to meddle with universities’ internal affairs. \"No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,\" wrote Harvard President Alan Garber on April 14. The main Trump administration demands Garber rejected were \"requirements to ‘audit’ the viewpoints of our student body, faculty, staff, and to ‘reduce the power’ of certain students, faculty, and administrators targeted because of their ideological views.\" TRUMP BRANDS HARVARD ‘ANTISEMITIC’ AND A ‘THREAT TO DEMOCRACY’ AMID FUNDING BATTLE As the new report reveals, though, those demands have a lot to do with fighting discrimination. Example after example shows how ideological lopsidedness and occasional downright unseriousness fosters bigotry against Jews and Israelis. Fighting discrimination may well require more thoroughgoing reform than Garber is willing to offer. Perhaps the most flagrant example in the report concerned a \"Pyramid of White Supremacy\" taught in a mandatory class at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. It categorizes \"day-to-day racist norms\" from the \"covert\" to the \"overt\" and scaling up to \"genocide.\" Most of it simply demonizes popular views that leftist radicals hate. The middle of the pyramid includes \"colorblindness,\" the \"myth of meritocracy\" and \"anti-affirmative action.\" But right there alongside it is \"Anti-Defamation League\" and \"anti-BDS,\" or the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement against Israel. The pyramid should primarily be a source of embarrassment. It reduces a Harvard graduate education to ideological indoctrination – a conspiratorial one, at that. But it also shows how bigotry against Jews and Israel, usually for being seen as \"white,\" fits right in with progressive orthodoxies about social justice. That phenomenon is everywhere. As the report documents, Harvard students and faculty who engage in national-origin discrimination repeatedly grounded their discrimination in progressive justifications about victimhood, colonialism, and race. When a School of Public Health webinar turned to criticizing Israel – doubtless on the intersectional theory that public health and the Middle East are somehow related – Jewish students asked why. They were met with a distinctly leftist retort: \"Who is more marginalized, Jews or Palestinians?\" Aside from the breathtaking historical illiteracy of such a question, it reveals the pervasiveness of the attitude thought to be confined to leftist activists: If you are not \"marginalized\" as a group, bigotry against you is no big deal. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Harvard’s Divinity School told Jewish students to \"embrace… ‘de-zionization.’\" The report concludes that in doing so, Harvard faculty \"attribute to Jews two great sins: first, in the Levant, the establishment of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Nakba; and second, in the United States, participation in White supremacy.\" On this view, treating Jews poorly is no different from harassing someone for joining the KKK. These are just a few examples, which do not even get into the horror of the cues Harvard students have taken from their teachers. The report puts it succinctly: \"The notion that acceptance in a politically liberal or progressive on-campus space is contingent upon disavowing Israel was a recurring theme.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Friends who are more outwardly Jewish and Israelis, the things they are experiencing are horrible. I feel lucky I don’t look Jewish,\" said one undergraduate. Jews and Israelis certainly don’t need to put up with being called genocide apologists or white supremacists as they traverse the quad. \"Put your headphones in, make sure you’re not outwardly Jewish, and just walk to class.\" The problem is that they might just hear the exact same thing when they get there.

    "title": "JONATHAN TURLEY: Biden not the only loser revealed by shocking Hur audio",
    "article_text": "Author Tom Fitton discusses the release of former President Biden’s interview audio with Special Counsel Robert Hur on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ \"For posterity's sake.\" Those words from President Joe Biden sum up the crushing impact of theleaked audiotapesfrom the interview between him and Special Counsel Robert Hur. Not only did they remove any doubt overBiden committing federal crimes, but they also constituted what is akin to a political racketeering indictment against much of the Washington establishment, from the White House staff to Democratic politicians to the media. The interview, conducted from Oct. 8-9, 2023, has long been sought by Congress, but was kept under wraps by Biden's Justice Department even as Biden campaigned for a second term. BIDEN REPEATEDLY SAYS ‘I DON’T REMEMBER' REGARDING CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS IN NEWLY RELEASED HUR INTERVIEW AUDIO Many of us balked at the conclusion of Hur that no charges were appropriate despite the fact that the president had removed classified documents for decades, stored them in grossly negligent ways, and moved them around to unsecure locations, including his garage in Delaware. Given President Donald Trump's indictment for the same offenses, it was hard to imagine how the special counsel could not recommend the same criminal charges (presumably after he left office). Instead, Hur declared it would have been hard to get a jury to convict Biden because he was \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" President Joe Biden, left, and first lady Jill Biden arrive on Marine One on the South Lawn of the White House, Monday, Aug. 5, 2024, in Washington.(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) It appears that Trump, on the other hand, was presumptively not sympathetic or well-meaning and possessed a good enough memory to face prosecution. The contrast was glaring and only reinforced the view of many citizens that there are two tracks for justice in Washington. Soon after the report's release, Biden gave an irate press conference at which he lied about the findings of his culpability and lashed out at any suggestion that he had gapped or stumbled in the interview. For example, when reporters raised Hur's assertion that Biden had forgotten when his son Beau died, Biden angrily responded, \"How in the hell dare he raise that?\" Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their damn business.\" However, it was not Hur but Biden himself who raised the death of his son, and he forgot a wide array of dates, including when he served in office. Special Counsel Robert Hur’s report described Biden as \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,\" mirroring the impression he left on viewers of the debate.(Getty Images) The interview shows that in 2023 it was clear that Biden was mentally diminished despite claims from many allies and former aides that there was a sudden loss of capacity just before the disastrous debate in 2024. It is now undeniable that the White House staff actively hid the president's incompetence from the American public. That includes the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki (who left her post in May 2022) and her successor, Karine Jean-Pierre, who insisted that Biden was sharp and \"running circles\" around the staff. Of course, the media is now covering the story after the public saw the truth in the debate. Figures like CNN's Jake Tapper have even written books that belatedly pursue the question despite previously insisting that there was no evidence of a diminishment in Biden's mental state. Tapper repeatedly dismissed the claim and even excoriated Lara Trump for raising it. In one interview, he pushed a White House talking point that such suggestions were mocking Biden for a childhood stutter. \"It's so amazing to me- a ‘cognitive decline,’\" he told the president's daughter-in-law. \"I think you were mocking his stutter. Yeah. I think you were mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline. I would think somebody in the Trump family would be more sensitive to people who do not have medical licenses diagnosing politicians from afar.\" When Lara Trump insisted that this was clearly evidence of a \"very concerning\" cognitive decline, Tapper dismissed her statement by saying, \"Thank you, Lara. I'm sure it's from a place of concern. We all believe that.\" Keep in mind that others beyond Lara Trump were raising this issue and there were tapes showing obvious physical and mental decline. The media simply refused to seriously pursue the story until the cover-up no longer mattered after the debate. Over on MSNBC, Joe Scarborough was equally apoplectic at those raising the issue andstated \"Start your tape right now because I’m about to tell you the truth. And eff you if you can’t handle the truth. This version of Biden intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. Not a close second. And I have known him for years…If it weren’t the truth, I wouldn’t say it This media effort continued all the way up the debate itself. On CNN.com,Oliver Darcywrote \"Right-wing media figures are desperately pushing conspiracy theories about Biden ahead of the debate.\" Once the public found out, the media was ready to tell the story when it became impossible, and no longer politically beneficial, to deny it. Articles began to appear with the same realization of, \"Oh you meant THAT mental decline. Well sure.\" It was the same belated acknowledgment that came, after the election, with Hunter Biden's laptop. The media just moved on with a shrug and a collective \"our bad\" concession. As for the then-president himself, the one moment of clarity in the interview may have been his most incriminating line. When asked why he removed classified material on Afghanistan, Biden admitted \"I guess I wanted to hang on to it for posterity's sake.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION That is precisely what critics on CNN and MSNBC accused Trump of doing: removing material as types of keepsakes or trophies. One president was indicted for that and one was sent along his way to pursue a second term in office. The real indictment that comes out of these tapes is a type of political racketeering enterprise by the Washington establishment. It took a total team effort from Democratic politicians to the White House staff to the media to hide the fact that the president of the United States was mentally diminished. If there were a political RICO crime, half of Washington would be frog marched to the nearest federal courthouse. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Of course, none of this complicity in the cover-up is an actual crime. It is part of the Washington racket.

PresidentDonald Trump'sbold executive order on drug pricing isn't just policy—it's a revolution in healthcare affordability. The plan is simple yet transformative: ensure Americans pay no more for medications than citizens of other wealthy nations. Consider this stark reality: aGLP-1 drugcosting $88 in London commands $1,000 in the United States. Even after manufacturer discounts to insurers, Americans still pay over $400—for the identical medication, from the same company, produced in the same facility. This disparity is especially galling when pharmaceutical companies extract 70% of their profits from America—a nation representing just 4% of the world's population. This global free-riding on American patients ends now. Industry leaders recognize this imbalance. I've already engaged with CEOs from four major American pharmaceutical companies and a foreign manufacturer eager to relocate to the U.S. Their response has been encouraging, but we're prepared to act decisively if necessary.

    "title": "DAN GAINOR: Journalism's original spin. 7 ways the Tapper/Thompson Biden book attempts to absolve media",
    "article_text": "Jake Tapper, who is out with a new book about the cover-up of Joe Biden's health decline, admitted on CNN that he didn't cover the issue enough during his presidency. Journalism is the first draft of history, to paraphrase a famous quote. If that’s true, journalism books are the CYA of history. Such is the case with the new book by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios National Political Correspondent Alex Thompson, who try to shift the blame for coverage of PresidentJoe Biden’shealth entirely onto the White House and away from the biased news media – like CNN. The duo is about to release their book titled, \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run.\" The book would be better titled, \"Original Spin.\" Based on early release to various news outlets, it is a whitewash of journalism’s many failures to properly cover Biden’s very public slide into incoherence. If Helen of Troy was The Face That Launched a Thousand Ships, this book launched 1,000 takes onTwitter/X, some of them so good they should win awards. (Stephen L. Miller, aka @redsteeze, outdid them all.) JOURNALISM'S 'ORIGINAL SPIN': HOW TAPPER'S BIDEN BOOK ATTEMPTS TO ABSOLVE MEDIA But it wasn’t just Tapper, it was an entire media enterprise that hid Biden’s decline. Here are my seven favorite moments from then and now: The Amazon description reads like it’s promoting \"All the President’s Men,\" not a book-long rationalization. \"From two of America’s most respected journalists, an unflinching and explosive reckoning with one of the most fateful decisions in American political history: Joe Biden’s run for reelection despite evidence of his serious decline—amid desperate efforts to hide the extent of that deterioration.\" And it then includes this quote from the equally culpable folks at Politico: \"The book Biden allies fear the most.\" Biden allies don’t fear the book. There aren’t many left who admit they supported him. It’s the media who fear it. Because this book reminds Americans the legacy press is untrustworthy either covering the news or admitting their role in covering it up. We’re not letting Tapper off that easy. Here’s his ego-infused PR quote in a CNN story, \"Toni Morrison once said ‘If there’s a book that you want to read, but it hasn’t been written yet, then you must write it,’\" Jake Tapper said in a statement. \"That’s what inspired this book: we wanted to know more about what we all just lived through. More than 200 interviews later, Alex and I have a much better idea. And soon you all will too.\" AXIOS REPORTER PUSHES BACK ON BIDEN'S DENIAL OF MENTAL DECLINE, SAYING WHITE HOUSE INSIDERS DISAGREE To hear Tapper and tell it, they are hard-working truth tellers in a world beset by dishonest politicians. This is the same CNN anchor who repeatedly both covered for and covered up Biden’s mental failings. And he wants a get-out-of-jail-free-card for admitting Biden isn’t mentally fit to run a hotdog stand. Or eat at one. On February 8, 2024, Biden held a press conference to counter special counsel Robert Hur's claim Biden was, \"a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\" The presser was epic, with the president pretending his memory was \"fine.\" Then he called Egyptian President Abdel Fatah El-Sisi the\"president of Mexico\"during a presser where he spoke slowly and seemed to lose his train of thought. (Days before, he claimed he had spoken with adead French leader.) The media coverage was laughable. The New York Times ran with, \"‘My Memory Is Fine,’ a Defiant Biden Declares After Special Counsel Report.\" The Post chose, \"Biden responds angrily to special counsel report questioning his memory.\" Legacy media outlets skipped the embarrassing memory lapse in headlines. Tapper wasn’t alone running cover for Biden. There was \"Morning Joe\" host Joe Scarborough, who delivered the most-embarrassing quote of the entire 2024 election: \"I've said it for years now, he's cogent. But I undersold it when I said he was cogent, he's far beyond cogent. In fact, I think he's better than he's ever been, intellectually, analytically, because he's been around for fifty-years,\" Scarborough said. \"Start your tape right now because I’m about to tell you the truth. And f--- you if you can’t handle the truth. This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever.\" That was March 6, 2024. Biden’s campaign ended slightly more than four months later. There was no medical event. No rapid decline. And this came after the disastrous press conference. When journalists didn’t like what people were saying about the president, they pretended it was based on phony videos. CNN’s Brian Stelter ran with the White House’s argument. \"The White House used the phrase ‘cheap fakes,\" adding, \"let me explain what that is.\" Now, we have Tapper saying that Biden didn’t even recognize actor George Clooney. In June 2024, NBC News' Gabe Gutierrez did a ‘well ackually’ segment that argued Biden hadn’t wandered away from foreign leaders. \"In reality, another camera angle showed the president was actually trying to greet skydivers.\" He also said the right was \"falsely claiming the president was meandering.\" Just like the right falsely claimed a White Housestaffer in an Easter Bunny outfitpulled the president away from press questions. As part of the book’s PR blitz, Tapper and Thompson co-authored a piece in The New Yorker, titled, \"How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump.\" Four paragraphs in, they quote Democrats who agree with their narrative. \"‘We got so screwed by Biden, as a party,’David Plouffe,who helped run the Harris campaign, told us,\" they claimed. And one paragraph later, \"Plouffe added, ‘He totally f---ed us.’\" The article goes on to credit actorGeorge Clooneyfor writing an op-ed calling Biden to step down. The actor had attended a Biden fundraiser in June and the article gave an exchange where, \"It seemed clear that the President had not recognized Clooney.\" But Clooney is Tapper’s hero here. Not the legions of conservatives who complained about Biden’s failing health long before. The Clooney name gets mentioned 59 times in the piece. Fifty-nine. That’s five more times than Clooney has appeared in movies, according to IMDB.com. Even after Biden’s debate with Donald Trump, two New York Times writers wouldn’t give in. Lydia Polgreen wrote: \"No one won this debate, but there is no question who lost: anyone who plans to cast a ballot for president in November.\" Jamelle Bouie agreed, \"Well, we had a raspy and stumbling President Biden and a deranged and incoherent Donald Trump, who spent two hours unleashing a stream of lies. Is there a winner here? Nah.\" AP delivered one of the greatest understatements in history: \"Debate-watchers in the Biden and Trump camps seem to agree on something: Biden had a bad night.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAN GAINOR Dan Gainor is a freelance opinion editor for Fox News Digital.

To illustrate how much he uses the company’s Copilot AI assistant in his daily life, Nadella said that instead of listening to podcasts, he now uploads the transcripts to Copilot, then talks to Copilot about the content during his drive to the office. In addition, Nadella — who jokingly described his job as “email typist” — said he relies on at least 10 custom agents developed in Copilot Studio to summarize emails and messages, prepare for meetings, and perform other tasks around the office. AI already seems to be transforming Microsoft in more substantial ways, with programersreportedly the hardest hitin the company’s recent layoffs, shortly after Nadella declared that30% of the company’s code was written by AI.

It claimed to show that the introduction of an AI tool into a large-but-unidentified materials science lab led to the discovery of more materials and more patent filings, but at the cost of reducing researchers’ satisfaction with their work. MIT economists Daron Acemoglu (who recentlywon the Nobel Prize) and David Autor both praised the paper last year, withAutor telling the Wall Street Journalhe was “floored.” In a statement included inMIT’s announcementon Friday, Acemoglu and Autor described the paper as “already known and discussed extensively in the literature on AI and science, even though it has not been published in any refereed journal.” However, the two economists said they now have “no confidence in the provenance, reliability or validity of the data and in the veracity of the research.” According to the WSJ, a computer scientist with experience in materials science approached Acemoglu and Autor with concerns in January. They brought those concerns to MIT, leading to an internal review. MIT says that due to student privacy laws, it cannot disclose the results of that review, but the paper’s author is “no longer at MIT.” And while the university’s announcement does not name the author, botha preprint version of the paperand the initial press coverage identify him as Aidan Toner-Rodgers. (TechCrunch has reached out to Toner-Rodgers for comment.) MIT also says it has requested the paper be withdrawn from The Quarterly Journal of Economics, where it was submitted for publication, and from the preprint website arXiv. Apparently, only a paper’s authors are supposed to submit arXiv withdrawal requests, but MIT says “to date, the author has not done so.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

In recent attempts, the team at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) increased the yield of the experiment, first to 5.2 megajoules and then again to 8.6 megajoules, according to a source with knowledge of the experiment. The new results are significant improvements overthe historic experiment in 2022, which was the first controlled fusion reaction to generate more energy than the it consumed. The 2022 shot generated 3.15 megajoules, a small bump over the 2.05 megajoules that the lasers delivered to the BB-sized fuel pellet. None of the shots to date have been effective enough to feed electrons back into the grid, let alone to offset the energy required to power the entire facility — the facility wasn’t designed to do that. The first net-positive shot, for example, required 300 megajoules to power the laser system alone. But they are continued proof that controlled nuclear fusion is more than hypothetical. The NIF uses what’s known as inertial confinement to produce fusion reactions. At the facility, fusion fuel is coated in diamond and then encased in a small gold cylinder called a hohlraum. That tiny pellet is dropped into a spherical vacuum chamber 10 meters in diameter, where 192 powerful laser beams converge on the target. The cylinder is vaporized under the onslaught, emitting X-rays in the process that bombard the fuel pellet inside. The pellet’s diamond coating receives so much energy that it turns into an expanding plasma, which compresses the deuterium-tritium fuel inside to the point where their nuclei fuse, releasing energy in the process. The other main approach to fusion, magnetic confinement, uses powerful superconducting magnets to compress and contain plasma in a space tight enough to create the conditions necessary for fusion. While no magnetic confinement experiments have produced net-positive results, several are beingconstructedordesignedwith the expectation that they’ll hit that milestone. Severalstartupsare pursuing inertial confinement, includingXcimer EnergyandFocused Energy.

Uh-oh:Coinbase says that customers’ personal information, including government-issued IDs, wasstolen in a data breach. The hackers demanded $20 million from the company, CEO Brian Armstrongsaid in a post on X. Coinbase said it will not pay the hackers’ ransom.

The most recent case: Granola, an AI note-taking app that’s recently seen a boost in usage, even though it launched a year ago. And when there’s usage, money follows. The company announcedit has raised $43 millionin a Series B funding round at a valuation of $250 million. Choice words:“Google has chilled independent firms like YC from funding and accelerating innovative startups that could otherwise have challenged Google’s dominance,” YC wrote in anamicus brief it submittedin the U.S.’ antitrust case against the search giant. But YC isn’t calling for a complete breakup of Google. Love to see it:Appleannounced a bunch of accessibility features, including Accessibility Nutrition Labels that will inform users of accessibility features within apps and games in the App Store; a new magnifier for Macs; a new Braille experience; and more. Layoffs at Microsoft:The company isreportedly laying off 3% of its workforce, or around 6,500 people, affecting all levels, locations, and teams. This follows a solid quarter for Microsoft, with $70.1 billion in revenue (up 13%) and net income profits of $25.8 billion (up 28%).

The Fortnite publisherscored a major victory last monthwhen Judge Rogers ruled that Apple was in “willful violation” of an injunction on anti-competitive pricing — a ruling that seemed to pave the way for Fortnite to return to the App Store, and more broadly, for developers to offer alternative payment options in their apps. However, Apple said it will appeal the ruling, and on Friday,Epic said Friday the company is blocking Fortnitefrom both its U.S. App Store and preventing it from being released on the Epic Games store in Europe: “Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it.” Apple disputed this characterization, specifically the suggestion that it was blocking Fortnite outside the United States. Instead, the company said it asked Epic Sweden to “resubmit the app update without including the U.S. storefront of the App Store so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.” But why block Fortnite in the United States?

Perry, an attorney representing Apple, telling Epic’s lawyers that “Apple has determined not to take action on the Fortnite app submission until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction.” In its filing, Epic argues that Apple is denying it “the ability to take advantage of the pro-competitive rules it helped usher in,” and “punishing” Epic “by shutting it out of the very market it has fought so hard to open — while sending a clear message to other developers not to challenge Apple’s practices.” Topics Anthony Ha is TechCrunch’s weekend editor.

As we reported back in February,its first attempt didn’t yield an AI worth hiring. But it’s now placed three newadson YC’s job board for “AI agents only” and has set aside a $1 million budget total to make it happen. Within about a week after the new job posts went live, it had about 50 applicants, founder Caleb Peffer tells TechCrunch. Firecrawloffers a web crawling tool that scrapes data from websites for LLMs. This is, Peffer admits, a shady part of the AI ecosystem wherebad behaving web crawlers can sometimes pound websites like DDoS attacks. But Firewcrawl has gained popularity by trying to bring in some guardrails, he says. For instance, many of its customers are enterprises scraping their own data for internal LLM use. Some websites want their data included in chatbot responses, just like they want Google links, he says. Additionally,the tool honors robot.txt settingsand can be set to only scrape a public website once and share the data with others. Consequently, one job opening is for a content creation agent “that never sleeps and always ships” that will autonomously produce “high quality” SEO-pleasing blog posts and tutorials on how to use its product, the startup’s ad says. Firecrawl wants this AI to watch engagement metrics and use that to autonomously improve the audience for its content, too. In other words: the agent should decide what to create, create it, post it, measure the audience, and grow mastery from that feedback, autonomously.If you are a borderline AGI AI made for blogging,this could be the job for you. The advertised pay is $5,000 a month. The company is also looking for a customer support engineer agent that will be tasked with crafting the AI workflow that responds to customer issues within two minutes and can handle tickets on its own, knowing when to escalate to a human. Previous experience doing customer support is requested. Pay is also $5,000/month. The third opening is for a junior developer agent who’ll be tasked with prioritizing incoming Github issues, writing documentation and writing code in TypeScript and Go. Once again, the pay also $5,000/month. But here’s the catch: Firecrawl is also hoping to hire human creator or creators behind these bots — and the $1 million budget is for hiring both agents and humans, though it’s not clear how many years the budget is supposed to cover. The startup might hire the humans full time, or as contractors (which might make more sense if they’re creating lots of agents for lots of companies). Firecrawl is also entertaining bids from other startups that specialize in creating the types of agents that it’s looking for, say in customer service, Peffer says. The truth is, the AI employee of Firecrawl’s dreams doesn’t exist yet. Maybe it never will. “AI can’t replace humans today,” Peffer says. ”The future, what we see, is a world where the next 10x engineers are operating armies of agents, AI systems that they’re building, maintaining, and monitoring. What we want to do is work with people that want to be those agent operators.” Firecrawl is not the only one. YC’s job board is full of jobs for developers of agents. Will their creations ever replace them as Silicon Valley iscontinuously wishing? That’s the real million-dollar question.

At a TechCrunch StrictlyVC evening earlier this week in London, De Rycker reflected on Europe’s place in the global AI race, balancing optimism with realism. “We have all the pieces,” she told those gathered for the event. “We have the entrepreneurs, we have the ambition, we have the schools, we have the capital, and we have the talent.” All that’s missing, she argued, is the ability to “unleash” that potential at scale. The obstacle? Europe’s complex regulatory landscape and, in part, its pioneering but controversial Artificial Intelligence Act. De Rycker acknowledged that regulations have a role to play. Still, she said she worries that the AI Act’s broad reach and potentially stifling fines could deter innovation at the very moment European startups need space to iterate and grow. While the goals of ethical AI and consumer protection are laudable, she fears the net may be cast too wide. “There’s a real opportunity to make sure that we go fast and address what we’re capable of,” she said. “The issue is that we are also faced with headwinds on regulation.” That urgency is amplified by shifting geopolitics. With U.S. support for Europe’s defense and economic autonomy waning under the current Trump administration, De Rycker sees this moment as a decisive one for the EU.  “Now that Europe is being left to fend [for itself] in multiple ways,” she said, “we need to be self-sufficient, we need to be sovereign.” That means unlocking Europe’s full potential. De Rycker points to efforts like the “28th regime,” a framework aimed at creating a single set of rules for businesses across the EU, as crucial to creating a more unified, startup-friendly region. Currently, the mishmash of labor laws, licensing, and corporate structures across the countries creates friction and slows down progress. “If we were truly one region, the power you could unleash would be incredible,” she said. “We wouldn’t be having these same conversations about Europe lagging in tech.” In De Rycker’s view, Europe is catching up. Cities like Zurich, Munich, Paris, and London are starting to generate their own self-reinforcing ecosystems thanks to top-tier academic institutions and a growing base of experienced founders. Accel, for its part, has invested in over 70 cities across Europe and Israel, giving De Rycker a front-row seat to the continent’s fragmented but flourishing tech landscape. Still, on Tuesday night, she noted a stark contrast with the U.S. when it comes to adoption. “We see a lot more propensity for customers to experiment with AI in the U.S.,” she said. Meanwhile, U.S investors are “spending money on these kinds of speculative, early-stage companies. That flywheel keeps going.” Accel, whose London team closed their newest fund with$650 millionlast year, can afford to lean in a bit more than many other regional players. It hasn’t backed any of the major foundational AI model companies like OpenAI or Anthropic but is instead focused on the application layer. “We feel very comfortable with the application layer,” said De Rycker. “These foundational models are capital intensive and don’t really look like venture-backed companies.” Examples of promising bets include Synthesia, a video generation platform used in enterprise training, and Speak, a language learning app that recently jumped to a $1 billion valuation. De Rycker (who dodged questions about Accel’s reported talks withanother big name in AI), sees these as early examples of how AI can create entirely new behaviors and business models. “We’re expanding total addressable markets at a rate we’ve never seen,” she said. “It feels like the early days of mobile. DoorDash and Uber weren’t just mobilized websites. They were brand new paradigms.” Ultimately, De Rycker sees this moment as both a challenge and a once-in-a-generation opportunity. If Europe leans too heavily into regulation, it risks stifling the innovation that could help it compete globally – not just in AI, but across the entire tech spectrum. “We’re in a supercycle,” she said. “These cycles don’t come often, and we can’t afford to be leashed.” With geopolitical uncertainty rising and the U.S. increasingly looking inward, Europe has little choice but to bet on itself. If it can strike the right balance, De Rycker believes it has everything it needs to lead. On Tuesday, asked by one attendee of the event what EU founders can do to be more competitive with their U.S. counterparts, she didn’t hesitate. “I think they are [competitive],” she said, citing companies Accel has backed, including Supercell and Spotify. “These founders, they look no different.” You can catch catch the full conversation with De Rycker here : Topics Editor in Chief & General Manager Loizos has been reporting on Silicon Valley since the late ’90s, when she joined the original Red Herring magazine.

    "title": "Hamas proposes releasing some hostages in fresh talks after new Israel offensive",
    "article_text": "Hamas has proposed releasing more hostages under a new Gaza ceasefire deal, after new negotiations were held on Saturday. The talks began hours after Israel's military launched a major new offensive in the Gaza Strip. Hamas has agreed to release nine hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce and Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners, a Palestinian official told the BBC. The official said the new proposed deal would also allow the entry of 400 aid trucks a day, and the evacuation of medical patients from Gaza. Israel, in turn, has demanded proof of life and detailed information about all remaining hostages. The new round of ceasefire talks is being held through Qatari and US mediators in Doha, and began on Saturday afternoon local time. Israel is yet to respond publicly to the proposed deal, but said prior to the talks that it would not withdraw troops from Gaza or commit to an end to the war. The proposal would not include these elements, the BBC understands. Israel's military announced the launch of a new offensive named \"Operation Gideon's Chariots\" earlier on Saturday, amid the deadliest wave of strikes in Gaza in months. At least 300 people have been killed since Thursday, rescuers say, including at hospitals and refugee camps in the north and south of the Strip. Thousands have died since Israel resumed strikes on 18 March, following the collapse of a fragile ceasefire which lasted two months. Aid agencies say Gaza's grievous humanitarian situation has also worsened, as Israel has been blocking supplies of food and other aid from entering the territory for 10 weeks. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month promised a major military escalation in the war to occupy and control swathes of Gaza, force the Palestinian population to the south of the territory, and \"destroy\" Hamas. Speaking from inside Gaza, journalist Ghada Al Qurd told the BBC's Newshour programme there had been lots of \"airstrikes, shellings, drones, shooting and even exploding, in the north and east.\" \"It's terrifying and horrible,\" she said. She said her family had only been having one meal a day, due to the scarcity and spiralling cost, and accused Israel of \"using food as a weapon\" - an allegation UN officials have also made in recent weeks. Aid agencies have warned about the risk of famine among Gaza's 2.1 million population, as footage and accounts emerge of emaciated children suffering malnutrition under the Israeli blockade. US President Donald Trump said on Friday that \"a lot of people were starving\" in Gaza. The Israeli government has repeatedly rejected claims there is a food shortage in Gaza. Victoria Rose, a British reconstructive surgeon working at Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her team were \"exhausted\" and staff had lost a \"considerable amount of weight\". \"The children are really thin,\" she said. \"We've got a lot of youngsters whose teeth have fallen out. \"A lot of them have quite significant burn injuries and with this level of malnutrition they're so much more prone to infection and they've got so much less capacity to heal.\" Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had said on 5 May that Israel was preparing an \"intense entry into Gaza\" to capture and hold territory, but that it would not commence until Trump completed his tour of the Middle East. He left the region on Friday. That day, residents across northern and central Gaza were told to leave their homes or places of shelter - an order aid workers say is almost impossible because many have already been repeatedly made homeless during the war. The IDF said on Saturday it wouldn't stop operating \"until Hamas is no longer a threat and all our hostages are home\" and that it had \"struck over 150 terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip\" in the preceding 24 hours. Strikes on Saturday hit towns in the north of Gaza, including Beit Lahiya and the Jabalia refugee camp, as well as in the southern city of Khan Younis, the Hamas-run health ministry and civil defence forces said. Thousands of Israeli troops, including soldiers and reservists, could enter Gaza as the operation ramps up in the coming days. Israeli tanks have also been seen at the border, Reuters news agency reported. The intensified offensive has been condemned by the UN and some European leaders. Commissioner-General of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) Philippe Lazzarini expressed shock at Israel's military operation, saying: \"How many more Palestinian lives will be wiped off from their homeland by bombardments, hunger or lack of medical care?\" \"Atrocities are becoming a new norm, under our watch, making the unbearable bearable with indifference,\" he said. Following the new strikes, the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, and Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani all called for a permanent ceasefire, while Germany's Foreign Ministry said the new offensive risked \"worsening the catastrophic humanitarian situation for Gaza's population  and the remaining hostages\". Israel launched a military campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. Hamas still holds 58 hostages. At least 53,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, including more than 3,000 people since March. The BBC's Analysis Editor Ros Atkins looks at how world leaders are responding to Israel's blockade of Gaza. The BBC speaks to people in Gaza during a 10-week blockade on food, medical supplies and other aid. It marks the largest ground assault on north Gaza since Israel resumed its offensive in March. The secretary of state's comments come as Israeli strikes across Gaza kill 114 people, according to hospitals and rescuers NYU student Logan Rozos used his speech to accuse the US of supporting a \"genocide\" in Gaza.",

    "title": "'You start to go crazy': The Australian who survived five years in a Chinese prison",
    "article_text": "Sharing a dirty cell with a dozen others, constant sleep deprivation, cells with lights on 24-hours a day; poor hygiene and forced labour. These are some of what prisoners in Chinese jails are subjected to, according to Australian citizen Matthew Radalj, who spent five years at the Beijing No 2 prison – a facility used for international inmates. Radalj, who is now living outside China, has decided to go public about his experience, and described undergoing and witnessing severe physical punishment, forced labour, food deprivation and psychological torture. The BBC has been able to corroborate Radalj's testimony with several former prisoners who were behind bars at the same time he was. Many requested anonymity, because they feared retribution on loved ones still living inside the country. Others said they just wanted to try to forget the experience and move on. The Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. \"I was in really bad shape when I arrived. They beat me for two days straight in the first police station that I was in. I hadn't slept or eaten or had water for 48 hours and then I was forced to sign a big stack of documents,\" said Radalj of his introduction to imprisonment in China, which began with his arrest on 2 January, 2020. The former Beijing resident claims he was wrongfully convicted after a fight with shopkeepers at an electronics market, following a dispute over the agreed price to fix a mobile phone screen. He claims he ended up signing a false confession to robbery, after being told it would be pointless to try to defend his innocence in a system with an almost 100% criminal conviction rate and in the hope that this would reduce the time of his incarceration. Court documents indicate that this worked at least to some extent, earning him a four-year sentence. Once in prison, he said he first had to spend many months in a separate detention centre where he was subjected to a more brutal \"transition phase\". During this time prisoners must follow extremely harsh rules in what he described as horrific conditions. \"We were banned from showering or cleaning ourselves, sometimes for months at a time. Even the toilet could be used only at specific allotted times, and they were filthy - waste from the toilets above would constantly drip down on to us.\" Eventually he was admitted to the \"normal\" prison where inmates had to bunk together in crowded cells and where the lights were never turned off. You also ate in the same room, he said. According to Radalj, African and Pakistani prisoners made up the largest groups in the facility, but there were also men being held from Afghanistan, Britain, the US, Latin America, North Korea and Taiwan. Most of them had been convicted for acting as drug mules. Radalj said that prisoners were regularly subjected to forms of what he described as psychological torture. One of these was the \"good behaviour points system\" which was a way – at least in theory – to reduce your sentence. Prisoners could obtain a maximum of 100 good behaviour points per month for doing things like studying Communist Party literature, working in the prison factory or snitching on other prisoners. Once 4,200 points were accumulated, they could in theory be used to reduce prison time. If you do the maths, that would mean a prisoner would have to get maximum points every single month for three-and-half years before this could start to work. Radalj said that in reality it was used as a means of psychological torture and manipulation. He claims the guards would deliberately wait till an inmate had almost reached this goal and then penalise them on any one of a huge list of possible infractions which would cancel out points at the crucial time. These infractions included - but were not limited to - hoarding or sharing food with other prisoners, walking \"incorrectly\" in the hallway by straying from a line painted on the ground, hanging socks on a bed incorrectly, or even standing too close to the window. Other prisoners who spoke about the points system to the BBC described it as a mind game designed to crush spirits. Former British prisoner Peter Humphrey, who spent two years in detention in Shanghai, said his facility had a similar points calculation and reduction system which was manipulated to control prisoners and block sentence reductions. \"There were cameras everywhere, even three to a cell,\" he said. \"If you crossed a line marked on the ground and were caught by a guard or on camera, you would be punished. The same if you didn't make your bed properly to military standard or didn't place your toothbrush in the right place in the cell. \"There was also group pressure on prisoners with entire cell groups punished if one prisoner did any of these things.\" One ex-inmate told the BBC that in his five years in prison, he never once saw the points actually used to mitigate a sentence. Radalj said that there were a number of prisoners - including himself - who didn't bother with the points system. So authorities resorted to other means of applying psychological pressure. These included cutting time off monthly family phone calls or the reduction of other perceived benefits. But the most common daily punishment involved the reduction of food. The BBC has been told by numerous former inmates that the meals at Beijing's No 2 prison were mostly made up of cabbage in dirty water which sometimes also had bits of carrot and, if they were lucky, small slivers of meat. They were also given mantou - a plain northern Chinese bread. Most of the prisoners were malnourished, Radalj added. Another prisoner described how inmates ate a lot of mantou, as they were always hungry. He said that their diets were so low in nutrition – and they could only exercise outside for half an hour each week – that they developed flimsy upper bodies but retained bloated looking stomachs from consuming so much of the mantou. Prisoners were given the opportunity to supplement their diet by buying meagre extra rations, if money from relatives had been put into what were called their \"accounts\": essentially a prison record of funds delivered to purchase provisions like soap or toothpaste. They could also use this to purchase items like instant noodles or soy milk powder. But even this \"privilege\" could be taken away. Radalj said he was blocked from making any extra purchases for 14 months because he refused to work in the prison factory, where inmates were expected to assemble basic goods for companies or compile propaganda leaflets for the ruling Communist Party. To make things worse, they were made to work on a \"farm\", where they did manage to grow a lot of vegetables, but were never allowed to eat them. Radalj said the farm was displayed to a visiting justice minister as an example of how impressive prison life was. But, he said, it was all for show. \"We would be growing tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages and okra and then – at the end of the season – they would push it all into a big hole and bury it,\" he added. \"And if you were caught with a chilli or a cucumber in general population you would go straight to solitary confinement for eight months.\" Another prisoner said they would occasionally suddenly receive protein, like a chicken leg, to make their diet look better when officials visited the prison. Humphrey said there were similar food restrictions in his Shanghai prison, adding that this led to power struggles among the inmates: \"The kitchen was run by prison labour. Those who worked there stole the best stuff and it could then be distributed.\" Radalj described a battle between African and Taiwanese groups in Beijing's Prison No 2 over this issue. The Nigerian inmates were working in the kitchen and \"were getting small benefits, like a bag of apples once a month or some yogurt or a couple of bananas\", he said. Then the Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese inmates were able to convince the guards to let them take over, giving them control of precious extra food items. This led to a large brawl, and Radalj said he was caught in the middle of it. He was sent to solitary confinement for 194 day after hitting another prisoner. Inside solitary, he finally had the lights turned off only to realise he'd be with very little light nearly all of the time, giving him the opposite sensory problem. His small food ration was also cut in half. There were no reading materials and there was nobody to talk to while he was held in a bare room of 1.2 by 1.8 metres (4ft by 6ft) for half a year. \"You start to go crazy, whether you like it or not, and that's what solitary is designed to do… So you've got to decide very quickly whether your room is really, really small, or really, really big. \"After four months, you just start talking to yourself all the time. The guards would come by and ask 'Hey, are you okay?'. And you're like, 'why?'. They replied, 'because you're laughing'.\" Then, Radalj said, he would respond, in his own mind: \"It's none of your business.\" Another feature of Chinese prison life, according to Radalji, was the fake \"propaganda\" moments officials would stage for Chinese media or visiting officials to paint a rosy picture of conditions there. He said, at one point, a \"computer suite\" was set up. \"They got everyone together and told us that we'd get our own email address and that we would be able to send emails. They then filmed three Nigerian guys using these computers.\" The three prisoners apparently looked confused because the computers were not actually connected to the internet - but the guards had told them to just \"pretend\". \"Everything was filmed to present a fake image of prisoners with access to computers,\" Radalj said. But, he claims, soon after the photo opportunity, the computers were wrapped up in plastic and never touched again. Throughout much of the ordeal, Radalj had been secretly keeping a journal by peeling open Covid masks and writing tiny sentences inside, with the help of some North Korean prisoners, who have also since been released. \"I would be writing, and the Koreans would say: 'No smaller… smaller!'.\" Radalj said many of the prisoners had no way of letting their families know they were in jail. Some had not made phone calls to their relatives because no money had been placed in their accounts for phone calls. For others, their embassies had not registered family telephone numbers for the prison phone system. Only calls to officially approved numbers worked. So, after word got round that the Australian was planning to try to smuggle his notes out, they passed on details to connect with their families. \"I had 60 or 70 people hoping I could contact their loved ones after I got out to tell them what was happening.\" He wrapped the pieces of Covid mask as tight as he could with sticky tape hoarded from the factory and tried to swallow the egg-sized bundle without the guards seeing. But he couldn't keep it down. The guards saw what was happening on camera and started asking, \"Why are you vomiting? Why do you keep gagging? What's wrong?\" So, he gave up and hid the bundle instead. When he was about to leave on 5 October 2024, he was given his old clothes which had been ripped five years earlier in the struggle over his initial arrest. There was a tear in the lining of his jacked and he quickly dropped the notes inside before a guard could see him. Radalj said he thinks someone told the prison officers of his plan because they searched his room and questioned him before he left. \"Did you forget something?\" the guards asked. \"They trashed all my belongings. I was thinking they're gonna take me back to solitary confinement. There will be new charges.\" But the guard holding his clothes never knew the secret journal had been slipped inside. \"They were like, 'Get out of here!'. And it wasn't until I was on the plane, and we had already left, and the seat belt sign was switched off, that I reached into my jacket to check.\" The notes were still there. Just before he had boarded the plane in Beijing a policeman who had escorted him to the gate had used Radalj's boarding pass to buy duty free cigarettes for his mates. \"He said don't come back to China. You're banned for 10 years. And I said 'yeah cool. Don't smoke. It's bad for your health'\". The officer laughed. He arrived back in Australia and hugged his father at Perth airport. The tears were flowing. Then he got married to his long-time girlfriend and now they spend their days making candles and other products. Radalj says he is still angry about his experience and has a long way to go to recover properly. But he is making his way through the contact list of his former inmate friends – \"I have spent the best part of six months contacting their families, lobbying their embassies so they might try to do a better job of helping them during their incarceration.\" Some of them, he said, haven't spoken to people back home for nearly a decade. And helping them has also helped with the transition back to his old life. \"With freedom comes a great sense of gratitude,\" Radalj says. \"You have a deeper appreciation for the very simplest things in life. But I also have a great sense of responsibility to the people I left behind in prison.\" Ed Talbot and James Hall-Smith are taking part in a rally in memory of their friend Charlie Hunt.

    "title": "Inside the therapy room: BBC watches as three lives change",
    "article_text": "Nicole enters the therapist's room and clutches what she calls her hugging pillow. She admits to being nervous about sitting down with a stranger to discuss her mental health. She is 31, lives in London and works as chiropractic assistant. She suffers from anxiety when she drives. \"There are so many things that so quickly go through my head,\" she says. \"How far away is it? What is the route? I somehow forget how to drive.\" She suffers from panic attacks and her fear of driving means she is constantly cancelling plans. But, over the course of six sessions with psychotherapist Owen O'Kane, it becomes clear her problems are much deeper than just a fear of driving. Every week, one in six of the UK population experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and every year more than 1.2 million people seek help from the NHS talking therapies service, with many more paying for support privately. This form of therapy is most commonly used for anxiety and depression, but can also help with a range of other problems, including body image dysmorphia, obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. It does not work for everyone: researchsuggests one-third of people do not benefit. The BBC has followed 12 people, featured in the seriesChange Your Mind, Change Your Life, who each received six support sessions from therapists. The therapists have used a combination of different talking therapy approaches, includingcognitive behavioural therapywhich focuses on changing the way we think and behave, alongside other techniques to improve relationships and process trauma. What it reveals is striking: How understanding and learning to manage the mind has the power to transform lives. \"You're not stuck with the brain you've got,\" says Owen O'Kane, who has worked in the field for 25 years. He describes his job as like detective work: \"People come with what seems to be a reasonable story, but the interesting thing is that very often the story and emotions don't match. I guess what we are doing is digging around a little bit.\" Over their sessions, Owen digs deeper into Nicole's anxiety. At one point she weeps. She admits in the past she has \"completely hated\" herself. She worries about what people think of her and is socially anxious: \"I don't feel good enough to be there. I might say something wrong. I need people to like me.\" Owen questions why she feels like this: \"As human beings we like the nice emotions. We like feeling happy, joy, being in love.\" but he says some people try to avoid or suppress emotions like fear, dread and sadness, and that can cause anxiety. Instead, he says it is healthier to accept them and accept them as safe. When people get to that point, he says, they start to feel empowered: \"They realise they're not going to be overwhelmed.\" Speaking outside the therapy room, Nicole says: \"I'm shocked. He got my number straight away. I would see vulnerability as a negative thing, but it's not.\" Asked to describe herself she uses words such as kind, thoughtful, determined and enthusiastic: \"I am not a bad person,\" she tells Owen. She says she has learned a lot: \"Most importantly I found I wasn't being kind to myself. That was really eye-opening.\" Owen says this is typical of many people he treats: \"When people get to these crossroads, when they wake up and realise what they are doing, that's a gold dust moment for me.\" James likewise learned to think about himself differently thanks to therapy. A 39-year-old father-of-one who works in finance, he struggles with anxiety and, in particular, worries about making mistakes at work. That fear is so debilitating he doesn't make it to work sometimes. He has been supported by Prof Steve Peters, a psychiatrist who explains perfectionism is at the root of his problems: \"If we think it's the end of the world if we make a mistake, it paralyses you.\" James was once an athlete, playing semi-professional football and competing in athletics before specialising in the bobsleigh. He was training for trials for the Great Britain team when he had a stroke eight years ago: \"With a flick of a switch, I lost everything,\" he says. \"It made me feel a lesser man.\" Now he fears under-performing at work and losing his job. Over the course of the sessions, Prof Peters explains the key is James's belief system. First, he gives some seemingly simple advice: \"Put your feet on the floor, stand up and walk,\" he says. Focusing on the basic task of moving, in James's case moving so he can get to work, enables someone caught up in catastrophic thinking to block out the negative thoughts that stop them doing something. In later sessions, James and Prof Peters explore what could be behind his problems. James tells Prof Peters about his childhood and how his father would criticise him to push him to improve. Prof Peters explains how James believes that to please you cannot make errors and then the devastating stroke he suffered at a young age has triggered an absolute desire for things to never go wrong again. He tells James he needs to make \"peace with himself\" by defining himself not by performance but by values and behaviours. He too asks James to describe himself and James replies he is hard-working, honest, engaging, friendly and as someone who would put others first. Over the course of his sessions, James's way of thinking changes: \"I can look at myself in the mirror and feel my value and my worth,\" he explains. Anjalee's struggles are somewhat different. They relate to one traumatic event in childhood – her mother died suddenly when she was 15. Now a mother herself, with three children under five, she has struggled emotionally. She has sleepless nights, a tight chest and feels emotionally disconnected. It is worse than any physical pain, says the 34-year-old: \"Becoming a mother has reopening everything I've tried to suppress.\" Her first birth was particularly traumatic. She developed sepsis – the condition her mother died from: \"I thought I was not going to survive,\" she says. Her psychotherapist, Julia Samuel, explains to Anjalee she has not been able to process what has happened and, as a result, the trauma has stayed with her. When her mother died, Anjalee was in the middle of exams and had two younger siblings, leaving her without time to grieve. Julia suggestseye movement desensitisation and reprocessing therapy, which uses movement to help people process and recover from distressing events. Julia asks Anjalee for her worst memory and she describes how her father tried to save her mother's life by performing chest compressions in their home until the paramedics arrived. Her mother was rushed out with Anjalee hoping she would return. She never did. Anjalee says she has never talked about this within anyone. Julia asks Anjalee to cross her arms against her chest and start deep breathing and tapping, mimicking a butterfly's wings flapping. She talks through the memory and how the images in her head are changing to more positive ones. Julia says this type of treatment is particularly effective when dealing with one single traumatic event. One memory, she says, can act as a block on everything. Afterwards, Anjalee speaks about how her symptoms have eased and the contentment she now feels. \"My therapist helped me reconnect with the 15-year-old girl I'd silenced. I began to process the trauma that haunted me. I now understand grief as the other side of love.\" During May, the BBC is sharing stories and tips on how to support your mental health and wellbeing.

On Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East this week, when the future of the famous plane was a huge talking point, Fox News host Sean Hannity had priority seating and access to the president to conduct an in-flight interview. But the rest of us in the travelling press pool were consigned to our small section of the plane. It was a whirlwind trip, hitting three nations in three nights, half a world away. The president described it as an \"endurance test\" - one that his staff and those of us in the press pool had to manage, as well. The presidential jet is not a bad way to fly, however. The 14 seats are comfortable, roughly on par with a first-class domestic flight. There's a bathroom and a table with snacks (including the coveted Air Force One-branded M&Ms bearing the president's signature, which aren't available anywhere else). The cabin has a pair of television monitors - usually tuned to the president's preferred cable news channel (CNN during Joe Biden's term; Fox News for Trump). On occasion, they've been set to a football game or other sporting events. For longer flights, the on-board kitchen serves plated meals (the president eats from a different, fancier menu). On short hops, there's usually food in a takeaway bag. But the interior of this famous aircraft could soon undergo a radical refit if, as looks likely, Trump accepts the Qatari offer to supply a new \"palace in the sky\" - the biggest foreign gift ever received by a US president. Technically, \"Air Force One\" is a radio call sign, the designation for any Air Force aircraft with the US president aboard. The small prop plane Lyndon Baines Johnson took from Austin to his Texas ranch in the 1960s was Air Force One, too. But the Air Force One most people picture, the one featured in the Harrison Ford action film, is the 747-200b with water blue, steel blue and white paint set against a chrome underbody - a colour scheme picked out by First Lady Jackie Kennedy in 1962. Currently there are two of these 747s in the Air Force passenger fleet, in use since 1990.Needless to say, technology – both in aircraft design and everything else – has come a long way in the ensuing years. The planes have been upgraded, but the costs of maintaining the airframe and engines are growing. The aircrafts are showing their age. This has clearly irked the current White House occupant – the only president to own his own jet, or for that matter, his own airline, prior to taking office. \"I leave now and get onto a 42-year-old Boeing,\" he said, exaggerating the plane's age during an industry briefing on Thursday in Abu Dhabi. \"But new ones are coming.\" Coming, but not soon enough for Trump. During his first term, he touted an updated presidential aircraft, made by Boeing, that was in the works. He even picked out his own colour palette, scrapping Kennedy's design for a red-white-and-blue livery. He proudly displays a model of that jet in the Oval Office. Originally planned to be delivered by 2021, delays and cost overruns for the estimated $4bn construction programme have made it less likely that the two new planes on order will be available for much, if any, of Trump's second term in office, which expires in January 2029. He has tasked tech multi-billionaire Elon Musk with speeding up the process and reportedly groused in private that he is embarrassed to travel in such an outdated plane. That explains why the president has become enamoured with the prospect of a seemingly more immediate solution to his air transport woes – courtesy of the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. News of Qatar's offer of a lavish $400m 747-8 made headlines last week, but the gift apparently has been in the works for months. Trump surreptitiously visited the aircraft in question in mid-February, just a few weeks after the start of his second term in office. Aside from the legal and ethical concerns of such a substantial gift – raised by critics and some allies of the president - converting a foreign 747 for use by an American president creates a number of technical challenges. The aircraft would have to be made capable of in-flight refuelling and retrofitted with a sophisticated package of communications and security equipment. The current models have systems built to withstand the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion. Such a refitting process, says aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, would take years, until 2030 at least. \"They have to assume the jet has been left unattended in a dangerous place for 13 years,\" he says. \"Which means it's not enough to take the plane apart. You also have to take every single component apart.\" The plane would need additional power to run its new systems, and its interior might have to be rearranged. Chances are there's no press cabin in the flying palace as originally designed. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Defense and Security Department, says the costs of such retrofitting could easily run to $1bn. He adds, however, that Trump could waive some, or all, of the security modifications if he so chooses. \"He's the president,\" he said. When the Air Force ultimately does retire its current crop of 747s, it will put to pasture an aircraft that have been part of fabric of American history for decades. One that transported President Bill Clinton, along with former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George W Bush, to Israel for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in 1995. After the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, George W Bush took to the skies in Air Force One and stayed aloft for hours, refuelling mid-air, until his security team determined it was safe for him to land and address the nation, before ultimately returning to Washington. Six US presidents have travelled on these jets, criss-crossing the US and visiting all corners of the globe. One took Biden to Israel just days after the 7 October attack by Hamas. Trump has effectively employed the aircraft as a campaign device, holding political rallies at airfields and making low-speed passes over the crowds before landing and using Air Force One as a dramatic backdrop for his speeches. On Trump's recent Mid East trip, military fighters from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE accompanied Air Force One as it flew through their national airspace. Aging though it may be, Air Force One is still one of the most recognisable signs of American presidential authority and power in the world - a military aircraft that serves a higher purpose. \"It's not made for luxury,\" says Aboulafia. \"It's a flying command post. You're not there to throw parties.\" Additional reporting by Max Matza At least 22 are injured, Mexico says, after the towering masts of training sailboat clip New York City's famous bridge.

    "title": "Youth mobility scheme could be part of EU deal, PM signals",
    "article_text": "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has given his strongest signal yet that a youth mobility scheme could form part of a new deal with the EU. Speaking tothe Timesahead of a summit on Monday between the bloc and the UK, he insisted such a scheme would not amount to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. While Sir Keir said it would be a \"reciprocal\" arrangement in which young people would be able to move abroad for up to two years, no specific details about the ages of those who could be eligible and whether there would be a cap on numbers were given. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has described the possible scheme as \"free movement through the back door\". \"We're not against youth mobility schemes. We're against uncapped migration schemes,\" she wrote on X. Reform UK has echoed these sentiments. Its deputy leader, Richard Tice, said earlier this week such a scheme would be \"the thin end\" to EU free movement. Sir Keir has denied these accusations, saying that Labour has a \"red line in our manifesto about freedom of movement\" and that \"youth mobility is not freedom of movement\". An agreement is expected to be announced at Monday's summit, which is being held at London's Lancaster House. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg has been told that it will only be an agreement in principle, not the final deal. She understands that the EU has been pushing for stays as long as four years, while the UK is not contemplating more than one or two. In fresh comments on Saturday evening ahead of the summit, Sir Keir said \"a strengthened partnership\" with the EU would \"be good for our jobs, good for our bills and good for our borders\". Prior to Brexit, young people in the UK had the right to travel and study freely, without a visa, in the rest of Europe and vice versa. A new deal could see a return to a similar state of affairs. The prime minister has pointed to reciprocal youth mobility schemes (YMS) that the UK already has with the likes of Australia - where people between the ages of 18 and 35 are allowed to work in each other's countries. The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year. These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed. The former Tory government last yearrejected an EU offerthat would have made it easier for people aged between 18 and 30 to study and work abroad in the wake of Brexit. Labour at the time said it had \"no plans for a youth mobility scheme\" if it won the general election. London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC's Newsnight programme on Friday that the current government was giving \"mixed messages\" and that he wanted to hear it \"speaking in one voice and say they would like a youth mobility scheme\". He said such a scheme would \"put rocket boosters up businesses in London\", where there are gaps in sectors including hospitality, creative industries, health and social care. The Liberal Democrats have also welcomed the idea of a new form of youth mobility scheme, with Europe spokesperson James MacCleary calling it a \"welcome step in the right direction\". He added: \"This news is a glimmer of hope for young people who have been so badly let down by Brexit. The government now need to follow through.\" The UK's European relations minister, Nick Thomas-Symonds, publicly confirmed last week that the government was considering setting up a youth mobility scheme as part of a new partnership agreement with the EU. He told the Financial Times that \"a smart, controlled youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people\" - provided the government's red lines are respected. Asked whether the UK might in the future consider re-joining theErasmus student scheme,Thomas-Symonds said there were not currently plans to do so but added the government was \"always open to listening to sensible proposals from the EU\". Universities and students the BBC has spoken to recentlysay Brexit has made studying in the UK less attractive. For example, since August 2021, new students from the EU generally have had to pay international fees and do not qualify for tuition fee loans. As well as youth mobility, issues such as fishing rights are also expected to be discussed during Monday's meeting - the first since Brexit. Sir Keir described the upcoming talks as a \"really significant moment\", saying they would help to create greater wealth for British people. \"Nobody wants to relitigate the last nine years and I think [the things] they will be most concerned about — am I going to be better off, is this going to help my living standards, is it going to make sure my job's preserved, are there jobs in the future, is my community going to benefit from that? — that'll be test number one,\" he said.",

    "title": "Trump says he will call Putin to discuss stopping Ukraine 'bloodbath'",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump says he will be speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin by phone on Monday about ending the war in Ukraine, saying the call would be about \"stopping the 'bloodbath'\". In a post on Truth Social, the US president said the call would take place at 10:00 EDT (14:00 GMT)  and he would then speak to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, and the leaders of some Nato countries. Russia and Ukraine were unable to reach any breakthrough when they held their first face-to-face talks in three years in Istanbul on Friday, although a prisoner swap was agreed. Trump had offered to attend the talks in Turkey if Putin would also be there, but the Russian president declined to go. Trump's comments come after he suggested progress on ending the war would only happen if he and Putin held face-to-face talks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed to Russian news agencies that preparations were under way for a call between Putin and Trump on Monday. The two leaders have held a phone call before on the topic. \"The conversation is in the works,\" Peskov told Tass news agency. Trump had said on Truth Social: \"Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end.\" European leaders have been calling for Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefirein the conflict. The US and Russian leaders are expected to discuss a ceasefire, as well as the possible summit between themselves. Moscow has moved slower than Trump would like, but it welcomed the American efforts at mediation, in a call on Saturday between the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Following thetalks in Istanbul,Ukraine also reiterated its call for a full and unconditional ceasefire. According to a Ukrainian official, the Kremlin had made \"new and unacceptable demands including insisting Kyiv withdraw its troops from large parts of its own territory\", he said, in exchange for a ceasefire. The head of the Russian delegation, Putin aide Vladimir Medinsky, said they were satisfied with the talks and ready to continue contact. Hours later, aRussian drone hit a passenger bus in the Sumy region,killing nine people - prompting Zelensky to demand stiffer sanctions on Moscow. He said the attack on the bus was \"a deliberate killing of civilians\". Russia has not commented, but state media reported that forces had hit a \"military staging area\" in Sumy province. At least 22 are injured, Mexico says, after the towering masts of training sailboat clip New York City's famous bridge. The Maryland tradition attracts a mix of socioeconomic classes. But this year, the tradition has been thrown into question. One person was killed and four injured in Saturday's explosion outside the American Reproductive Centers.

    "title": "'I was refused service in a cafe because of my face'",
    "article_text": "Subjected to brutal bullying as a child, Amit Ghose says he still has to deal with  constant staring, pointing and comments, and has even been refused service in a cafe because of his face. The 35-year-old from Birmingham described how visiting an independent coffee shop in London recently \"everyone was staring at me, and it was like they'd almost seen a ghost\". \"The person serving looked at me and said: 'Oh, we're not serving any more'. \"She turned around and walked off. But clearly, clearly they were still serving.\" Amit was born with Neurofibromatosis type 1, a condition that causes non-cancerous tumours to grow along nerves. But after \"learning acceptance\" of his facial disfigurement he now shares his motivational story in schools with the aim of helping children \"embrace their personalities and celebrate who they are\". Another recent experience of abuse spurred him on to self publish a children's book, Born Different. \"I had a couple of individuals come over to me in a park and ask me what happened to my face, and I thought they were just being curious,\" he said. \"But actually they started laughing, giggling, saying: 'Oh my God, if I had a face like you I wouldn't even come out my house'.\" He said the encounter \"really upset\" him, \"and I thought to myself, I need to do something about this. I need to get this book out. Now is the right time\". \"If I had this book when I was a young child, I think it would have helped me.\" Amit had his left eye surgically removed at the age of 11, leading to further facial disfigurement as well as abuse and bullying. In the run up to Halloween one year, a child at school told him \"you don't need a Halloween mask, you've got one for life\", he recalled. \"That broke me to the point where I did not accept the left hand side of my face,\" he said. \"For a very, very long time I hid the face, I just was not comfortable showing it to the world at all.\" Looking back, he said he had not understood the depth of depression and anxiety he experienced then. \"Other children not wanting to come and sit next to me or hiding behind their parents all had a mental effect on me,\" he said. At school, cricket was his passion and it was through playing the game that he eventually made friends. \"Cricket helped me become Amit, that boy who plays cricket, from Amit, the boy who has a funny face,\" he explained. But, he said, even as an adult he still experienced \"constant staring\". \"The pointing, the tapping the friend next to them saying 'have you seen that guy's face', that is also constant,\" he said. \"But there is kindness out there as well, and that needs highlighting.\" It was his wife Piyali who eventually taught him the \"art of acceptance,\" he explained. \"Really that I've got to accept myself before others can accept me,\" he added. She also persuaded him to start sharing his story on social media. \"I thought TikTok was all about singing and dancing, and I thought maybe not, but she convinced me. \"I created a video and I said to the world: 'I want to take you all on a journey to help and support and inspire you using my lived experiences.'\" He started his account in early 2023, and has since gone on to gain almost 200,000 followers and millions of likes. \"Me helping people on social media by sharing my story has helped me become more accepting of myself. \"Now I say to the world, this is me, take it or leave it.\" At about the same time, he left his job at a law firm to take up motivational speaking full time. Helping young people felt so much more important, he said. He is also about to launch a podcast in which he speaks to others who have had similar experiences, including Oliver Bromley who wasejected from a restaurantbecause staff said he was \"scaring the customers\". \"We're going to have lots of fun and inspire a lot of people,\" he said. \"Disability or no disability, visible difference or no visible difference, we all have insecurities, we all have things that we're faced with, and challenges we're faced with. \"I just want to give this narrative to people that if we truly celebrate who we are, accept who we are, fall in love with who we are, then we can be more confident.\" Follow BBC Birmingham onBBC Sounds,Facebook,XandInstagram.

    "article_text": "At least 25 people are reported to have died and dozens are injured after tornadoes tore through parts of two US states. Officials in Kentucky said there had been 18 deaths while seven people were killed in Missouri, including five in the city of St Louis. The Kentucky tornado struck Laurel County in the south-east of the state in the early hours of Saturday. Officials said they expected the death toll to rise. Missouri officials said 5,000 buildings had been damaged, roofs destroyed and power lines downed due to the tornado. About 140,000 properties in Missouri and Kentucky were left without power as of Saturday afternoon. Officials in St Louis said the fire department was conducting house-by-house searches in the worst-affected areas. St Louis mayor Cara Spencer said in an update on Saturday that at least 38 people were reported injured in her area, largely from collapsed buildings and toppled trees. Authorities in Kentucky said there were also severe injuries reported. \"The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,\" said Laurel County Sheriff John Root in a post on social media. National Weather Service radar suggested the tornado touched down in Missouri shortly after 14:30 local time in the west of the city close to Forest Park - home to St Louis Zoo and the site of the 1904 Olympic Games. St Louis Fire Department said three people had to be rescued after part of the nearby Centennial Christian Church collapsed. One of those people died. A curfew was imposed from 21:00 to 06:00 local time in the two areas where most of the damage took place, to prevent injuries from debris and reduce the potential for looting. St Louis mayor Spencer said: \"The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous. \"We're going to have a lot of work to do in the coming days. There is no doubt there, but tonight we are focused on saving lives and keeping people safe and allowing our community to grieve.\" The US National Weather Service said tornadoes also hit neighbouring Illinois, with more severe weather conditions stretching eastwards to the Atlantic coast. On Saturday, it warned of few tornadoes that could hit northern Texas over the weekend as a result of strong to severe storms in the area. The tornadoes struck an area of the US that is generally referred to as \"Tornado Alley\", where tornadoes are most frequent. They typically occur in the months of May and June, though they could strike during other times of the year. Kentucky has seen an average of five tornadoes each May since the year 2000, while Missouri has seen an average of 16. Are you in the area?Please get in touchbut only if it is safe to do so.

    "title": "How Glasner led Palace through darkness to light of FA Cup glory",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Palace shock Man City to win first major trophy in their history Crystal Palace's greatest day, and the glory of the FA Cup final win against Manchester City, came after they emerged into the light from the darkness of a crisis that threatened to sweep over manager Oliver Glasner. Palace's worst start to a season since 1992-93 - they failed to win in the Premier League until beating Tottenham in their ninth game at Selhurst Park on 27 October - was a far distant memory in the Wembley sunshine as the Eagles celebrated the first major success in their history. As Glasner and his triumphant Palace side celebrated in front of their ecstatic support with their anthem 'Glad All Over' echoing around the stadium, this was ultimate justification for chairman Steve Parish and Selhurst Park's hierarchy holding their nerve as storm clouds gathered around the 50-year-old Austrian. It was also vindication of Glasner's own approach, after he said during those troubled times in October: \"It's time for hugging my players, not kicking them.\" There was plenty of hugging going on at Wembley as Palace paraded the FA Cup, the crowning glory of the recovery fashioned by Glasner, carried out brilliantly by his players. \"That's what Oliver Glasner's done - he made us all believe,\" Parish told BBC One in the immediate aftermath of their battling 1-0 victory. \"You could see it at the end. I am so proud.\" Crystal Palace beat Man City to win FA Cup & end wait for major trophy 'Get rid of VAR' - should Henderson have seen red in FA Cup final? 'Maybe the thought of taking a penalty at Wembley was too much' The Debrief: Crystal Palace win the FA Cup Glasner's reaction when history was made matched his management style - calm and measured as he marched over to shake hands with beaten City counterpart Pep Guardiola. Allied to these qualities, Glasner's intensity and positive approach drew comparisons with Jurgen Klopp when he won the Europa League with Eintracht Frankfurt in 2022. It served Glasner and Palace well when they stalled badly at the start of this season. Glasner never lost faith in himself when Palace secured only three points from their first eight games this season. And, more significantly, he never lost faith in Palace's players. He believed there were genuine reasons for Palace's slow start after finishing the previous campaign with 19 points out of a possible 21. This meticulous and strict personality, who plans everything around his outlook calendar, was overseeing a major transition after Palace lost arguably their most gifted forward when Michael Olise moved to Bayern Munich in a Â£50m deal. Key defender Joachim Andersen also left to join to Fulham for Â£30m. Eddie Nketiah arrived from Arsenal for Â£30m, but had not been training, while other big elements of his squad were under-cooked. Eberechi Eze, Adam Wharton, Marc Guehi and goalkeeper Dean Henderson had been with England at Euro 2024, while Jean-Philippe Mateta had played for France in the Olympic final. Jefferson Lerma and Daniel Munoz were with Colombia at the Copa America. Glasner was confident Palace would be a force once they were back up to speed, while he also had to integrate four deadline-day signings, including Nketiah, defender Maxence Lacroix from Wolfsburg, keeper Matt Turner from Nottingham Forest and on-loan Trevoh Chalobah from Chelsea. And so it has proved. Spectacularly. This video can not be played 'The Eagles have landed!' - emotional full-time scenes as Palace win FA Cup Parish insists Glasner's position was never in doubt having witnessed his work and upbeat nature on the training ground. This day, when a new chapter was written in Palace's history, is the payback for that show of faith. Glasner has devised the perfect system to suit the attacking trio of Eze, Ismaila Sarr and Mateta, the latter the spearhead and focal point, the others drifting behind with freedom and menace. Palace have strengths elsewhere, with Munoz directly involved in 13 goals in all competitions this season - six goals and seven assists, the joint-most of any defender for Premier League clubs in 2024-25 alongside Tottenham's Pedro Porro. The Eagles' back three of Chris Richards, Lacroix and Guehi have been rock solid, even though Palace lost influential captain Guehi after 61 minutes at Wembley following a blow to the head. And, crucially on the big occasions when margins are fine, Palace also possess an X-factor. Glasner's big players, those he was convinced would come out of that early-season slump, have delivered throughout this FA Cup journey, and were heroes again against City. Eze's crisp 16th-minute strike settled this final, finishing off a classic Palace counter-attack with a sweeping finish past City keeper Stefan Ortega. It was Palace's first shot and first touch inside the penalty box, but with such economy and ruthlessness came the decisive moment. The gifted forward set Palace on their way at Fulham in the quarter-final then Aston Villa in the semi-final at Wembley. When, as they will be forever, stories of Palace's FA Cup win are told, Eze's name will be permanently attached. This video can not be played Eze rounds off team move to give Palace shock lead over Man City Henderson has also decorated Palace's success, first against Villa and again here, when he was a Palace hero and City's villain. Henderson's only misjudgement came when he hesitated in a race with Erling Haaland to reach Josko Gvardiol's long ball, handling outside his area, relief coming when the video assistant referee ruled City's striker had been moving away from goal and was not denied a clear scoring opportunity. Either side of this incident, Henderson was faultless as he saved from Haaland, Gvardiol and Jeremy Doku in the first half, then City substitute Claudio Echeverri late on. England head coach Thomas Tuchel, an admirer of Henderson, was watching and, while the keeper may have some way to go to justify the chants of \"England's number one\" from Palace fans, there is no question he has strengthened his claims. He certainly got under Guardiola's skin, City's frustrated manager appearing to aim angry words in Henderson's direction at the final whistle. This video can not be played Henderson denies Marmoush from the penalty spot with brilliant save No such problems for Palace. This was joy unconfined for everyone involved, especially the supporters who back the Eagles so noisily and passionately, and were so desperate to banish the heartbreak of FA Cup final defeats against Manchester United in 1990 and 2016. Until Palace embarked on this run to FA Cup glory, Glasner's three previous Wembley visits had been to watch England twice and drop his daughter off at a Taylor Swift concert. He has now made Wembley memories of his own to savour, following up a comprehensive 3-0 win against Villa in the semi-final then hearing the sweet sound of Palace's fans belting out their full victory playlist once referee Stuart Attwell signalled the end of 10 tortuous minutes of added time. Glasner's message of caution before the FA Cup final, when talk of history was raised, was: \"You don't talk about an egg until the hen has laid it.\" The egg, when laid, was golden. Now Glasner, Palace and their elated followers can talk about this historic day forever.

    "article_text": "This video can not be played Henderson denies Marmoush from the penalty spot with brilliant save Erling Haaland will be sick at the sight of Wembley Stadium. The Norway striker had the chance to end his goalscoring curse at the national stadium on Saturday, but opted to pass on the opportunity during Manchester City's FA Cup final loss against Crystal Palace. With ball tucked firmly under his arm and with the chance to equalise from the penalty spot, Haaland astounded spectators inside the arena and those watching at home by kissing it and handing it over to Omar Marmoush, who saw his spot-kick saved by Dean Henderson. \"I thought he would want to take it but they didn't speak,\" said City manager Pep Guardiola. \"That moment for the penalty, it's the feeling and how they feel. They decided Omar was ready to take it. \"Omar took a lot of time when the ball was stopped, so it put more pressure on him, and Henderson made a good save.\" Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested the occasion may have got to Haaland, saying: \"Erling Haaland is a world-class forward, but when we are talking about Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, there is no way they are giving that ball away. \"That is what separates them two players from Erling Haaland or Kylian Mbappe and these players. They are selfish and they want to score every game. \"When he misses chances I think you can see it gets to him and it does affect him. \"Maybe the thought of taking a penalty at Wembley might have been too much for him.

In aninterview with BBC Sportthis week, Haaland described this season as \"horrific\" but said City had the chance to make amends by lifting silverware against Palace. They failed to do so. Haaland's goalscoring exploits since arriving on these shores have been unmatched and, despite missing chunks of this season through injury, he has still managed to score 30 goals. But he has now failed to score in eight finals with City, extending his barren run to six games without finding the net at Wembley. Missing three of his past seven penalty was maybe on his mind. This video can not be played Shearer 'can't believe' Haaland gave penalty to Marmoush Former England captain Alan Shearer said: \"There is no way anyone is saying to me 'you're not taking a penalty today if we get a penalty'. \"Whether he has missed three in a season or whether he's been out injured, you're fit you're out on the pitch and you should be game for taking the penalty. \"I cannot believe he's turned around and said to someone else 'you take the penalty because I don't really fancy it'.\" Former City defender Micah Richards said: \"I know Erling Haaland's record at Wembley is not very good, but for him not to take the penalty... he is usually so confident and arrogant.\" Henderson said: \"Haaland might have stepped up - I wasn't sure which way to go. \"He gave it to Marmoush and I knew which way he was going. I knew I would save it.\" City dominated the opening stages and Haaland had a hooked effort clawed out by the inspired Henderson, but Palace hit them on the break as Eberechi Eze swept home the goal in the 16th minute that ultimately won Palace the match. The defeated opposition players paid due respect to Palace by waiting for the opposition to lift the trophy before slipping off with their heads bowed down the tunnel. Haaland, though, hung about on the pitch with his runners-up medal weighing heavily around his neck, probably contemplating how this season had gone so wrong. Palace players revelled in winning the first major trophy in the club's history and Haaland's compatriots celebrated the national day of Norway, but the striker himself had little to cheer. There was also a changing of the guard in City's midfield as the departing Kevin de Bruyne was unable to end his illustrious career at the club on a high with a trophy, while 19-year-old Argentine Claudio Echeverri was given his debut in the second half. \"This season has been a massive disappointment for Manchester City,\" Richards said. \"Pep Guardiola has talked about that throughout the season. The players have not met the levels they've set in recent years. \"For City, we are looking at a rebuild - it's obvious for everyone to see - although at times today they did really well.\" Guardiola said: \"We didn't score so congratulations to Crystal Palace for the victory - we did everything. \"Today we were more aggressive. If you're not going to score goals, you're not going to win.\" As the ticker tape rained down, the Bee Gees' classic 'Stayin Alive' pumped out over the speakers. Haaland and his team-mates will need to do just that in their remaining two Premier League games if they are to finish in the top five in what is turning into a forgettable campaign.

    "article_text": "This is Lewis Hamilton's first race for Ferrari in Italy Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix Venue:ImolaDate:18 MayRace start:14:00 BST on Sunday Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app Ferrari are in \"P-nowhere\", according to Charles Leclerc, after he and Lewis Hamilton qualified 11th and 12th for their home Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix. Leclerc was a second off the pace of the pole-setting McLaren of Oscar Piastri in front of the team's adoring 'tifosi'. The Italian track is about 50 miles south-east of the Ferrari factory in Maranello. \"Very disappointed, especially at home at such a special grand prix for the team, it hurts. It would have hurt anyway at whatever track, but here it hurts even more,\" Leclerc said. \"I have no words about our performance today. The only thing we can say is that we are sorry for this kind of performance at home. We are just not good enough at the moment.\" Hamilton, who was 0.161 seconds slower than his team-mate, said he felt the team had made \"some really good progress\" at Imola but admitted he was \"devastated\" by the car's performance. Norris 'just not good enough' in qualifying Piastri beats Verstappen to pole after Tsunoda crash Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix qualifying result \"I feel gutted, I guess,\" he said. \"Because the car was generally feeling really good. \"To be honest, I felt like the car, the set-up was just right. The brakes were working, everything was kind of in place. And we just can't go quicker. \"If you look at how quick Max (Verstappen's Red Bull) is going through Turn Two and Three, we just can't match it. And when we put that new soft (tyre) on at the end, for some reason it just didn't come alive, there was no extra grip.\" It was the second race in succession in which Ferrari had failed to find time when fitting new tyres for their final runs in qualifying - the same happened in Miami two weeks ago. Charles Leclerc is fifth in the drivers' championship Hamilton won the sprint race in China in March but Leclerc's third place in Saudi Arabia is Ferrari's only podium of the season so far. Leclerc is fifth in the drivers' championship and Hamilton seventh, with the team fourth in the constructors' standings - 152 points behind leaders McLaren. Hamilton acknowledged that time was running out on Ferrari's season but added that he saw his first season with the team as a \"foundation-building year\". \"We've got to start adding performance to this car, clearly,\" Hamilton said. \"We're not at the level. I mean, look at Max's rear, it just doesn't move. He's doing like 6-10k faster through Turn Two than us and we can't match that. \"Same with the McLarens. So we've just got to keep pushing, keep applying pressure. I believe the guys can find some performance. \"This is a foundation-building year and getting to grips with everything within the team, making changes that are needed in order to help the team navigate to success long term. \"That's stuff that I'm focused on in the background. There's a lot of improvements we can make across the board, as well as obviously building a faster car.

    "title": "Paolini ends 40-year wait for home women's singles champion at Italian Open",
    "article_text": "Jasmine Paolini is only the fourth player from Italy to win the Italian Open Jasmine Paolini produced a scintillating display as she blew away Coco Gauff in straight sets to end a 40-year wait for a home winner of the women's singles at the Italian Open. Roared on by a partisan crowd at the Foro Italico in Rome, including Italian president Sergio Mattarella, Paolini triumphed 6-4 6-2 against Gauff of the United States. Paolini, who was a surprise finalist at the French Open and Wimbledon last year, wrapped up victory on the clay in one hour 29 minutes. The 29-year-old was the first Italian woman to win the tournament since Raffaella Reggi in 1985 and only the fourth overall since its inception in 1930. \"ItÂ doesn'tÂ seemÂ real. It'sÂ incredibleÂ toÂ haveÂ theÂ trophyÂ inÂ myÂ hands.Â I'mÂ so emotional,\"Â PaoliniÂ said. \"IÂ cameÂ hereÂ asÂ aÂ kidÂ toÂ watchÂ thisÂ tournamentÂ soÂ toÂ liftÂ theÂ trophyÂ isÂ beyondÂ whatÂ IÂ everÂ dreamedÂ of.\" Neither player was able to hold serve in the opening three games before Paolini's nerves eventually settled as she took a 3-1 lead. That was the point at which Paolini upped the ante as she closed out the set in emphatic fashion. Paolini raced into a 3-0 lead in the second set with two early breaks before Gauff claimed a break back and then managed to hold her serve. However, Gauff was unable to wrestle momentum back her way as Paolini swaggered through the remainder of the set. Guaff saved one match point but, at 40-30, Paolini sealed victory with a  powerful serve down the middle. Victory means she will move up a place to fourth in the world rankings on Monday and obtain a top-four seeding for the French Open, which begins next weekend. She and Sara Errani take on Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in Sunday's women's doubles final. Monica Seles was the last woman to win the singles and doubles tournaments in Rome in 1990, while the only player to do so in a WTA 1000 series tournament was Vera Zvonareva at Indian Wells in 2009. Paolini's compatriot Jannik Sinner will contend the men's singles final against rival Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday.

    "article_text": "Lando Norris has not won a race since the 2025 season opener in Australia Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix Venue:ImolaDate:18 MayRace start:14:00 BST on Sunday Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra; live text updates on BBC Sport website and app Lando Norris said he was \"just not good enough\" after qualifying fourth for the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix with his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri on pole. Norris was 0.292 seconds slower than Piastri, and likely faces a difficult race on an Imola track where overtaking is notoriously hard. Briton Norris is 16 points behind the Australian in the championship after the first six races of the season. \"Never good enough in my final lap in 'quali',\" Norris said. \"Everyone goes quicker and I always go slower.\" Norris' downbeat assessment of his own form reflected his struggles in qualifying this season. The Briton dominated Piastri over one lap in 2024, when he was beaten only four times by his team-mate. But changes in the way the McLaren car behaves over the winter have meant it suits him less than it did. Piastri beats Verstappen to pole after Tsunoda crash Ferrari 'P-nowhere' with Hamilton 'devastated' Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix qualifying result Combined with what team principal Andrea Stella describes as a \"relatively numb\" front axle, which is not giving Norris the \"cues\" he needs to drive at the limit, and Piastri has turned the tables. This was his third pole in seven races - matching the total of Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who joins him on the front row in Imola - to Norris' one. Piastri has won four of the six grands prix so far, Norris only one. Norris said: \"I'm not going to just blame the car. That's not me. I felt good all weekend. I felt good in Q1 and Q2. I felt like there's lap time available. \"But when I try and go for lap time, it just doesn't go. Clearly, there's a lot of things changed from last year. \"In my whole career, qualifying has been my biggest strength by a long way. This year, it's just not coming my way.\" Stella, though, pointed out that Piastri had qualified fourth at the last race in Miami and had gone on to win. \"We have said since the start of the season that our car, which is a very competitive car, is not the easiest car to drive in qualifying conditions when you have an empty tank and you go for the last millisecond,\" Stella said. \"It's Imola, and now there is emphasis on the fact that Lando is P4, but let's just go one race back, and who was P4 in Miami? \"It was actually Oscar, but I don't think we talked very much about the fact that he was P4, and in fact he even won the race.\" Norris said the race was going to be \"tricky\" for him and he had to hope for strategy to find a way forward. He starts the race sandwiched between the Mercedes of George Russell and the improved Aston Martin of Fernando Alonso. Fernando Alonso, then with Renault, won in Imola 20 years ago, holding off Ferrari's Michael Schumacher in the closing stages The Spaniard's showing was his team's best of what has so far been a difficult year and it comes as a result of a major upgrade on the car that has - at least partly - been influenced by their new managing technical partner, Adrian Newey, the design legend who joined in March. Alonso's team-mate Lance Stroll qualified in eighth place. \"To be with both cars in Q3, it really lifts a little bit of pressure from the shoulders of everyone in the team,\" Alonso said. \"The package that we introduced yesterday, we had some positive results, but you never know until you go to qualifying. \"We need to keep the feet on the ground, and maybe the track characteristics, it does help the Aston, so we'll need to see in (the next races in) Monaco and Barcelona. But so far, happy with the improvement.\" However, the 43-year-old emphasised that while he was \"happy to be fifth\", it was not close to his or the team's ambitions. \"I want to be in Australia (at the start of the season) next year and win the race,\" Alonso said. \"It's going to be a tactical race. As always in Imola, it's difficult to overtake. Less stops possible for everyone because then you cannot overtake on track. \"I expect to have a good start, good strategy, and let's see the pace. I think it's not as good as P5, so I'm ready to lose a couple of positions, but hopefully not too many.\" Piastri spoke about his determination to ensure he kept the lead at the start. \"As long as I can get a good start, then (I'm) confident,\" he said. \"It's a difficult track to overtake on. Our pace has been strong. Our long-run pace yesterday looked very encouraging. So, yeah, as long as I can get a good start and have a good first lap, then that would be good.\" Verstappen, who said his car was better balanced than on Friday when he had struggled with race pace, said: \"I'll just try to do a good start and see where I'm at with the pace, because yesterday wasn't particularly good in the long run also. \"And then, yeah, just see with the new set-up we have on the car. Hopefully it all sticks a bit better on the Tarmac and, hopefully, in general a bit more competitive.\" Incredible images from 75 years of F1 Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix Qualifying Review Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Glossy black cockatoos could be pushed towards extinction in Victoria if burns go ahead, experts warn",
    "article_text": "Glossy black cockatoos could be pushed towards extinction inVictoriaif planned burns of 13,000 hectares of forest go ahead, ecologists and conservationists warn. The Victorian government is being urged to abandon the burn, which is intended to reduce bushfire risk. Glossy black cockatoos are listed as vulnerable in Victoria, where they are found only in East Gippsland. Nearly two-thirds (64%) oftheir Victorian habitatwas burned in the 2019-20 black summer bushfires, leaving the speciesalmost entirely dependent on 48,000 hectares of unburnt coastal forest between Lake Tyers and Orbost, about 350km east of Melbourne. A peer-reviewed study published in the journal Australian Field Ornithology estimated that the Victorian population had declined by three-quarters since the fires. Glossy black cockatoos feed almost exclusively on the cones of black sheoak trees. Peter Menkhorst, a retired ecologist who worked for Victorian government wildlife agencies for 48 years and a co-author of the study, said they probably had the most specialised diet of any Australian bird, and thata fire in black sheoak forests could badly damage their food supply. He said any unburnt stands of black sheoak were “of critical importance for the species”. A state government report intobiodiversity after the firesagreed that surviving black sheoak stands were of “great significance for this highly specialised bird species” and advised “great care” would be needed in managing the forests. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email But conservation groups have expressed concern that the state’s forest fire management department plans to burn what they estimate is 13,000 hectares of the bird’s remaining habitat over the next three years. Gippsland Environment Group and the Victorian National Parks Association say the birds may never recover if the burns go ahead. Louise Crisp, a founding member of the Gippsland organisation, said she was “horrified” that significant sheoak stands near Lake Tyers and Lakes Entrance were burned. “What they’re doing is burning the glossies’ pantry,” she said. Even a low-intensity fire could cause the cones to open and shed their seed, she said, which was a problem because the birds wouldn’t eat seed from the ground. “My biggest fear is that the population will not have a chance to recover from the incredible effects of the black summer bushfires because Forest Fire Management Victoria are continuing to burn their sole food resource.” Sign up toClear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis after newsletter promotion A spokesperson for Forest Fire Management Victoria said uncontrollable fire was the greatest threat to cockatoo feeding habitat and low-intensity planned burns helped reduce fuel loads and protect sheoak trees. “Ensuring the protection of native wildlife and habitat in the short and long term is a key priority when implementing our planned burning program,” they said. Dr Daniella Teixeira, an ecologist who researches glossy black cockatoos at Queensland University of Technology and is chairing a species recovery team, said fires in sheoaks needed to be planned carefully to avoid areas where the birds were feeding, particularly if there were nest sites nearby. Fire that was too hot could kill the trees. The birds were “very fussy” about what they ate, she said, “even down to the individual trees”. Teixeira said the species was long-lived and slow to reproduce, laying a single egg every one or two years, and in decline across its range. BirdLife Australia’s president, Mandy Bamford, said Victoria’s glossy black cockatoo population was “tiny”, estimated at 250 birds. Those birds needed sheoaks to feed on and safe places to nest, she said, and BirdLife had worked with the department to map priority sites that needed protection. The department’s preferred burn window in autumn posed an additional risk, she said, as it overlapped with the bird’s breeding season. “If there are nestlings in hollows, they can’t get away. Also, potentially you’re reducing food sources at a critical time when they’re feeding chicks.” Concerns have been raised about Forest Fire Management Victoria activities after an endangeredgreater gliderwas found dead next to a tree-felling operation in Yarra Ranges national park in May 2024. Acritically endangered orchidreceived a last-minute reprieve from a planned burn last October after a local environment group threatened legal action to protect its habitat. Jordan Crook, a nature campaigner at the Victorian National Parks Association, said authorities had a duty to protect threatened species along with houses and infrastructure. He said fire management planning was happening “behind closed doors” without independent oversight. “We need to fundamentally change how we use fire in the landscape and manage bushfires,” he said. “The way we’re currently doing it is damaging our biodiversity and our wildlife habitat.”",

    "article_text": "The Australian government is refusing freedom of information requests at a rate not seen for a decade, data shows, prompting concerns for transparency and accountability. Data held by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, the watchdog overseeing the FoI system,revealed the proportion of FoI requestsbeing completely refused has shot up to 27% in the December 2024 quarter. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email That is the highest level since at least 2014-15,historical records show. The OAIC said it is aware of the rising refusal rate and is monitoring the situation. “There are some clear opportunities for improvement for the commonwealth FoI system that we are alive to as the regulator and monitoring,” a spokesperson said. “This includes refusal rates.” The skyrocketing refusal rate has prompted concern among transparency advocates. Transparency International Australia chief executive officer, Clancy Moore, said the FoI system was an essential to ensuring accountability and integrity, but refusal rates suggested “important information about the functioning of government is being kept from everyday Australians”. “Given the Albanese’s government commitment to transparency, open government and integrity, there is a clear argument to introducing stronger consequences for unlawful refusals, increase funding to the FoI teams and the OAIC, and continue work to foster a culture of openness and transparency in the public sector,” he said. The commonwealth has improved its performance in other areas of the FoI system. In the last three years, it has improved the speed of its decision making, partly reversing some significant declines between 2019 and 2022. It is now processing 75% of FoIs within the required time limit, up from 70% in 2021-22. The federal government is also releasing more FoIs in full than its state and territory counterparts. It is continuing to reduce the costs charged to applicants for processing FoIs. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion The OAIC said FoI should be a core business for government departments. “We would like to see government agencies embrace it as something they need to do well to get the community’s trust and confidence,” a spokesperson said. The OAIC is now intervening to review refusal decisions at a record rate, conducting merit reviews in 207 cases in 2023-24. It said it planned to increase its effectiveness as a regulator of FoI, promote open government, and improve the ability of government agency’s to respond to FoI requests. “The right to participate in government decision making through access to information and to hold government to account is one of the fundamental features of our democratic system of government,” the spokesperson said. “The FoI Act recognises that the information government holds is a national resource and is managed for public purposes, and that public access to it should be prompt and at the lowest reasonable cost.”",

    "article_text": "Ted O’Brien says theLiberal partyneeds to expand to better reflect modern Australia, pledging to recruit more women and young people to help shape policy and stand for parliament. As the Coalition begins the long road back from the 3 May election defeat underPeter Dutton, the new deputy party leader and his leader, Sussan Ley, face calls for formal quotas to help women take winnable seats, and for a major policy reset to better align with voters’ concerns. The Fairfax MP and nuclear power advocate told Guardian Australia he would contribute to policy debate on energy supply, but stopped short of saying whether the Dutton-era plan for construction of seven reactors should remain policy for the next election, due around 2028. “I absolutely believe that we need to see a bigger Liberal party which reflects modern Australia, and represents modern Australia, and that includes more women, not just running as parliamentarians but throughout the party,” O’Brien said. “I’m saddened by the fact that we had 28 female candidates, that 28 women went to this election as Liberals who weren’t elected.” Asked about Dutton labelling the ABC and Guardian Australia “hate media” in the days before the election, O’Brien promised a different approach. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “I don’t believe in prejudging any media outlet. “I think that we need to be speaking to all Australians because the Liberal party represents all Australians, and different media outlets sometimes speak to different parts of Australia.” TheCoalitionlooks set to be reduced to fewer than 45 seats, after Anthony Albanese defied expectations and dramatically increased Labor’s representation to at least 93 seats. Ley and the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, have begun talks on a new Coalition agreement, but she is holding off on naming a frontbench or expressing views on policy specifics. Elected by a vote of 29 to 25 over the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, Ley said she wanted to meet voters “where they are” and that the Liberal party needed to reset its offerings to Australians. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion O’Brien – first elected to parliament in 2016 – worked for his family’s flour mill and the bakery firm Defiance, including across Asia, and has worked as a consultant. He and his wife have three children, including a 20-month-old. He founded the youth-focused non-profit Generation Innovation and is a former chair of the Australian Republican Movement. He said he would bring a constructive and communicative leadership style. “We’ve lost an election, we’ve been sent a big message, and the Liberal party is moving to a phase of rebuilding and I think Sussan is going to do a fantastic job as our leader. “I’ve got a role to play in it, in trying to assist getting the team all working together and keeping us all united as we move forward.” Senior party figures, including former minister Simon Birmingham and senators Maria Kovacic and Linda Reynolds, have called for the Coalition to adopt formal gender quotas to boost female representation. Labor made similar moves in 1994 and now have gender parity in the caucus and Albanese’s second-term cabinet. But O’Brien said he would not offer a view on any mechanisms to broadening diversity. “The first step in the process is very much for us to be listening to the Australian community, looking at the data and the evidence so that we are genuinely being very humble about this,” he said. A formal review of the Liberal loss is expected, probably led by party elders. Alongside a debate about nuclear, some Nationals MPs want the opposition to dump its support for net zero by 2050. O’Brien said he looked forward to speaking to voters across the country in his new role. “I believe in old school politics. I believe in the street corner, the town hall, the footy club, and so when you’re old school like that, you don’t know who’s going to rock up and have a chat to you.”",

    "article_text": "Austria has won theEurovisionsong contest after JJ triumphed in Basel with their song Wasted Love, an operatic ballad with soaring vocals that mutates into a club anthem for the finale. It is the third time the country has won, with JJ following in the footsteps of Udo Jürgens in 1965 and Conchita Wurst in 2014. Switzerland, which hosted the first ever Eurovision song contest in 1956, was the venue this year after Nemo won in Malmö last year with their song The Code. They presented the trophy to JJ, who called for “more love”. After finishing a reprise of their winning song, a clearly emotional JJ said “thank youEurope, I love you all” Viennese-born JJ has a range from counter tenor to soprano, and studies classical music. He co-wrote the winning song with Teodora Spiric and Thomas Turner. JJ has previously appeared under his given name Johannes Pietsch on The Voice UK.Austriawill be expected to host in 2026, with Vienna having twice held the competition before. Israel finished second, having lead for some time after a large public vote put them into the top spot. Organisers later said a Eurovision song contestcrew member was hit with paintafter two people tried to rush on stage to disrupt the Israeli singer Yuval Raphael’s performance. Estonia came third and the widely tipped pre-contest favourites from Sweden came fourth. It was another difficult night for the UK. In recent years,Sam Ryder’s Space Manhas been the only song that has bucked the trend for poor results, finishing second in 2022. No other UK entry since 2012 has finished higher than 15th, and this year’s effort by Remember Monday continued that record. The girl band’s song about the aftermath of a wild night out –What The Hell Just Happened?– was granted automatic entry to the final, as the UK is one of the largest net contributors to the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) which organises the show. They finished 19th, having scored zero with the public vote, the second year in a row that has happened to the UK entry. Sophie Ellis-Bextor presented the UK’s jury votes, after Doctor Who actor Ncuti Gatwadropped out of the roledue to “unforeseen circumstances”. Over the course of the two semi-finals and final, guests on the show had included three-time Eurovision host Petra Mede and returning contestants, as well as a special video message from Céline Dion, who won the contest on behalf of Switzerland in 1988. During the final as the votes were being cast two popular Eurovision entires that narrowly failed to win in the past, Baby Lasagna’s Rim Tim Tagi Dim and Käärijä’s Cha Cha Cha, had a wrestling-style mashup contest, while last year’s winner Nemo performed twice. Thirty-seven countries entered the contest, and 26 made it to the final. The semi-finals, held on Tuesday and Thursday, threw up some surprises. Australia, which has competed in Eurovision since 2015, surprisingly failed to qualify with Go-Jo’s innuendo-ladenMilkshake Man. There were still plenty of risque songs on offer, including Miriana Conte, who had to change the lyrics of her song Serving to remove a reference to the Maltese word for singing – “Kant” – due to the phrase “Serving kant” having an obvious resemblance to an English swear word. Despite it being a fan favourite, it scored poorly with the wider public. In Finland’s entry, Ich Komme by Erika Vikman, her song repeatedly announced that she was coming, and she ended her performance hoisted up on a giant gold microphone spraying out fireworks. Other outlandish props including Italy’s Lucio Corsi with an outsized piano, France’s Louane gradually being doused with falling sand, and Estonia’s Tommy Cash wearing a post-it note with “I love Eurovision” on it on his suit pocket, while dancing outside a set called the “Winners Café”. He did not win. Israel’s continued participation in the contest again sparked protest, as it did last year, with about 200 people, many draped in Palestinian flags, joining a gathering in central Basel on Wednesday evening, and more protests on Saturday night. Police used teargas and rolled in a water cannon truck to prevent demonstrators from marching through the centre of the northern Swiss city. Before the event, Irish broadcasterRTÉ had asked the EBU for talksafter 72 former contestants called for a ban on Israel. Raphael, who is a survivor of attack on the Nova music festival by Hamas on 7 October 2023, had her dress rehearsaldisrupted by protesterson Thursday. The EBU stopped Russia competing in Eurovision in 2022 after its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which went on to win the competition that year.",

    "article_text": "AEurovision song contestcrew member was hit with paint after two people tried to rush on stage to disrupt Israeli singer Yuval Raphael’s performance on Saturday, organisers in Basel said.The incident took place while Raphael, 24, was performing New Day Will Rise. No one was injured, and the man and woman involved were escorted from the venue.A spokesperson for Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR, which is organising the contest, said: “At the end of the Israeli performance, a man and a woman tried to get over a barrier on to the stage. They were stopped. One of the two agitators threw paint and a crew member was hit.“The crew member is fine and nobody was injured. The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police.” A spokesperson for Israeli broadcaster Kan said the protesters “were blocked by security officials but Raphael was shaken and upset”. “At the same time, a big anti-Israel protest takes place in the centre of Basel. Israeli national security council issued a warning to Israeli civilians in the city to keep a low profile,” he added. Raphaelfinished second to Austrian singer JJin the competition’s final, after winning the public vote. A spokesman for Basel police said: “The organiser handed the two people over to the police. The police checked the two people and then released them. It is now up to the organiser to decide whether to press charges.” Youth Demand, which is calling for a trade Embargo on Israel, said its supporters David Curry, 22, from Manchester, and Meaghan Leon, 27, from London, had been arrested.Earlier, pro-Palestinian protests took place near a free concert in the centre of Basel against Israel’s inclusion in the contest, as the country intensifies its bombardment of Gaza and enforces blockades of food and other humanitarian supplies. A small group nearby also demonstrated with Israeli flags. Protesters clashed briefly with police in the centre of the city shortly before Raphael took to the stage at the St Jakobshalle venue.Police used teargas and rolled in a water cannon truck to prevent demonstrators from marching through the centre of the northern Swiss city.The confrontation began when police intervened to stop an altercation after two men rushed towards the protesters waving Israeli flags, according to Swiss news agency Keystone-ATS.Israel’s national security council had issued a warning to Israelis in Basel about the protest, advising them to “avoid confrontations with demonstrators and to keep Israeli identifiers low-profile in public spaces”.Hundreds of demonstrators, many wearing Palestinian keffiyeh scarves, carried signs stating: “No Music for Murder”, “Stop Genocide”, and “Singing while Gaza Burns”.Some of the protesters burned huge Israeli and US flags while others sent red and green smoke into the air, according to the AFP news agency.During Raphael’s dress rehearsal on Thursday, six people with whistles and Palestinian flags obstructed her act and were subsequently ejected from the venue.Raphael survived the 7 October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas gunmen at the Nova music festival, which killed hundreds of people.The singer hid under a pile of dead bodies for eight hours until she was rescued.",

    "article_text": "This live blog is now closed, you canread our full report here Hamasconfirmed a new round ofGazaceasefire talks withIsraelwas under way inQatar’sDoha, group officialTaher al-Nonotold Reuters. He said both sides were discussing all issues without “pre-conditions”. This live blog will be closing shortly. You can find all of the Guardian’sMiddle Eastcoveragehere. Here is a summary of the latest developments: At least 140 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the last 24 hours, a deadly escalation asIsraelseemed poised to launch a major offensive in the besieged territory.Israeli strikes inGazahave killed more than 300 people since Thursday, Palestinian health officials said, one of the deadliest periods in the war since ceasefire talks broke down in March. According to local health authorities inGaza, 459 people have been injured in Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours. The escalation in attacks was condemned by the UN human rights chief, Volker Türk, on Friday, who said the bombing campaign was meant to displace Palestinians in Gaza and that it was equivalent to “ethnic cleansing”.“This latest barrage of bombs … and the denial of humanitarian assistance underline that there appears to be a push for a permanent demographic shift in Gaza that is in defiance of international law and is tantamount to ethnic cleansing,” he said. Türk’s comments were also echoed by the UN secretary general, António Guterres, who called for a permanent ceasefire while speaking at an Arab League summit in Baghdad on Saturday. Marwan al-Sultan, director of the Indonesian hospital in the northern Gaza Strip, said the situation there was “tragic and catastrophic after its surroundings were targeted again this morning, causing the collapse of ceilings and cracks in the walls”.“The operating rooms and intensive care units are completely full and we are unable to receive any more critical cases,” he told AFP. Israel said the bombardments were the initial phases of Operation Gideon’s Chariots, an expansion of the campaign in Gaza meant to “achieve all of the war goals in Gaza”.The strikes were accompanied by a large troop buildup along Gaza’s borders, aimed at establishing “operational control” of parts of Gaza. Hamas confirmed a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks with Israel was under way in Qatar’s Doha, group official Taher al-Nono told Reuters.He said both sides were discussing all issues without “pre-conditions”. Arab leaders urged the international community Saturday to fund their plan to rebuild the Gaza Strip after US president Donald Trump reiterated a proposal to take over the Palestinian territory.An Arab League summit in Baghdad said in its final statement that it urges “countries and international and regional financial institutions to provide prompt financial support” to back its Gaza reconstruction plan. The Arab leaders also said that they welcomed a US decision to lift sanctions on Syria. Iraq prime minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, whose country hosted the Arab League summit, said on Saturday it would provide $40m for the reconstruction of Lebanon and Gaza after wars withIsrael. Iraq backed the creation of an “Arab fund to support reconstruction efforts” after crises in the region, al-Sudani told Arab leaders in Baghdad, adding that Iraq will contribute “$20m to the reconstruction ofGazaand $20m for the reconstruction of Lebanon”. Earlier, at the Arab League summit, Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas urged Arab leaders to unite behind a concrete plan to end the war and rebuildGaza. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez on Saturday called for increased pressure “to halt the massacre in Gaza”, speaking at the Arab League summit. Sánchez, who has sharply criticised the Israeli offensive, said world leaders should “intensify our pressure on Israel to halt the massacre inGaza, particularly through the channels afforded to us by international law”. The organisation backed by Israel to take over food distribution in Gazaas famine loomshas admitted it would not be able to feed some of the most vulnerable civilians from the militarised compounds it plans to set up.Aid groups and the UN have already refused to work with theGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF), a Swiss-registered organisation led by a former US marine. They say it does not have the capacity to end hunger in Gaza and would make it harder to get aid to civilians caught up in other wars by undermining their neutrality. British officials are dubious thatEmmanuel Macronintends to press ahead with French recognition of a Palestinian state next month– the first by a G7 nation – which could also push back the UK government following suit. The French president indicated last month that Paris might recognise Palestine, joining 148 other countries, but said he wanted to do so at a UN conference in New York in June as part of a wider process. Israel’s military said it killed a local Hezbollah commander on Saturday in south Lebanon, where authorities reported one dead in the fourth Israeli strike within days despite a November ceasefire. Lebanon’s health ministry said one person was killed in an Israeli “drone strike” on a vehicle in south Lebanon’s Tyre district. Italy’s government on Saturday told Israel to stop deadly military strikes in Gaza, with foreign minister Antonio Tajani saying: “Enough with the attacks.”“We no longer want to see the Palestinian people suffer,” Tajani said during a trip to Sicily, in remarks relayed by his spokesperson. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that US president Donald Trump’s comments on his country during his Gulf visit were “not worth responding to”.In a televised speech, Khamenei said that Trump was lying when he said he wants peace: “Trump claimed he wants to use power to achieve peace, he lied. He and the American officials, and American administrations, have used power to support the massacre in Gaza, to ignite wars wherever they could and to back their own mercenaries.” Khamenei also described Israel as “a dangerous, deadly cancerous tumor in the region” that must be uprooted. Syrian government security forces raided Islamic State hideouts in Aleppo, killing one militant and arresting others, according to Syrian interior ministry spokesperson.A member of the Syrian security forces was also killed in clashes during the raid, the spokesperson added. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğansaid Turkey’s “US partnership is vital for stability in our region and the world”.As reported by Anadolu, speaking at the Arab League Summit in Baghdad, he called for a “softening” of CAATSA (Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act). Humanitarian workers are hearing “goodbye messages from friends and colleagues”, fearing they “may not survive the night,” Bushra Khalidi, Oxfam’s policy lead in Ramallah told the Guardian. “Being in Gaza right now is a death sentence,” said Khalidi. At theArab league summitinBaghdad, Arab leaders called for a ceasefire inGazaasIsraelescalated its attacks on the besieged strip, killing more than 300 people in the last three days in the deadliest bombings since March. Saudiminister of state for foreign affairsAdel al-Jubeircalled for joint efforts “to lessen the humanitarian suffering of the Palestinian people,” and urged a ceasefire.Mahmoud Abbas, president of thePalestinian Authorityalso called for a “permanent ceasefire” and for the “unconditional delivery of relief aid.” Hamasconfirmed that it was engaging in a renewed round of ceasefire talks with Israel inDohaon Saturday, though optimism for a breakthrough deal was low. The calls for a ceasefire came as Israel seemed poised to launch a new offensive on theGaza Strip, amassing troops on the Palestinian territory’s border. Military officials said troop movements and bombings were the beginning phases ofOperation Gideon’s Chariots, which they said was aimed at pressuring Hamas to release hostages as well as establishing “operational control” of parts ofGaza. The news of an offensive prompted renewed calls from the international community for a ceasefire, who said Gaza’s population could hardly handle intensified fighting after 19 months of war. “Enough with the attacks,”Italianforeign ministerAntonio Tajani said during a trip toSicily.“We no longer want to see the Palestinian people suffer,” Tajani said. “Let’s come to a ceasefire, let’s free the hostages, but let’s leave people who are victims of Hamas alone.” Arableaders urged the international community Saturday to fund their plan to rebuild theGaza StripafterUSpresidentDonald Trumpreiterated a proposal to take over thePalestinianterritory. AnArab League summitinBaghdadsaid in its final statement that it urges “countries and international and regional financial institutions to provide prompt financial support” to back itsGazareconstruction plan, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). TheArableaders also said that they welcomed aUSdecision to lift sanctions onSyria. “The reconstruction of Syria is impacted by economic and financial sanctions,” the statement from the Arab League summit said. “We welcome the US President Donald Trump’s announcement to lift the sanctions imposed” on Syria, it added. Ahmad Alhendawi,Save the Children’s regional director for theMiddle East,north Africa, andeastern Europetold the Guardian: The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire. All of Gaza’s children are at risk of famine. This is a deliberate humanitarian catastrophe. Children are being starved by design under Israeli authorities’ total siege, which has created conditions incompatible with human life.Gaza’s children are being bombed in their tents and makeshift shelters as the inescapable living nightmare continues.Starvation as a method of warfare and denying humanitarian aid are crimes under international law and are grave violations against children. The halt on aid must be immediately reversed and humanitarian assistance must be allowed to enter Gaza. We urgently need international action to protect children and families now. It is the very least they are owed, and the very least the international community is obliged to deliver. Iran’s supreme leaderAyatollah Ali Khameneisaid on Saturday thatUSpresidentDonald Trump’s comments on his country during hisGulfvisit were “not worth responding to”, reports Reuters. Khamenei said that Trump was lying when he said he wants peace, citing statements by the US president during his trip to the Gulf that Iran had to move quickly on a US proposal for its nuclear programme or “something bad’s going to happen”. Here are some images coming in via the newswires today: The organisation backed byIsraelto take over food distribution inGazaas famine loomshas admitted it would not be able to feed some of the most vulnerable civilians from the militarised compounds it plans to set up. Aid groups and theUnited Nationshave already refused to work with theGazaHumanitarian Foundation (GHF), aSwiss-registered organisation led by a formerUSmarine. They say it does not have the capacity to end hunger in Gaza and would make it harder to get aid to civilians caught up in other wars by undermining their neutrality. Israel has not officially laid out its plans for food distribution in Gaza, but statements from the GHF and briefings from Israeli officials envisage four or five militarised distribution centres in southern Gaza, run by private security companies, under the oversight of Israeli military bases. GHF is in “advanced discussions” with Israel on details and timing and hopes to have news soon, a person involved with planning at the foundation said. Heads of household would be expected to collect boxes weighing up to 20kg with several days’ supply of food and basic hygiene items like soap for their families. There is no provision for those too sick or weakened by famine to walk long distances across Gaza’s ruined landscape with heavy loads. “From what we have understood, the plan would increase the ongoing suffering of children and families in the Gaza Strip,” saidUnited Nations Children’s FundspokespersonJonathan Crickx. “How is a mother of four children, who has lost her husband, going to carry 20kg back to her makeshift tent, sometimes several kilometres away?” Crickx said. “The most vulnerable people, including the elderly, people with disabilities, the sick and wounded, and orphans, will face huge challenges to access aid.” Italy’s government on Saturday toldIsraelto stop deadly military strikes inGaza, with foreign ministerAntonio Tajanisaying: “Enough with the attacks.” “We no longer want to see the Palestinian people suffer,” Tajani said during a trip toSicily, in remarks relayed by his spokesperson, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “Let’s come to a ceasefire, let’s free the hostages, but let’s leave people who are victims of Hamas alone,” he was cited as saying. Israel’s military has announced it is in the “initial stages” of a new offensive inGazaaimed at defeatingHamas. Israel resumed its offensive in Gaza on 18 March, ending a two-month truce in its war against Hamas triggered by the group’s October 2023 attack. International condemnation has escalated over Israel’s military actions, and its blockage of humanitarian aid entering theGaza Strip. Syriangovernment security forces raidedIslamic Statehideouts inAleppo, killing one militant and arresting others, according to Syrian interior ministry spokesperson. A member of the Syrian security forces was also killed in clashes during the raid, the spokesperson added, according to Reuters. More than 140 people have been killed inGazasinceDonald Trumpleft theMiddle Easton Friday, asIsraellaunched waves of airstrikes across thePalestinianterritory. The attacks, as well as the 10-week long blockade on food and humanitarian aid, has been compared to ethnic cleansing by theUNhigh commissioner on human rightsVolker Türk. Palestinians described being killed “without warning” and “without mercy” in the latest strikes. Here is the Guardian’s video report: At least 140Palestinianshave been killed inGazain the last 24 hours, a deadly escalation asIsraelseemed poised to launch a major offensive in the besieged territory. Israeli strikes inGazahave killed more than 300 people since Thursday, Palestinian health officials said, one of the deadliest periods in the war since ceasefire talks broke down in March. The intensified bombing campaigns came as Israel’s total blockade on humanitarian aid have prompted fears of a famine in the Palestinian territory. “Since midnight, we have received 58 martyrs, while a large number of victims remain under the rubble. The situation inside the hospital is catastrophic,” saidMarwan al-Sultan, the director of theIndonesian hospitalin northernGazaearly on Saturday. The death toll in the last 24 hours was at least 146, according to Reuters. The escalation in attacks was condemned by theUNhuman rights chief,Volker Türk, on Friday, who said the bombing campaign was meant to displace Palestinians in Gaza and that it was equivalent to “ethnic cleansing”. “This latest barrage of bombs … and the denial of humanitarian assistance underline that there appears to be a push for a permanent demographic shift in Gaza that is in defiance of international law and is tantamount to ethnic cleansing,” he said.

Hamasconfirmed a new round ofGazaceasefire talks withIsraelwas under way inQatar’sDoha, group officialTaher al-Nonotold Reuters. He said both sides were discussing all issues without “pre-conditions”. Kristyan Benedict,Amnesty International UK’s crisis response manager, called on the government to suspend “all UK arms exports to Israel”. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: Right now, Keir Starmer’s government is catastrophically failing to fulfil its legal obligation to act to prevent Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. Ministers can reverse this destructive position by immediately suspending all UK arms exports to Israel and rejecting Israel’s dangerous and flagrantly illegal attempts to weaponise humanitarian aid. Although the Labour government suspended most relevant arms export licences toIsraelin September, it made an exception for the F-35 fighter jet programme, citing international peace and security concerns. This week, a high court case was launched challenging the UK’s handling of arms export controls to Israel. The government is defending itself in ajudicial reviewthat alleges it acted unlawfully by continuing to supply F-35 parts and components to a global pool, despite the risk that they may be used by Israel inGazain ways that could breach international law. Israel’s military said it killed a localHezbollahcommander on Saturday in southLebanon, where authorities reported one dead in the fourth Israeli strike within days despite a November ceasefire. Lebanon’s health ministrysaid one person was killed in an Israeli “drone strike” on a vehicle in south Lebanon’sTyredistrict, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). An AFP correspondent said they saw the charred wreckage of a vehicle inAbu al-Aswad, an area about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the Israeli border. The Israeli military said in a statement that its forces “struck and eliminated … a commander” involved in “the re-establishment of Hezbollah terrorist infrastructure” in south Lebanon. Israel has continued to launch strikes on its neighbour despite the 27 November truce which sought to halt more than a year of hostilities with Hezbollah militants including two months of full-blown war. The Israeli military said that “the rebuilding of terrorist infrastructure and related activity constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon”. Earlier this week, the Israeli military said three separate strikes in south Lebanon targeted Hezbollah operatives. At anArab Leaguesummit inBaghdadon Saturday, Lebanon’s prime ministerNawaf Salamdenounced “daily Israeli violations” of Lebanese sovereignty and “the ongoing Israeli occupation of positions” in the south. He said Lebanon was working to “fully implement” aUN security councilresolution that formed the basis of the ceasefire. The resolution says Lebanese troops andUNpeacekeepers should be the only forces in south Lebanon, and calls for the disarmament of all non-state groups. Salam again urged international pressure “to oblige Israel to stop its attacks and immediately and fully withdraw from all Lebanese territory”. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has urged Arab leaders to unite behind a concrete plan to end the war and rebuildGaza. As reported by Qatar News Agency, speaking at the 34th Arab League Summit in Baghdad, Abbas laid out his proposal: A permanent ceasefirein Gaza. Immediate releaseof all Palestinian detainees and Israeli hostages. Unconditional delivery ofrelief aid. Total withdrawalof Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. An international conference in Egyptto implement Gaza’s reconstruction plan. A call forHamasand other factions to “lay down and hand over their arms” to the Palestinian Authority. Support for atwo-state solutionin line with UN resolutions and the Arab Peace Initiative. A pledge to hold presidential and legislative electionsnext year, provided appropriate conditions exist in Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem. In March, an emergency Arab League summit in Cairo endorsed a plan to rebuild Gaza without displacing its residents. Earlier wereportedtheUnited Nationsand major aid groups have expressed concern over plans for aid to be distributed via The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) – a Swiss-registered organisation led by a former US marine. WhileIsraelhas not officially detailed its distribution plans, statements from the GHF and briefings from Israeli officials outline a model involving four or five militarised aid centres in southern Gaza, overseen by Israeli military bases. Henriette Willberg, Head of Research atLaw for Palestine, told the Guardian that Palestinian civil society groups are urging states to “reject Israel’s planned distribution mechanisms”, which she said “further weaponises aid and bypasses humanitarian actors”. She instead called on countries to support the deployment of a “Diplomatic Humanitarian Convoy toGazathrough the Rafah Crossing”, adding that states should “send a diplomatic mission to accompany this convoy”. “This demand is strongly enshrined in legal principles and states’ responsibilities under international law,” Willberg added.",

The strikes were accompanied by a large troop buildup along Gaza’s borders, aimed at establishing “operational control” of parts of Gaza. The campaign, as well as the aid blockade on the territory, was meant to forceHamasto release hostages, Israeli officials said. The terrorist organisation took about 250 hostages during its October 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people. Fifty-seven hostages are still held by Hamas. The attacks came asDonald Trumpdeparted the Middle East after a four-day visit to Arab Gulf countries, during which Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar made pledges to invest billions in the US. Hopes that Trump’s visit might bring renewed progress on truce talks in Gaza were dashed after the US president reiterated his desire to turn Gaza into a “freedom zone”. This was seen as a likely nod to his plan of the US assuming control over the Palestinian territory and turning it into the “riviera of the Middle East”. A January ceasefire broke down in mid-March after Israel refused to move to a scheduled second phase that could have led to ending the war. Prospects of a lasting truce seemed further away as Israel’s security cabinet approved plans in early May that could involve seizing the entire Gaza Strip. Gaza ceasefire talks were also expected to dominate the Arab League summit, where Arab officials met on Saturday. The Iraqi foreign minister, Fuad Hussein, said that attending ministers would endorse a reconstruction plan for Gaza, a contrast to Trump’s offer to take over the Palestinian territory. Ministers later pledged $40m in reconstruction funds for Gaza and Lebanon. Later on Saturday Hamas confirmed a new round of Gaza ceasefire talks with Israel was under way in Qatar’s Doha. A group official, Taher al-Nono, told Reuters both sides were discussing all issues without “pre-conditions”. Israel’s offensive in Gaza, launched in retaliation for the October 2023 attacks, has killed about 53,000 people in Gaza, according to Palestinian health authorities. Widespread hunger and malnutrition among children have also soared, after Israel cut off vital humanitarian aid to the territory on 2 March. There is little medical care in Gaza, due to scarce supplies and repeated Israeli strikes on hospitals and medical facilities. The UN aid chief, Tom Fletcher, urged a resumption of aid to Gaza in a speech to the UN security council on Tuesday, where he said famine loomed.Israel has consistently denied that its 10-week blockade is causing hunger in Gaza. However, Trump acknowledged on Thursday that “a lot of people are starving in Gaza”. Israel, which claims Hamas hijacks aid to fund its military, has proposed a plan to distribute aid from hubs in Gaza run by private contractors and guarded by Israeli troops. The US has backed the plan, and a body called the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is set to begin carrying out the plan by the end of the month. Aid groups described the plan as unworkable and potentially unlawful as it could lead to forced displacement. They urged Israel to lift its blockade and to rely on the UN and other existing humanitarian bodies, which have long experience in transporting aid into Gaza. “We can save hundreds of thousands of survivors,” Fletcher said. “We have rigorous mechanisms to ensure our aid gets to civilians, and not to Hamas.” The European Council president, António Costa, said on Saturday: “Shocked by the news from Gaza: starving civilians, hospitals hit again by strikes. The violence must stop!”. Germany’s foreign ministry said on Saturday it is “deeply concerned” about the situation in Gaza, and that the offensive “could put the lives of the remaining hostages, including those of German hostages, in danger”. “A broad military offensive also risks worsening further the catastrophic humanitarian situation for Gaza’s population and the remaining hostages,” it added. On Saturday the Spanish prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called for pressure to stop Israel’s “massacre in Gaza” and said Madrid plans a UN resolution requesting a world court ruling on aid access to the Palestinian territory.",

    "title": "How Donald Trump’s ‘historic’ Gulf state deals benefit a handful of powerful men",
    "article_text": "On his tour of the Middle East this week,Donald Trumpannounced a slew of multibillion-dollar tech deals with the leaders ofSaudi Arabia, theUnited Arab EmiratesandQatar. With the sale of the US’s most advanced technology, he also sold the American model of the industry that made it: enormous amounts of power concentrated in the hands of a few men. The announcements poured in last week: the US and the United Arab Emiratesagreedon Abu Dhabi as the site of the largest artificial intelligence campus outside the US. The deal reportedly allows the UAE to import half a million Nvidia semiconductor chips, considered the most advanced in the world for the creation of artificial intelligence products. Saudi Arabia struck a similar deal for semiconductors, obtaining the promise of the sale of hundreds of thousands of Nvidia Blackwell chips to Humain, an AI startup owned by its sovereign wealth fund. Cisco said it had signed a deal with a UAE AI firm to develop the country’s AI sector. The agreements also directed some investment by Saudi firms into US technology and manufacturing. Amazon Web Services and Qualcomm likewise announced deals on cloud computing and cybersecurity. The agreements were remarkable for several reasons. Styling himself the broker-in-chief, Trump brought along an entourage of dozens of CEOs to the Middle East, including Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, OpenAI’sSam Altman, Elon Musk, Amazon’s Andy Jassy, Palantir’s Alex Karp and two dozen others. Those executives negotiated their deals face-to-face with Gulf country leaders. Many of those agreements broke with the policies of Joe Biden’s administration, which imposed strict controls on the sales of the US’s most cutting-edge technology. Biden forbade Nvidia and other chipmakers from selling their latest wares to Middle Eastern powers because of the latter’s links to China. Whether the Gulf states keep the tech for themselves as stipulated – the enormous datacenter is to be built by an Emirati company but managed by American ones – or proffer it to China in a geopolitical backroom deal remains to be seen. Despite the uncertainty that arose from some corners, the Trump White House put out three press releases that trumpeted how the president had “secured historic investment commitments” that total in the trillions from the three oil-rich nations. A section ofone fact sheetwas headlined: “Never tired of winning.” The deals stand to enrich the tech CEOs substantially by opening up new audiences for their products. These are the same men at the helm of AI development, and Trump’s use of them as surrogates seems likely to propagate the American model of technological power in new places. Also notable throughout the trip:Elon Muskdemonstrated he still wields considerable influence in the White House. The world’s richest person may have pivoted from the government cost-cutting project of Doge, but there he was, beside the president once again. Musk’s presence on the trip had less to do with AI than Altman’s or Huang’s, though. His value to the president’s dealmaking was his power over global internet connectivity.

    "title": "‘Very disturbing’: Trump receipt of overseas gifts unprecedented, experts warn",
    "article_text": "Former White House lawyers, diplomatic protocol officers and foreign affairs experts have told the Guardian thatDonald Trump’s receipt of overseas gifts and targeted investments are “unprecedented”, as the White House remakes US foreign policy under a pay-for-access code that eclipses past administrations with characteristic Trumpian excess. The openness to foreign largesse was on full display this week as the US president was feted in the Gulf states during hisfirst major diplomatic trip abroadthis term,inking dealshe claimed were worth trillions of dollars and pumping local leaders for investments as he says he remakes US foreign policy to prioritise “America first” – putting aside concerns of human rights or international law for the bottom line of American businesses and taxpayers. But quite often, the bottom line also has benefited Trump himself. His family’s wealth has ballooned by more than $3bn, according to press estimates, and the reported benefits fromcryptocurrenciesand other investment deals such as plans for new Trump-branded family properties may be far larger. Deals for billions more have been inked by business associates close to Trump, meaning that their political support for the White House can translate into lucrative contracts abroad. “When we’re negotiating with other countries, the concern is that our negotiating position will change if someone does a favor or delivers a gift to the president of the United States,” Richard Painter, the chief White House ethics lawyer in the administration of George W Bush, said. “Whether it’s trying to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war, or the Middle East or anything else. You know the the impression is given that the position of the United States can be swayed and even bought.” Others argue that the message being sent by the White House is that American foreign policy is being sold to the highest bidder. “Trump has put a for-sale sign out front of the White House,” said Norm Eisen, the executive director of the legal advocacy group State Democracy Defenders Fund and a White House “ethics czar” and ambassador to the Czech Republic under Barack Obama. “Of course you’re going to see Qatar and UAE as like a bidding war. Qatar says: ‘I’ll give you a $400m plane,’ and the UAE says: ‘Hold my beer,I’ll give your crypto company $2bn.’” In a particularly eye-catching incident this week, Qatar offered to give the US Department of Defense a$400m Boeing 747-8that Trump had suggested could be used as Air Force One and then passed on to his presidential library after he leaves office. The plane has become a lightning rod among US Democrats, and critics have argued it violates the emoluments clause of the constitution that prohibits the president from receiving gifts from foreign entities. Trump had called the plane a “great gesture” from Qatar and said that it would be “stupid” for him not to accept the gift. A Democratic lawmaker had called the plane a “flying palace”, andeven diehard Maga supporterssuch as the commentators Laura Loomer and Ben Shapiro have criticised it publicly. Painter suggested that it would be similar to King George III gifting George Washington a copy of the royal stagecoach for his use in office. “You think the founders wouldn’t have considered that a bribe?” he said. But Gulf states have offered other incentives, including a$2bn investmentfrom a UAE-controlled funds into a Trump-linked stablecoin that could incentivise the president to shape foreign policy in favour of Abu Dhabi. An advisory sent to congressional Democrats this week and seen by the Guardian said: “President Trump and the Trump family have moved at breakneck speed to profit from a massive crypto scam on the American people.” The gifts, and in particular the potential gift of a jet, have led to a series of denunciations on Capitol Hill as they seek to build momentum for a legislative push. “This isn’t America first. This is not what he promised the American people. This is Trump first,” said Chris Murphy, a Democratic senator from Connecticut. “He is willing to put our nation’s security at risk, take unconstitutional bribes, just so he can fly himself and his Mar-a-Lago golf buddies around the world in gold-plated luxury planes gifted to him by foreign governments.” But is it illegal? AsQatarwould give the jet to the Department of Defense, some experts have said that it may not directly violate the emoluments clause or other laws, even if Trump were to make use of the plane while in office. “Never seen it before,” said Scott Amey, the general counsel of the Project On Government Oversight, a non-profit government watchdog group based in Washington. “Is it allowed? I’m still uncertain.” Past administrations would have run from the perceived conflicts of interest being welcomed by Trump. The former White House ethics advisers described crises such as when a Gulf state tried to present a Rolex to a national security adviser, or when the Boston Red Sox tried to gift the White House chief of staff a baseball bat signed by all the players (the addressee was forced to pay its estimated market value, said Painter). Eisen said that he forbade Obama from even refinancing the mortgage on his house in Chicago because of his capacities to influence the market. “The status quo has been saying no, because it’s an actual and apparent conflict of interest, and it could jeopardize our domestic and foreign policies,” said Amey. ”It certainly doesn’t pass the sniff test for a lot of Americans.” The lavish gifts and other investments come as Trump is reshaping America’s policy in the Middle East, skipping Israel and turning toward the Gulf states in a flurry of deal-making that could benefit both sides handsomely. And Trump’s family and other advisers, such as Steve Witkoff, with interests in the Gulf states are closely involved. “When the firstTrump administrationcame in, I saw that people in the Gulf said, ‘Finally, an American administration we understand. He sends us his son-in-law to talk to us,’” said Dr F Gregory Gause III of the Middle East Institute, a former professor of international affairs at the Bush School. “It’s a startling change in American norms … the notion that Trump family private business and US government business walk hand in hand is remarkable.” While potential gifts like a jet cannot be hidden, the potential to move billions of dollars in cryptocurrency secretly has watchdogs, the political opposition and other foreign observers deeply concerned. “We’re talking about billions of dollars, almost infinite money, that can be paid by anyone,” said one senior European diplomat. One little-known China-linked firm with no revenue last year bought $300m of a Trump meme coin this week, raising further concerns of dark foreign money moving intoUS politics. Senate Democrats have called for rewriting the Genius Act, Trump-backed legislation that they say would provide for far-too-lax regulation of so-called stablecoins, in order to ban him from benefiting. “If Congress is going to supercharge the use of stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies, it must include safeguards that make it harder for criminals, terrorists, and foreign adversaries to exploit the financial system and put our national security at risk,” said the memo. The flood of foreign money has left former officials who used to carefully track the giving of gifts and other goods from foreign government infuriated. The rules can be “annoying and sort of stupid, but it is what separates the good guys from the bad guys, as it relates to corruption and good governance”, said Rufus Gifford, a former head of protocol for the state department, which also tracks gifts to US officials from foreign governments. “And I think that Trump just has no respect for those institutions that have been set up for a very specific purpose, which is to root out corruption. “It is very, very disturbing that a president of the United States could be in a position to profit off the office in which he holds,” he continued. “And that is, again, something that is never supposed to be able to happen. And it’s really quite extraordinary.”",

    "title": "UK officials suspect Macron will delay French Palestine recognition",
    "article_text": "British officials are dubious thatEmmanuel Macronintends to press ahead with French recognition of a Palestinian state next month – the first by a G7 nation – which could also push back the UK government following suit. The French president indicated last month that Paris might recognise Palestine, joining 148 other countries, but said he wanted to do so at a UN conference in New York in June as part of a wider process. The UN conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for 2-4 June, co-chaired byFranceand Saudi Arabia. Israel has already warned Macron that recognition would be seen as rewarding Hamas, and France has been trying to forestall the criticism by strengthening a reformed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. The UK foreign secretary, David Lammy,has confirmed to parliamenthe has been in discussions with the French about recognition, but also said he would not simply support a gesture with no practical impact. But the growing British view is that France – a country that has debated recognition for more than a decade – will decide the conditions are not ripe. The UK has for years said it will recognise a Palestinian state, but only at the point of maximum impact, without defining that moment any further. But British officials admit anger at the Israeli blockade of aid intoGaza, and backbench Labour MPs’ frustration with their party’s response in government is putting pressure on the Foreign Office to back an initiative. The UK Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, was forced in the Commons this week to defend claims by government lawyers in the high court thatthere is no genocide in Gaza, or that women and children were being targeted by Israel. Edward Leigh, father of the house and a Conservative, asked Falconer if he was “aware that many friends of Israel worldwide, notwithstanding narrow legal definitions, are asking this moral question: when is genocide not genocide?” A Palestinian human rights group, Al-Haq, is seeking a judicial review that the government has acted unlawfully in continuing to supply components and spares for F-35 fighter jets to a global pool that can then be transferred to Israel in Gaza. A Ministry of Defence official in a heavily redacted 11-page submission discussed in closed court on Friday, claimed the F35 jet fighter programme is largely owned by the US government and consensus is required for approval to be given to any UK request that its parts are not transferred to Israel. Labour defends its Palestine policy by pointing to September’s suspension of arms exports to Israel for use in Gaza. But figures released on Thursday showedthe government approved $169m worth of military equipment to Israelin the three months that followed the Labour government’s partial suspension. The export data show that 20 different licences in categories such as military aircraft, radars, targeting equipment and explosive devices were approved between October and December 2024. Arms campaigners say the three-month total is more than what was approved altogether under the Tory government between 2020 and 2023. The business department said: “The majority of military licences by value approved in 2024 is made up of components for items being produced in Israel for third countries, including our Nato allies, and we continue to assess all licence applications on a case-by-case basis against our strict criteria.” The controversy is relevant to Britain’s recognition of Palestine in that ministers are now under political pressure to point to practical steps being taken to show disapproval of the methods Israel is using to eliminate Hamas. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion The June conference in New York is born out of a UN general assembly resolution passed in the wake ofthe international court of justice (ICJ) July 2024 advisory opinion declaring that the Israeli occupation was unlawfulunder international law. The General Assembly resolution passed in September 2024 set a 12-month “deadline” for action to be taken on the ICJ ruling. France has a long history dating back to the former president François Hollande of suggesting that it is on the brink of recognising Palestine, but in the end has always pulled back, arguing the timing was not right, or there was a lack of international diplomatic consensus. Macron in April said: “We must move towards recognition, and we will do so in the coming months […] I also want to participate in a collective dynamic, which must also allow all those who defend Palestine to recognise Israel in turn, which many of them do not do.” Michel Duclos, senior fellow at the Institut Montaigne, said: “My impression is that there are as many opinions on recognition as there are advisers to the president. But if the president has to wait for Saudi Arabia to recognise Israel, it is clear from the Trump visit to the Gulf, he will have to wait for a long time.” The formal aim of the UN conference is to “urgently chart an irreversible pathway towards the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution”. If Macron requires Saudi recognition of Israel as a quid pro quo for his recognition of Palestine, it is unlikely to happen in June without at minimum a permanent ceasefire. The Saudi foreign ministry this week again accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, and normalisation remains off its agenda. WithinEurope, only Spain, Ireland, Sweden, Slovenia and Norway have recognised Palestine. The US last vetoed full recognition of Palestine at the UN in April 2024. The UK abstained and France backed the move. A group of French politicians and academics in an article in Le Monde this week argued recognition was a “moral imperative, a political necessity, a strategic requirement” and the only way for France to escape “an untenable diplomatic paradox” in proclaiming its commitment to the two-state solution while refusing to recognise one of them.",

The blaze was reported to police by firefighters in the early hours of Monday. Police said damage was caused to the property’s entrance but nobody was hurt.A car that Starmer had sold to a neighbour last year was set alight four days earlier on the same street.On 11 May, firefighters dealt with a small fire at the front door of a house where the Labour leader is understood to have lived in the 1990s before it was converted into flats. One person was helped to safety by firefighters wearing breathing apparatus, the London fire brigade said.Anyone with information that could assist the investigation has been asked to contact the Met. A 21-year-old man, Roman Lavrynovych, has already been charged with three counts of arson with intent to endanger life and appeared in court on Friday.The Ukrainian national was remanded in custody after appearing at Westminster magistrates court. He did not enter any pleas to the charges.Lavrynovych will appear next at the Old Bailey for a plea and trial preparation hearing on 6 June.",

    "title": "UK government dropped health push after lobbying by ultra-processed food firms",
    "article_text": "Government legal guidance urging retailers in England to offer millions of consumers deals and discounts on minimally processed and nutritious food was dropped after a lobbying campaign by the world’s biggest ultra-processed food firms, the Guardian can reveal. Ahead of new regulations banning junk food promotions from October, the Department of Health and Social Care issued advice to thousands of shops, supermarkets, online retailers and other businesses to help them comply with the law. The guidance said: “The aim of this policy is to shift the balance of promotions towards healthier options – such as minimally processed and nutritious food.” This might include, for example, two-for-one deals, discounts or extra loyalty points on fruit, vegetables, whole grains, fresh meat and fish. Promotions on minimally processed and nutritious food would be gamechanging, making it more affordable for families and improving the diets of millions. But the healthy food push was dropped after the Food and Drink Federation, which represents corporations including Nestlé, Mondelēz, Coca-Cola, Mars and Unilever repeatedly demanded the government ditch it. Now the new regulations coming into force in England still limit the promotion of food and drink that is high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS), but guidance issued to retailers no longer urges them to switch their deals to minimally processed and nutritious food. Instead, it simply encourages promotions of “healthier options”. Experts say this is “flawed” advice because many ultra-processed foods still meet the definition of “healthier”, including some energy drinks, crisps, snacks, cereal bars, pizzas, burgers and ice-creams. The U-turn, revealed for the first time, occurred on 1 June 2023 under Rishi Sunak’s government, the Guardian found.The change remainsin the current government’s guidance being issued to retailers ahead of the law change in October. It came after the FDF waged a campaign to put pressure on the DHSC to rewrite its nutrition policy, lobbying officials to remove the push to minimally processed food in the guidance issued to retailers, according to documents and emails reviewed by the Guardian. In response to a freedom of information request, the government released a cache of emails between the FDF and the DHSC. Most of the correspondence was heavily redacted. The government cited section 40(2) of the Freedom of Information Act, “which provides for the protection of personal information”, and section 35(1)(a), “which provides protection for the information that relates to the formulation or development of government policy”. The emails, sent between October 2022 and April 2023, reveal how the FDF, which represents firms with a combined annual turnover of more than £112bn, lobbied the DHSC to drop the guidance pushing retailers to promote minimally processed food. Email from [redacted], 2 October2022 “This is a real bone of contention with the companies … Please can you give me a date when this will be deleted from the guidance?” “I see the promotions guidance was re-issued on Friday to reflect the new implementation date of the volume-based promotions,” an FDF official wrote in an email to a DHSC official on 2 October 2022. “My understanding was that when the guidance was updated the reference to the aim of the policy being to shift choices to ‘minimal [SIC] processed foods’ would be removed but it’s still there.” “This is a real bone of contention with the companies,” the FDF official added. “Please can you give me a date when this will be deleted from the guidance?” Four days later, on 6 October 2022, the FDF official emailed the DHSC official again. “It would be great to understand when this change is going to happen. Clearly the policy and guidance is live and as discussed before, we consider this reads that government policy is that processed foods are inherently unhealthy, not something we agree with or believe the scientific evidence supports.” Email from [redacted], 6 October2022 “I had thought we had agreement that this change would happen, and whilst I appreciate you don’t want to keep re-opening guidance documents, this discussion was several months ago now.” The FDF official said: “I had thought we had agreement that this change would happen, and whilst I appreciate you don’t want to keep re-opening guidance documents, this discussion was several months ago now.” In an email to DHSC officials on 23 November 2023, an FDF official wrote: “Please do also let us know as soon as possible when you have clarified next steps for removing the reference to ‘minimally processed’ from the promotions guidance – as mentioned on the call, this is a particularly contentious issue for our members.” Email from [redacted], 23 November2022 “Please do also let us know as soon as possible when you have clarified next steps for removing the reference to ‘minimally processed’ from the promotions guidance – as mentioned on the call, this is a particularly contentious issue for our members.” On 3 January 2023, the FDF was told the advice to promote minimally processed food would be deleted from the guidance issued to retailers, the emails show. Email from [redacted], 3 January2023 “I can confirm that as part of these changes, we intend to remove the wording ‘such as minimally processed and nutritious food’.” “We are considering a number of changes to the HFSS promotions implementation guidance as minor points of clarification and will update on these in due course,” an email to an FDF official said. “I can confirm that as part of these changes, we intend to remove the wording ‘such as minimally processed and nutritious food’.” There is no longer any reference to either term in the current version of the document,which remains liveon the government’s website. Cathy Cliff, campaigns coordinator at the Soil Association, provided the emails to the Guardian after obtaining them under freedom of information laws. “This move to block discounts on healthy foods is clearly one that benefits the profits of UPF manufacturers more than the health of their consumers,” she said. After the guidance was dropped, the FDF boasted about its lobbying success, hailing the victory in a “key wins” section of its website, the Guardian found. “The FDF’s engagement with Department of Health and Social Care officials … resulted in the removal of the reference to ‘minimally processed’ in the HFSS promotions guidance.” The FDF also said it had successfully lobbied to stop ultra-processed food being mentioned in separate legislation in Scotland. “FDF Scotland’s engagement with the Scottish government ensured the prevention of the term ‘ultra-processed food’ [UPF] being used in the good food nation bill.” The page has since been deleted from the FDF website. It now reads “sorry, page not found”. Half the average diet of Britons now consists of ultra-processed food (UPF). For some, especially those who are younger, poorer or from disadvantaged areas, a diet comprising as much as 80% UPF is typical. All food is processed to some degree, and processing can be necessary and beneficial. But UPF is different. It is often high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) but also engineered and marketed in ways that cause excess consumption, fuelling the obesity crisis, which costs the NHS more than £11bn a year. Last montha study foundthat consuming large amounts of UPF increases the risk of an early death. It is so damaging to health that it is implicated in as many as one in seven of all premature deaths, including at least 17,000 every year in England. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “This change took place under the previous government. This government is committed to tackling obesity and building a healthier Britain. “We are taking action to end the targeting of junk food adverts to children across TV and online and we have handed local authorities stronger powers to block applications for takeaways near schools. We are also commissioning research to improve the evidence on the health impacts of UPF.” A Scottish government spokesperson said: “The good food nation bill was framework legislation, the term ‘ultra processed food’ was therefore not omitted, as it was agreed that the bill would not include reference to specific policies.” An FDF spokesperson said: “FDF regularly engages with government on behalf of food and drink manufacturers, on regulation that underpins nutrition, food safety and food security; as well as on how we play our part in helping people follow healthier diets. “In the instance cited, we asked the government to phrase their business guidance on new HFSS regulations in a way that was consistent with that legislation. We were concerned that references to processing in the guidance, which was not covered in the legislation, would cause confusion.”",

    "title": "Three Iranians in UK charged after counter-terrorism investigation",
    "article_text": "Three men have appeared in court charged under the National Security Act on suspicion of assisting the Iranian foreign intelligence service. Mostafa Sepahvand, 39, of St John’s Wood, Farhad Javadi Manesh, 44, of Kensal Rise, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, 55, of Ealing, appeared before Westminster magistrates court on Saturday. The three defendants spoke through a Farsi interpreter at the brief court hearing to confirm their names, dates of birth and addresses. The three men all arrived in the UK by irregular means, including by small boats and a lorry, between 2016 and 2022. No pleas were entered by any of the men, who were all wearing grey sweatshirts, with Sepahvand attending in a wheelchair and Noori hobbling into the dock. Scotland Yard said a counter-terrorism investigation had led to three Iranian men being charged for engaging in conduct likely to assist the foreign intelligence service between 14 August 2024 and 16 February 2025. They were arrested on Saturday 3 May. Sepahvand was also charged with engaging in conduct; surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research, intending to commit serious violence against a person in the UK. Manesh and Noori have also been charged with engaging in surveillance and reconnaissance, with the intention of committing serious violence against a person in the UK. Another man, arrested on Friday 9 May under the National Security Act, was released without charge on Thursday. They were remanded into custody and will appear for a preliminary hearing at the Old Bailey on 6 June. The district judge Annabel Pilling told the defendants: “I’m sending your case to the central criminal court. “There will be a trial in due course before a judge and jury if you plead not guilty. “The next stage will be a preliminary hearing before the specialist judge Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb on 6 June.” The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said Iran must be “held to account for its actions”. Cooper said: “I want to thank the police and security services for their continuing work on this very serious investigation, and for their immense dedication to protecting our national security and the safety of our communities. “The charges that have been laid against these three individuals must now take their course through the criminal justice system, and nothing must be done to prejudice the outcome of those proceedings. “But we will also take separate action to address the very serious wider issues raised by this case. The police have confirmed that the foreign state to which these charges relate is Iran, and Iran must be held to account for its actions. “We must also strengthen our powers to protect our national security as we will not tolerate growing state threats on our soil. “Protecting national security is the first duty of government. The police and security services have our continued support in their vital work, and we will take whatever action is needed to tackle the complex threats we face and keep our country and our people safe.” Cmdr Dominic Murphy, from the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said: “These are extremely serious charges under the National Security Act, which have come about following what has been a very complex and fast-moving investigation. “Since the men were arrested two weeks ago, detectives have been working around the clock, and we have worked closely with colleagues in the CPS to reach this point. We have been in contact with the individuals directly affected, and we continue to provide them with support. “Now that these men have been charged I would urge people not to speculate about this case, so that the criminal justice process can run its course.” Frank Ferguson, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service’s special crime and counter-terrorism division, said: “Following a review of the evidence provided by the Metropolitan police service’s counter terrorism command, we have authorised criminal charges against three Iranian nationals.”",

    "title": "‘It feels like we never left’: resentment builds in one of UK’s firmest Brexit-backing areas",
    "article_text": "When Keir Starmer was asked last week whether he thought Britons had finally moved on from the issue ofBrexit, his answer was a definitive yes. It’s not difficult to see why the prime minister would hope to settle the question, before a week in which he hopes to reset the UK’s relationship with the EU, clearing a way for easier access to a marketplace that could help increase the economic growth he badly needs. But at a different kind of marketplace, in one of the most stridently Brexit-backing parts of the country, the answer was not so clearcut. Gazing up from the display of scented products at his family’s stall on the high street in Grays, Thurrock, Nigel Guest briefly pondered. “It feels like we never left the EU to be honest,” replied Guest, 56, a lifelong native of theEssexconstituency who, along with an overwhelming 72% of local voters, voted to leave the EU in 2016. Only three other districts backed Brexit to the same extent. “I just feel that it was a missed opportunity. Yes, people were sometimes fed bullshit. But they were asked if we wanted to come out and people around here literally voted in their droves for it. We’ve never really seen the investment we were promised.” His partner, Sarah, went further, accusing successive governments of a “betrayal”. Money that she believed had been saved by exiting the EU should have been channelled into improving it and other public services, she said. Such sentiments were not hard to find behind the bustle of Friday market day in Grays, nestled on the north bank of the Thames, a short drive and even shorter train ride from Tilbury docks, part of the Thames freeport. In the period before the EU referendum,Thurrock recordedthe lowest levels of life satisfaction of any place in the UK, while hostility towards immigration was tapped into first by the BNP and later Ukip. With similar messaging,Reform UKis now eyeing its electoral prospects here, where it came second in last year’s general election. But for the postponement of local elections, it could also well have added the Thurrock council – declared in effect bankrupt in 2022 – to the list of those it won on 1 May. Yet economic green shoots have emerged, not least in Tilbury, where plans were submitted last week to expand the thriving port by as much as 40 hectares (100 acres). “Thurrock is very much like a red wall seat. It just happens to be in the south rather than the north,” said Jackie Doyle-Price, who was the local Conservative MP from 2010 until last year, when Jen Craft won the seat back forLabour, which had held it for most of the period after the second world war. “It’s close to London, but Brexit was still an opportunity for those who felt politics was leaving them behind to voice their dissatisfaction,” Doyle-Price said. “People have moved on from the vote in many ways, but one thing which really cut through during the referendum campaign – the immigration debate – has got worse. What was promised hasn’t materialised, because immigration has continued to remain high.” Those shifts in demographics are vividly illustrated by the changing face of Grays’ high street, where a diverse range of new restaurants, food stores and other retailers have arrived over the past decade. Those newcomers included Hassan Naeen, who was optimistic about the town’s future since establishing Sabina, a supermarket selling hair and body products to African-Caribbean customers and others. “There’s a good community here, and we have been promised that regeneration of the town is coming,” he said. As for the question of potential tensions over immigration, he had praise for the government’s plans to toughen policy. At a west African restaurant next door, there was a candid if careful reflection from Father Paschal Uche as he fetched lunch with a fellow Catholic priest, Tochukwu Okonkwo. “It shouldn’t be overstated but sometimes you see divides that might be there even within our community. So, there are certain masses that might have more white, older crowds and others where you’ve got mainly west African or a migrant community.” As for Brexit, he said of his experience working elsewhere in Essex: “I think, speaking personally, that some people might have been hit by the realities, whether that’s about travel, certain conveniences or whatever else, and feel they are still waiting to see the benefits.” While they wait, however, house prices and rents in the area have been rising to levels beyond the reach of local people, a point emphasised by Neil Woodbridge, whose social enterprise employs 200 staff supporting local disabled people. “I don’t pick up on a huge amount of regret from my staff who voted Brexit. As with elsewhere, it was an ‘up yours to the government’ and I think they would do it again. “Keir Starmer might be right to the extent Brexit is in the past for them, but the reality is that they’re struggling. There’s a thing called the ‘Thurrock shrug’, and it’s where people go ‘yeah, whatever’ because they always feel let down by government. “There are such great opportunities, whether it’s the ports expansion locally or the direction the economy hopefully is going, but people need to be brought along. Otherwise it’s just storing up big problems.”",

The Guardianfirst revealed two weeks agothat Downing Street was rethinking the controversial cut and considering whether to increase the £11,500 threshold over which pensioners are no longer eligible for the allowance. Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, axed the payment from 10 million pensioners within weeks of taking office, arguing that it was no longer affordable because the Conservatives had left a £22bn black hole in the country’s finances. The benefit, which is worth up to £300, is now means-tested and only available to people who are in receipt of pension credit and some other benefits. The decision has been hugely unpopular with voters and has been blamed for some of Labour’s loss of support in the English local elections and theRuncorn and Helsby byelectionearlier this month. Keir Starmer did not deny that he was reconsidering the policy this week. Speaking while on a trip to Albania, Starmer said: “We took difficult decisions, but the right decisions, at the budget, including the decision that we took on winter fuel.” “We are now seeing the benefits of that in the interest rate cuts and the growth figures. They were difficult decisions but the right decisions.” Simon Francis, the coordinator of the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said that “any U-turn is welcome, but what matters now is the detail, especially if winter fuel payments are not restored to all pensioners. “We need to see the pension credit threshold raised significantly, a taper system introduced to stop people missing out on winter fuel payments for being just £1 over the line, and wider targeting of this support, including for those on non-means-tested disability benefits or carer’s allowance. Above all, ministers must learn lessons from this scandalous decision.” Nigel Farage’sReform UKparty, which won the Runcorn and Helsby byelection and 677 council seats this month, has pledged to reverse the cut. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion In the wake of the local election results, theLabourRed Wall group of about 45 MPs urged ministers to “act now” to win back voters in northern England and the Midlands. They said it was not “weak” to respond to issues raised by the public, including the winter fuel payment cut. The policy has also faced public criticism from senior Labour figuresincluding Eluned Morgan, the Welsh first minister. Morgan said last week that voters were “very frustrated” by the cut and that “it’s the number one issue that comes up on the doorstep” in Wales. Any change to the policy could be announced as soon as next month, with Reeves due to deliver a spending review on 11 June. Meanwhile, Starmer is facing the biggest rebellion of his premiership next month over separate cuts to disability benefits, with dozens of MPswarning last weekthat they were “impossible to support”.",

    "title": "Storms kill at least 25 across US including 18 in ‘mass casualty event’ in Kentucky",
    "article_text": "Storm systemssweepingacross the midwestern US have left more than 25 dead in Missouri and Kentucky. Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, said at a briefing in London, Kentucky, that “at least 18” of the deaths were in his state. At least nine of those were reported after a tornado sparked what authorities called a mass casualty event in south-eastern Kentucky. The storms were part of a weather system on Friday that killed seven people inMissouriand spawned more than two dozen tornadoes in Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana, left several hundred thousand customers without power in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heatwave to Texas. Authorities inKentuckysaid there were also severe injuries when a twister tore across Laurel county late on Friday. “The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,” the office of sheriff John Root said in a statement posted on social media. Gilbert Acciardo, a spokesperson for the sheriff’s office, said rescuers had “been on the ground all night looking for possible survivors. That’s what we’re continuing to do.” Beshear said his office would release more information as soon as it became available. “We know this is a tragic event,” he said in a statement. In Laurel county, the tornado hit shortly before midnight. “Lives have been changed forever here tonight. This is a time we come together, and we pray for this community,” Randall Weddle, the mayor of London, told WKYT-TV. “I have never personally witnessed what I’ve witnessed here tonight. There’s a lot of devastation.” The mayor of St Louis, Missouri, Cara Spencer,confirmedfive deaths in her city and said more than 5,000 homes had been affected. “This is truly, truly devastating,” she said, adding that the city was in the process of declaring an emergency and an overnight curfew on Friday had been put into place in the neighborhoods with the most damage. The number of people injured was not immediately known. The Barnes-Jewish hospital received 20 to 30 patients from the storm with some in serious condition and most expected to be discharged by Friday night, according to hospital spokesperson Laura High. The St Louis children’s hospital received 15 patients with two of them expected to remain in the hospital into the weekend, she said. National Weather Service (NWS) radar indicated a tornado touched down between 2.30pm and 2.50pm in Clayton,Missouri, in the St Louis area. The apparent tornado touched down in the area of Forest Park, home to the St Louis zoo and the site of the 1904 World’s Fair and Olympic Games the same year. At the Centennial Christian church, St Louis fire department battalion chief William Pollihan told the Associated Press that three people had had to be rescued after part of the church crumbled. One of those people died. Stacy Clark said his mother-in-law, Patricia Penelton, had died in the church. He described her as a very active church volunteer who had many roles, including being part of the choir. Jeffrey Simmons Sr, who lives across from the church, heard an alert on his phone before the lights went out. “And next thing you know, a lot of noise, heavy wind,” he said. He and his brother sheltered in the basement. Later, he realized it had been worse than he’d thought, saying: “Everything was tore up.” Downed trees and stoplights also caused traffic gridlock during the Friday afternoon commute, and officials urged people to stay home. John Randle, a 19-year-old University of Missouri-St Louis student, said he and his girlfriend had been at the St Louis art museum during the storm and were hustled into the basement with about 150 other people. “You could see the doors flying open, tree branches flying by and people running,” he said. “A lot of people were caught outside.” Christy Childs, a St Louis zoo spokesperson, said in a text that the zoo would remain closed on Saturday due to downed trees and other damage. Childs said all animals were safe and that there were no reports of significant injuries to staff, guests or animals. A tornado struck in Scott county, about 130 miles (209km) south of St Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying multiple homes, sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media.",

    "title": "One person dead and five injured after car explodes near IVF facility in Palm Springs",
    "article_text": "At least one person is dead after a car exploded near a reproductive facility in Palm Springs,California, on Saturday morning, according to local authorities. In a late statement, the FBI described the attacks as an “intentional act of terrorism”, adding that the clinic was deliberately targeted, while declining to elaborate on how authorities had reached a conclusion on a motive. The authorities have a person of interest in the investigation and are not searching for a suspect, Akil Davis, assistant director of the FBI’s Los Angeles field office, told reporters. The person killed was near the vehicle that had been blown to pieces outside the clinic, operated by American Reproductive Centers (ARC), Davis said. The bomb, which detonated before 11am, was either in or near a car parked outside the clinic when it exploded, said mayor Ron deHarte of Palm Springs. “Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,” Davis said. He did not comment on the relationship - if any - between the victim and the person of interest in the investigation. Aerial images of the damage to the facilityshowedthe burned-out remains of a vehicle in a parking lot behind the clinic. Despite damage to the building, ARC said the facility would be fully operational on Monday. The Desert Sun reported that the explosion could be felt as far as 2 miles (3km) away after it occurred by the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic. The US attorney Bill Essayli of the central district of California weighed in on the explosion,saying on X: “We are aware of the explosion that occurred this morning in Palm Springs. FBI is on scene and will be investigating whether this was an intentional act. We will release as much information as possible once we are able to confirm details.” Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the ARC facility, told the Associated Press in a phone interview that all of his staff were safe and accounted for. The explosion damaged the practice’s office space, where it conducts consultations with patients. The blast did not harm the in vitro fertilization (IVF) lab and all of the stored embryos. “I really have no clue what happened,” Abdallah said. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.” In a separate statement on Facebook, the ARCsaid: “We are heartbroken to learn that this event claimed a life and caused injuries, and our deepest condolences go out to the individuals and families affected … ARC will be fully operational on Monday morning, and our team is here to answer any concerns you may have. We appreciate the incredible support from our patients and local community, as well as the swift action of Palm Springs Police, Fire, and emergency responders.” Videopostedon X by one witness, the former Fox News correspondent Rick Leventhal, showed extensive damage outside the facility. Nima Tabrizi, 37, of Santa Monica, said he had been inside a cannabis dispensary nearby when he felt a massive explosion. “The building just shook, and we go outside and there’s massive cloud smoke,” Tabrizi said. “Crazy explosion. It felt like a bomb went off ... We went up to the scene, and we saw human remains.” California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, has also been briefed on the explosion,writingon X: “Jen [his wife] and I are keeping everyone affected in our hearts. The state is working closely with local and federal authorities as the investigation unfolds. Please avoid the area.” Palm Springs is a tony community in the desert about a two-hour drive east of Los Angeles, known for upmarket resorts and a history of celebrity residents.

    "title": "Trump to talk to Putin on Monday about Ukraine ceasefire proposal and trade",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpsaid that he will speak to bothVladimir PutinandVolodymyr Zelenskyyin an effort to stop what he called the “bloodbath” war inUkraineamid a barrage of new social media posts that included baseless conspiracy theories and a demand that Walmart not raise prices for customers because of tariffs he has imposed. Trump, posting on his Truth Social account on Saturday,wrotethat he will speak to Putin on Monday morning. “THE SUBJECTS OF THE CALL WILL BE, STOPPING THE ‘BLOODBATH’ THAT IS KILLING, ON AVERAGE, MORE THAN 5000 RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS A WEEK, AND TRADE,” Trump wrote, in his customary all-capitalized prose. The president has repeatedly cited a death toll for the conflict that ismuch higherthan any official figures, orestimates based on an open-source investigation, without explaining why. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov confirmed to a state-run Russian news agency that preparations were under way for a call between the US and Russian presidents. Trump’s call with the Russian president will be followed by a separate conversation with Zelenskyy, Ukraine’s leader, and Nato leaders as part of the US effort to end the war that has raged since the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. “HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump wrote. Russia and Ukraine have just concluded mostly fruitless talks, the first of their kind since the start of the war, in Istanbul. Ukraine said it was ready for a ceasefire but was faced by “unacceptable” demands from Russia, which attempted to fully invade its neighbor and has occupied the eastern flank of the country. It’s unclear what kind of progress Trump will be able to spur, if any, in the peace process. The US president has been heavily critical of Ukraine, freezing military aid and having an infamous argument with Zelenskyy at the White House in full view of the media, before appearing to soften after a face-to-face conversation at the funeral of Pope Francis in the Vatican. Trump had offered to travel to Turkey for the talks after his trip to the Middle East last week if Putin would also attend, and urged Zelenskyy to go, but Putin sent a team of low-level negotiators instead. Trump’s ire with Ukraine’s president does not seem to have abated, however, with the president telling Fox News on Friday he is upset with what the country has done with the aid handed to it by the US. “What bothered me, I hated to see the way it was, you know, excuse me, pissed away,” he said. “I think he’s the greatest salesman in the world. Far better than me,” Trump said of the Ukrainian president. “Where is all this money going?” Ina social media postof his own, Zelenskyy mourned the death of nine civilians in “a Russian drone strike on an ordinary passenger bus”. He added: “Yesterday, as on any other day of this war, there was an opportunity to cease fire. Ukraine has long been offering this – a full and unconditional ceasefire in order to save lives. Russia retains nothing but the ability to continue killing.” Sign up toFirst Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state,reported on social mediathat he had spoken to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, and told him that “the death and destruction must stop”. Rubio added on X, formerly Twitter, that the US “has presented a strong peace plan and we welcome the Prisoner of War exchange agreement reached in Istanbul. Let’s not miss this huge opportunity. The time for ending this war is now.” In a separate Truth Social post on Saturday, Trumpcomplainedabout the impact of tariffs he has imposed, after Walmart, among other retailers, warned it will have to raise prices for Americans in response. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,”Trump posted, adding that the company should “‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” A further post from Trump featured a video of an evidence-free conspiracy theory that not only implied that Bill and Hillary Clinton were guilty of murder but also that Seth Rich, a Democratic staffer, was the source of Clinton campaign emails released by WikiLeaks in 2016. (Special counsel Robert Muellerindicted12 Russian government hackers for hacking the email accounts of people close to Clinton in 2016 and delivering the hacked emails to WikiLeaks.)

    "title": "Seven men still on the run after New Orleans jailbreak",
    "article_text": "Seven men – including one convicted in four killings and others charged with murder – remained on the run after abreakoutat New Orleans’ jail that officials fear may have been enabled by help from within their own ranks. A total of 10 men participated in the brazen overnight escape by fleeing through a hole behind a toilet and scaling a wall while the lone stafferassigned to their cell pod was away getting food. Three of the escapees were captured within hours, according to officials, who on Saturday continued a frantic search overnight for those still on the loose. Surveillance footage, shared with media during a news conference, showed the escapees sprinting out of the facility – some wearing orange clothing and others in white. They scaled a fence, using blankets to avoid being cut by barbed wire, after which some could be seen sprinting across the nearby interstate and into a neighborhood. A photograph obtained by numerous news outlets, including the Guardian, showed the opening the men escaped through after a toilet in a cell had been removed. Above the hole were scrawled messages that included profanities: “To Easy LoL” with an arrow pointing at the gap, and “catch us when you can”. The absence of the 10 men, who also utilized facility deficiencies that officials have long complained about, went unnoticed for hours. It was not until a routine morning headcount, more than seven hours later, that law enforcement learned of the escape. Officials from the sheriff’s office say no deputy had been at the pod where the fugitives were being held. There was a technician – a civilian employee of the jail rather than one of the sheriff’s office’s sworn deputies – there to observe the pod, but she had stepped away to get food, they said. Soon after the escape, attempted murder suspect Kendall Myles, 20, was apprehended after a brief foot chase through the French Quarter. He had previously escaped twice from juvenile detention centers. By Friday evening, two more fugitives had been captured. Officials found battery suspect Robert Moody, 21, inNew Orleans’ Central City section thanks to a Crimestoppers tip, according to the Orleans parish sheriff’s office, which runs the jail. Dkenan Dennis, an armed robbery suspect, was found near an eastern New Orleans highway, the Louisiana attorney general, Liz Murrill, announced on the social media platform X. The Orleans parish sheriff, Susan Hutson, said the men were able to get out of the Orleans Justice Center because of “defective locks”. Hutson said she has continuously raised concerns about the locks to officials and, as recently as this week, advocated for money to fix the ailing infrastructure. Hutson said there are indications that people inside her department helped the fugitives escape. “It’s almost impossible, not completely, but almost impossible for anybody to get out of this facility without help,” she said of the jail, where 1,400 people are being held. The escapees yanked open a door to enter the cell with the hole at about 1am Friday. At least one of the steel bars protecting plumbing fixtures “appeared to have been intentionally cut using a tool”, according to a statement from the Orleans sheriff’s office on Friday night. The men shed their jail uniforms once out of the facility, and it is still unclear how some of them obtained regular clothing so quickly, officials said. Three sheriff’s employees have been placed on suspension pending the outcome of the investigation. It was not immediately clear whether any of the employees were suspected of helping with the escape. Officials also didn’t say whether the technician who left to get food was among the three suspended. The escapees range in age from 19 to 42. Most are in their 20s. One of the fugitives, 27-year-old Derrick Groves, was convicted on two charges of second-degree murder and two charges of attempted second-degree murder at a trial in October for his role in a deadly quadruple shooting on Fat Tuesday in 2018. He also pleaded guilty to two charges of manslaughter in connection with a double killing in 2017, and an unrelated charge of battery of a correctional facility employee filed against him in April 2024. Murder convictions in Louisiana carry mandatory life imprisonment. But Groves remained at New Orleans’ jail rather than at a state prison after his attorney was suspended from practicing law and there were post-conviction proceedings related to his double-murder trial pending against him. Law enforcement warned that Groves may attempt to locate witnesses in the murder trial. Two others – Jermaine Donald, 42, and Corey Boyd, 19 – had been jailed on charges of murder. Leo Tate, 31, had previously faced murder charges that were dismissed as part of a plea deal. Gary Price, 21, is charged with attempted murder. Hutson said the police department was actively working with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies to search for the fugitives. The sheriff said the jail she runs is about 60% staffed and thus staff are “stretched thin”. Hutson is facing re-election in October. And at least one of Hutson’s opponents, the former interim New Orleans police superintendent Michelle Woodfork, demanded she answer questions about the escape. The New Orleans district attorney Jason Williams appointed Woodfork to a position in his office last year and said Friday’s escapes represented “a complete failure of the most basic responsibilities entrusted to a sheriff or jail administrator”. According to Hutson, her agency had “indication” that those who escaped “received assistance … from individuals inside of our department”, USA Todayreported. Hutson added that a jail employee saw the men escape through surveillance footage but did not notify authorities. Photos shared by the Louisiana state police on Saturday morningshowedthe three escapees who were caught on Friday being flown out of New Orleans by helicopter to a state prison. “During the transfer, one of the inmates exhibited hostile behavior, requiring troopers to use a spit hood to ensure their safety,” the state police’s social media account said. In response, the Louisiana governor, Jeff Landry,wroteon social media: “Great work by Louisiana state police and assisting law enforcement agencies. The job is NOT finished!” The FBI hasoffereda reward of up to $5,000 for tips leading to the arrest of the escapees. Maya Yangandthe Associated Press contributed reporting",

    "title": "Newly released audio appears to confirm Biden’s memory lapses in 2023",
    "article_text": "A newly released recording appears to confirm thatJoe Bidensuffered some memory lapses while US president, struggling to recall the year his son died or when Donald Trump was first elected. While being interviewed by a special counsel over his handling of classified records, the audio shows Biden’s responses are marked by long pauses, a faint whispered voice and confusion over key dates, such as when his son Beau died (2015) or when Trump won his first presidency (2016). The audio, obtainedby Axiosthrough an undisclosed source and then released by the outlet, includes attempts by Biden’s staff to remind or correct him on details during his interviews in October 2023 with Robert Hur, a special counsel at the Department of Justice. Hur, who investigated Biden’s handling of classified material, subsequently described the then president as a “sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory” in his final report, which recommended against charging Biden with any sort of crime. Awritten transcript of the five-hour interview was released last year. But the newly released audio provides some context for Biden’s struggle to recall certain facts. At the time, White House officials strongly denied that Biden was impaired in his ability to do his job as president, with allies continuing to back Biden until a disastrous debate with Trump in June 2024 resulted in mounting pressure for him to step aside as the Democratic candidate. He did so in favor of his vice-president, Kamala Harris, a month later. Polling at the time showed that many Americans considered Biden, at the time 81 years old, to be too old to run again as president. Though he had beaten Trump in 2020, Biden’s decision to try to run against him again, with Trump just three years younger than him, has come under intensifying scrutiny. At the release of Hur’s report, Biden and his allies reacted angrily to its claims. “There’s even a reference that I don’t remember when my son died,” Biden said last year. “How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn’t any of their damn business.” The audio also includes Biden talking about how Barack Obama – whom he served as vice-president – didn’t want him to run for the White House in 2016 due to the belief that Hillary Clinton “had a better shot of winning the presidency than I did”. There were also deviations to ponder the influence of the Gutenberg printing press and the experience of driving a Corvette with the comedian Jay Leno. Trump repeatedly mocked Biden’s age and gaffes before going on to defeat Harris in last year’s election. However, the current president has also had lapses of his own, appearing to confuse E Jean Carroll, who accused him of sexual abuse and was awarded damages, with his ex-wife Marla Maples when shown a photograph during a deposition. He also claimed that the audience “went crazy” during his televised debate with Harris last year (there was no audience whatsoever in the room). Trump has also continued his habit of delivering discursive speeches littered with multiple untruths and gross exaggerations while president and has even been accused of falling asleep during events, although the White House has denied these claims. On Friday, Trump further raised eyebrows when he referenced the most notorious racial epithet when discussing the recent ceasefire between India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed countries, with Fox News. “It was getting deeper and more, I mean, more missiles,” Trump said. “Everyone was stronger, stronger, to a point where the next ones are going to be you know what: the N-word.” “You know what the N-word is, right?” he asked host Brett Baier, who replied: “nuclear”. Trump said “yeah”, and both men laughed over the exchange.",

    "article_text": "At least one person has been killed after an explosion near a reproductive health facility in Palm Springs, California, the city’s mayor said. Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills said the blast on Friday “appears to be an intentional act of violence” and that several buildings were damaged, some severely. “There has been one fatality, the person’s identity is not known,” Mills’ statement said. The city’s mayor, Ron deHarte, said a bomb was either in or near a car parked outside of the clinic when it exploded, the Reuters news agency reported. Palm Springs Fire Chief Paul Alvarado said no suspect had been identified. Authorities said the blast occurred on Saturday around 11am local time (18:00 GMT) near North Indian Canyon Drive and East Tachevah Drive. Police urged residents to avoid the area as fire crews and investigators secured the scene. Federal agents from the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were dispatched to support the local investigation, which remains in its early stages. The blast damaged the American Reproductive Centers facility, a fertility clinic run by Dr Maher Abdallah. He told The Associated Press that, while his office space suffered damage, the in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) lab and its stored embryos were untouched. “I really have no clue what happened,” Abdallah said. “Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.” He added that all his staff were safe and accounted for. Nearby resident Nima Tabrizi, 37, from Santa Monica, said he was inside a cannabis dispensary when he felt the building shake. “The building just shook, and we go outside and there’s a massive cloud smoke,” Tabrizi said. “Crazy explosion. It felt like a bomb went off … We went up to the scene, and we saw human remains.” Palm Springs, a wealthy desert city known for its luxury resorts and celebrity history, is located about 100 miles (161km) east of Los Angeles.",

    "title": "‘Fight back’: Pedro Pascal urges Cannes to resist US political pressure",
    "article_text": "Chilean-American actor Pedro Pascal has called on members of the film industry to “fight back” and keep expressing themselves amid what he appeared to describe as a political climate of fear in the United States. “F*** the people that try to make you scared. And fight back. This is the perfect way to do so in telling stories. Don’t let them win,” said 50-year-old Pascal, who was at the Cannes film festival for the premiere of “Eddington”. “Fear is the way that they win, for one. And so keep telling the stories and keep expressing yourself and keep fighting to be who you are,” he said. “Eddington” stars Pascal as a small-town mayor campaigning against a down-on-his-luck sheriff played by Joaquin Phoenix in a New Mexico town where tensions are simmering over COVID-19 mask policies and the Black Lives Matter protests. Pascal, known for his role in dystopian video-game adaptation “The Last of Us”, added that it was “far too intimidating” for him to address a question about US President Donald Trump’s immigration policy. “It’s very scary for an actor participating in a movie to sort of speak to issues like this,” he said. “I’m an immigrant. My parents are refugees from Chile. We fled a dictatorship, and I was privileged enough to grow up in the US after asylum in Denmark … I stand by those protections,” the 50-year-old told a news conference in Cannes. Trump has launched a crackdown on irregular immigration and has also detained and moved to deport a number oflegal permanent US residents, his policies triggering a rash of lawsuits and protests. Trump has made himself one of the main talking points in Cannes this week after announcing on May 5 that he wanted 100 percent tariffs on movies “produced in foreign lands“. Acting legend Robert de Niro, who accepted a Cannes lifetime achievement award on Tuesday, also urged an audience of A-list directors and actors to resist “America’s philistine president”.",

    "article_text": "Syrian security forces have killed threeISIL (ISIS)fighters and arrested four others in Aleppo, authorities said, the first time the interim government has announced such an operation against the group in Syria’s second city. The raids, launched by the General Security Department in coordination with the General Intelligence Service, targeted multiple ISIL sleeper cells operating across Aleppo, Syria’s Ministry of Interior said in a statement on Saturday. One security officer was killed in the operation, it said. Forces stormed the site and seized “explosive devices, an explosive vest and a number of General Security force uniforms”, the statement added. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the operation took place in Aleppo’s Haidariya district and that clashes also broke out in another neighbourhood. Interim Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who assumed power in Damascus in December, has long opposed ISIL. His forces battled the group’s self-declared caliphate during the Syrian war. US President Donald Trump met al-Sharaa this week in Saudi Arabia and described him as an “attractive guy with a very strong past”. Following the meeting, Washingtonannouncedthat it would lift sanctions on Syria – a major policy shift and boost for al-Sharaa’s transitional government. Al-Sharaa seized power in Damascus in December after his forces toppled Bashar al-Assad in a lightning offensive. Al-Sharaa cut ties with al-Qaeda in 2016. The recent operation comes just months after Syrian authorities said they had foiled an ISIL bombing plot near the Sayeda Zeinab shrine, a key pilgrimage site for Shia Muslims south of Damascus.",

    "title": "FA Cup Final 2025: Crystal Palace defeat Man City in major upset",
    "article_text": "Crystal Palace’s Eberechi Eze sparked a massive south London party by scoring the only goal towin the FA Cup 1-0 against Manchester Cityand claim the club’s first major trophy in their history. Local man Eze volleyed in after 16 minutes, former Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson performed heroics in the Palace goal, and City contrived to waste a sack-load of chances, including a penalty, in an enthralling final on Saturday. After England forward Eze, whose goals in the last eight and semis fired his team into the final for the third time, scored completely against the run of play, Palace had to survive a City siege to spark wild celebrations. Omar Marmoush had a first-half penalty saved by Henderson as City lost in the Cup final for a second successive season, summing up a harrowing campaign in which they have been dethroned as the powerhouse of English football and will go without a domestic trophy for the first time since 2016-17. For Palace’s massed ranks decked in purple and blue, it was a day of unbridled joy as Oliver Glasner’s team rode their luck to make it third time lucky after suffering defeats in their previous two FA Cup final appearances in 1990 and 2016. Glasner, who took charge of the club 15 months ago, becomes the first Austrian coach to win the FA Cup. City have been a pale imitation of the side that has dominated the English game for most of the past decade. But the way they began at Wembley suggested that Pep Guardiola’s side were determined to prove that talk of their demise had been greatly exaggerated. Having picked an ultra-attacking lineup shorn of defensive midfielders, City hemmed Palace deep inside their own half for the opening 15 minutes with Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings on what was his last Wembley appearance in City’s colours. His lofted ball picked out Erling Haaland, whose stretching effort at the far post was brilliantly saved by Henderson, who also shortly afterwards beat out Josko Gvardiol’s header. Palace finally broke the siege, and in their first foray beyond the centre circle, they ripped through City’s lines. Jean-Philippe Mateta played in Daniel Munoz, and his cross was met by Eze, who flashed a first-time volley past Stefan Ortega to provoke an eruption of noise from the Palace fans. Ismaila Sarr nearly made it 2-0, but Ortega saved, and Palace’s hearts were in their mouths when Henderson appeared to have handled the ball outside his area under pressure from Haaland, but a subsequent VAR check spared him a possible red card. There was no escape for Palace defender Tyrick Mitchell when he tripped Bernardo Silva, and referee Stuart Attwell pointed to the spot. Surprisingly, Haaland did not take it and instead Omar Marmoush stepped forward for his first penalty since joining City in January, but his effort lacked conviction and Henderson dived to his right to save. Henderson made a flying save to keep out Jeremy Doku’s curling effort as Palace reached half-time ahead despite having only 19 percent of possession. Munoz thought he had made it 2-0 just past the hour mark, but a lengthy VAR check ruled his effort out for offside. Seven-time winners City went close numerous times after the break, with Henderson and his defenders performing heroics to preserve Palace’s lead. A huge groan went up from the Palace fans as 10 minutes of stoppage time, but after more close shaves and nail-biting, the final whistle sounded and the club’s anthem Glad All Over bellowed around the stadium.",

    "title": "Hamas says new Gaza truce talks under way as Israel expands ground assault",
    "article_text": "Israel and Hamas have confirmed a new round of Gaza truce talks is under way in Qatar as the Israeli military expanded its ground offensive on the besieged Palestinian territory, despite growinginternational callsfor a ceasefire. Israel Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Saturday that the Hamas delegation in Doha returned to negotiations “on a hostage deal”. Israel had entered the talks without any conditions, according to Katz. Taher al-Nono, the media adviser for the Hamas leadership, confirmed to the Reuters news agency that a new round of indirect talks had begun without any conditions. “The Hamas delegation outlined the position of the group and the necessity to end the war, swap prisoners, the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and allowing humanitarian aid and all the needs of the people of Gaza back into the Strip,” he added. Medical sources told Al Jazeera that at least 70 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, as Israel launched a new offensive in Gaza. Israel’s army said on social media that it was intensifying attacks and exerting “tremendous pressure” on Hamas across Gaza, and wouldn’t stop until the captives are returned and the armed group is dismantled. Katz said that Operation Gideon Chariots was being led with “great force.” The new offensive comes after Israel escalated its air attacks on Gaza,killing hundreds of Palestinians in the past three days. Many of the victims were killed in northern Gaza, including in Beit Lahiya and Jabalia, which have received forced displacement orders by the Israeli army in recent days. As leaders of the Arab Leagueheld a Gaza-focused summitin Iraq’s Baghdad and called for international funding to rebuild Gaza on Saturday, Hamas urged the international community to impose sanctions on Israel. In a statement on its Telegram channel, the armed group described the situation in Gaza as a “full-blown genocide committed before the eyes of a world that stands helpless, while more than two and a half million people are being slaughtered in the besieged Strip”. The group also reported continued fighting with invading Israeli forces, claiming on Saturday that its fighters killed and wounded two Israeli soldiers using machineguns in the Shujayea neighbourhood of Gaza City in the northern part of the enclave. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres said he was “alarmed” by Israel’s expanded offensive in Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire. UN relief chief Tom Fletcher said a joint plan by the United States and Israel to replace international aid mechanisms in Gaza was a “waste of time” as more than 160,000 pallets of aid are “ready to move” at the border, but blocked by Israel. Germany voiced alarm over Israel’s expanded assault in Gaza, saying it was a “cause for deep concern.” “A large-scale military offensive also entails the risk that the catastrophic humanitarian situation for the population in Gaza and the situation of the remaining hostages will continue to deteriorate and that the prospect of an urgently needed long-term ceasefire fades,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.",

    "title": "At least 21 dead after storms hit US states of Missouri and Kentucky",
    "article_text": "At least 21 people have died after tornadoes caused by severe storms swept through the states of Missouri and Kentucky in the United States, officials said. Kentucky governor Andy Beshear on Saturday said on X that at least 14 people died in Friday night’s storms. At least seven others were killed in Missouri as authorities launched a search for people trapped in buildings. Kentucky authorities said there were severe injuries when a tornado tore across Laurel County late on Friday. “The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,” the office of Sheriff John Root said in a statement posted on social media. In Missouri, St Louis Mayor Cara Spencer confirmed five deaths in her city and said more than 5,000 homes were affected. “Our city is in mourning tonight,” she told reporters. “The loss of life and destruction is truly, truly horrific.” Another tornado struck Scott County, about 209km (130 miles) south of St Louis, killing two people, injuring several others and destroying multiple homes, Sheriff Derick Wheetley wrote on social media on Friday. “Our first responders acted swiftly, even while the tornado was still active, putting themselves in harm’s way to provide immediate assistance and care to those injured,” he said. The storms are part of a severe weather system that has also spawned tornadoes in Wisconsin, leaving thousands of people without power in the Great Lakes region and bringing a punishing heatwave to Texas. A dust storm warning was issued around the Chicago area on Friday night. The weather service said a wall of dust extended along a 161km (100-mile) line from southwest of Chicago to northern Indiana that severely reduced visibility. In Texas, a heat advisory was issued for San Antonio and Austin cities, with temperatures at a blistering 95F (35C) to 105F (40.5C). Parts of the southern East Coast, from Virginia to Florida, also battled with heat in the 90s (32-37C). The National Weather Service Office for Austin and San Antonio said humidity over the weekend was expected to make temperatures feel hotter. “There are concerns of heat exhaustion for people that aren’t taking proper precautions when they’re outdoors,” meteorologist Jason Runyen said, advising those affected to take breaks and stay hydrated.",

    "title": "Iran’s leaders slam Trump for ‘disgraceful’ remarks during Middle East tour",
    "article_text": "Tehran, Iran –Iran’s political and military leaders are pointing the finger back at Donald Trump after the United States president sharpened his rhetoric during his first major tour of the Middle East. In a speech to a group of teachers gathered for a state ceremony in Tehran on Saturday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said some of Trump’s comments were not even worth responding to. “The level of those remarks is so low that they are a disgrace for the one who uttered them and a disgrace to the American nation,” he said, to chants of “Death to America” and others from the crowd. Khamenei added that Trump “lied” when he said he wants to use power towards peace, as Washington has backed “massacring” Palestinians and others across the region. He called Israel a “dangerous cancerous tumour” that must be “uprooted”. Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also told a gathering of navy officers on Saturday that Trump is extending a message of peace while threatening destruction at the same time as backing Israel’s“genocide” in the Gaza Strip. “Which one of this president’s words should we believe? His message of peace, or his message of massacre of human beings?” the Iranian president said, pointing out that Trump sanctioned the International Criminal Court (ICC) in a move that wasinternationally criticised. The statements came after Trump used his Middle East tour – during which hesigned huge dealswith Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates – to heap praise on Arab leaders neighbouring Iran and blasting the leadership in Tehran. The US president told Arab leaders they were developing their infrastructure while Iran’s “landmarks are collapsing into rubble” after its theocratic establishment replaced a monarchy in a 1979 revolution. He said Iran’s leaders have “managed to turn green farmland into dry deserts” as a result of corruption and mismanagement, and pointed out that Iranians are experiencing power outages several hours a day. The blackouts, a result of ayears-long energy crisisthat is hurting Iran’s already strained economy, are expected to linger for the rest of this year as well, according to Iranian authorities. The largest associations of the mining, steel and cement industries in Iran on Saturday wrote a joint letter to Pezeshkian, urgently requesting him to review a 90 percent electricity use restriction imposed on the critical sectors. Trump, who hailed Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa andlifted sanctions on Damascus, also took aim at Iran’s regional policy. He described Tehran’s support for the fallen establishment of President Bashar al-Assad as a cause of “misery and death” and regional destabilisation. Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the US president’s remarks as “deceptive”, telling state media on Friday it was the US that hampered Iran through sanctions and military threats while backing Israel and attacking Syria. Parliament chief Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, who was addressing an Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference in Indonesia, said Trump’s remarks showed he was “living in a delusion”. Hossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), addressed Trump directly on Friday and said even though Iran has beautiful landmarks, “we take pride in the elevation of character, identity, culture, and Islam”. The sharp rhetoric in response to Trump’s latest controversial comments come days after he teased that he may start calling the“Persian Gulf”the “Arabian Gulf” soon. This angered Iranians across the board, prompting criticism of any attempt to rename the key waterway from average citizens online, authorities, local media, and even some pro-Trump Iranians outside the country who have been advocating for US sanctions and regime change. Both Iran and the US say they would prefer an agreement that would serve to quickly de-escalate tensions surrounding Iran’s nuclear programme, despite the latest war of words. But afterfour rounds of negotiationsmediated by Oman, any prospective deal – which would lift sanctions in exchange for making sure Iran would not have a nuclear bomb – still appears to face significant hurdles. Trump said Tehran has been handed a proposal torapidly advance towards a deal, but Iran’s Araghchi on Friday said no written proposal was produced yet amid “confusing and contradictory” rhetoric from Washington. “Mark my words: there is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to enrichment for peaceful purposes: a right afforded to all other NPT signatories, too,” he wrote in a post on X, in reference to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Kazem Gharibabadi, a senior nuclear negotiator, on Friday rejected reports by Western media outlets that Iran may agree to fully halt its enrichment of uranium for the remainder of the Trump presidency to build trust. “The right to enrich is our absolute red line! No halt to enrichment is acceptable.” Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from a landmark nuclear accord signed between Iran and world powers three years earlier, imposing the harshest sanctions yet by the USthat have only intensifiedduring the latest negotiations. The nuclear deal set a 3.67 percent enrichment rate with first-generation centrifuges for civilian use in Iran, in exchange for lifting United Nations sanctions. Iran is now enriching up to 60 percent and has enough fissile material for multiple bombs, but has made no effort to build one yet.",

    "title": "Seven European nations urge Israel to ‘reverse its current policy’ on Gaza",
    "article_text": "A group of seven European nations has called for an end to Israel’smilitary assault and blockadeof Gaza, as the United Nations aid chief says time should not be wasted on an alternative United States-backed proposal to deliver aid to the Palestinian territory. In a joint statement late on Friday, the leaders of Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia, Spain and Norway said they “will not be silent in front of the man-made humanitarian catastrophe that is taking place before our eyes in Gaza” as Israel’s blockade has prevented the delivery of humanitarian aid for two and a half months. “We call upon the government of Israel to immediately reverse its current policy, refrain from further military operations and fully lift the blockade, ensuring safe, rapid and unimpeded humanitarian aid to be distributed throughout the Gaza strip by international humanitarian actors,” the statement read. “More than 50,000 men, women, and children have lost their lives. Many more could starve to death in the coming days and weeks unless immediate action is taken,” it said. Meanwhile, the Council of Europe, a body that works to safeguard human rights and democracy, also noted that Gaza was suffering from a“deliberate starvation”and warned that Israel was sowing “the seeds for the next Hamas” in the territory, referring to the Palestinian armed group. “The time for a moral reckoning over the treatment of Palestinians has come – and it is long overdue,” said Dora Bakoyannis, rapporteur for the Middle East at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. The European calls came hours after UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said 160,000 pallets of relief and 9,000 trucks were ready to enter Gaza. “To those proposing an alternative modality for aid distribution, let’s not waste time. We already have a plan,” he said in a statement. “We have the people. We have the distribution networks. We have the trust of the communities on the ground. And we have the aid itself – 160,000 pallets of it – ready to move. Now,” he said. “We demand rapid, safe, and unimpeded aid delivery for civilians in need. Let us work.” Israel has halted the entry of food, medication and all other essentials into Gaza since March 2. UN agencies and other humanitarian groups have warned of shrinking food, fuel and medicine supplies to the territory of 2.4 million Palestinians facing acute starvation. Earlier, the US and Israel said they were preparing a plan that would allow the resumption of aid by an NGO, while keeping supplies out of Hamas’s hands. Under the heavily criticised alternative aid plan, the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation aims to start work in Gaza by the end of May. It intends to work with private US security and logistics firms to transport aid into Gaza to so-called secure hubs where it will then be distributed by aid groups, a source familiar with the plan told the Reuters news agency. It is unclear how the foundation will be funded. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation has also asked Israel to allow humanitarian deliveries by the UN and aid groups to resume now until its infrastructure is fully operational, saying this is essential to “alleviate the ongoing humanitarian pressure”. The UN, however, said it would not work with the foundation because the distribution plan is not impartial, neutral or independent. Israel says the blockade, alongside “military pressure”, is intended to force Hamas to free the remaining captives. On Thursday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim reiterated the group’s position that the entry of aid into Gaza is a prerequisite for any truce talks with Israel. “Access to food, water and medicine is a fundamental human right – not a subject for negotiation,” he said.",

    "title": "Poland presidential election 2025: Polls, results, contenders",
    "article_text": "Poland will hold the first round of voting in its presidential election on Sunday. This is a hotly contested race betweentwo main candidates– one from Civic Platform, the lead party in the ruling Civic Coalition, and the other an independent backed by the main opposition party, Law and Justice (PiS). While much of the power rests with the prime minister and parliament in Poland, the president is able to veto legislation and has influence over military and foreign policy decisions. The current president, Andrzej Duda, who is from PiS, has used his veto to block reforms to the justice system that the government has been trying to enact for some time. Furthermore, reports of foreign election interference have recently spooked voters who are primarily concerned with issues such as the Russia-Ukraine war, immigration, abortion rights and the economy. Here is all we know about the upcoming vote: Polish citizens aged 18 or older can vote. There are about 29 million eligible voters. On Sunday, they will select a single candidate from a list of registered presidential candidates. If a candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote, they win the election. If all candidates fall short of the 50 percent threshold, the country will vote in a second round for the two top contenders from the first round on June 1. The winner of that contest will become president. The election is expected to go to a second round. Presidents may serve a maximum of two five-year terms in Poland. The current president reaches the end of his second term on August 6. On May 18, polls will open at 7am (05:00 GMT) and close at 9pm (19:00 GMT). In 2023, current Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s Civic Coalition ascended to power, ending eight years of rule by the PiS party’s government. While Tusk promised to reverse unpopular judicial reforms enacted by PiS, President Andrzej Duda, a former nationalist ally of the party, has hampered Tusk’s efforts by using his presidential power to veto legislation. Key issues dominating this election include the Russia-Ukraine war. When the war first broke out in February 2022, Poland threw its full support behind Ukraine, welcoming more than one million Ukrainian refugees who crossed the border without documents. On May 10, Tusk, alongside other European leaders, visited Kyiv and gave Russian President Vladimir Putin anultimatumto enact an unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine. However, relations between Poland and Ukraine havegrown tense. Earlier this year,Polish farmersled protests, arguing the market had been flooded with cheap agricultural products from Ukraine. There are also emerging reports of Ukrainian refugees facing discrimination in Poland, as well as resentment about welfare provided to them. There have been growing fears of a spillover of Russian aggression to Poland due to its proximity to Ukraine. On May 12, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Warsawsaidan investigation had revealed that Moscow’s intelligence agencies had orchestrated a massive fire at a shopping centre in Warsaw in May 2024. Several candidates for the presidential election have proposed raising the defence budget to 5 percent of GDP. Poles also have economic concerns about taxes, housing costs and the state of public transport. Abortion is a key issue in Poland. Poland has some of thestrictest abortion lawsin Europe. Women are only allowed to have abortions in cases of rape or incest or if their life or health are at risk. In August 2024, Tusk acknowledged that he did not have enough backing from parliament to deliver on one of his key campaign promises and change the abortion law. Opinion is also split on whether LGBTQ rights should be restricted or expanded in the country. The country is also divided over how involved it should be with the European Union (EU), with the PiS taking the stance that the country would be better off forming an alliance with the United States than the EU. A total of 13 candidates are vying for the presidency. The top four candidates are: Trzaskowski, 53, has been the liberal mayor of Warsaw since 2018 and is an ally of Tusk, affiliated with the PM’s political alliance, Civic Coalition. He is also a senior member of the Civic Platform party (PO), which heads the Civic Coalition. Trzaskowski was narrowly defeated by Duda in the 2020 presidential election. During his time as mayor, he was lauded for investing in Warsaw’s infrastructure and culture. He proposes to increase defence spending to 5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and to develop Poland’s arms and technology industry. Trzaskowski has liberal views. He is pro-Europe and one of his campaign promises includes strengthening Poland’s position in the EU. Another one of his pledges is to relax abortion laws, however, he has been quiet on this issue during the run-up to the presidential election. He has also been supportive of the LGBTQ community and has attended pride parades. This could alienate some more conservative voters who live outside urban centres. For this reason, right-wing voters may vote against him in the second round of voting. Trzaskowski could also lose support from centrist and progressive voters, who are frustrated by Tusk’s inability to bring reform to abortion laws. Nawrocki, 42, is a conservative historian standing as an independent candidate backed by the PiS party. His academic work has been centred around anti-communist resistance. He currently administers the Institute of National Remembrance, where his removal of Soviet memorials has angered Russia. He administered the Museum of the Second World War in northern Poland from 2017 to 2021. His campaign promises include lowering taxes and pulling Poland out of the EU’s Migration Pact and Green Deal. He also wishes to allocate 5 percent of GDP to defence. Nawrocki is critical of giving more rights to LGBTQ couples. Nawrocki has had a fair share of controversies in the past. In 2018, he published a book about a notorious gangster under the pseudonym “Tadeusz Batyr”. In public comments, Nawrocki and Batyr praised each other, without revealing they were the same person. Mentzen, 38, is a far-right entrepreneur who leads the New Hope party, a member of the Confederation coalition. He has degrees in economics and physics; owns a brewery in Torun; runs a tax advisory firm; and is critical of government regulation, wishing for significant tax cuts. Mentzen has used social media platforms to connect with younger voters. He believes that Poland should not take sides in the Russia-Ukraine war. He wants to ensure the Polish constitution overrides EU laws and wishes to withdraw from the EU Green Deal. He opposes LGBTQ rights and opposes abortion, even in cases of rape. Ahead of the 2019 election for the European Parliament, he said: “We don’t want Jews, homosexuals, abortion, taxes or the European Union.” Since then, he has tried to distance himself from this statement. While Poland offers free higher education, Mentzen dropped in opinion polls after he advocated for tuition fees in state schools in late March. Holownia, 48, is a former journalist and television personality-turned-politician. He is the speaker, or marshal, of the lower house of parliament, the Sejm. In 2020, he founded a centrist movement called Polska 2050, which burgeoned into a party and ended up joining Tusk’s coalition. Holownia wishes to promote regional development alongside better access to affordable housing and improving the public transport system. He says he wants to reduce bureaucracy, support Polish businesses and develop Poland’s domestic arms production capabilities. Threeleftist candidatesare also running the election including Deputy Senate Speaker Magdalena Biejat, 43, an advocate for women’s rights, minority rights, affordable housing and abortion access; Adrian Zandberg, 45, who has made similar promises to Biejat; and academic and lawmaker Joanna Senyszyn, a former member of the Polish United Workers’ Party. Other candidates include far-right Grzegorz Braun, who was pilloried globally for using a fire extinguisher to put out Hanukkah candles in parliament in 2023, and journalist and YouTuber Krzysztof Stanowski, 42, who does not have a political programme and wants to show Poles behind the scenes of the campaign while raising money for charity. As of May 12, Trzaskowski was in the lead with the support of 31 percent of voters, according to Politico’s polling aggregate. Nawrocki was in second place with 25 percent, while Mentzen had 13 percent and Holownia had 7 percent. As soon as polls close, Ipsos will release an exit poll based on surveys undertaken at 500 randomly selected polling stations. While this is not the official result, it is expected to be highly indicative of which way the vote is going. Partial results may start to emerge on Sunday night or Monday. In Poland, voting always takes place on a Sunday. In 2020, the official results for the first round of voting were confirmed on Tuesday morning. On Wednesday, Poland said it had uncovered a possible election interference attempt via advertisements on Facebook. “The NASK Disinformation Analysis Center has identified political ads on the Facebook platform that may be financed from abroad. The materials were displayed in Poland,” according to a statement by NASK, which is Poland’s national research institute dealing with cybersecurity. “The advertising accounts involved in the campaign spent more on political materials in the last seven days than any election committee.” The NASK statement did not specify which countries’ financial backers of the campaign were believed to be based in. Fears of Russian election interference are high in Europe after Romania declared a do-over of its Novemberpresidential electionafter reports emerged of alleged Russian election interference. The first round of the repeat election took place on May 4, with the second round due to happen on May 18. This was after far-right politicianCalin Georgescu,who was polling in single digits during the campaign, surprisingly emerged victorious.",

    "title": "Everton vs Southampton: Goodison Park stages final Premier League match",
    "article_text": "Liverpool, England –“I love it when it gets like this,” exclaimed the man beside me as he rubbed his hands with glee. It was the Halloween of 2009 and in the gloom of an early winter’s afternoon, Goodison Park was at its best. Everton were playing Aston Villa in a league match, which was becoming increasingly bad-tempered. Two late red cards, an appalling referee and the floodlights taking full effect. It was the perfect recipe for a big bowl of Goodison fury. The game finished as an unmemorable 1-1 draw, but the sheer delight of the man in the neighbouring seat long stayed with me. His excitement was a reminder to relish those rare occasions when the entire audience at this glorious theatre of football are united in emotion. And nowhere does emotion quite like Goodison Park. Fury, relief, joy and despair – and that’s just a two-nil defeat to Norwich in the League Cup fourth round. Fans sitting in this footballing relic have felt it all throughout the stadium’s long and illustrious history. If they gave out Ballon d’Ors for booing, Everton would need a separate stadium just to house the trophy cabinet. But on Sunday, there will be new emotions to add to the list – because everything is about to change. A 133-year chapter in the story of Everton is about to end, as Goodison Park hosts the men’s team for the final time. “Goodison has just always been there, there’s not an Evertonian alive that has watched Everton anywhere else,” said Matt Jones, host of the Blue Room podcast. Like thousands of fellow fans, he will spend the weekend grappling with various emotions. “I feel a bit like a dad watching his daughter get married at a wedding and everything’s starting to make him cry. As you get closer and closer to the day, you get more and more emotional,” Jones told Al Jazeera Sport. At its most basic level, Sunday’s fixture against Southampton is game number 2,791 for the Everton men’s senior team at Goodison. But for Evertonians, it represents so much more. A small part of our identity is about to be lost. I’ve grown from a boy to a man in various seats in every stand of that grand old stadium, learning every swear word there is to know along the way. The highs and lows of the last 30 years have been intertwined with trips there, with the ground somehow able to block out everyday life for 90 precious minutes. Much like the inability to get a phone signal inside, you leave your troubles at the turnstile. I’ve taken various partners to Goodison (one said that she had “never seen rage quite like it”), with most of those relationships ending in the same sort of heartbreak as an Everton cup run. But I’ve always felt privileged to sit inside a real-life museum of football. Surrounded by history, tradition and furious middle-aged men abusing anything that moves. The next page of the Everton story will see the men’s team relocate to a 53,000-capacity stadium at Bramley Moore Dock. The impressive structure sits on the banks of the river Mersey and, for the sake of sponsorship, will be called the Hill Dickinson Stadium. Life in such a shiny, modern arena will be a huge adjustment for one of the oldest teams in English football. “It’s that feeling of leaving your family home. It’s the only way I can describe it,” said Merseyside-based sports reporter Giulia Bould. “You know you’re going to a house with a load of mod cons and you know your life’s going to be so much easier in this new house, but you’ve got to leave your family home. It’s weird,” she added. This season has been filled with finals for Everton, although sadly not the ones that are played at Wembley with a trophy on the line. Instead, each fixture at Goodison has ticked another final occasion off the list. From the final cup game to the final night match, even the final Saturday 3pm kickoff has had a shoutout. But on Sunday, it really will be the finale – although only for the men’s team. Just days before what was due to be the final ever Goodison game, Everton announced that the old stadium would be granted a stay of execution. The bulldozers won’t move in – instead the women’s team will. “I think it’s perfect,” said Bould as she reflects on the decision from Everton’s American owners to pass Goodison over to the women’s team. “Under the previous owner, the women’s side has long been ignored and run into the ground really, it’s been pretty much treated as second rate. But now it has been put on a level where it should be, setting the precedent for everyone else,” Bould told Al Jazeera Sport. Goodison Park is no stranger to setting a precedent. It was the first purpose-built football stadium in England and the first to install dugouts and undersoil heating. The Toffees’ long run without relegation means it’s hosted more English top-flight football games than anywhere else. Goodison was also the venue for an FA Cup Final and a World Cup semifinal, with Pele and Eusebio both also scoring there during the 1966 tournament. Even North Korea has graced the Goodison turf. The storied history of Everton’s home has caught the imagination of some of the greats of the modern game. Jose Mourinho called the place “the history of English football”, while Arsene Wenger described it as “one of the noisiest” stadium’s he’s managed in. Sir Alex Ferguson once spared former Evertonian Wayne Rooney from an afternoon at Goodison with Manchester United, purely because of the abuse he would receive. Visiting Goodison Park today feels vastly removed from the riches of modern English football. To put it bluntly, the stadium is no longer fit for purpose. But that is what makes it magical. “It is the closest you can get to travelling through time to watch football,” said photographer and Evertonian Gary Lambert. That time travel begins before you even set foot in the stadium. “Physically, Goodison is an imposing place. It appears out of nowhere between the rows of terraced houses,” said Lambert. Once inside, the stadium’s history unravels through the various sights and sounds. Obstructed views are common, with posts and pillars causing many a strained neck. And the unique Archibald Leitch criss-cross design runs down the middle of the ancient Bullens Road stand. “Goodison Park is the bluest place on earth. The brickwork on three-quarters of the ground is painted a vivid shade of royal blue. “It doesn’t matter what tweaked blue hue the latest kit manufacturer might tone the latest home shirt, it’s that blue outside which is Everton’s blue,” Lambert told Al Jazeera Sport. But there is one particular quirk that stands out above them all and it happens whenever Everton go on the attack. “There are still so many old-fashioned wooden seats, so the seats bang and click as everyone moves to stand up,” said Bould. The chorus of wooden clangs is something she will miss when Everton move away from their historical home. “That clicking noise, you don’t hear that anywhere. That, for me, is Goodison.” Like all Everton fans, I’ll miss the matchday routines around Goodison. Parking near the snooker hall, a pre-match pint in Crofts Social Club, the endless queues for the loo. I might even miss the lack of legroom. It’s troubling to comprehend life after Goodison for Everton’s men. The two are so connected and so well-suited. Everton is Goodison and Goodison is Everton. A divorce after 133 years was always going to hurt. But change is needed for a club still clinging to former glories. Everton’s new ground could be the chance for a new start. The Hill Dickinson Stadium doesn’t suit us, but it represents the new world of football, where money is power. In many ways, Sunday’s fixture will be a changing of the guard as the grand old team are hurtled into the modern age. “We’re at the end of such a long journey now at Goodison. And at just the very start and the very first step of a new one. “And maybe we’re quite privileged to be at this crossover point and experience both of them,” said Jones.",

    "title": "UK police charge three Iranians with suspected espionage",
    "article_text": "British police say they have charged three Iranians with suspected espionage for Iran’s intelligence services from August 2024 to February 2025. The police said in a statement on Saturday that the three men were charged with offences under the National Security Act following a major counterterrorism investigation. Mostafa Sepahvand, 39, Farhad Javadi Manesh, 44, and Shapoor Qalehali Khani Noori, 55, were accused of conduct likely to assist a foreign intelligence service between August 14, 2024, and February 16, 2025, the police said, adding that the foreign state to which the charges relate is Iran. The three men are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court later on Saturday. Commander Dominic Murphy, from the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command, said the men were arrested two weeks ago. “These are extremely serious charges under the National Security Act, which have come about following what has been a very complex and fast-moving investigation,” he said. Sepahvand was also charged with carrying out surveillance, reconnaissance and open-source research, intending to commit serious violence against someone in the United Kingdom, police and prosecutors said, while Manesh and Noori were also charged with engaging in surveillance and reconnaissance, with the intention that serious violence against someone in the UK would be carried out by others. The charges against the three men come after police arrested eight men including seven Iranians earlier in May, in two separate operations which Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said were some of the biggest investigations of their kind in recent years. Police said on Saturday that the four other men arrested as part of the counter-terrorism operation had been released from custody but the investigation was still open. The eighth man was released without charge on Thursday. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had previously said he was “disturbed” to learn that Iranian citizens had been arrested by the British authorities. The UK has placed Iran on the highest tier of its Foreign Influence Registration Scheme (FIRS), which aims to boost the UK’s national security against covert foreign influences. The measures, due to come into place later this year, will mean that all people working inside the UK for Iran, its intelligence services or the Revolutionary Guard would have to register or face jail.",

    "title": "Libyan ministers resign as protesters call for government to step down",
    "article_text": "Several ministers with Libya’s internationally recognised government have resigned in support of the protesters calling for Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah to step down. The government late on Friday said a police officer was killed in an “attempted assault” on the prime minister’s office as thousands of Libyans marched into squares and various areas in the capital, Tripoli. “He was shot by unknown attackers and succumbed to his injuries,” a statement said, adding that members of a group who mixed with the protesters tried to set the office on fire using Molotov cocktails. Economy and Trade Minister Mohamed al-Hawij, Local Government Minister Badr Eddin al-Tumi and Minister of Housing Abu Bakr al-Ghawi resigned, according to a video released by two of those ministers as well as local media reports. The government had earlier on Friday denied reports of the ministers’ resignations. Meanwhile, in the city of Misrata, protesters gathered in support of Dbeibah and his government. The protests follow awave of violence in Tripoliin the past week that led to the deaths of at least eight civilians. The deadly clashes started after powerful militia leader Abdelghani al-Kikli, also known as Gheniwa, was killed in an ambush at a military base. Dbeibah attempted toconsolidate powerand assert control after the killing, with more clashes following later in the week. Before the demonstrations, the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) had emphasised “citizens’ right to peaceful protest” and warned against “any escalation of violence”. Reporting from Tripoli, Al Jazeera’s Malik Traina said Libyans want to see a major change as people are “extremely frustrated” with the security situation. “Libyans are calling for elections and want to be able to voice their opinion and put those that they want in power,” he said. Egypt’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on Saturday that Cairo was closely monitoring developments in Libya, and urged all parties to exercise “maximum restraint”. It also advised Egyptian citizens in Libya to remain cautious and stay in their homes until the situation is clarified. Libya has been in turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising in 2011, which ended up dividing the country between two rival administrations. Dbeibah’s Government of National Unity (GNU) has maintainedcontrol over western Libyasince 2021, while an administration backed by renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar leads in the east. Libya was scheduled to hold national elections at the end of 2021, which were postponed indefinitely due to disputes over candidate eligibility, constitutional rules, and concerns over security as the rival governments failed to agree on a framework.",

    "title": "Q&A: Botswana’s Letsile Tebogo on his Olympic triumph; African sprinters",
    "article_text": "Doha, Qatar –Loud cheers greeted Letsile Tebogo when he stepped onto the track for the men’s 200-metre race at the World Athletics Doha Diamond League in Qatar and stepped away a winner a few minutes later. The Botswanan Olympic gold medallist made his Doha debut with a time of 20.10 seconds on a balmy Friday evening, coolly glancing sideways at his closest competitor as he crossed the finish line 0.01s ahead of Courtney Lindsey of the United States (US). It was a leisurely run compared with his triumphant 19.46s finish at the Stade de France nine months ago, when he left a star-studded American lineup – including 100m gold medal winner Noah Lyles – in his wake as he brought Botswana its first Olympic gold. As a young boy, Tebogo was a keen footballer with a preference for manning the left wing, but was pushed towards athletics by his teachers. Seven years later, the reluctant sprinter made the world sit up and take notice as he became the first African to win a 200m gold at the Olympics. A day prior to the Doha Diamond League, the World Athletics 2024 Athlete of the Year sat down with Al Jazeera to reflect on his achievement in Paris and its the impact on the African continent: Al Jazeera: How has life changed for you since winning the Olympic gold?Letsile Tebogo:In so many ways. To begin with, there’s increased awareness of the scale of my achievement, which has brought along commercial interest. I now have multiple opportunities to support myself as multiple brands want to be associated with my name. What I’m most excited about, though, is the impact I have made on aspiring athletes. I have proved that by staying on the right track and working hard, it is possible to achieve your dreams no matter which part of the world you’re from. Wherever you are, whatever you have, just make sure you put in enough effort and dedication. Al Jazeera: How difficult is it for you to step out of your house when you’re in Botswana?Tebogo:I’m never out unless it’s for an event. I stay locked up indoors because I don’t want to be out there too much.I like having an element of mystery and want to leave people wondering: where is he, what’s he doing? Al Jazeera: How does it feel to break the American and Jamaican hold on sprinting medals at the Olympics?Tebogo:That’s always been my goal. To snap their dominance. It was sad to see only two nations rule the sport for decades. I wanted to make a breakthrough for African athletes. I aspired to be the one to make it happen and then take in the world’s response. And that reaction has been heartwarming. Al Jazeera: When compared with the success in distance running, Africa has not been able to bag as many medals in sprinting. What challenges do African athletes face when it comes to sprinting at the highest level?Tebogo:It’s mostly down to infrastructure and support but I am not entirely sure. However, I can see that Africa is looking towards investing in its athletes beyond distance running. Once the governments are on board, it makes a massive difference to the sport. Al Jazeera: Can you see the impact of your success for Batswana athletes?Tebogo:It’s still early days but I’ve definitely seen athletes shed a layer of self-doubt. They are no longer afraid of coming forward to showcase their talent. I hope the new [Botswana] government will take the next step and help these athletes. Al Jazeera: How do you see the future of sprinting in Africa?Tebogo:Africans are stepping up and we see an increased number of African athletes in global competitions. I dream of an all-African lineup at the Olympics one day.",

    "title": "Arab League calls for funds to rebuild Gaza at summit in Baghdad",
    "article_text": "Arab leaders have urged the international community to fund their plan torebuild the Gaza Stripafter United States President Donald Trump reiterated a proposal to take over the Palestinian territory. An Arab League summit held on Saturday in Baghdad said in its final statement that it urged “countries and international and regional financial institutions to provide prompt financial support” to back its Gaza reconstruction plan. “This genocide [in Gaza] has reached a level of ugliness unparalleled in all conflicts in history,” Iraq’s Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani said in his opening speech at the 34th Arab Summit, which was dominated byIsrael’s genocide in Gaza. He said Iraq backed the creation of an “Arab fund to support reconstruction efforts”, adding that Iraq will contribute $20m towards the fund and another $20m for Lebanon, which has also been in conflict with Israel. The Iraqi prime minister said Baghdad rejects “the forced displacement of Palestinians”, calling for an end to “the massacres in Gaza, the attacks on the West Bank and the occupied territories”. “We have called, and continue to call, for serious and responsible Arab action to save Gaza and reactivate the UNRWA,” he said, referring to the UN body for Palestinian aid. Saturday’s talks in the Iraqi capital came only a day after Trump completed hisMiddle East tour, triggering hopes of a ceasefire and the renewal of aid delivery to Gaza. United Nations chief Antonio Guterres and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez – who have sharply criticisedIsrael’s genocidein Gaza – were guests at the summit. “We need a permanent ceasefire now, the unconditional release of the hostages now, and the free flow of humanitarian aid ending the blockade now,” Guterres said. Spain’s Sanchez said the humanitarian crisis in Gaza must end “immediately and without delay”. “Palestine and Spain are working on a new draft to be presented to the United Nations, where we are demanding Israel to end the unjust humanitarian siege laid to Gaza and to allow for the unconditional delivery of relief aid into Gaza”, he said. He also said there must be “more pressure on Israel to end the carnage unfolding in Gaza by all the conceivable means, namely the tools available under the international law.” “And here, I would like to announce that Spain will present a proposal to the General Assembly for the International Criminal Court to examine Israel’s compliance with the delivery of relief aid into Gaza,” the Spanish prime minister added. In March, Israel ended a ceasefire reached with Hamas in January, renewing deadly attacks across Gaza and forcing a blockade of food and other essential items. In recent days, Israel has intensified its offensive, as tens of thousands of Palestinians are forced to starve. At a preparatory meeting of the Arab League summit, Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein said they will try to endorse decisions that were made at their meeting in Cairo in March to support Gaza’s reconstruction as an alternative to Trump’swidely condemned proposalto take over the enclave. During his visit to Qatar, Trump on Thursday reiterated that he wanted the US to “take” Gaza and turn it into a “freedom zone”. Earlier this year, he caused an uproar by declaring that the US would turn Gaza into a “Riviera of the Middle East”, prompting Arab leaders to come up with a plan to rebuild the territory, at a summit in Cairo. The Arab plan for Gaza proposes rebuilding the Palestinian enclave without displacing its 2.4 million residents. Besides Gaza, Arab officials also discussed Syria, which only six months ago entered a new chapter in its history after the fall of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad. Earlier this week, Trump in Riyadh met Syria’s interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose group spearheaded the offensive that toppled al-Assad last December. Prior to their meeting, he also announced that US sanctions on Syria will be lifted in a huge boost to the government in Damascus. Al-Sharaa, who was imprisoned for years in Iraq on charges of belonging to al-Qaeda following the 2003 US-led invasion, however, missed Baghdad’s summit after several powerful Iraqi politicians voiced opposition to his visit. The Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani represented Damascus instead. Saturday’s summit also came amid Iran’s ongoing nuclear talks with the US. Trump has pursued diplomacy with Iran as he seeks to stave off a threatened military strike by Israel on Iran, a desire shared by many of the region’s leaders. On Thursday, Trump said a deal was “getting close”, but by Friday, he was warning that “something bad is going to happen” if the Iranians do not move fast. Iraq has only recently regained a semblance of normalcy after decades of devastating conflict and turmoil, and its leaders view the summit as an opportunity to project an image of stability. Reporting from Baghdad, Al Jazeera’s Mahmoud Abdelwahed said the summit was “very crucial” for Iraq. “This is the first time the summit has been held in Iraq since 2012 and Iraq takes it as a credit to regain its rule as a player to bridge the gap between member states of the Arab League,” he said.",

    "title": "Israel’s Gaza ‘disengagement’ that paved the way for conquest",
    "article_text": "In August 2005, the Israeli government officially withdrew from the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian coastal enclave it had occupied continuously since 1967. Apart from pulling back its armed forces, it had to undertake the dismantlement of 21 illegal settlements housing 8,000 Jewish settlers. Israeli troops were deployed to begin the process, which pulled at the heartstrings of international media outlets like The New York Times. The paper reported on thesobbing settlersaffected by Israel’s “historic pullout from the Gaza Strip”, some of whom had to be carried “screaming from their homesin scenes that moved a number of the soldiers to tears”. To be sure, there is nothing quite so tragic as illegal colonisers being uprooted from one section of land that does not belong to them and transferred to another section of land that does not belong to them. It bears mentioning that a majority of the Palestinian population of the Gaza Strip are themselves refugees from Israel’s blood-drenched conquest of Palestine in 1948, whichkilled 15,000 Palestinians, expelled three-quarters of a million more, and destroyed over 500 Palestinian villages. Since 2005, the myth of a unilateral Israeli “withdrawal” from Gaza has stubbornly persisted – and has been repeatedly invoked as alleged evidence of Israel’s noble willingness to occasionally play by the rules. And yet objectively speaking, what happened in August of that year was not much of a “withdrawal” at all, given that the Israeli military continued to control Gaza’s borders while subjecting the territory to a punishing blockade and periodic wanton bombardment. Israeli officials themselves made no effort to hide what they were really up to. In 2004, while the plan was still being discussed in the Knesset, Dov Weisglass, a senior adviser to then-Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon,stated point-blank: “The disengagement is actually formaldehyde. It supplies the amount of formaldehyde that is necessary so there will not be a political process with the Palestinians.” By “freezing” the political process, Weisglass went on to explain, “you prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, and you prevent a discussion on the refugees, the borders and Jerusalem”. Thanks to “disengagement”, then, the whole issue of Palestinian statehood had been “removed indefinitely from our agenda” – and all with the “blessing” of the president of the United States of America “and the ratification of both houses of Congress”. Since the so-called “withdrawal” from Gaza did not entail ceasing to make life hell for the Palestinian inhabitants of the territory, Israel remained ever-engaged on that front. On September 28, 2005 – the month following the drama of the sobbing settlers and soldiers – the late Dr Eyad El-Sarraj, founder of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme,wroteon the Electronic Intifada website: “During the last few days, Gaza was awakened from its dreams of liberation with horrible explosions which have shattered our skies, shaken our buildings, broken our windows, and threw the place into panic.” These were the effects of Israeli aircraft executing sonic booms in the skies over Gaza, a method El-Sarraj noted “was never used before the disengagement, so as not to alarm or hurt the Israeli settlers and their children”. And that was just the start of the “disengaging”. In 2006, Israel launched Operation Summer Rains in the Gaza Strip, which scholars Noam Chomsky and Ilan Pappe would subsequentlycharacteriseas being thus far the “most brutal attack on Gaza since 1967”. This, of course, was before Gaza was awakened from its dreams of liberation with an all-out Israeligenocide, which has now killed more than 53,000 Palestinians since October 2023. But there was plenty of brutality in between, from Israel’s Operation Cast Lead – which kicked off in December 2008 and killed 1,400 Palestinians in a matter of 22 days – to Operation Protective Edge, which slaughtered 2,251 people over 50 days in 2014. Along with periodic bouts of mass killing, the fluctuating Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip posed additional existential challenges. In 2010, for example, the BBClistedsome of the household items that had at different times been blocked from entering Gaza, including “light bulbs, candles, matches, books, musical instruments, crayons, clothing, shoes, mattresses, sheets, blankets, pasta, tea, coffee, chocolate, nuts, shampoo and conditioner”. In 2006, Israeli government adviser Weisglass – the same character who revealed the “formaldehyde” approach to disengagement – also took it upon himself to charminglyclarifythe logic behind Israel’s restrictions on food imports into the Gaza Strip: “The idea is to put the Palestinians on a diet, but not to make them die of hunger.” Now that Israel isliterally starving Palestinians to deathin Gaza with the full complicity of the United States, it seems the “idea” has undergone some revisions. Meanwhile,recent news reportsciting unnamed Israeli officials indicate that Israel is also currently plotting the “conquest” and full military occupation of the Gaza Strip. Two decades on from Israel’s withdrawal-that-wasn’t from Gaza, it’s safe to surmise that “disengagement” paved the way for conquest. And this time around, there’s no disengagement plan.

    "title": "Knicks oust Celtics in Game 6 playoffs, make Eastern Conference finals",
    "article_text": "Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby each scored 23 points as the New York Knicks reached the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since 2000 by steamrolling the visiting Boston Celtics 119-81 in Game 6 of their second-round series. Mikal Bridges had 22 points and Karl-Anthony Towns added 21 points and 12 rebounds for third-seeded New York, which led by as many as 41 points on Friday. The Knicks wrapped up the best-of-seven series with the largest winning playoff margin in franchise history. “There’s more to go,” Bridges said. “We’re not done. We came out there tonight and played hard and handled business. But our season is not over. We have much more to go.” New York surpassed a 36-point playoff victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in the decisive Game 5 of the 1970 Eastern Division finals. Josh Hart contributed 10 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists to record New York’s first postseason triple-double since Walt Frazier accomplished the feat in 1972. “I want to congratulate the Celtics on a terrific season,” Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said. “Unfortunate injury to Jayson Tatum. They’re a terrific organisation, ownership, front office, Joe Mazzulla is a terrific coach, great players. “They’re not going to hand you anything. You have to earn it.” The Knicks will open the conference finals at home against the fourth-seeded Indiana Pacers on Wednesday. Defending NBA champion Boston was led by Jaylen Brown, who had 20 points, six rebounds and six assists before fouling out late in the third quarter. The Celtics were again short-handed after losing Tatum to a ruptured right Achilles during Game 4 on Monday. “Upset or not, we beat a great team,” Brunson said. “They obviously lost a huge piece (in Tatum). The way they came out in Game 5, they’re still a good team. Regardless of what anyone thinks – upset or not – we’re just happy to come out of the series with a win and now we’ll prepare for another team.” New York shot 46.2 percent from the field, including 16 of 45 (35.6 percent) from 3-point range. The Knicks held a 55-36 rebounding advantage. Payton Pritchard scored 11 points and Al Horford added 10 for Boston, which shot 36 percent and was 12 of 40 (30 percent) from 3-point range. The score was tied at 16 before the Knicks began pulling away. New York led 26-20 at the end of the first quarter and then opened the second with a 16-4 surge to open up an 18-point lead midway through the period. After Boston’s Luke Kornet interrupted the burst with a three-point play, the Knicks rattled off 16 of the next 21 points to take a 58-32 lead on a putback dunk by Miles “Deuce” McBride with 1:31 left. McBride buried a 3-pointer as time expired in the half for a 64-37 lead at the break. That marked New York’s largest halftime advantage at the break since leading the Los Angeles Lakers 69-42 in Game 7 of the 1970 Finals, won by the Knicks. “You win a championship and you have that target on your back from Day 1,” Celtics guard Derrick White said of falling well short of winning back-to-back NBA titles. “There’s ups and downs through every season. This part sucks and we didn’t complete the goal that we set out to get.” The contest was effectively over when Brown fouled out with 2:50 left in the third quarter and Boston down by 33. Anunoby poured it on with consecutive 3-pointers to end a 10-0 push as the margin went above 40 at 92-51 with 1:51 remaining in the third. “They played better than we did,” Mazzulla said. “I’m happy for Thibs [Thibodeau]. He’s been coaching for a long time. That’s the biggest thing. You pay your dues, you put forth everything. That guy is a lifer. He’s what a coach is all about and he deserves it. And they deserve it as a team. You got to take your hat off to them.”",

    "title": "Trump says he will call Putin, Zelenskyy to discuss Ukraine ‘bloodbath’",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump says he will phone his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, followed by Ukraine’s leader and NATO allies on Monday in a push to bring the Ukraine war to an end. “HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE A PRODUCTIVE DAY, A CEASEFIRE WILL TAKE PLACE, AND THIS VERY VIOLENT WAR, A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER HAPPENED, WILL END,” Trump wrote on his social networking site, Truth Social, on Saturday. Trump’s remarks come a day after the first Moscow-Kyiv talks in three years failed to yield a ceasefire agreement. Putin had declined an invitation from Zelenskyy to attend Friday’s talks, sending a lower-level delegation in his place, a move that led Zelenskyy to say the Russian leader was not taking peace efforts “seriously”. Following the talks, which led to an agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners each, Ukraine’s Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said the “next step” would be a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin. On Saturday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia considered the move possible, “but only as a result of the work and upon achieving certain results in the form of an agreement between the two sides”. He did not elaborate on what would be required. Peskov said both sides needed to complete the prisoner swap before fixing the next round of talks. Ukraine’s head of military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, indicated the exchange could take place as early as next week. Earlier on Saturday, a Russiandrone attackin Ukraine’s Sumy region killed nine bus passengers in what the National Police described as “a cynical war crime”. Seven others were injured in the attack in Sumy’s Bilopillia, Zelenskyy said in a post on X, and called for tougher sanctions on Moscow. Russia’s Ministry of Defence said it had targeted Ukrainian military equipment, the TASS state news agency reported. “All the deceased were civilians,” Zelenskyy said, adding that preliminary reports indicated a father, mother and daughter had been killed. “And the Russians could not have failed to understand what kind of vehicle they were targeting. This was a deliberate killing of civilians.” He said the wounded had suffered burns, fractures, and blast injuries, and were receiving treatment in hospital. The Ukrainian leader said he expected tougher sanctions from Ukraine’s partners to pressure Moscow “to stop the killings”. “Without tougher sanctions, without stronger pressure, Russia will not seek real diplomacy,” he said. “This must change.” He said Russia had sent “a weak and unprepared” delegation to the Istanbul talks on Friday without a meaningful mandate, and real steps were needed to end the war. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha denounced the attack as a “deliberate and barbaric war crime”, accusing Putin of continuing “to wage a war against civilians” and calling for additional pressure on Russia. “There should be no illusions. Pressure on Moscow must be increased to put an end to Russian terror,” Sybiha wrote. Russia denies targeting civilians since launching a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",

    "title": "‘Exploding inequality’: The fight for the hearts and minds of Poland’s left",
    "article_text": "Krakow, Poland –As Adrian Zandberg, leader of Poland’s left-wing Razem (Together) party, prepared to speak to the large crowd at his rally in one of Krakow’s central squares on Wednesday this week, he wasn’t just getting ready to contest Sunday’spresidential election. Speaking with a revolutionary zeal to the cheering crowd, Zandberg put forward his ideals: Quality public services, affordable housing for all, investment in education and science and the end to a toxic right-wing duopoly in Polish politics. Zandberg is one of two presidential hopefuls of Poland’s left – the other is Magdalena Biejat of the Lewica (The Left) party. Between the two of them, they represent a political force that has long remained on the margins of politics. Sunday’s contest is also a fight for the leadership of this movement which is popular with urban, generally younger people. Opinion polls suggest that the final presidential battle – first-round voting takes place on Sunday – will be between the two favourites, Rafał Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki, representatives of right-wing parties Civic Platform and Law and Justice (PiS) which have dominated the country’s political scene for the past 20 years. Nevertheless, Zandberg was confident and full of passion as he addressed his supporters. “I believe that we can build a different, better Poland. I believe that we can afford for Poland to become a country with decent public services,” he declared. “That we can afford for people in the 20th economy in the world to stop dying in line to see a doctor. That we can afford for young, hard-working people to be able to rent a roof over their heads for a normal price, so that they can afford to start a family.” Calling the current system “unconstitutional” and one which “explodes with inequalities”, he called for a change. The system, he said, “is a threat to the future of Poland”. Like other left-wing politicians, he has been a staunch critic of the neoliberal views of the two main candidates, their lack of commitment to securing affordable housing for people (which is a constitutional right), attempts to privatise the healthcare system, and their seeming embrace of rising anti-migrant sentiment within the country. The day before, in another square in central Krakow, Biejat, Zandberg’s main competitor for the hearts and minds of Poland’s left and deputy marshal of the Senate, stood before her own crowd of supporters. Unlike Zandberg’s Razem, her party, Lewica, is part of the ruling Civic Coalition along with the centre-right Civic Platform. Lewica’s decision to enter the coalition government in late 2023 prompted criticism among some on the left, and has become the main bone of contention between the two leftist presidential candidates. Speaking at her rally on Tuesday, Biejat defended the decision to join the coalition as the right one. According to her, it has allowed her party to have a real effect on politics in Poland. She listed their achievements: “It is thanks to Lewica being in the government that we managed to introduce a pension supplement for widows. We managed to introduce a pilot programme which shortened working hours. We managed to increase the funeral allowance,” Biejat said. “We have changed the definition of rape, so that women no longer have to explain to the judges that it was not their fault that someone had hurt them. Thanks to us, parents of premature babies have received additional leave days for each week spent in hospital with a small child.” The Krakow crowd, albeit smaller than Zandberg’s, cheered Biejat’s declarations of support for the rights of women, LGBTQ people and those with disabilities and for affordable housing. The two-term presidency of the left-wing Aleksander Kwasniewsk, an independent but also one of the founders of the Democratic Left Alliance, was highly successful. Under his presidency, which ended in 2005, Poland joined NATO and the European Union and introduced a new constitution. Since his departure, however, the left has been in crisis. While the ideals of the left-wing candidates barely differ from those of left-wing candidates in other European countries, their appeal in Poland is limited these days as people have become disillusioned with immigration, and resentment towards the one million Ukrainian refugees taking shelter from the war with Russia has grown. According to Politico’s latest aggregate poll, the two leftist candidates are each expected to win 5 percent of the vote. In the most recent European election in 2024, Lewica secured just 6.3 percent of the vote, the lowest score in its history. In the most recent parliamentary elections of 2023, the party secured just 5.3 percent of the vote. The question now is whether leftist parties can start to make a comeback. Some observers see signs of a possible resurgence – but it is fragile. “Any result above 5 percent for each of the candidates [in the upcoming presidential contest] would be a good score. And below 4 percent – a bad one,” said Bartosz Rydlinski, a political scientist at Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw. He credits Zandberg with “restarting the Razem party project” by appealing to younger voters. “Recent studies show that he is competing with Slawomir Mentzen [the highly popular ultraconservative and free-market-enthusiast leader of the Confederation Party] to be number one among the youngest voters. “Magdalena Biejat, on her part, represents women from the middle class, living in large cities. She is their mirror image. The election will show which one of them is more popular,” Rydlinski said. At the last presidential election five years ago, Robert Biedron of Lewica, who now serves as a Polish member of the European parliament (MEP), won just 2.2 percent of the vote. This time around, the left is expected to do better, but its appeal remains limited. According to experts, the left has lost much of its traditional support base to the nationalist conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which attracted voters with generous welfare packages. In this presidential election, Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by PiS, is expected to take 25 percent of the vote in the first round, according to Politico’s aggregate poll. This is despite the fact that Nawrocki has abandoned Law and Justice’s commitment to social welfare and has embraced free-market thinking with a focus on strengthening an alliance with the US while distancing Poland from the EU. His main competitor,Rafał Trzaskowski of the centre-right Civic Platform, is polling at 31 percent. “The left is continuously trying to win back pro-social Law and Justice voters, but so far it has failed,” Jakub Majmurek, a commentator at the left-wing Krytyka Polityczna media outlet, told Al Jazeera. “First of all, because these voters are often calculating and feel that the Law and Justice is a much more credible welfare provider than the weak left. “Second, these voters are largely pro-church and much more conservative when it comes to social issues than the left.” A good result for the left in the Sunday election could have the effect of bringing left-wing politics back to the agenda, analysts say, and make some inroads into reversing the long-term trend of far-right and centre-right politicians dominating government. “If the combined result of Biejat and Zandberg is around 10 percent, in the second election round, Trzaskowski or even Nawrocki will have to try to claim this left-wing electorate somehow,” Majmurek explained. “That would be the best scenario for the left. Especially if both candidates receive a similar percentage of the vote. That would show that none of them is a hegemon and cannot build the left without the other.”",

    "title": "Thousands of Palestinians flee north Gaza amid intensified Israeli attacks",
    "article_text": "Thousands of Palestinians have been ordered by the Israeli forces to flee parts of northern Gaza as indiscriminate air strikes have killed at least 115 people in the territory. Palestinians in northern Gaza’s Beit Lahiya area fled their homes with essential belongings on Friday, after intense Israeli air strikes hit the area. More than 19,000 Palestinians have been displaced in Gaza since Thursday afternoon, according to the International Organization for Migration (IOM). “Many with nothing but the clothes on their backs,” the organisation said in a post on X. “Nowhere is safe in Gaza.” Nearly all of Gaza’s population has been displaced at some point during the genocide, with several forced to flee many times over. Israel has increasingly issued forced displacement orders as it escalates its attacks in the enclave. In a statement in Arabic on Saturday, the Israeli military said it has launched the “initial stages” of what it callsOperation Gideon’s Chariots, a new offensive for“the expansion of the battle in the Gaza Strip, with the goal of achieving all the war’s objectives, including the release of the abducted and the defeat of Hamas”. A separate statement in English said the army was “mobilising troops to achieve operational control in areas of the Gaza Strip”. Israel has killed at least 115 Palestinians in Gaza since dawn on Friday as it intensifies bombardment of the enclave amid widespread forced starvation. More than 100 other Palestinians were killed on Thursday in similar attacks. Since October 2023, Israel has killed at least 53,119 Palestinians and wounded 120,214 others, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health. The enclave’s Government Media Office updated thedeath tollto more than 61,700, saying thousands of people missing under the rubble are presumed dead.",

    "title": "Malaysia’s ‘fish hunters’ target invasive species, one catch at a time",
    "article_text": "Puchong, Malaysia– On a recent Sunday morning, about a dozen men with fishing nets skirted the rubbish-strewn banks of the Klang River just outside the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur. Surveying the river, the men cast their nets into the polluted water. The nets billowed open and sunk quickly under the weight of metal chains. From where they stood on the riverbank, they started to pull in their nets, already filled with dozens of squirming black-bodied catfish. “You don’t see any other fish. Only these,” said Mohamad Haziq A Rahman, the leader of Malaysia’s “foreign fish hunter squad”, as they emptied their catch of wriggling suckermouth catfish into piles, away from the river. None of the fish caught that morning were sold at nearby markets or food stalls. The sole purpose of the expedition was to cull suckermouth catfish, one among a growing number of invasive species that have in recent decades dominated freshwater habitats across Southeast Asia. Once brought in for commercial or hobbyist reasons, invasive fish are not only threatening to edge native species out of the food chain in Malaysia and elsewhere, but they also spread diseases and cause great damage to local environments. Invasive fish are a problem the world over, but experts say the issue is keenly felt in mega-biodiverse Malaysia. “More than 80 percent of rivers in the Klang Valley have been invaded by foreign fish species, which can cause the extinction of the rivers’ indigenous aquatic life,” said Dr Kalithasan Kailasam, a river expert with the Malaysia-based Global Environment Centre. “It’s growing in almost all other main rivers in Malaysia,” said Kailasam, explaining how species such as the suckermouth have the potential to quickly reproduce and survive in dirty water, leaving local fish on the losing side. Aside from the suckermouth, Malaysia’s waterways are now threatened by species such as the aggressive peacock bass, Javanese carp and redtail catfish, he said. While the full extent of the problem is not yet known, Malaysia’s fisheries department, after a four-year study until 2024, found invasive species in 39 areas across nearly every state in peninsular Malaysia and on the island of Labuan, including in dams, lakes and major rivers. Alarmed by the threat, a small group of citizens banded together to fight the aquatic invaders. Led by Haziq, they are working to reclaim Malaysia’s rivers one fin at a time. The citizen fish hunters’ quest to fight invasive species started during the country’s COVID-19 lockdowns, when Haziq, a former healthcare consultant, turned to fishing as a pastime in a river near his house in central Selangor state. He found every fish he caught was of the suckermouth variety, also known as the “pleco” or “ikan bandaraya” – which translates as the “janitor fish” in Malay and is favoured by hobbyists to keep aquariums clean, as the suckermouth feeds on algae, leftover food and dead fish. Native to South America, varieties of the suckermouth have also been introduced into waterways in the United States, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, often when owners dump them into rivers, canals, dams or free them after they grow too large for their aquarium tanks. Because of their thick, scaly skin, suckermouths are usually avoided by even larger predators in Malaysia, and can grow to about half a metre (1.6ft) in length. As bottom feeders, the catfish have been known to eat the eggs of other species and destroy their nesting sites. Catfish also burrow into riverbanks to nest, causing them to erode and collapse, which is a serious environmental issue in flood-prone Malaysia where year-end monsoon winds bring heavy rain. Malaysia’s central bank said in 2024 that floods are the cause of 85 percent of the country’s natural disasters, with their frequency increasing since 2020.­ Though far from his favourite fish to catch, Haziq discovered that suckerfish roe could be used as bait for other bigger fish, and he earned some money selling their eggs to other fishing enthusiasts. He also gained a following by putting his exploits on social media. Further research then led him to learn about the threats posed by invasive species. Haziq started to attract like-minded anglers, and, in 2022, they decided to form a group for hunting suckermouth, meeting nearly every week in a river to carry out a cull. Their public profile and popularity are growing. The group’s membership has now grown to more than 1,000, and it has a strong fan following on social media. “People kept asking how to join our group, because we were looking at the ecosystem,” Haziq said. Focusing first on Malaysia’s Selangor state and rivers in the capital Kuala Lumpur, the fish hunter squad had netted nearly 31 tonnes of suckermouths by 2024. They have also visited rivers in other states in Malaysia as their campaign expands. During a hunt in the Klang River earlier this year, Haziq and his comrades deployed to the river’s banks on a mission to see how many suckermouth they could catch during a single outing. But hunting for invasive fish can be tricky. Without boats, the hunters have to wade into the fast-moving polluted waters from muddy banks, while navigating underwater debris such as rubbish on the riverbed. Almost all the fish they caught were of the invasive kind, but once in a while, they do net a local. “Haruan (snakehead)!” shouted ex-navy diver Syuhaily Hasibullah, 46, as he showed off a small fish half the size of his arm, taken from a net containing several suckermouths. “This one is rare! There used to be a lot of them in the river,” he told Al Jazeera. Haziq said if the hunters found many invasive species in their nets, they would organise another outing to the same location, bringing along more people to take part. The day they set out to calculate how many invasive fish they could catch in a single outing turned out to yield half a tonne of suckermouth in just three hours – so many they had to stuff them into sacks. Previously, the hunters buried their hauls in deep holes away from the river. Now, they have found more creative ways to dispose of what is, generally, an unwanted fish. At the event earlier this year, sacks of suckermouths were handed over to a local entrepreneur looking to experiment with turning the fish into a form of charcoal known as biochar. Some local universities have also started researching the possible use of the suckermouth. One university research article explored the potential of suckermouth collagen for pharmaceutical use, while another considered its use as fertiliser or even as a type of leather. On some occasions, the hunters even eat the fish they catch, though that depends on which river they have been taken from. While redtail or African catfish are considered delicacies by some, the suckermouth, also known in India as “devil fish”, is a less attractive snacking option – but not out of the question when it comes to a quick riverside grill. “If the fish is from the Klang River, we don’t eat it,” Mohd Zulkifli Mokhtar told Al Jazeera, before dozens of hunters broke their fast during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan. “But if it’s from the Langat River, it’s still OK,” Zulkifli said, as dozens of suckermouth caught in the less polluted Langat River, located in Bangi some 25km (16 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur, were gutted, marinated in satay and grilled on skewers. Studies from Bangladesh and Indonesia have found varieties of catfish with high levels of heavy metals and contaminants. A 2024 article by Malaysia’s Universiti Teknologi Mara cited a study that showed the level of contaminants in the suckermouth was “heavily influenced by the level of pollution in the river”. While Malaysia’s fisheries department said there were no records of local species becoming endangered because of invasive ones, native fish nevertheless face threats. Local fish either faced becoming prey or have had to fight to survive, with the department finding in a survey that 90 percent of the fish in six rivers in the Selangor and Kuala Lumpur region were now foreign arrivals. The department’s Director-General Adnan Hussain said various measures had been put in place, including the release of some 33.6 million native fish and prawns into rivers nationwide from 2021 to 2025 to “balance the impact” of invasive fish. Late last year, the state government of Selangor also came up with a scheme to pay anglers one Malaysian ringgit ($0.23) for every kilogramme (2.2lb) of the suckermouth fish removed from two rivers. The captured fish were to be turned into animal feed and organic fertiliser, an official said. Restrictions on the import of certain foreign aquatic species – including entire species and groups – into Malaysia were also imposed last year, and the fisheries department said that programmes and collaboration with the fish hunters had also helped to deal with the problem. In one river in Selangor state, Adnan said the amount of invasive fish caught following one eradication programme had dropped from 600kg (1,300lb) in a May 2024 event to just more than 150kg (330lb) four or five months later. However, Universiti Malaysia Terengganu fish researcher Professor Amirrudin Ahmad said it was “almost impossible” to fully exterminate the country’s invasive fish. “So many species live in (native water bodies) and getting rid of invasive species by the means of poisoning the water is not feasible at all,” he said, adding there were close to 80 recorded fish species introduced in Malaysia so far. He further warned that rising temperatures caused by climate change may even allow species like the predatory Mekong redtail catfish to proliferate in cooler upstream waters in Malaysia. “They are here to stay,” Amirrudin said. “It is simply,” he said, “that the environment is mostly similar to their native country, or these species are highly adaptable.” That this is an ecological war that can never truly be won is a point that Haziq and his fellow fish hunters are fully aware of. Nearly every river they visited in recent times had almost nothing but invasive fish, he said. But their mission will carry on, he added, along with the hunting and public awareness that has spurred thousands to follow his social media videos on the subject. “Yes, this fish won’t be completely gone from our rivers,” he told Al Jazeera. “But if we don’t act now, it would be worse,” he said. “It’s better to take action than to just leave it alone,” he added. “At least we can reduce the population, than allow it to completely take over our local fish.”",

    "title": "US announces first ‘terrorism’ charges for supporting a Mexican cartel",
    "article_text": "The United States has revealed the first federal charges against a foreign national for providing material support to one of the criminal groups that President Donald Trump has designated a “foreign terrorist organisation”. On Friday, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a statement identifying the suspect as 39-year-old Maria Del Rosario Navarro-Sanchez of Mexico. An unsealed indictment accused Navarro-Sanchez of furnishing the Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion (CJNG), a Mexican drug cartel, with grenades and helping it smuggle migrants, firearms, money and drugs. “Cartels like CJNG are terrorist groups that wreak havoc in American communities and are responsible for countless lives lost in the United States, Mexico and elsewhere,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in thestatement. “This announcement demonstrates the Justice Department’s unwavering commitment to securing our borders and protecting Americans through effective prosecution.” The charges stem from a decision early in Trump’s second term in office to apply “terrorism” designations to foreign criminal organisations, including gangs and drug cartels. On his first day back in office, on January 20, Trump signed anexecutive orderdeclaring that “international cartels constitute a national-security threat beyond that posed by traditional organized crime”. He directed his officials to begin preparations for implementing the “terrorism” designations. By February 19, the Federal Register in the USlisted eight Latin American criminal groupsas “foreign terrorist organisations”, among them the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). Mexico’s Cartel de Jalisco Nueva Generacion was also among that initial group of designated organisations. Since then, the Trump administration has broadened its scope, adding more Latin American groups to the list. On May 2, for instance, twoHaitian gangs– Viv Ansanm and Gran Grif –joined the US’s listof foreign terrorist organisations. These designations are a departure from the usual use of the “foreign terrorist” label, often reserved for organisations that seek specific political aims through their violence. Critics, however, warn that this application could have unintended consequences, particularly for civilians in vulnerable situations. The “foreign terrorist designation” makes it a crime for anyone to offer material support to a given group, but criminal gangs often extort civilians for money and services as part of their fundraising activities. “You could accuse anyone – from a migrant who pays a smuggler to a Mexican business that is forced to pay a ‘protection fee’ – of offering material or financial support to a terrorist organisation,” Will Freeman, a fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, told Al Jazeera journalist Brian Osgood earlier this year. In the case unsealed on Friday, it was revealed that Navarro-Sanchez was arrested on May 4. She had two co-defendants, also Mexican citizens, who likewise faced charges of firearms trafficking and other crimes. The Mexican government had previously confirmed Navarro-Sanchez’s arrest. A statement ICE released to the media showed multiple firearms and packages of meth and fentanyl allegedly linked to the case. It also included a photo of a golden AR-15 gun known as “El Dorado” that was reportedly “recovered from Navarro-Sanchez’s possession during her arrest in Mexico”. “Supplying grenades to a designated terrorist organisation – while trafficking firearms, narcotics, and human beings – is not just criminal,” said ICE’s acting Director Todd Lyons. “It’s a direct assault on the security of the United States.”",

    "article_text": "The driver, along with three others, were charged in October over a fake deliveries ploy. The driver, along with three others, were charged in October over a fake deliveries ploy. byWes Davis A former DoorDash delivery driver pleaded guilty this week to conspiracy to a wire fraud conspiracy that scammed DoorDash out of over $2.5 million, the US Attorney’s Office in California’s Northern Districtannounced on Tuesday. He and others made it happen over a period of months using fake customer accounts, deliveries that never happened, driver accounts, and access to DoorDash employee credentials. Here’s how the Attorney’s office describes the scheme. The driver, Sayee Chaitainya Reddy Devagiri, placed expensive orders from a fraudulent customer account in the DoorDash app. Then, using DoorDash employee credentials, he manually assigned the orders to driver accounts he and the others involved had created. Devagiri would then mark the undelivered orders as complete and prompt DoorDash’s system to pay the driver accounts. Then he’d switch those same orders back to “in process” and do it all over again. Doing this “took less than five minutes, and was repeated hundreds of times for many of the orders,” writes the US Attorney’s Office. Devagiri faces up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, and is scheduled for a status hearing in September. He and four others werecharged in Augustfor their roles in the scheme, which prosecutors say was carried out between November 2020 and February 2021. The DoorDash employee whose insider credentials they used, Tyler Thomas Bottenhorn, was charged separately in 2022 and pleaded guilty the following year, the Attorney’s Officewrote in October.

In aletter from Applethat Epic shared late Friday, Apple writes that it won’t “take action on the Fortnite app submission until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction.” Epic claims the delay is retaliation for its legal fight with the company, and notes in its filing that Apple “expressly and repeatedly” told it and the court that it would approveFortniteif the app complied with Apple’s guidelines, which it insists its current submission does. Following Gonzalez Rogers’ decision in April, Epic saidFortnitewould returnto the US App Store. The company has since submitted the game twice,most recentlyto include content from an update to the EU version of the game. But instead of Apple approvingFortnitein the US, the gamedisappeared from the EU App Store. Epic claimed that was because it can’t release in the EU because ofApple’s decision to block its US submission. Apple said it had merely asked that it resubmit the app without including the US storefront, “so as not to impact Fortnite in other geographies.” But in apost announcing its new filing, Epic claims that would mean it has to submit multiple versions of the app, which it says is against Apple’s guidelines. Epic is asking that the court enforce its injunction, find Apple in contempt again, and require the company to “accept any compliant Epic app, includingFortnite, for distribution on the U.S. storefront of the App Store.” The hitch here is that throughout this case, Judge Gonzalez Rogers hasn’t gone so far as to requireFortnite’s return to the store, finding in her 2021 ruling that Epic had stillknowingly broken its developer agreementwith apple.9to5Macwritesthat the judge would likely need to agree that Apple is once again in contempt of court, as she did in her April 30th ruling. The difference between now and then — and what could work in Epic’s favor — is justhow annoyed she seemed with Applein the text of that ruling. Apple did not immediately respond toThe Verge’s request for comment.

    "article_text": "We’ve assembled a collection of 30-odd gifts to help your grad celebrate and gear up for what comes next. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. bySheena VasaniandBrandon Widder If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Graduation is one of those unique milestones in life that’s both exciting and nerve-wracking. It’s worth celebrating, but it also marks a new chapter that can feel overwhelming. That’s why your grad will surely appreciate a little support as they step into the next phase of their life, whether that be college or their first job. Lucky for you, we’ve put together a list of gifts that are designed to make the transition into post-grad life a little smoother. Our picks cover essentials they might need for their first apartment or dorm — fromkitchenwaretotools— along with a few gifts toremindthemof home. We’ve also sprinkled in a ton of gadgets to set them up for success, includinge-readersandportable chargers. And because they’ve certainly earned some downtime, we’ve included a selection of other ideas to help them unwind and celebrate a job well done. A proper collection deserves a proper showcase, which is where Nanoleaf’s smart LED cases come in. Each reactive, stackable box can display tunable white lighting and up to 16 million hues, allowing you to bathe your shoes, figurines, and other items in whatever colors you see fit. And because it’s Nanoleaf, you’ll even be able to access the same smart features as the company’s bulbs. Who needs a Ruggable or a pricey Tibetan rug when you can get one emblazoned with Sora, Sonic, or a dual-wielding Master Chief? RugsRat’s circular rugs are soft, durable, and pay homage to video game series new and old. That includes classics likeHalo 2andGrand Theft Auto: Vice City, as well as newer releases such asElden RingandCyberpunk 2077. Hell, you can even design your own. Whether they’re outfitting their dorm room or an apartment, Ikea’s Skådis Pegboard Combination offers grads a sleek, space-saving way to stay organized. The spacious board comes with a set of containers, hooks, clips, and a shelf, all of which are perfect for neatly displaying everything from keys and sticky notes to cables, pens, and other accessories. Now that the school year is officially over, your giftee likely has a lot more time to binge. For that, we recommend the Google TV Streamer 4K, which boasts onboard Google Assistant, easy-to-use smart home controls, and the best interface of any streaming device available. The set-top box even features a handy button for pinging the remote, giving it an edge over your couch. With its spacious 11-inch display, Apple’s latest iPad makes it easy to dive into studying or unwind with your favorite TV shows. It delivers snappy performance courtesy of Apple’s A16 chip, letting you off emails, take notes, or binge-watch to your heart’s content. Plus, it has a solid front-facing camera this time, ensuring you can video call and stay in touch with loved ones back home with ease. Portable and powerful, the latest Beats Pill offers good sound and IP67 dust and water resistance, making it ideal for beach days or study sessions. It’s also packed with features geared toward grads on the go, including a speakerphone for hands-free calls and a USB-C port for charging other devices. It even supports Find My / Find My Device support on both iOS and Android, so they won’t have to worry about losing it. If they’re feeling homesick, the 6-inch Looking Glass Go can bring photos of family and friends to life like no ordinary picture frame can. Just upload an image from any iOS or Android device, and the app will transform it into a high-resolution hologram with the help of AI. You can even share your 3D pictures with loved ones, making it a meaningful way to stay connected from afar. A personalized hometown puzzle is the kind of gift that hits the sweet spot in terms of nostalgia. The 400-piece jigsaw puzzles encapsulate a 6 x 4-mile coverage area with a given address at the center, and because they’re based on USGS mapping, each shows roads, waterways, vegetation, transit, and other geographical tidbits your giftee should be all too familiar with. Whether you intend to use it for work trips or weekend getaways with friends, the Carry-On is a sleek, durable suitcase that makes travel easier. It’s packed with thoughtful touches — including a TSA-approved lock, 360-degree wheels, and a separate laundry bag — and it’s small enough to fit in most overhead bins yet spacious enough that you should have no trouble stowing everything you need for a three-day jaunt. A cluttered desk can make it hard to concentrate, which is why Anker’s 7-in-1 charging station is a great gift for grads. The 100W hub features a pair of USB-C and USB-A ports on the front and three AC outlets on the back, making it easy to power a 16-inch MacBook Pro, table lamp, phone, and other gadgets while keeping a tidy workspace. Hoto’s electric screwdrivers are a mainstay atThe Verge, and the company’s Hand Tool Set is just as eye-catching. All of the included components, from the needlenose pliers and claw hammer to the textured carrying case, showcase a handsome minimalist design that’s far more attractive than the usual white-label fare. It makes for an attractive starter kit, if nothing else. Classic team-based games like Codenames offer a good opportunity to break the ice with new schoolmates, whether you’re living with them or just linking up on the quad. The collaborative game charges two so-called “spymasters” with connecting a series of seemingly unrelated cards via a one-word clue, which their teammates must then uncover before the opposing team. It’s simple to learn but tough to master. Cuisinart’s cordless, 1,500W electric kettle lets you dial in the right temperature for whatever you’re drinking, be it coffee, a nice oolong, or a dorm room staple like instant ramen (no judgment here). The speedy stainless-steel kettle is loaded with six preset temps and an auto-shutoff timer, too, rendering it ideal for busy grads who always have to jet. The Last Lecturecaptures the moving wisdom that Randy Pausch, a professor and former computer scientist, shared with his students following his cancer diagnosis cancer in ’06. His inspiring words encourage readers to reflect on what truly matters and the kind of legacy they hope to leave behind, making it a thoughtful guide for any graduate trying to figure out their next steps in life. The Anker Laptop Power Bank is a lifesaver for anyone who works or studies on the go. With an impressive 25,000mAh capacity and 165W total output, it can quickly charge a beefy MacBook Pro to 50 percent capacity in just 30 minutes. Plus, with three USB-C ports and a USB-A port, you can power multiple devices at once, including phones, tablets, and handheld consoles. Whether they’re planning to take a well-earned vacation or just prone to losing things, an AirTag is a smart, stress-saving gift for any grad. The UWB Bluetooth trackers tap into Apple’s vast Find My network, letting you keep an eye out and quickly recover lost luggage, keys, passports, and other items using little more than a quick glance at your iPhone. Pantone’s vibrant, color-coded ceramic bowls provide a simple way to brighten up any kitchen cabinet… or bowl of Cap’n Crunch. The six sturdy, 5.75-inch bowls are also dishwasher-safe, making them suitable for everything from soup to messy study snacks. The Kalita Wave 185 Dripper might be the only thing that gets your college-bound grad through linguistics or ochem. It brews a rich, full cup of pour-over coffee using wave filters and a flat-bottom, three-hold design, which makes it the perfect companion for pulling all-nighters when the nearest cafe is closed. The Kobo Elipsa 2E isn’t just an e-reader — it’s the ideal study companion for grads heading to college or grad school. Its sizable 10.3-inch screen and included stylus makes annotating a breeze, while its ability to convert handwritten notes into typed text and solve math equations renders it an even more valuable tool for studying. The Switch 2 could make for a stellar gift for any grad — that is, if you can manage to preorder one ahead of the console’s arrival on June 5th. Nintendo’s latest hybrid console packs a larger 7.9-inch 1080p display, magnetic Joy-Con controllers, and a host of other minor but welcome improvements that build upon what was already a winning formula. The Skullcandy Method 360 ANC are basically a pair of Bose earbuds in disguise, which isn’t a bad thing. They offer well-balanced sound, great features, and a comfortable fit that effectively blocks out unwanted noise, much more so than previous Skullcandy offerings. I guess that’s what you get when you license technology and audio tuning from Bose. Everyone could use a good pan to cook their meals. With a Lodge skillet, your graduate can sear, sauté, bake, broil, braise, and fry all kinds of foods for years to come. Not only does the hardy 12-inch pan offer terrific heat distribution and retention, but it’s also safe to use in the oven or over an open fire. The included silicone handle is just an added plus that lets you ditch the oven mitts. Cotopaxi’s Nido Accessory Bag pairs wonderfully with work trips, road trips, and trips to a shared bathroom (hello, dorm life). The durable Dopp kit is great for holding both toiletries and tech accessories thanks to its zippered pocket and a bevy of small storage compartments, all of which let you store your essentials neatly in place. Circa’s leather notebook offers a level of customization few journals can match. Given the pages are secured via a series of discs along the spine, your grad can easily add or remove sheets and organize sections in a way that fits their unique lifestyle and needs. That means they can reorient their thoughts for class, their next job interview, and a variety of other situations. F*cking Planner Stickers can provide any grad who is trying to keep their life together (or at least look like they are) with a much-needed dose of humor. Bold, irreverent, and hilariously honest, they turn even the most mundane adulting tasks — from scheduling meetings to paying bills — into something a little less boring and a lot more fun. High-end robovacs with auto-empty docks and AI obstacle avoidance are great and all, but sometimes a classic handheld is all you need. Black & Decker’s rechargeable Furbuster is a great option for picking up fur, dirt, and other debris, especially since it offers a surprising amount of suction and an extra-long crevice tool for hitting those hard-to-reach areas. The Songmics Bamboo Bed Desk is great for sick days, late-night study sessions, and a formidable breakfast in bed. It’s equipped with an adjustable top and legs, along with a small side drawer for storing pens, snacks, and everything needed to stay productive — or unwind — without leaving bed. The Instax Mini 99 is the perfect instant camera for budding photogs who crave a little more control over their shots. It quickly prints credit card-sized photos and features dual shutter buttons, along with a multitude of brightness settings and color effects. It even offers a Sports Mode, allowing you to effortlessly capture shots of subjects who refuse to sit still. ©2025Vox Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved",

    "title": "It’s time for Logitech to make a real Forever Mouse",
    "article_text": "Logitech needs to do better than its meager deal with iFixit. Logitech needs to do better than its meager deal with iFixit. bySean Hollister Last fall, Logitech CEO Hanneke Faber wasroundly ridiculedafter suggesting the company would like to produce a“Forever Mouse” — a mouse with a monthly subscription fee for software updates. It seemed to betray a lack of understanding: many people who buy mice don’t want softwareat all, much less software they have to pay for; the idea they’d payevery monthis ridiculous. But as I sit here with a perfectly good Logitech mouse, the best I’ve ever owned, I’m starting to think some sort of “forever mouse” wouldn’t be such a bad idea. Logitech has an opportunity and a responsibility to make its mice last longer, and I have part of the proof right underneath my palm. I use a great mouse that is slowly disintegrating. In some ways, my wireless Logitech G502 Lightspeed is already a forever mouse. I may never have to charge or replace its battery again, becauseI use Logitech’s magic wireless charging mouse padto automatically keep its battery at the perfect level.I haven’t plugged in this mouse once in nearly three and a half years. Luckily, the mouse’s buttons and sensor have held up well over the same period, as far as I can tell. But the soft rubber grips that let me hold the gadget? After just a few years of use, they’re reaching the end. They’re worn down, so grubby and discolored that I can’t simply clean them anymore. Worst of all, one of the grips is beginning to delaminate from the mouse’s frame and is starting to peel off. It squishes uncomfortably under my thumb every time I grip the mouse. There’s one obvious solution: Logitech should sell replacement mouse parts. The company even claims it sells mouse parts via the repair site iFixit. Here is a quote from Logitech chief operating officer Prakash Arunkundrum in aniFixit press release: “Normal wear and tear is inevitable, which is why we strive to make it simpler for people to access original Logitech replacement parts for their devices.” But as of today, Logitech doesn’t actually sell the parts that would address “wear and tear.” Here is thecompletelist of partsyou can buyfor a Logitech mouse on iFixit: Don’t get me wrong, it’s refreshing to see official parts on the open market. But these aren’t the parts I, or anyone who wants to repair a Logitech mouse, truly need. We need grips. Buttons. Shells. Mouse wheels. And optimally, microswitch assemblies. These are the things that wear out over time — or all at once, if you have an unfortunate accident. Logitech and iFixit are also only selling three different kinds of mouse batteries. If you have a dying Logitech G900 mouse battery, like my wife, iFixit doesn’t have that part. Months ago, I reached out to both Logitech and iFixit to find out why the part offerings are so slim, but I didn’t get very far. Logitech declinedThe Verge’s request for an interview about its repair strategy, and iFixit didn’t want to speak out of turn. Here’s what Logitech did say, via spokesperson Leila Lewis: Yes, there are plans to add additional replacement parts for existing products supported by iFixit, as well as new products, to the Logitech Repair Hub on iFixit in the future. We actively explore and evaluate other critical repair components (such as switches, buttons, and scroll wheels) based on replacement feasibility and compliance requirements across geographies. iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens told me: Logitech is pretty responsive to what people are asking for. If there are particular parts people want, please speak up! We’ll work on expanding the selection. I told them both that for now, I simply need the grips. Several months later, Logitech’s part selection has not expanded. I haven’t found replacements anywhere (though Amazon will happily sell me some grip tape). I can’t imagine replacing an entire $100 mouse over a couple of pieces of rubber. If I have to, I probably won’t pick Logitech again. Peeling rubber coating is exactly why I had to stop using my beloved Logitech MX518 over a decade ago. I don’t expect mice to truly last forever, but I think it’s worth sending the world’s leading peripheral maker a message that you can’t build disposable products while claiming they’re repairable. How much loyalty could Logitech inspire if its mice were truly repairable? How many more mice might it sell if word got out that — like Logitech’s legendary C920 webcam — they were made to last? That if you buy Logitech, youdon’thave to trash a device that fits you like a glove,don’thave to keep retraining your hand for slightly different shapes of mouse? What if, at a minimum, Logitechshared 3D printer files like Philips just did with shavers, so we could print our own buttons and grips? Or do Logitech’s profits rely on people trashing perfectly good mice just because they’re starting to get gross, I wonder? I’d hate to think that. (The company’s financials don’t say.) Thankfully, Logitech now has a way to disprove that idea. Forever Mouse, but forget the subscription; embrace the idea that mice shouldlast.

    "title": "Huawei’s first trifold is a great phone that you shouldn’t buy",
    "article_text": "This feels like a form factor that’s here to stay. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byDominic Preston If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Let’s get one thing out of the way immediately: you shouldn’t buy Huawei’s trifold phone, the Mate XT. And that’s alright, because you probably couldn’t if you wanted to — while it’sno longer exclusive to China, it’s only on sale in a handful of countries, and not in the US or Europe. Besides, I can reel off a list of major problems with the Mate XT: at almost $4,000 it’s far too expensive, it doesn’t have native support for Google apps (though you can get around that more easily than you might think), it’s limited to 4G, and there are some pretty obvious reasons to worry about its durability. Any one of those individually would be a good reason to steer clear of buying the Mate XT. Taken together, they’re insurmountable. But this isn’t a phone you’remeantto buy, at least not outside China. It’s a phone you’re meant togawk at on the internet, to marvel at Huawei’s technological prowess, to ooh and ahh about its many and varied folds. This is Huawei showing off, proving to the world that it’s still got it. And in fairness, it has. 6 Verge Score A versatile tablet replacementImpressive battery lifeMuch thinner than you’d expect Incredibly expensiveNo Google support or 5GHow tough is it really? As I sit and write this — more than six months after Huaweifirst released the Mate XT in China— it’s still the only one of its kind. Rumor has it thatSamsung has a trifoldready to show off this year, but it hasn’t yet. And by the time it does, odds are Huawei will have spent a full year as the only player in the game. That might ring alarm bells in your head. This must be undercooked tech, you think, rushed out the door to beat everyone else to market. But the most surprising thing about the Mate XT is that it only occasionally feels first-gen. There’s a hint of it in the multitasking, which refuses to allow you to fully open three apps at a time, pinning each to one of the three screen segments. Or when the fully open screen often doesn’tquitego entirely flat, which is more annoying than any crease will ever be. And you notice it when you open the phone, or close it, and the app you’re using seems to briefly reboot itself, losing your spot in a long article or (once, infuriatingly) discarding a Letterboxd review that was almost entirely finished. I’ve learned not to change the configuration while doing something, just to be safe. But for the most part, these just don’t really matter. After several weeks using the Mate XT as my main phone, my primary impression is that it delivers on its promise, effectively offering three different devices in one. Fully closed, this is simply a regular phone with a 6.4-inch display. At 12.8mm thick, it has a little heft to it, but not unduly so — it’s less than a millimeter thicker thanSamsung’s Z Fold 6. It’s solid, and weighty, and even the cameras are decent. It’s as good a phone in this form as Samsung’s foldable, so long as you can live with sideloading the Play Store. When I’m reading a long article or trying to keep up in the editorial Slack channels, I open the phone up to a 7.9-inch, squarish display that’s a pretty close match for what other foldables offer. For me, this is the least useful setup of the three, a reminder that current book-style foldables offer something I don’t really want most of the time, extra screen space in all the wrong places. But that’s what the Mate XT’s full screen is for. Flipping one more section nets me a full 10.2-inch display, making this a thin, lightweight tablet I can fold up and fit in my pocket. It’s wider than it is tall, a close match for the aspect ratios in most streaming apps, ideal for watching videos and playing games, tripling the screen real estate for wide-screen entertainment. I haven’t traveled much in the time I’ve been working on this review, but this is a phone crying out for rail commutes and long-haul flights, a big-screenBalatromachine that fits in your pocket, not your backpack. Nine times out of ten, I use the Mate XT like a regular ol’ phone, and that extra screen space is probably wasted on me. But I don’t travel all that much, or make a habit of gaming on my phone; I wouldn’t make the most of this outside a handful of plane rides a year. Maybe you wouldn’t either, but I imagine anyone who already gets regular use out of both a phone and a tablet is feeling a little pull of temptation to merge them into one. The main thing people have asked me about the Mate XT, once they get over the foldiness of it all, is whether the battery sucks. In my experience, it absolutely doesn’t. The 5,600mAh capacity proves more than capable of lasting a full day (and then some), but I’ll refer you back to the previous paragraph — I’m not spending all day with the phone fully open. 5,600mAh is a decent battery for a phone, but a small one for a tablet, so if that’s your main use case, then you should expect to feel a bit more of a pinch. The second thing people ask is how likely it is to break. And compared to a regular phone, the answer is pretty likely! There’s a whole extra failure point in the second hinge, and no IP rating, so you can’t trust it to survive either water or dust. I’m more worried that one part of the soft, flexible screen is always exposed to the outside world. It’s going to get nicks, scratches, and dents, and there’s nothing you can do about it. My review unit already has a couple, and I’ve been babying the thing. I’d say you shouldn’t buy this unless you can afford to replace it, but again: you probably shouldn’t buy it at all. Maybe you should buy the next one. Or the one after that. Or one a few generations down the line. Or just the first one that isn’t made by Huawei, because fantastic as the company’s hardware can be, I’m still not convinced it’s worth giving up proper Google support. But while the Mate XT may be the first trifold, I’m confident it won’t be the last. And this hardware, with Google and 5G, for two-thirds the price, and a generation or two of durability improvements? You should buy that phone.

    "title": "It&#8217;s parry season",
    "article_text": "﻿Two great new games have great parrying systems. ﻿Two great new games have great parrying systems. byJay Peters If you like games with parrying, there are two great new ways to get your fix:Doom: The Dark AgesandClair Obscur: Expedition 33. These very different games — one is a fast-paced first-person shooter, the other a turn-based fantasy RPG — approach the mechanic in very different ways. Let’s start withDoom. One of the big new additions to the game is a giant shield for the Doom Slayer, and you can use it to block projectiles or enemy attacks. The game helpfully signals anything that you can parry in a bright neon green that’s easy to see as you’re rushing around and destroying hordes of demons. When a green projectile gets within range or an enemy does a green attack, you can press the parry button at the right time to deflect the danger with a huge reverberation of your shield and an action-movie-like moment of slow motion. Like most of modernDoom’s action, it all looks, feels, and sounds very satisfying. But parries are also critical for fights, as they can open up an opportunity to hit the enemy with a punch or a few shots from whatever monstrous gun you’re wielding. Stay keen for something green In intense battles, I’m always hunting for green glints to find things to parry to potentially gain an advantage. When an enemy shoots a spread of bullets with some green interspersed, I’ll even runtowardthe danger to get in a good deflection. Some weapon upgrades have perks tied to parries, too, giving you many incentives to stay keen for something green. Doom, very helpfully, has a setting that lets you change the timing for the parry window whenever you want. I have no shame in admitting that I’ve occasionally made the parry window as wide as the game allows; yes, it lowers the difficulty, but I like parrying every chance I can. Expedition 33’s parrying system is just as thrilling and impactful, but shifts from fast-paced action to turn-based battles. When it’s an enemy’s turn in a battle, they’ll often wind up their giant swords, axes, or fists for flashy, multistep attack combos, and you can parry each hit if you time things right. Every successful parry regains one AP, which you’ll spend during your turn to use skills. More powerful skills typically have higher AP costs, so the more blows you parry, the better equipped you’ll be on your next turn. Parry all of an enemy’s attacks on their turn and you’ll do a counter (which also has an action-movie-like slow-motion effect) that can be a very helpful way to chip away at a health bar. That’s not easy, though:Expedition 33’s gives you averytight window to press the parry button in time to block a hit, and if you miss the window, you’ll take some damage. Missing multiple parries on a single turn might drain your health bar from full to empty, and given how tricky the game’s enemies can get with staggering their hits or faking you out, that will probably happen often. The game lets you dodge enemy attacks, which has a much wider timing window, but you don’t gain AP and you won’t get a chance to counter. I found myself leaning toward parries far more than dodges: despite the risks, landing a successful series of parries, especially in a high-stakes battle, was usually worth the trial and error because of how cool it looked and how much it helped in a fight. I do wishExpedition 33had a setting to adjust the parrying windows just slightly (and if you’re on PC, there’sa mod that can help with that). But I also get why the timing is so tough: the rewards are high, but so are the costs. Parrying can be a divisive mechanic, especially when it’s challenging. That’s why people bounce off of games likeSekiro: Shadows Die TwiceandNine Sols. ButDoomandExpedition 33both offer new and interesting takes on the idea that show just how rewarding a good parry can be.

    "title": "Google I/O will be an AI show",
    "article_text": "Android is no longer front and center at Google’s developer conference. Android is no longer front and center at Google’s developer conference. byAllison Johnson Android is gettingits biggest visual update in years, and rather than unveiling it for the first time at its big annual developer conference, Google announced Material Three Expressive ata pre-show event broadcast on YouTubethe week before. If a major design language shift for the world’s most popular mobile OS doesn’t qualify as a headliner at I/O, then what does? You guessed it: AI. We expect Google to talk all about Gemini during I/O, which kicks off on Tuesday, and how it’s improving it and bringing it to products in areas that consumers will see even more. If you’ve paid attention to the past couple of I/O keynotes, this won’t be a surprise.Android was barely mentioned in 2023, and CEO Sundar Pichai said AIso many times that we lost count. Last year’s keynote was more of the same, except that Pichai saved us some trouble and counted mentions of AI for us. All of this reflects the very obvious, inescapable shift that Google and every other tech company have made recently to pump out AI features at a breakneck pace. But in a way, less news about the newest Android OS at I/O is actually a good thing. Google has made a big effort in recent years to bring new features to more phones — even if they aren’t running the latest OS. Companies like Samsung and Motorola roll out new OS versions on their own schedules, so adding new features through Google Play and app updates means they’ll reach people faster. Onekey criticism of Androidin previous years was slow feature rollouts that often entirely failed to reach many users. Google alsoadopted a new schedule this yearfor Android 16, moving to a major release in Q2 and a minor release in Q4, which should help more devices take advantage of new features. If this year’s I/O really is an AI show, then there’s a risk it’s going to feel like one we’ve seen before. The past two years of software and hardware from seemingly every consumer tech company have been nonstop AI pep rallies. We’ve seen a lot of previews of features that are supposedly just around the corner. Then, when it’s time to actually ship them… well,ask Apple how that’s going. To Google’s credit, it has certainly shipped lots of AI features. The company has a lot of surfaces for it, too — from the XR platform we’re expecting to hear more about (that’s the glasses it has teased several times), to Chrome, Gmail, and Meet. There’s a lot of ground to cover. I get the feeling, though, that we’re reaching a tipping point, one where promises of all the time and effort that AI will save us are wearing a little thin. But if nothing else, I appreciate that Google went out of its way to give Android time to shine before the big show — rather than relegating it to a handful of mentions between AI feature updates.

    "title": "Meta faces Democratic probe into plans to power a giant data center with gas",
    "article_text": "New gas plants could be built to power the company’s largest data center yet. New gas plants could be built to power the company’s largest data center yet. byJustine Calma Meta’s building a new AI data center so massive in Louisiana that the local utility company has plans to construct three new gas-fired power plants to provide it with enough electricity. Now, advocates and lawmakers are pressing Meta for answers about how it’ll clean up pollution stemming from the data center’s energy consumption. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, shot off aletterto Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday demanding answers about how much energy the data center would use and the greenhouse gas emissions that would be generated. Powering the new data center with gas “flies in the face of Meta’s climate commitments,” the letter says. Tech companies are rushing to build out data centers to train and run new AI tools,driving up electricity demand. In this case, power utility Entergy wants to meet that demand with new gas infrastructure, raising concerns about the impact Meta’s data center will have on the environment and local residents. “We urgently need corporate responsibility” “Meta’s backslide from its own climate pledges risks triggering broader economic harm at a time when we urgently need corporate responsibility,” Sen. Whitehouse said in a statement emailed toThe Verge. In 2020, Metapledgedto reach net-zero emissions across its operations, supply chain, and consumer use of its products by the end of the decade. But the company’s carbon footprint is larger now than it was when it set that goal, according to its latestsustainability report, as itdoubles down on AI. The company has tried toreduce its emissions by matching its electricity use with equal purchases of renewable energy.It’s a strategy Meta and other big companies often take: pay to support new clean energy projects to try to cancel out the environmental effects of your facilities plugging into a power grid that runs on dirty energy. Environmental advocates are increasingly concerned that this strategy still burdens communities with local pollution, and that the pressure to meet rising electricity demand from AI is boosting fossil fuel use rather than renewable energy. We’re seeing that tussle play out in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where Meta has plans to build its largest data center to date. It’sspending $10 billion on the project, the companyannouncedin December. Once complete, the campus would span 4 million square feet, about as large as70 football fields. But the project is moot unless Meta can ensure there will be enough electricity available for all those servers, a problem it’s working with Entergy to solve. Entergyproposed building three entirely new gas plantswith a total capacity of 2,260 megawatts to support the data center, but it has to get regulatory approval first. Some advocates contend that there hasn’t been enough transparency around Meta’s data center plans to help the public understand the potential impact on the local power grid. The New Orleans-based Alliance for Affordable Energy and the Union of Concerned Scientistsfiledamotionin March asking the Louisiana Public Service Commission to add Meta as an official party to proceedings over whether to approve construction of the new gas plants. Doing so would compel the company to disclose more information, and the commission is scheduled to consider the motion on Monday. “It’s hard to wrap your brain around [whether] a facility like this either might be good for your community or bad for your community without understanding the possible impact to your electrical system, your bills, and your water,” says Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy. There are alreadyforecasts that rapidly growing data center electricity demand could raise electricity billsin the US. Meta said in December that it would contribute $1 million a year to an Entergyprogramthat helps older adults and people with disabilities afford their bills. Data centers have also been notoriouswater-guzzlers, although Meta says it would invest in projects to restore more water than it would consume. Sen. Whitehouse’s letter, meanwhile, asks Meta to answer a list of questions by May 28th. On top of questions about the data center’s electricity use and greenhouse gas emissions, Whitehouse wants to know what the justification is for building gas-fired power plants rather than renewable energy alternatives. And it presses Meta to explain how the proposal aligns with its 2030 climate goal. Meta maintains that it’ll continue matching its electricity use with support for renewable energy, including a commitment to help fund 1,500 megawatts of new solar and battery resources in Louisiana. It also said it would help fund the cost of adding technology to at least one power plant that would capture carbon dioxide emissions. Whitehouse wants to know how much funding it will provide and how much carbon will be captured. Carbon capture tech has beenprohibitively expensiveto deploy and costs are often offset byusing the captured CO2 to produce more fossil fuels through a process called enhanced oil recovery. “We received the letter and look forward to providing a response,” Meta spokesperson Ashley Settle said in an email toThe Verge. “We believe a diverse set of energy solutions are necessary to power our AI ambitions – and we continue to explore innovative technology solutions.” Entergy didn’t immediately respond to inquiries fromThe Verge.It has agoalof making sure that 50 percent of its generating capacity is carbon pollution-free by 2030. But the utility said that gas “is the lowest reasonable cost option available that can support the 24/7 electrical demands of a large data center like Meta,” in astatement toFast Company, which first reported on Whitehouse’s letter.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 17, 2025 / 7:39 PM EDT/ CBS/AP After finishing as runner-up at theKentucky Derbyearlier this month, the heavy-favorite Journalism earned a thrilling victory Saturday atthe 150th Preakness Stakesat Baltimore's Pimlico Race Course, the second leg of the Triple Crown. Journalism, who entered with 8-5 odds, came from behind down the stretch to defeat a field of eight other horses. Gosger was second by a half-length after getting passed by Journalism just before the wire. Sandman was third and Goal Oriented fourth. Journalism went 1 3/16 miles in 1:55.37. Journalism gave trainer Michael McCarthy his second Preakness victory. It is Umberto Rispoli's first in a Triple Crown race, and he is the first jockey from Italy to win one of them. Notably absentfrom the race, however, was Sovereignty, the 3-year-old colt who won the Kentucky Derby. Sovereignty is still expected to run in the Belmont Stakes on June 7 at the Saratoga Race Course in New York, setting up a possible and much-awaited rematch with Journalism. This is the fifth time in seven years that the Preakness, for various reasons, was contested without a Triple Crown bid at stake. But Journalism staked his claim for 3-year-old horse of the year by winning the $2 million American classic race run at the old Pimlico Race Course for the last time before it's torn down and rebuilt. The Preakness is set to be held at nearby Laurel Park, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., next year before a planned return to the new Pimlico in 2027. Journalism thrived on a warm day that dried out the track after torrential rain fell at Pimlico for much of the past week. Those conditions suited him better than the slop at Churchill Downs in the Derby. Journalism is the first horse to win the Preakness after running in the Kentucky Derby since Mark Casse-trained War of Will in 2019. Only two others from the 19 in the Derby participated in the Preakness: Casse's Sandman and fellow Hall of Famer D. Wayne Lukas' American Promise. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    "title": "Rubio says U.S. will find out if Russia is \"tapping us along\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 17, 2025 / 5:54 PM EDT/ CBS News Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke on the phone Saturday with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, to get a readout on the latest talks, as the U.S. tries to determine whether Russia is \"tapping us along\" in efforts to end thewar in Ukraine. \"We talked about a variety of things,\" Rubio told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in aninterviewairing Sunday. \"I wanted to get his readout on his view of how the talks went yesterday. They were not a complete waste of time.\" The phone call between the countries' top diplomats occurred a day after Moscow and Kyiv held the first direct talks in three years. Russian President Vladimir Putin spurned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offer to meet face-to-face in Turkey after he proposed direct negotiations and instead sent a lower-level delegation. The talks in Istanbul Friday broke up after fewer than two hours without a ceasefire, although both sides agreed on exchanging 1,000 prisoners of war each. The United States — along with its European allies — have been pushing Russia and Ukraine for an end to the three-year war. President Trump, who has expressed frustration with the stalled talks and threatened to stiffen American sanctions unless progress is made toward a peace deal, said Saturday he will be speaking with Putin by phone Monday. That call will be followed by one with Zelenskyy, Mr. Trump said. \"Are they tapping us along? Well, that's what we're trying to find out,\" Rubio told Brennan when asked if Russia and Ukraine are seeking to talk to \"buy time.\" \"We'll find out pretty soon.\" He added, \"On the one hand, we're trying to achieve peace and end a very bloody, costly and destructive war. So, there's some element of patience that is required. On the other hand, we don't have time to waste. There are a lot of other things happening in the world that we also need to be paying attention to.\" The secretary of state said he believes the only way that these talks will move forward is if Mr. Trump and Putin meet in person. He said Mr. Trump has publicly offered to meet one-on-one. \"The mechanics of setting that kind of meeting up would require a little bit of work, so I can't say that's being planned as we speak in terms of picking a site and a date,\" Rubio said. \"But the president wants to do it. He wants to do it as soon as feasible.\" The Vatican has made a\"very generous offer\"to host any peace talks. Rubio, who is in Rome to attend the Mass for the inauguration of Pope Leo XIV Sunday, said the Vatican would be a place that \"all parties would feel comfortable.\" Leo, who was elected as thefirst U.S.-born pope on May 8, took up Pope Francis' call for peace in Ukraine in his first Sunday noon blessing as pope. He appealed for all sides to do whatever possible to reach \"an authentic, just and lasting peace.\" Lucia Suarez Sang is an associate managing editor at CBSNews.com.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Saturday said that he'll speak separately to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday as he ramps up efforts to help the two nations reach a ceasefire. \"I will be speaking, by telephone, to President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Monday, at 10:00 a.m.,\" Trumpwrotein an all-caps post on Truth Social on Saturday, adding, \"I will then be speaking to President Zelenskyy of Ukraine.\" Trump said he would speak to Putin about \"stopping the 'bloodbath' that is killing, on average, more than 5,000 Russian and Ukrainian soldiers a week, and trade.\" “Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end,” he added. Trump has urged Zelenskyy and Putin for months to reach a ceasefire deal to end the three-year war. Ending the war was akey campaign promiseof Trump's during the 2024 presidential election cycle. Officials from Russia and Ukraine met in Istanbul on Fridaytoholdtheir first direct talkssince the war began. The two sides reached an agreement for a prisoner swap but did not appear to be significantly closer to setting terms for a permanent ceasefire. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Saturday about peace talks, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said. Putin did not attend the Istanbul talks. Trump told reporters on Friday that he and the Russian president \"have to meet.\" \"He and I will meet. I think we’ll solve it, or maybe not,\" Trump added. The president has for weeks escalated rhetoric against Putin, blasting him for striking Ukraine as U.S. officials tried to initiate talks between both sides. “Vladimir, STOP!” Trumpwrotein one April post after Russia bombarded Ukraine in attacks that killed at least 12 people. Trump met with Zelenskyy for a private conversation on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral in Rome in April. After that meeting, the U.S. presidentquestionedPutin's commitment to ending the war in Ukraine, writing in another Truth Social post that recent Russian strikes, \"[make] me think that maybe he doesn’t want to stop the war, he’s just tapping me along.\" Earlier in his administration, Trump and top U.S. officials, like Vice President JD Vance, targeted their ire about the ongoing war toward Zelenskyy, with a late-February White House meeting between the three mendevolvinginto a shouting match. Last month, Ukraine and the U.S.reached a dealon an \"economic partnership\" between the two nations involving Ukraine's rare earth minerals.

    "title": "Austria wins Eurovision with JJ's operatic club jam 'Wasted Love'",
    "article_text": "BASEL, Switzerland — Austria was crowned the winner at Saturday’s grand finale of theEurovision Song Contest, the world’s most popular singing tournament, beating strong competition from Israeland Switzerlandto come in first place on an evening full of glitz and glamour. Austria’s song, “Wasted Love” by JJ, was awarded 436 points by a combination of votes from viewers and juries of music professionals from each participating country. JJ is a countertenor opera singer, and the song makes use of his impressive vocal range. It starts with a swelling orchestral sound that builds to a dance club finish. Despite widespread rumors and high anticipation for a homecoming appearance by Celine Dion, who won the contest while representing Switzerland in 1988 (artists don’t have to be from the country they represent), the Canadian star was unable to attend. The singer has curtailed her recent public appearances due to a diagnosis of stiff-person syndrome. She had earliersent a video message, played during Tuesday’s semifinal, in which she said she “would love nothing more” than to attend Eurovision, calling winning the contest “life-changing.” Every country that competes in Eurovision also votes on the winner,  meaning rivalries and regional alliances from the real world spill over into the results. Allies Greece and Cyprus have a long history of giving each other 12 points (the most possible), which is often met with boos from the crowd. Only Greece made it to this year’s final, and Cyprus gave it 12 points. On the other hand, neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan, which have fought wars over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, has awarded its neighbor more than a handful of points. This year, Azerbaijan didn’t make it to the final. Azerbaijan yet again did not give any jury points to Armenia. The most geopolitically divisive entrant was Israel’s Yuval Raphael, whose song “New Day Will Rise” is about finding hope after tragedy. While the song does not mention any specific events, Raphael survived the Hamas-led terror attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and another 250 were taken hostage. Israel’s subsequent assault on Gaza has killed over 53,000 people and has brought the surviving population of about 2 million to the brink of starvation. For many critics, Israel’s inclusion in Eurovision is tantamount to accepting its military campaign, and protesters demand Israel’s expulsion from the contest, just as Russia was in 2022 following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Raphael’s song, which was met with scattered boos as well as cheers, came in second place, racking up 357 points. There were gasps of disbelief in the audience when the other top contender, Switzerland, was awarded no points from the public. Sweden’s failure to triumph was a surprise amid its favored status, buoyed by KAJ’s “Bara Bada Bastu,” a humorous ode to the Nordic tradition of going to the sauna. The performance by the act’s trio of Finns featured a faux sauna complete with backup dancers in towels — a vision of European culture, just not a winning one on Saturday. The event was a jamboree of glitz and showbiz glamour, with fans from across the continent cheering on their favored contestants as a TV audience of hundreds of millions watched at home and at viewing parties. Eurovision began in Switzerland in 1956as a way to test new television technology, and to help bring postwar Europe together. At the time, the contest only featured seven countries. This year, there were 37 nations taking part, whittled down to 26 finalists over two semifinals earlier this week. And the production is now a behemoth, with hundreds of crew members and 22 cameras capturing the action. The first act to perform was Kyle Alessandro, a 19-year-old from Norway, who took the stage wearing chain mail for a pyrotechnic-enhanced rendition of his entry, “Lighter.” His song kicked off a show that included a number of memorable performances, including that of Finland’s Erika Vikman, whose sexually charged “Ich Komme” ends with her suspended in the air atop a giant microphone stand emitting sparks. Poland’s Justyna Steczkowska made her return to Eurovision after 30 years with a “Game of Thrones”-inspired performance that saw the 52-year-oldlifted into the air by ropes as a CGI dragon swooped behind her on an 8,000-square-foot LED video wall. Some 163 millionpeople watched the Eurovision final and the two semifinals last year. Final viewing figures are not yet available for this year’s competition, but it is sure to remain one of the most-watched events in the world. It attracts more viewers than the Super Bowl, which had123.4 millionviewers last year, according to CBS. That viewership will likely see \"Wasted Love\" climb the charts across Europe. For some Eurovision winners like Dion and ABBA, international stardom awaits. Most artists aren’t quite that lucky, but the massive platform means winners can see levels of fame they would otherwise only dream of. Italian rock band Måneskin performed on “Saturday Night Live” after winning the 2021 contest, and Dutch singer Duncan Laurence performed his winning 2019 song “Arcade” on NBC’s “TODAY” show when it started climbing U.S. charts after going viral on TikTok. For the 25 artists who didn’t win, there’s still the hope that they’ll have found new fans. Holly-Anne Hull, a member of this year’s British act, Remember Monday, told NBC News in a Zoom interview last month that for her group, the outcome is secondary to the opportunity to be able to perform together on the world stage. “We aren’t even doing it for the live show. We’re doing it for the fact that we can live in this band every single day up until that moment,” she said. “All we’ve ever dreamed of is doing this band full time.”",

    "title": "A war hero was killed in a Texas parking lot. Why was the gunman not arrested?",
    "article_text": "For more than five years, Abdul Rahman Waziri put his life on the line to protect U.S. Green Berets. He was a member of an elite unit of Afghans trained to detect hidden explosives — considered the tip of the tip of the spear in America’s bloody fight against the Taliban. Waziri was also one of the lucky ones. Unlike many other Afghans who worked for the U.S. military, he made it out of the country during America’s chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He settled in Houston with his wife, where they were raising their two young girls. But on April 27, Waziri, 31, was fatally shot outside his apartment complex in a dispute about parking. The shock and heartbreak felt by his family has been compounded by what they consider to be a baffling decision by law enforcement to release the gunman with no charges. “It’s ridiculous,” said Waziri’s brother, Abdullah Khan. “In Afghanistan, we have no law at all. But if someone gets murdered, the person will not be free.” Houston policesaid in a statementthat following the shooting, officers at the scene were approached by a man who identified himself as the shooter and said he and Waziri were “arguing over parking.” Officers interviewed the man and took possession of his gun but then let him go. “After consulting with the Harris County District Attorney’s Office, the male was released and [Houston Police Department] investigators will continue their investigation,” the police added. They have not released his name. Three weeks later, no action has been taken. The authorities have not made any other public statements despite mounting pressure from the area’s growing Afghan community as well asGreen Berets who worked with Waziri. “He was a lion of a man but also one of the most gentle warriors I have ever seen,” said Ben Hoffman, a former Green Beret who went on missions with Waziri in 2019. “This guy risked his life for us,” Hoffman added. “And for him to survive all of that and make it out of Afghanistan and then just die in cold blood outside an apartment complex in Houston — what is going on here?” Damali Keith, a spokeswoman for the Harris County District Attorney’s Office, said: “We are still awaiting additional information from investigators before making a charging decision.” The Houston Police Department did not respond to a request for comment. The shooting took place just before 9:10 p.m. at the Gables at Richmond Apartments, where Waziri had been living since last year. A surveillance camera captured Waziri driving into the parking area in a white Toyota Camry. He pulled the car to a stop and put on his blinkers. According to his brother, he was coming home from the gym. Waziri was likely going to grab his mail and then park in a spot closer to his apartment, his brother said. But about 30 seconds after Waziri’s car pulled in, a black Kia sedan turned into the parking lot. It came to a stop directly behind Waziri’s vehicle, according to the surveillance footage, which was provided by the family's attorney. What happened next is not entirely clear. The area where the cars were stopped can’t be seen on the video because of a structure looming over the parking lot. But Waziri can be seen walking away from his car, with the other man trailing behind him. They stop and exchange words while pointing in the direction of their vehicles. Then Waziri continues walking away and the other man returns to where their cars were parked. Seconds later, Waziri looks back in that direction and then walks back toward his car. It’s unclear what happens over the next 55 seconds. But near the end, the other man’s shoes can be seen moving in the direction of his car and then back toward Waziri’s. Shortly afterward, the other man was captured on the video walkingaway from the scene. “It shocks me that this man was not arrested,” said the Waziri family attorney, Omar Khawaja. Khawaja said he spoke to a witness and escorted that person to police headquarters five days after the shooting. The witness provided the following account to investigators, according to Khawaja. After the initial confrontation captured on video, the other man began to kick Waziri’s car. That’s what prompted Waziri to walk back to the vehicles. A physical struggle ensued, with Waziri getting the upper hand, and then the other man returned to his car and retrieved a gun. Waziri put his hands up and said something along the lines of, “Don’t shoot,” but the gunman opened fire anyway. NBC News’ efforts to reach the witness were not successful. Police said Waziri was shot “more than one time,” and officers discovered his body lying next to his white Toyota. Khawaja, the family’s attorney, said Waziri was unarmed at the time; he owned a gun but it was at home. Khawaja said he is aware of at least one otherwitness who is too afraid to come forward. “You can imagine the kind of paralysis and fear the community feels,” Khawaja said. “The guy who just killed this man is still living in the community and with no consequences whatsoever. That’s a chilling effect on witnesses.” Under Texas law, a person has a right to use deadly force if it is believed to be “immediately necessary” to protect against another’s “use or attempted use of unlawful force.” David Crump, a professor at the University of Houston Law Center, said another factor looms large in a prosecutor’s decision on whether to bring charges: Did the person initiate the altercation? “If someone initiates a quarrel and ends up shooting a guy who was unarmed, it seems strange to me that the shooter was not arrested,” Crump said. “But I have to add that we don’t know all the facts.” The killing hassparked protestsin Houston, where thousands of Afghans have settled after fleeing their homeland. It also prompted some of Waziri’s Green Beret friends to write letters to Houston Mayor John Whitmore demanding justice. One of those retired Green Berets, Vince Leyva, said in an interview that he used to call Waziri a “gentle giant.” “I’m 6-foot-1 and he towered over me,” said Leyva. “But he was so calm, so well-spoken. He was not a guy who would argue, which is why this really baffles me.” Waziri and the other Afghan members of the National Mine Reduction Group, or NMRG, would be out in front of U.S. Special Forces members during missions. Their job was to identify and disable improvised explosive devices, but they sometimes found themselves in firefights during Taliban ambushes. Beyond the risk of getting killed on the job, they were frequently hunted down by insurgents. “Everyone knew who the NMRG were, especially the Taliban,” said Leyva, who helped train the Afghans. “They always had targets on their backs, but they were proud to do their job.” Waziri was so good at it that he was selected to be an instructor, Leyva said, a role he had until U.S. forces withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021. Waziri was looking out for others even in his last few days in his homeland as the Taliban swiftly seized major cities, according to Shireen Connor, who was part of a grassroots team of veterans and others who helpedto coordinate the evacuations of Afghans. “The streets of Kabul were engulfed in panic,” Connor said in a letter to the Houston mayor. “In the midst of this, Mr. Waziri, a high-profile Taliban target, was setting up safe houses not for himself but for our evacuees. Always helping other people in the face of significant personal peril. How do you define a human being like this?” After the shooting, Waziri’s wife and two young daughters — 4-year-old Bahar and her 9-month-old baby sister, Zoya — flew to Florida to stay with his brother. “His wife is in very bad condition now,” said Khan, the brother. “She’s still panicking.” Khan and Waziri’s wife have yet to tell Bahar that her father is dead. And so, nearly every day, the little girl asks her mother and uncle a string of heartbreaking questions. Where is my father? When is he coming home? Please, can you just call him?",

    "article_text": "Two weeks after entering the Kentucky Derby as the favorite only to finish second, Journalism appeared beaten again entering the final straightaway at Saturday’s Preakness Stakes, the middle leg of horse racing’s Triple Crown. Once trailing by as many as five lengths, Journalism was still far behind Gosger at the top of the homestretch as it squeezed between Clever Again and Goal Oriented — the horses so close they and their jockeys rubbed together — before finally finding open ground. From there, with jockey Umberto Rispoli urging him on, Journalism ran down Gosger at the post, needing all of the course’s 1 3/16th miles to author a stunning comeback victory at the 150th Preakness at Baltimore’s Pimlico Race Course. It was the second Preakness victory for Journalism's trainer, Michael W. McCarthy, who previously won in 2021 with Rombauer. As the gap between the leader and Journalism widened, McCarthy said he was resigned to a loss. “My initial thought was, ‘Proud of the horse,’” McCarthy said. “‘Great effort, just gonna come up a little bit short.’” Except, the race was far from over. Gosger finished second, with Sandman third. “The horse is a champion,” Aron Wellman, a co-owner of Journalism, said on NBC in the winner’s circle. “Our jockey Umberto Rispoli is a champion. Our trainer Michael McCarthy is a champion.” Rispoli became the first jockey from Italy to win a Triple Crown race. “I wish everybody over there are proud of me,” Rispoli said. Journalism outlasted eight other competitors, a small field that did not include Derby winner Sovereignty, after trainer Bill Mott withdrew the horse due to the short turnaround between races. It marked the third time in the last four years that the Derby winner skipped the Preakness. The Triple Crown, Mott said earlier this month, is “not something we’re not going to think about.” It was the fifth time in the last seven years that the Preakness started without a true shot at the Triple Crown, a trend that has sparkeda debateabout whether the two-week turnaround between Triple Crown races has become antiquated. The field of nine horses was still anticipated as the trainers — including Bob Baffert and his record eight Preakness victories, and D. Wayne Lukas, who has won seven times at Pimlico over 44 years — had amassed a combined 19 previous Preakness victories. Journalism was still considered the favorite following the Derby and opened with 8-5 odds Saturday morning. By race time, it had become an even bigger favorite at 6-5. Yet its path to victory was made difficult only a quarter of a mile in Saturday, as Clever Again led entering the first turn, followed closely by Gosger and River Thames, with Journalism sixth. Both Rispoli, the jockey, and McCarthy, the trainer, said in post-race interviews they believed their horse was in trouble and might run hard, only to come in second, as at the Derby. Yet Journalism was in first at the end, right on deadline.",

    "title": "Caitlin Clark says flagrant foul for shoving Angel Reese was not 'malicious'",
    "article_text": "INDIANAPOLIS — The Caitlin Clark-Angel Reese rivalry added another chapter Saturday when Reese took exception to Clark’s hard foul with 4:38 left in the third quarter as the Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky opened their seasons. After Reese grabbed an offensive rebound, Clark slapped Reese across the arm, knocking the ball away and Reese to the floor. Reese then jumped up and confronted Clark as Fever center Aliyah Boston jumped in between the two players. Following a replay review, the referees upgraded the foul to a flagrant one and called double technical fouls on Boston and Reese. It was Clark’s third personal foul. During an in-game interview with ESPN, Clark said there was “nothing malicious” about the foul. “It’s just a good take foul,” Clark said. “You know, either Angel gets a wide open two points, or we send them to the free-throw line. Nothing malicious about it. It’s just a good take foul. Every basketball player knows that.” When Reese missed the first of two throws, Gainbridge Fieldhouse erupted in cheers. Reese made the second, though, and Chicago added a layup on the ensuing possession to cut the deficit to 56-45. Clark had 12 points, four rebounds, three assists and a career-high tying three blocks in the first half. Reese had seven points and nine rebounds through the first two quarters.",

    "title": "At least 27 dead as tornadoes and thunderstorms strike three states",
    "article_text": "At least 27 people have perished in severe weather that swept from the lower Midwest to the South over the weekend, with Missouri and Kentucky suffering the worst of it, authorities said. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said the number of weather-related fatalities — he attributed them to a single tornado initially believed to have touched down at EF3 strength overnight — had risen from 14 to 18 by late Saturday afternoon. \"It has taken far too many lives,\" Beshear said. \"Homes that there isn’t a single wall standing. Homes that have all four walls yet lost the person inside.\" The governor said 17 of the fatalities were in Laurel County and one was in Pulaski County. One of the deceased was a Laurel County firefighter, Beshear said. Officials in Missouri reported seven weather-related fatalities since Friday, including five in St. Louis County and two in Scott County. In Virginia, where parts of the state were subjected to the same system of unstable air, thunderstorms, and powerful winds, two people were killed in separate incidents involving falling trees that struck vehicles, authorities said. The fatalities were reported in Fairfax County and in Fort Hunt, the latter along a section of George Washington Memorial Parkway that's under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Park Police. Beshear promised that the state's resources are being deployed to help Kentuckians affected by the severe weather. He said 10 people remained in critical condition after suffering weather-related injuries in Kentucky. A spokesperson for St. Louis Children’s Hospital and Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, said the facilities received over 60 patients in total, with the children’s facility treating 15 and Barnes-Jewish seeing more than 50. Two of the patients at Children's Hospital were in critical condition. All others have been discharged, the spokesperson said on Saturday. Most of the patients at Barnes-Jewish have been discharged or will be soon, the spokesperson said. St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer said the severe weather, including two reported tornadoes in the area on Friday, affected an estimated 5,000 buildings in the city. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement Saturday that she has spoken with the governors of Missouri, Kentucky and Illinois and offered them \"federal resources and action for the deadly tornadoes and storms.\" \"We discussed how while emergency management is best led by local authorities, we reinforced that DHS stands ready to take immediate action to offer resources and support,\" Noem said. The severe weather was the result of an east-moving system of unstable air set off by a clash of warmth to the south and west and a cooler front to the north, federal forecasters said. The National Weather Service said 28 tornadoes were reported on Friday. More than 63,000 utility customers in Missouri and 58,000 in Kentucky were without power on Saturday, according to utility trackerPowerOutage.us.",

    "title": "Critics question why exhibits at the African American History Museum are rotating out",
    "article_text": "Before sunrise in Baltimore on Friday, the Rev. Robert Turner, senior pastor of the Empowerment Temple AME Church, set out to walk 43 miles from his church to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Turner, who has made the trip from Baltimore to D.C. more than 30 times to call for reparations for Black people across America because of the consequences of slavery, made the 14-hour journey this week to protest what he says is an attempt by the Trump administration to erase important American history. For him, the future of the museum that he and many other Black people lovingly call the “Blacksonian” is worth every step. “If you don’t know the horrors that we went through, the hell, then you might not see the need for repairing,” Turner said. “It’s important for President Trump to know this issue of saving the Blacksonian and the issue of repairing America, and creating a culture of repair is very important to saving the soul of America.” The context: Decades-old artifacts related to slavery and civil rights are rotating out of exhibits at the museum as apotential White House reviewlooms. In late March, President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding in part that the museum take down any exhibits that “divide Americans based on race.” But now, the White House says it is not involved in any changes at the museum, while Democrats in Congress are sounding the alarm, signing a letter andintroducing legislation to protect civil rights landmarks. NBC News went inside the museum and found at least 32 artifacts that were once on display have been removed. They include Harriet Tubman’s book of hymns filled with gospels that she is believed to have sung as she led enslaved people to freedom through the underground railroad, as well as a cloth made by enslaved people and a photo of the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Also removed was the “Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,” the memoir by one of the most important leaders in the abolition movement. Both items were gifted to theSmithsonian. In a statement, White House spokesperson Lindsey Halligan said, “The White House had no involvement in removing any exhibit from the National Museum of African American History and Culture or any other Smithsonian institution. They did this on their own accord.” The museum pushed back on criticism, saying onitswebsitethat “claims that objects have been removed for reasons other than adherence to standard loan agreements or museum practices are false.” It also listed11 new artifacts coming on display later this month, including a photograph focused on how mass incarceration impacts Black people, a painting depicting a Ku Klux Klan figure, and artwork dedicated to Emmett Till, a 14-year-old Black boy from Chicago murdered by white men in 1955 while visiting family in Mississippi after the teen was accused of trying to flirt with a white woman. In an email to NBC News, the museum reiterated that rotating objects is normal. But Turner isn’t convinced. “We have to now say enough is enough, and America is better than this, Black and white,” he said. “We are stronger than this. If our children can endure being lynched, then white children can endure a classroom that teaches that America used to lynch kids.” Liz Brazelton, the owner of a diary connected to the Oscar-winning film “12 Years a Slave,” isn’t convinced either. She’s the great-great-granddaughter of the lawyer who helped free Solomon Northup, a free Black man who was kidnapped and forced into slavery. “I grew up with the diaries,” Brazelton said. “The most important thing in his diaries was the fact that he did help free this man who was a free man of color. And it’s just an amazing story. And in central Louisiana, it’s quite a prominent story. And I’m very proud of it.” She gave one of her great-great-grandfather’s diaries to the museum in September 2015 on a 10-year loan. The museum sent her a letter in March, before the end of the term, saying, “We have decided to move ahead with the return a bit early to coincide with our internal gallery rotation schedule.” The letter was sent two weeks before Trump signed the executive order targeting exhibits at the Smithsonian, which raised a red flag for Brazelton. “When I saw the executive order, I wondered if they maybe knew something was going to happen and they rotated it out early because it was about slavery, that entire exhibit,” she said. The Smithsonian declined NBC News’ request for an interview. But it repeated in an email that the diary move was a scheduled rotation to “allow for necessary rest following an extended display period.” Brazelton said she was never told between 2016 and 2025 that her family’s diary was ever taken off of exhibit or rotated out. She believes it had stayed in the exhibit until recently. The Rev. Amos C. Brown, a prominent pastor and civil rights leader, lent two of his books to the museum when it opened in 2016. The items included his father’s Bible, which is more than 100 years old and was carried by Brown during protests with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., as well as a book on the history of Black people that was written in the 1800s. “I was feeling that through this museum, America will see me, will see Black people,” Brown said. “We have been and are architects, designers of great things. … We took a negative and turned it into a positive, and telling the story of how people achieved great things in spite of oppression, in spite of those evil things that were done to us, that’s what that museum represents.” Earlier this year, theSmithsonian sent him an email saying it would return his books.The museum called it a “standard practice,” adding that the loan expired in May. Still, Brown called that explanation an excuse, noting to NBC News that the museum has always chosen to renew the loan until now. “I feel it to be very much inhumane, disrespectful and downright unjust,” he said of the decision to end the loan. After his public pushback, the museum offered to keep the books permanently, according to a letter reviewed by NBC News. The broader controversy is becoming increasingly political. House Democrats are demanding Vice President JD Vance, who now sits on the board of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, not take steps to overhaul the museum. In a letter, the lawmakers said, “This flagrant attempt to erase Black history is unacceptable and must be stopped.” Rep. Terri Sewell, an Alabama Democrat who sits on a House committee that conducts oversight of the Smithsonian Institution, was among the lawmakers who signed the letter. “To tell the truth means to share the good and the bad. And if we don’t tell our stories, who will tell our stories?” she said. Meanwhile, Turner plans to continue making his monthly, hourslong pilgrimage from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., to shine a brighter spotlight on the museum’s artifacts getting pulled from displays and to demand reparations for Black people across the nation. “Our story cannot die, no matter who’s in the White House,” he said.",

    "title": "1 dead, 4 hurt in Palm Springs car explosion deemed ‘act of terrorism’ by FBI",
    "article_text": "LOS ANGELES — One person is dead after a car exploded outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, Saturday in what officials said was an \"intentional act of terrorism.\" Four people were injured, Akil Davis, assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Los Angeles field office, said at a news conference Saturday evening. The nature and seriousness of the injuries were not disclosed. The identity of the deceased person and their involvement in the explosion is not yet known. Davis said the person was near the vehicle that exploded. Officials have identified a person of interest but are not actively seeking out a suspect, Davis said. Palm Springs Police Chief Andy Mills said authorities believe the incident was isolated and there is no longer a danger to the community. \"I am confident that the community is not at risk any longer,\" he said. Several buildings were damaged, some severely,Mills said on Facebook, noting that the \"blast field\" stretches blocks. Davis said the debris field stretches at least 250 yards and covers several blocks in all directions of the blast. \"This was a powerful explosion,\" a law enforcement source familiar with the investigation said. Davis called the blast \"significant\" and said it was likely one of the largest bombing investigations the FBI has been involved in in Southern California. He compared it to theAliso Viejo bombing in 2018. \"Make no mistake: This is an intentional act of terrorism,\" Davis said. He later noted that the investigation will determine whether this is an act of domestic or international terrorism. The blast occurred at 1199 North Indian Canyon Dr., Mills said, at around 11 a.m.,according to the city. The street is home to a number of medical facilities, including Desert Regional Medical Center. There is no information yet on a possible motive, including whether a nearby fertility clinicwas targeted. What appears to be the fertility clinic,American Reproductive Centers (ARC), said on Facebookthat a car exploded in the parking lot near its building. No one who works at the center was harmed. The lab at ARC, which houses all eggs, embryos and reproductive materials, was not damaged, the clinic said on social media. \"We are heavily conducting a complete safety inspection and have confirmed that our operations and sensitive medical areas were not impacted by the blast,\" ARC said. The clinic said it will be \"fully operational\" Monday morning. At a Saturday news conference, Mayor Pro Tem Naomi Soto called the clinic “a place of hope” where people go to \"start or expand their families. \"This is a building where hope lives, and we are confident it will continue afterward, as their meaningful work must continue,\" Soto said. TheLGBTQ Community Center of the Desert saidits McDonald Wright building sustained minor damage from the explosion and that it would be closed until further notice out of an abundance of caution. The FBI'sLos Angeles bureau said on Xthat investigators, bomb technicians and an evidence response team were at the scene. Mills said the Palm Springs Police Department is working closely with the FBI. The FBI is working to determine the origins of the explosion and the identity of the deceased, Davis said. The Los Angeles office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is assisting in the investigation, the bureausaid on X. \"This is going to take a great deal of time for us to process this scene,\" Mills said. He urged the public to have patience with investigation teams and to leave evidence they may find near their homes where it is and to report it to officials. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been briefed on the explosion, his office said. U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi has also been briefed on the incident,she said on X. \"We are working to learn more, but let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America,\" Bondi said. \"Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable.\" California Attorney General Rob Bontasaid on Xthat he was \"horrified\" by the news of the explosion. He said the California Department of Justice is in touch with law enforcement and has offered assistance in the investigation. Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-Ca.,said on Xher heart goes out to those impacted by the explosion. \"Bombing a clinic won't stop people from needing or wanting reproductive care — whether it's IVF or an abortion — and I will keep working to ensure everyone can get the care they need without fear,\" Jacobs said. Videos posted to social mediaand verified by NBC News captured theforce of the blast. Multiple businesses had theirwindows blown outand suffered other structural damage. Firefighters were seen in the videos dragging hoses into buildings. Images on social mediaalso showed clouds of smoke rising from the area, appearing to center around the health facility where the explosion occurred. Palm Springs is a desert city about 110 miles east of Los Angeles.",

    "title": "New standards for Oklahoma high school students promote 2020 election misinformation",
    "article_text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma high school students studying U.S. history learn about the Industrial Revolution, women’s suffrage and America’s expanding role in international affairs. Beginning next school year, they will addconspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election. Oklahoma’s new social studies standards for K-12 public school students, already infused with references to the Bible and national pride, were revised at the direction ofstate School Superintendent Ryan Walters. The Republican official has spent much of his first term in office lauding President Donald Trump, feuding with teachers unions and local school superintendents, and trying to end what he describes as “wokeness” in public schools. “The left has been pushing left-wing indoctrination in the classroom,” Walters said. “We’re moving it back to actually understanding history ... and I’m unapologetic about that.” The previous standard for studying the 2020 election merely said, “Examine issues related to the election of 2020 and its outcome.” The new version is more expansive: “Identify discrepancies in 2020 elections results by looking at graphs and other information, including the sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.” The new standard raised red flags even among Walters’ fellow Republicans, including the governor and legislative leaders. They were concerned that several last-minute changes, including the language about the 2020 election and a provision stating the source of the Covid virus was a Chinese lab, were added just hours before the state school board voted on them. A group of parents and educators havefiled a lawsuitasking a judge to reject the standards, arguing they were not reviewed properly and that they “represent a distorted view of social studies that intentionally favors an outdated and blatantly biased perspective.” While many Oklahoma teachers have expressed outrage at the change in the standards, others say they leave plenty of room for an effective teacher to instruct students about the results of the 2020 election without misinforming them. Aaron Baker, who has taught U.S. government in high schools in Oklahoma City for more than a decade, said he’s most concerned about teachers in rural, conservative parts of the state who might feel encouraged to impose their own beliefs on students. “If someone is welcoming the influence of these far-right organizations in our standards and is interested in inserting more of Christianity into our practices as teachers, then they’ve become emboldened,” Baker said. “For me, that is the major concern.” Leaders in the Republican-led Oklahoma Legislature introduced a resolution to reject the standards, but there wasn’t enough GOP support to pass it. Part of that hesitation likely stemmed from a flurry of last-minute opposition organized by pro-Trump conservative groups such asMoms for Liberty, which has a large presence in Oklahoma and threatened lawmakers who reject the standards with a primary opponent. “In the last few election cycles, grassroots conservative organizations have flipped seats across Oklahoma by holding weak Republicans accountable,” the group wrote in a letter signed by several other conservative groups and GOP activists. “If you choose to side with the liberal media and make backroom deals with Democrats to block conservative reform, you will be next.” After a group of parents, educators and other Oklahoma school officials worked to develop the new social studies standards, Walters assembled an executive committee consisting mostly of out-of-state pundits from conservative think-tanks to revise them. He said he wanted to focus more on American exceptionalism andincorporate the Bibleas an instructional resource. Among those Walters appointed to the review committee are Kevin Roberts, the president of The Heritage Foundation and a key figure in its Project 2025 blueprint for a conservative administration, and Dennis Prager, a radio talk show host who founded Prager U, a conservative nonprofit that offers “pro-American” educational materials for children that some critics say are not accurate or objective. In a statement to The Associated Press, Walters defended teaching students about “unprecedented and historically significant” elements of the 2020 presidential election. “The standards do not instruct students on what to believe; rather, they encourage critical thinking by inviting students to examine real events, review publicly available information, and come to their own conclusions,” he said. Recounts,reviewsandauditsin thebattleground stateswhere Trump contested his loss all confirmedDemocrat Joe Biden’s victory, and Trumplost dozens of court caseschallenging the results. Critics say Walters’ new standard is filled with misleading phrasing that seeks to steer the discussion in particular direction. Democrats characterized it as another political ploy by Walters, widely viewed as a potential candidate for governor in 2026, at the expense of school children. “It’s harmful posturing and political theater that our kids do not need to be subjected to,” said Sen. Mark Mann, a Democrat from Oklahoma City who previously served on the school board for one of the state’s largest districts. National experts on education standards also expressed alarm, noting that Oklahoma hashistorically ranked highlyamong the states for its standards. Brendan Gillis, the director of teaching and learning at the American Historical Association who oversaw a research project that analyzed standards in all 50 states, said Oklahoma’s social studies standards had been “quite good” until the latest version. In addition to concerns about election misinformation, Gillis added: “There was also a lot of biblical content that was sort of shoehorned in throughout the existing standards.” He said a lot of the references to Christianity and the Bible misinterpreted the history of the country’s founding and lacked historical nuance. David Griffith, a research director at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative-leaning education think-tank, said he was not aware of any other states that have tried to promote election misinformation in their curriculum standards. He called the new standards an “unfortunate” departure from Oklahoma’s traditionally strong social studies standards. “It is just inappropriate to promote conspiracy theories about the election in standards,” he said.",

    "article_text": "Former New England Patriots football coach Bill Belichick is hoping to set the record straight on his working relationship with his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson. In an interview on “The Pivot Podcast” to promote his new book,“The Art of Winning: Lessons From a Life in Football,” on Friday, Belichick spoke in more detail about how Hudson helps him juggle his opportunities off the field. “As I stay focused on football, some of the other opportunities that come along, Jordon looks at those and can dig into a little bit deeper,” he said. “But really what she does helps me spend my time on football, and that’s what’s important to me.” The 73-year-old coach added that Hudson helps him schedule what he described as “personal opportunities,” such as media interviews or speaking arrangements. He also said Hudson gave him tips on things to exclude or include in his book, such as removing technical terms from certain chapters and dedicating page numbers to certain players and family members. Belichick and Hudsonwent viral during an interviewwith “CBS Sunday Morning” last month in which Hudson herself blocked the now-University of North Carolina football coach from answering a question about their relationship. When CBS interviewer Tony Dokoupil asked how the couple met, Hudson, sitting at a desk in the background, jumped in and said: “We’re not talking about this.” “No?” Dokoupil said. “No,” she responded. The uncomfortable exchange appeared to generate more speculation about the information the couple was trying to keep private. Belichick since released a statement saying the couple had nothing to hide about how they met. He also said in jest during the podcast interview that he took up yoga because he is “trying to stay young.” This week, Belichick got into another terse exchange with an interviewer on ESPN, where he was questioned if his relationship with Hudson would affect his ability to lead the football program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “That’s really off to the side,” hetold ESPNon Tuesday. “It’s a personal relationship, and she doesn’t have anything to do with UNC football.” Belichick has the most Super Bowl wins of any head coach in American football, with six wins under his belt at the helm of the New England Patriots. He is considered one of the greatest coaches of all time.",

    "title": "Hiker missing for 3 weeks details her survival journey in California mountains",
    "article_text": "The day before Tiffany Slaton’s 28th birthday, she was looking forward to eating a pack of Dunkaroos — cookies with frosting dip — that she’d saved as a makeshift birthday cake. It was the only real food she had left after surviving 24 days lost in the Sierra Nevada mountains, subsisting on wildleeks and boiled snow. What had originally started as a three-day solo camping vacation around Shaver and Huntington lakes in Fresno County, California, turned into a weekslong journey of survival. It ended at a cabin more than 40 miles away, at Vermillion Valley Resort, where Slaton wasfound by the resort’s owneron Wednesday. By the time she was rescued, Slaton had endured 13 snowstorms and climbed to altitudes of 11,000 feet, officials said Friday. In addition to dropping 10 pounds from the ordeal, she also lost her tent and sleeping bags, and was forced to abandon her bike at a trailhead sign. At a press conference Friday alongside her parents and Fresno County Sheriff John Zanoni, Slaton spoke publicly about her journey for the first time. Zanoni called her story one “they would make movies about.” “It is truly an incredible story of perseverance, determination and survival,” the sheriff added. Slaton, an experienced outdoors person from Jeffersonville, Georgia, was reported missing by her parents on April 29 after they had not heard from her in nine days, authorities said. A full-scale operation to locate Slaton was conducted from May 6 to May 10, spanning 600 square miles and deployinga helicopter. Local authorities and volunteers covered 4,300 miles by foot and vehicle in search of Slaton, officials said Friday. Slaton began her trek on April 20, equipped with basic camping supplies, including an electric bike, two sleeping bags and a tent, anticipating she would be gone for only a few days. Early in her journey, Slaton fell off a cliff, she said, and was unable to return to the main road due to a recent avalanche. She was unconscious for about two hours, and upon regaining consciousness she had to splint one of her legs and “pop the other knee back into place.” She attempted five calls to 911 — without success — and couldn’t get her phone’s navigation system to work, she said Friday. Frustrated, she asked her phone for the location of the nearest Starbucks — it gave her a location 18 miles away, which was closer than retracing her path back to the park’s entrance. Slaton pressed on, relying on her resourcefulness and what she could find in the wilderness.Her skills as ahigh-level archer, her medical knowledge as a traveling dialysis technician and her horticultural training proved crucial to her survival. She journaled every day in an effort to “keep sane.” “The worst thing you can do in an emergency situation is panic,” Slaton said. After five days, Slaton ran out of most of her food and relied on her foraging skills to gather leeks she knew to benative in the Sierra Nevada range. She said she made tea each day with manzanita and pine needles. Slaton navigated theKaiser Pass, a 9,000-foot peak buried under 10 to 12 feet of snow before it was plowed earlier this week. She eventually made her way to the Vermilion Valley and Lake Edison, where she was finally rescued. When Slaton first saw the Vermilion Valley Resort cabin, she thought she was hallucinating and “had somehow managed to make it to the North Pole.” She opened the door, which was unlocked, and inside she found what she described as “the best sleeping bag I had ever seen.” Slaton was found on Wednesday — the day before her 28th birthday — by resort owner Christopher Gutierrez. Snowplows had cleared the roads, allowing him access to his property to prepare it for the summer. Gutierrez told authorities he left the cabin unlocked in case a stranded hiker would need shelter. “That was the 13th heavy snowstorm I had been in, and it was going to be the last one,” Slaton said. “If he hadn’t come that day, they would’ve found my body there.” Zanoni called it a “miracle” that the road happened to be plowed on Tuesday, enabling Gutierrez to arrive the next day. When Slaton was found, the resort owner said he recognized her from her missing person report. “She pops out, didn’t say a word, just ran up, and all she wanted was a hug. And it was, it was a pretty surreal moment,” Gutierrez said at a press conference Wednesday. “And that’s when I knew. That’s when I realized who this was.”",

    "article_text": "Jimmy Fallon and The Weeknd crashed a Fordham University graduation party in New York City on Thursday, surprising this year’s graduates with performances of the hit songs “Blinding Lights” and “Can’t Feel My Face.” The students thought they were attending a small party in their honor, the host of “The Tonight Show” said in avideoof the surprise. Theuniversity reportedabout 200 students were in attendance. “They have no idea that I’m about to DJ for them,” Fallon said. “They also have no idea that The Weeknd is going to perform.” Fordham President Tania Tetlow welcomed the graduates-to-be to the celebration, telling them they had a “special guest DJ” coming. Students erupted in cheers as Fallon then entered the room, taking his place behind the DJ setup. “I’ve never deejayed before in my life,” Fallon said. “I should admit that now. I just figured it’d be fun.” Fallon fumbled around with the equipment before plugging his phone in and playing The Weeknd’s popular song “Blinding Lights” as he warmed up the crowd. That’s when the doors opened to reveal the Grammy Award-winning singer himself, sending students into another bout of cheers. “Class of 2025, let’s go!” The Weeknd yelled before launching into his performance. He shared the mic with some students in the front and hit synchronized dance moves with Fordham’s mascotRamses, whom Fallon and The Weeknd kept calling “Ramsey.” The Weeknd then performed another hit, “Can’t Feel My Face,” before the duo left. Students loudly sang along, hands raised in the air. OnFriday night’s episodeof “The Tonight Show,” The Weeknd said he did not expect the surprise to be “that crazy.” “When did you know for a second that it might work?” Fallon asked. “When they started screaming for you, actually,” the singer replied, to laughs from the show’s audience. The Fordham University students celebrated their commencement onSaturday morning.",

    "article_text": "By Alana Wise A reconstruction of Mosura fentoni, an extinct sea creature from more than 500 million years ago.Danielle Dufault/Royal Ontario Museumhide caption Paleontologists have discovered a three-eyed creature with a pencil sharpener-like mouth that roamed the sea for prey more than 500 million years ago. The fossilized remains of one Mosura fentoni  — nicknamed the \"sea moth\" — were found in the Burgess Shale of Canadian Rockies, presenting researchers with new insight into animal life in the Cambrian period, according to a paper published this week in the journalRoyal Society Open Science. The predator was about the length of an index finger, with three eyes dotting its head and a circular mouth lined with teeth, according to paleontologists at the Manitoba Museum and Royal Ontario Museumwho made the discovery. The beast was also equipped with flaps on both sides of its body for swimming, and had intimidating claws extending from its head. \"It has a pair of these jointed claws at the front of its head that have these very long spines on them,\" said lead study author Joe Moysiuk, curator of paleontology and geology at the Manitoba Museum. \"It gives it almost a bit of an Edward Scissorhands look.\" The discovery of the Mosura — part of the extinct group, radiodonts — revealed that the creature was much more complex than fossils of other radiodonts previously suggested, according to researchers. Rather than the simple abdomen-like area observed in other radiodonts, at its rear, this creature's body included 16 segments lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods. \"One of the really interesting things about this discovery is that multi-segmented abdomen-like region of the body of this new species, and it's something that we haven't seen in any of its close relatives before,\" Moysiuk said. \"It shows us that these animals were capable of modifying different regions of their body and specializing them for different sorts of functions, which is something that we see in a lot of the living relatives.\" The well-preserved fossil showed the Mosura's open circulatory system, consisting of a heart that pumped blood into large body cavities, called lacunae. The sea moth is believed to have used its body flaps to swim similarly to modern stingrays, sharing the waters with fellow radiodont and early apex predator, the iconicAnomalocaris canadensis. Stewart Edie, a paleobiologist at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, said the discovery of the Mosura gives scientists better insight into how diverse life on Earth was even prior to the Cambrian explosion — during which complex life began to take shape. \"The Cambrian Explosion is famous for setting up the foundational body plans for most of the major animal groups we know today — but less clear has been how quickly or extensively evolution was proceeding within them,\" Edie said. \"The recent discovery of Mosura shows that a group of arthropods — one long-held to be rather pedestrian in its evolutionary history compared to its close relatives — was in on the 'explosion,' too.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Fatal explosion outside fertility clinic was 'intentional,' police say",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press Damage to a building is seen after an explosion in Palm Springs, Calif., on Saturday, May 17, 2025.Eric Thayer/APhide caption An explosion tore through a fertility clinic in the upscale California city of Palm Springs late Saturday morning, leaving one person believed to be the suspect dead in an attack the FBI characterized as terrorism. A burned-out vehicle was seen in the parking lot behind the clinic after the blast, which caved in the building's roof, sprayed debris across a five-lane road and shattered windows in businesses blocks away. The clinic was closed for the weekend, and the doctor who leads it told The Associated Press its staffers were safe. \"Make no mistake: This is an intentional act of terrorism,\" Akil Davis, the head of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, told an evening news conference. He declined to say how authorities reached that conclusion. A law enforcement official said investigators recovered an AK-47-style rifle from the scene. The official was not authorized to discuss details of the investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. Authorities were still working to confirm the identity of the person killed, Davis said. Four people were hurt, but authorities provided no details on the severity of those injuries, how they occurred or where. Davis said law enforcement was also looking into the possibility that the explosion was livestreamed. The act was being investigated as a possible car explosion, according to two other law enforcement officials briefed on the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss preliminary information from an ongoing investigation. One of the officials told AP that investigators believe the person who died was likely the person who set off the explosion, but they cautioned that the investigation was still in its early stages. The blast gutted the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic, in a single-story building along a five-lane street lined with palm trees. Dr. Maher Abdallah, who leads the clinic, told AP in a phone interview that the explosion damaged the practice's office space, where it conducts consultations with patients. The clinic's IVF lab and stored embryos are offsite and were not damaged. \"Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients,\" Abdallah said. Palm Springs Mayor Pro Tem Naomi Soto called the clinic \"a place of hope.\" \"This is a building that people go to to start or expand their families,\" she said. \"We acknowledge their pain and concern across the community for the patients and staff.\" Law enforcement investigate a vehicle after an explosion on Saturday, May 17, 2025 in Palm Springs, Calif.AP/ABC7 Los Angeleshide caption Rhino Williams, 47, said he was chatting with customers at a hotel restaurant he helps manage just over a block away when he heard a huge boom. Everything rattled, Williams said, and he sprinted to the scene to see if anyone needed help. Williams covered his nose with his shirt as he smelled burning plastic and rubber. He said he saw a building had \"blown out\" into the street, with bricks and debris scattered everywhere, and he spotted a car's front axle on fire in the parking lot. He said it was the only car in the lot. He ran into the building, calling out and peering behind the counter to see if anyone was inside. He did not hear a response and did not see anyone behind the counter. Williams then ran around to check on other buildings. Multiple windows of the neighboring liquor store were also blown out, he said. Once he saw authorities arrive, he headed back to the hotel. Steven Michael Chacon was in his car preparing to turn into a hospital across the street from the clinic when felt and heard a massive boom as the building was torn apart, sending a massive plume of black smoke into the air. Not knowing what happened, he exited his car to flee the scene. Glass was all over the ground, and he saw what appeared to be a body part. \"I got out of my car and then people started screaming, there were people bloody, there was glass everywhere,\" he said. Palm Springs, about a two-hour drive east of Los Angeles, is known for upscale resorts, golf courses and a history of celebrity residents. Among those investigating were investigators, bomb technicians and an evidence response team from the FBI as well as investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The Trump administration condemned the attack. \"The Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. \"Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Scott Simon A copy of the 1300 version of the Magna Carta on display at the Harvard Law School.Lorin Granger/Harvard Law Schoolhide caption There's a new reason to go through that pile of papers you've plunked somewhere. Tests have established that a supposedly \"unofficial\" copy of the Magna Carta resting in the files of the Harvard Law School library for decadesis an original, and, \"one of the world's most valuable documents.\" The law school reportedly paid just $27.50 for it in 1946. David Carpenter, a professor at King's College London, came upon the document in the Harvard Law School library's online collection, and toldThe Guardiannewspaper that he mused to himself, \"My god this looks for all the world like an original…\" Prof. Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, at the University of East Anglia, used spectral imaging,  ultraviolet light, and other tests, to determine that this Magna Carta rediscovered at Harvard is indeed the real thing. The Magna Carta was first issued by King John of England in 1215 and declared that all people, royalty and commoners, had personal rights. Even kings had to abide by laws. It was reissued by his successors until Edward I in the year 1300. Professors Carpenter and Vincent date the Harvard Magna Carta to that final iteration. The BBCsaysjust 24 of the 200 original documents survive today. One of them, from the year 1297, is on display at the National Archives in Washington, DC, to remind us how the Americans who wrote the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights were inspired by the Magna Carta. It's on loan from the philanthropist David M. Rubenstein, who purchased it for $22 million dollars and called it, the \"best money I ever spent.\" You may wonder if he's asked himself this week, \"Wait—I could have gotten one for $27.50?\" It is inviting when old papers or paintings are discovered in an attic or file to think first of their monetary value. But this week, with so many court cases about executive authority and the rights of individuals, it might be worthwhile to pause and read some of the words that made the Magna Carta so momentous. For example,  Clause 39: \"No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.\" The true wealth of the Magna Carta is in what it says.

    "title": "Amid global competition for production business, Hollywood is hurting",
    "article_text": "Mandalit del Barco A backlot on the Radford Studio Center in Los Angeles is built to look like New York City.Seinfeldshot here in the 1990s.Eilish M. Nobes/Radford Studio Centerhide caption On a Hollywood backlot in Los Angeles, you can find a replica New York City street — complete with a diner, a newsstand, brownstones, a bodega and a subway entrance. It's part of the Radford Studio Center, a sprawling production hub in Studio City. In 1928, silent film actor and director Mack Sennett built the studio on what was once a lettuce ranch. Classic TV showsGunsmoke,Gilligan's IslandandThe Mary Tyler Moore Showwere all made here. So was the hit 1990s TV showSeinfeld. \"This stage has a ton of positive juju,\" says Zach Sokoloff from Radford's soundstage nine, whereSeinfeldtaped. Sokoloff is senior vice president at Hackman Capital Partners, which manages Radford Studio Center and studios around the world. Riding in a studio golf cart to the backlot, Sokoloff points out the spot where the show's famous episode \"The Soup Nazi\" was made. The lot is full of recognizableSeinfeldspots: \"Up there, you've got the balcony where Jerry threw the marbled rye,\" he says. Sokoloff explains that the studio built this backlot forSeinfeldin 1994, after a massive 6.7 magnitude earthquake rocked Los Angeles and destroyed much of the set. \"There was trepidation about remaining in LA, so we decided to bring New York to the production, as opposed to having the production go to New York,\" he says. Building a replica New York City is what it took to convince Seinfeld to stay in California, says Sokoloff. But keeping productions in the area – and even in the country – has become a challenge, at a time when film and TV production has increasingly moved elsewhere. The issue came to national attention this month,when President Trump took to Truth Social to declare, \"The movie industry in America is DYING a very fast death.\" He announced he would authorize a 100% tariff on movies made outside the U.S. Trump's proclamation —prompted by a visit from one of his \"special ambassadors\" to Hollywood, Jon Voight– shocked and confused film industries around the world. But the president quickly paused to consider the idea, saying he'd meet with industry leaders because he wanted \"to make them happy.\" In the days since, Voight, and fellow \"ambassador\" Sylvester Stallone teamed up with the Motion Picture Association and several industry unions to craft a letter urging the president to consider enacting federal tax incentives and adjusting certain tax provisions to increase film and TV production in the United States. The entire episode opened a conversation about the decline of TV and movie-making — and what can be done about it. According to FilmLA, which issues film permits, production still hasn't rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic and delays triggered by the writers and actors' strikes in 2023. Studios and streamers also aren't ordering as many shows these days. \"With less work to go around, the competition for what's left is intensified,\" says spokesman Philip Sokoloski. Most states have some sort of financial incentive for productions. So do nearly 100 countries, including Canada, the U.K., Ireland and Australia. \"Even Thailand [has incentives],\" says Joe Chianese, senior vice president of Entertainment Partners, a global production services company. \"The recent season ofThe White Lotuswas shot entirely in Thailand. With the number of incentives here in the U.S. and around the world, producers really have a lot of choices.\" Chianese consults with producers aboutproduction laws, incentives and taxes around the world. He says that productions can bring a lot of money to an area at once, \"which is a real stimulus to the economy, creating jobs.\" The trend of what's known as \"runaway production\" began in the late 1990s, he says, when Canada introduced tax credits for film and TV production, and \"you saw that rolling out in other countries.\" Ever since, there's been global competition for entertainment jobs and bragging rights. Within the U.S., states are jockeying to get those show business jobs. Last week, New York passed its budget with an $100 million increase in funds dedicated to production incentives, setting aside a total of $800 million. This week, thanks to New Jersey's tax credits,Netflix broke ground on new soundstages, a backlot, and post-production facilities on a former U.S. Army base at Fort Monmouth. And in Texas,a proposed state bill offering moreincentives to film there has gotten a boost from some famous celebrities. \"Small fraction of the Texas budget surplus could turn this state into the new Hollywood,\" actor Woody Harrelsonsays in a recent video, teaming up with Matthew McConaughey, Billy Bob Thornton, Dennis Quaid and Renée Zellweger. \"No shade to Texas, but I think people would rather film in California,\" says Steven Jaworski, vice president of production for A&E Studios. Jaworski is in charge of budgeting for the Netflix seriesThe Lincoln Lawyer, a legal drama produced at Los Angeles Center Studios, not far from City Hall and other downtown locations where the show often shoots. The situation’s so dire that if something is not done this summer, I truly believe California being the entertainment capital of the world and the production capital of the world — I think that will be a thing of the past. The situation’s so dire that if something is not done this summer, I truly believe California being the entertainment capital of the world and the production capital of the world — I think that will be a thing of the past. Steven Jaworski, vice president of production for A&E Studios \"The reality is this show could be shot anywhere,\" he says from the set ofThe Lincoln Lawyer. \"LA is a character to our story … but as costs increase, whether it's inflation or even the way that the economy may be going, there may be a mandate of 'you have to cut your costs,' and the only way to keep the show going would be to relocate. It would be heartbreaking if this show had to leave.\" Long before Trump's announcement, Jaworski and others were sounding the alarm about productions leaving California. \"The situation's so dire,\" he says, \"that if something is not done this summer, I truly believe California being the entertainment capital of the world and the production capital of the world — I think that will be a thing of the past.\" It wasn't until 2009 that California began offering tax credits to film there – and by that time, production was already moving elsewhere to take advantage of lucrative credits. The California legislation was even nicknamed \"The Ugly Betty Bill\" – after the hit ABC series that moved its production from California to New Yorkfor the tax creditsthere. But California's existing tax credit program badly needs updating, according to Casey Bloys, the chairman and CEO of HBO and Max Content. \"The talent is here, the infrastructure is here. We have a number of shows, includingHacks, that are shooting here,\" he said on a panel at the Milken Institute earlier this month. \"But the issue becomes, when you try to plan, you have to get into a lottery, and you're not sure your show is going to get a tax break or not.\" Ravi Ahuja, President and CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment, speaks at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills in May.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Sony Pictures Entertainment CEO and president Ravi Ahuja also made the case for helping out the state. \"While it's true a lot of production has left the United States, it's even worse for California,\" he said on a panel. He and other studio executives said they like filming in LA, but also want to be able to film and shoot on location around the world. To solve the problem, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has already been pushing to more than double California's tax credit program, and two bills going through the state legislature would expand the types of productions that are eligible for credits. After Trump introduced the idea of movie tariffs, he blamed Newsom for allowing the Hollywood jobs to leave. Newsom stood by the program in California and the incentive increases he's already proposed. He also volunteered to help the president craft a $7.5 billion dollarfederaltax credit plan. \"America continues to be a film powerhouse, and California is all in to bring more production here. Building on our successful state program, we're eager to partner with the Trump administration to further strengthen domestic production and Make America Film Again,\" he said in a statement. Despite the recent attention on keeping production in the country, industry leaders in California still say the program there needs help. Boosting California's budget and revising its tax credit program would offer a reward for productions made in the state, not a punishing tariff for producing outside the U.S., says Pamala Buzick Kim, co-founder of a grassroots group called Stay in LA. A lot of people outside of LA think that when you say Hollywood, everyone's rich. I wish that that was the case. 99% of us who are in production really are your everyday working class folks.

But 99% of us who are in production really are your everyday working class folks.\" Kim says Trump's movie tariff idea \"definitely sent a spiral of confusion through the industry and through the international market, but the fact that we are getting attention at a national level is great.\" Kim says it's important to preserve LA's legacy and its biggest greatest export. \"We have generations of people who have been in this business who are in this area who are the best of the best.

    "title": "Trump plans to call Putin, then Zelenskyy, on Monday to push for Ukraine ceasefire",
    "article_text": "The roots of Russia's invasion of Ukraine go back decades and run deep. The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is — in the words of one U.S. official — a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. By The Associated Press In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, rescuers recover the bodies of passengers after a Russian drone struck a passenger bus at the village of Bilopillya in the Sumy region, Ukraine, on Saturday.Ukrainian Emergency Service/APhide caption KYIV, Ukraine — U.S. President Donald Trump said that he plans to speak by phone Monday with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, followed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders of various NATO countries, about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump said that the call with Putin will be about stopping the \"bloodbath\" in Ukraine. \"Hopefully it will be a productive day, a ceasefire will take place, and this very violent war, a war that should have never happened, will end,\" Trump wrote Saturday in a post on his social networking site Truth Social. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed in comments to Russian media that preparations were underway for Monday's call. Trump's remarks came a day after the first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in years failed to yield a ceasefire. Putin had spurned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's offer to meet face-to-face in Turkey after he himself proposed direct negotiations — although not at the presidential level — as an alternative to a 30-day ceasefire urged by Ukraine and its Western allies, including the U.S. Also Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a phone call with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov. During a visit to Rome, Rubio suggested that the Vatican could be a venue for Russia-Ukraine peace talks. In Ukraine, a northeastern town declared a period of mourning after a Russian drone hit a bus evacuating civilians from front-line areas, killing nine people, Ukrainian officials said. The strike came hours after the Russian and Ukrainian delegations left Istanbul, after agreeing to what would be the biggest prisoner swap to date between the warring parties. The talks in Istanbul on Friday broke up after less than two hours without a ceasefire, although both sides agreed on exchanging 1,000 prisoners of war each, according to the heads of both delegations. Ukraine's intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said on Ukrainian television Saturday that the exchange could happen as early as next week. But the Kremlin has pushed back against a proposal by Ukraine and its Western allies for a temporary ceasefire as a first step toward a peaceful settlement, and the parties remained far apart on key conditions for ending the fighting. Since U.S.-brokered talks began in March, Ukraine's strategy has been to convince the Trump administration that Putin is unreliable, and that Kyiv is serious about peace. Trump has expressed frustration with the stalled talks and threatened to abandon his efforts if results aren't achieved. The political theatrics are underscored by stark realities on the ground in Ukraine. In a war of attrition against Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine's position is poised to grow weaker as time goes on, unless powerful sanctions are imposed against Moscow and the U.S. continues arms deliveries. Zelenskyy said that he had discussed the outcome of the talks with Trump and the leaders of France, Germany, Britain and Poland. In an X post from a European leadership meeting in Albania on Friday, Zelenskyy urged \"tough sanctions\" against Moscow if it rejects \"a full and unconditional ceasefire and an end to killings.\" Peskov on Saturday held open the possibility of Putin holding talks with Zelenskyy, providing the agreed prisoner swap goes ahead, and if the Russian and Ukrainian delegations reached unspecified further \"agreements.\" Peskov also told reporters that Moscow will present Ukraine with a list of conditions for a ceasefire, but gave no timeframe, or say what needed to happen before Zelenskyy and Putin can meet. In Ukraine, nine civilians were killed and seven others were wounded when a Russian drone struck a bus evacuating people from Bilopillia, a town around 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Russia's border, according to local Gov. Oleh Hryhorov and Ukraine's national police. The Associated Press couldn't independently verify the reports. There was no immediate comment from Moscow. Zelenskyy described the attack as \"deliberate killing of civilians,\" adding in a post on the Telegram messaging app that \"Russians could scarcely not realize what kind of vehicle they were hitting.\" The local media outlet Suspilne said that the passengers on the bus were being evacuated from the town when the strike happened. Authorities are working to identify some of the victims, most of them older women. Local community chief Yurii Zarko called the day \"Black Saturday,\" and mourning was declared in the town through Monday. Zelenskyy lamented the missed opportunity from Friday's peace talks, saying that \"Ukraine has long proposed this — a full and unconditional ceasefire in order to save lives.\" Ukraine's European allies strongly condemned the attack. U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that he was \"appalled\" by it. \"If Putin is serious about peace, Russia must agree to a full and immediate ceasefire, as Ukraine has done,\" he wrote on X. The German Foreign Office wrote on its official X account that the strike in Bilopillia was \"unsurpassed in cynicism.\" \"Less than 24 hours after the end of the Istanbul talks, Putin is once again making clear that he does not want peace,\" it said. Russia's Defense Ministry said that its forces on Saturday struck Ukrainian units gathered near several border settlements in Sumy, including Ryzhivka and Atynske, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) north of Bilopillia. It didn't directly comment on reports of the deadly attack. According to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War think tank, Ukrainian forces have been inching forward into Russian territory in the Kursk region, just north of Bilopillia. Russia said last month that its forces had fully reclaimed the Kursk region, nearly nine months after Kyiv's lightning incursion captured more than 100 settlements there and promised to hand Ukraine a bargaining chip in possible negotiations. Ukrainian officials said that fighting in Kursk was still ongoing. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "The first time we had 'one big, beautiful bill' we called it Reaganomics",
    "article_text": "Ron Elving Close-up photo of pinback button with text reading Reagan, Let's Make America Great Again, for Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential election campaign.Smith Collection/Gado/Sipa USA/Sipa via AP Imageshide caption Have some sympathy for the headline writers and TV chyron composers trying to describe what's happening on Capitol Hill right now. Should they just call it the \"budget bill\" (yawn) or the \"mega bill\" (one eye opens) or the \"gargantuan package deal\"? Many simply succumb and adoptPresident Trump's phrase\"one big, beautiful bill\" — the latest testament to his knack for marketing with labels that stick. It's even the proposed official name for the House legislation. (For those with tight space constraints, there's the casual acronym \"OBBB.\") Members of Congress or staff can of course fall back on the bill's formal procedural description — budget reconciliation, or just \"reconciliation\" for short. But it's not hard to understand why talk of \"budget reconciliation\"is not sweeping the nation. Nonetheless, everything Trump has poured into this legislative potpourri — from tax and spending cuts to a big Pentagon boost and sprawling policy directives — depends on the package getting special consideration under special rules. Those rules are only available for budget reconciliation bills, and they make all the difference — the biggest being their exemption from the Senate's practice of allowing unlimited debate, the filibuster. Normally, the threat of a filibuster means bills need at least 60 votes to get through the Senate. But take away that threat and the majority party can enact even its most ambitious changes to existing policy and law by a simple majority vote. No votes from the opposition are needed. That has been crucial to enacting key programs for each of the past seven presidents, who have used reconciliation more than two dozen times over the half century since it was created. It was used for crucial parts of the Affordable Care Act (also known as Obamacare) and for Biden's energy and infrastructure initiatives as well as for the deep tax cuts done in the first year of Trump's first term. Rep. Randy Weber, R-Texas, attends the House Energy and Commerce markup of the FY2025 budget resolution in Rayburn building on May 13.Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Imageshide caption But the president who initiated the ambitious use of reconciliation was Ronald Reagan, whose first federal budget was a watershed in the history of federal fiscal policy. The year was 1981, and official Washington was waking up to an unfamiliar landscape. There was a newly inaugurated outsider in the White House determined to move fast and change things. His new budget featured eye-popping increases for the Pentagon alongside deep cuts for social safety net programs. But looming over all else was a historic reduction in the federal tax on income and capital gains. Sold as being \"across the board\" with something for taxpayers at all income levels, the cuts' dollar value was highest for the investor class. All in all, the changes constituted the centerpiece of Ronald Reagan's effort to reverse the growth trends in the federal government and install what would be called \"Reaganomics\" — the centerpiece of the \"Reagan Revolution.\" You could say Reagan's priorities were just a statement of Republican orthodoxy. To be sure, tax cuts and muscular national defense and a gimlet eye on other programs had been components of Republican platforms for generations. Reaganomics was something else again. Like the thrusts that have come with Trump's return to office, the White House in 1981 was striving to strike while the post-election iron was still hot. The promise of Reagan's program was that tax cuts could lessen the burden of government, unleash enterprise and so stimulate the economy as to create jobs and even increase federal revenue. The biggest advocates of the tax cuts maintained they would \"pay for themselves.\" All gain with little or no pain. Everyone would be better off. America, writ large, would be better off. Or, as one of Reagan's 1980 campaign slogans put it: \"Let's Make America Great Again.\" Another parallel between the Trump and Reagan upheavals was the presence of an unelected official suddenly wielding enormous power in a new role. In the current scenario that has been Elon Musk, the auto and space entrepreneur who helped fuel Trump's campaign late in 2024. Musk came aboard as a special adviser to Trump, running the new\"Department of Government Efficiency\" initiative and threatening the jobs of well over a hundred thousand federal employees. President Reagan and his director of the Office of Management and Budget, David Stockman.HUM Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Imageshide caption In 1981, the designated slasher was Reagan's new director at theOffice of Management and Budget, David Stockman. Stockman, a former seminarian and congressman from Michigan, quickly assembled an executive budget blueprint that upended generations of assumptions about the federal government's role. At 34 years old, Stockman's youthful assurance and irreverence for sacred cows of all kinds soon upset many of his former colleagues on the Hill. But Reagan's revolution went forward because his election coattails from 1980 had sent such a strong message to Congress. Republicans had their first majority in the Senate since the 1950s. Just as important, Reagan could look to a working coalition in the House, where Democrats had just lost35 seats and they could not count on the votes of another 30 or more Southern Democrats whose districts had gone for Reagan. Those members' votes in the House would be enough to put his proposal over the top in their chamber. Still, enacting as large a course correction as the new administration envisioned was a major challenge. As news of the spending cuts sank in there were protests in major cities and outside the offices of members of Congress. Reconciliation required a lot of committee action and some panels chafed at their new marching orders (called \"reconciliation instructions\"). As the package struggled its way through a maze of committee votes, there was a growing sense that the pushback was going to dismember the deal or defeat it outright. But on March 30, 1981, a disturbed young man ambushed Reagan leaving the Washington Hilton Hotel and shot him at close range. Reagan took a bullet that punctured a lung and might have ended his presidency in its third month. But after emergency surgery and two weeks of hospital, Reagan was back. The drama of it all lent fresh impetus to the package as previously wavering Republicans rallied 'round. Through it all, the drama centered on Reagan, giving him what UCLA political scientist Mark A. Peterson has called\"an image of invincibility and legislative acumen\"that would last for years. But before the summer was over, the other hero of the tale would prove to be the reconciliation process that was making the legislative win possible — a process with its origins in quite a different era of relations between Congress and the president. Reconciliation was created in the Congressional Budget Control and Impoundment Act of 1974. It was a product of the politics of that year, when the Vietnam War was coming to a disheartening end and President Richard Nixon was fighting a long battle against impeachment. Nixon had been reelected in a 49-state landslide in 1972, but his second term was soon subsumed by a scandal involving his reelection campaign, spying on political opponents (including the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate office complex) and an elaborate effort to cover it all up. Nixon's public approval, once as high as 60%, was plummeting further by the month. He would resign in August of 1974. The 1974 act created the first Congressional Budget Office and the budget committees in both chambers of Congress, setting out a process for planning each federal fiscal year. It also included the notion of a unified, multipurpose bill that would incorporate spending and tax priorities and policy changes as well (while leaving the actual commitment of federal dollars to the traditional appropriations committees of the House and Senate). As noted, the key element in all these rules was the elimination of the filibuster and empowerment of the Senate majority party. The original legislation limited the number of times reconciliation could be used and indicated it should be for purposes of lowering the annual budget deficit and reducing the national debt. Although it had been available in law for Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, neither had the majorities in Congress that have been key to making reconciliation work. Reagan was the first who did, and he used it to make his mark on his era. The effects of Reaganomics on job creation, inflation, income distribution and equity in the U.S. have been debated for more than 40 years and remain controversial today. The same could be said for the effects of other presidential uses of the reconciliation tool in the past. How well Trump and his congressional leadership team handle that tool this year to reshape and redirect the federal government will set a powerful narrative for the first stage of Trump's second term.

    "title": "Do these Buddhist gods hint at the purpose of China’s super-secret satellites?",
    "article_text": "Until recently, China's entries in the realm of spaceflight patches often lacked originality. Mission patches are a decades-old tradition in spaceflight. They can range from the figurative to the abstract, prompting valuable insights or feeding confusion. Some are just plain weird. Arspublished a storya few months ago on spaceflight patches from NASA, SpaceX, Russia, and the NRO, the US government's spy satellite agency, which is responsible for some of the most head-scratching mission logos. Until recently, China's entries in the realm of spaceflight patches often lacked the originality found in patches from the West. For example, aseries of patchesfor China's human spaceflight missions used aformulaic designwith acircular shapeand a mix ofred and blue. The patch for China's most recent Shenzhou crew to the country's Tiangong space station last month finally broke the mold with atriangular shapeafter China's human spaceflight agency put the patch up for a public vote. But there's a fascinating set of new patches Chinese officials released for a series of launches with top secret satellites over the last two months. These four patches depict Buddhist gods with a sense of artistry and sharp colors that stand apart from China's previous spaceflight emblems, and perhaps—or perhaps not—they can tell us something about the nature of the missions they represent. The four patches show the Four Heavenly Kings, protector deities in Buddhism who guard against evil forces in the four cardinal directions,according to the Kyoto National Museum. The gods also shield the Dharma, the teachings of the Buddha, from external threats. These gods have different names,but in China, they are known as Duōwén, Zēngzhǎng, Chíguó, and Guăngmù. Duōwén is the commander and the guardian of the north, the \"one who listens to many teachings,\" who is often depicted with an umbrella. Zēngzhǎng, guardian of the south, is a god of growth shown carrying a sword. The protector of the east is Chíguó, defender of the nation, who holds a stringed musical instrument. And guarding the west is Guăngmù, an all-seeing god usually depicted with a serpent. The patches for a quartet of Chinese satellites launched since March each portray one of the Four Heavenly Kings. We know little about these satellites, other than their names and locations, and they were reportedly manufactured by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology, a division of China's main state-owned aerospace contractor. They are part of a series of Chinese missions known as Tongxin Jishu Shiyan (TJS), or what China calls communication technology test satellites. But that's likely a cover for their real purpose. China launched TJS-15, the first satellite with a Heavenly King mascot, on March 9 aboard a Long March 3B rocket. A Long March 7A rocket launched the TJS-16 satellite March 29, and another Long March 3B deployed the TJS-17 payload April 10. Finally, on Monday, a Long March 3C rocket sent China's TJS-19 satellite into orbit, skipping TJS-18 in the sequence. All four satellites are on their way to, or already operating in, geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. At that altitude, a satellite's orbital velocity matches the speed of Earth's rotation, allowing it to remain over the same part of the planet. Notably, ground-based trackers have detected unexpected objects that appear to have separated from TJS-15 and TJS-17 in geosynchronous orbit. These may be remnant rocket engines that helped inject the satellites into their operating orbits, but a handful of earlier Chinese satellites also released smaller spacecraft to perform their own maneuvers. US officials believe China uses many of the TJS satellites for missile warning or spy missions. In the first instance, some of the TJS satellites may be similar to the US Space Force's fleet of early warning satellites, on guard with heat sensors to detect the thermal signature of a ballistic missile launch. TJS satellites filling the role of a reconnaissance mission might have enormous umbrella-like reflectors to try and pick up signals transmitted by foreign forces, such as those of the United States. It's not difficult to start making connections between the Four Heavenly Gods and the missions that China's TJS satellites likely carry out in space. A protector with an umbrella? An all-seeing entity? This sounds like a possible link, but there's a chance Chinese officials approved the patches to misdirect outside observers, or there's no connection at all. All of the TJS satellites are parked in geosynchronous orbit over the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia, or the Western Pacific, except for one—TJS-7—positioned over the Eastern Pacific, with good visibility over the entire United States. Mike Dahm, a researcher at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies and a former naval intelligence officer,told the US-China Economic and Security Review Commissionlast year that TJS-7 is probably a missile warning satellite, but it could be spying on signals coming from the US homeland. Some of the TJS satellites might also be capable of maneuvering near other satellites for closeup inspection. The US military has its own inspector satellites,known as GSSAP, to get a closer look at interesting things happening in geosynchronous orbit. And the Space Force is using them. One of these GSSAP platforms, designated USA-324, approached within about 10 miles of China's new TJS-16 and TJS-17 satellites on April 26 and April 29, according to COMSPOC, a commercial satellite tracking company. A video animation released by COMSPOC, embedded below, shows how the USA-324 satellite maneuvered close to each of the Chinese satellites last month over the Western Pacific Ocean. It seems the Space Force is intrigued by China's flurry of new top secret satellites missions, too. Over the weekend, USA 324, maneuvered into the 152 °E neighborhood—“checking out” its new neighbors TJS-16 and TJS-17. USA 324 made two close passes— ~17 km to TJS-16 (26 Apr 14:45 UTC) and ~12 km to TJS-17 (29 Apr 13:40 UTC)— before settling down near 152.8 °E.pic.twitter.com/r4lpZEeeFd — COMSPOC_OPS (@COMSPOC_OPS)April 29, 2025 Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Sierra made the games of my childhood. Are they still fun to play?",
    "article_text": "Get ready for some nostalgia. My Ars colleagues were kicking back at the Orbital HQ water cooler the other day, and—as gracefully aging gamers are wont to do—they began to reminisce about classicSierra On-Line adventure games. I was a huge fan of these games in my youth, so I settled in for some hot buttered nostalgia. Would we remember the limited-palette joys of early King's Quest, Space Quest, or Quest for Glory titles? Would we branch out beyond games with \"Quest\" in their titles, seeking rarer fare likeFreddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist? What about the gothic stylings ofThe Colonel's Bequestor the voodoo-curiousGabriel Knight? Nope. The talk was of acorns. [Bleeping] acorns, in fact. The scene in question came fromKing's Quest III, where our hero Gwydion must acquire some exceptionally desiccated acorns to advance the plot. It sounds simple enough. As onewalkthroughputs it, \"Go east one screen and north one screen to the acorn tree. Try picking up acorns until you get some dry ones. Try various spots underneath the tree.\" Easy! And clear! Except it wasn't either one because the game rather notoriously won't always give you the acorns, even when you enter the right command. This led many gamers to believe they were in the wrong spot, when in reality,they just had to keep entering the \"get acorns\" commandwhile moving pixel by pixel around the tree until the game finally supplied them. One of our staffers admitted to having purchased theKing's Quest IIIhint book solely because of this \"puzzle.\" (The hint book, which is now online, says that players should \"move around\" the particular oak tree in question because \"you can only find the right kind of acorns in one spot.\") This wasn't quite the \"fun\" I had remembered from these games, but as I cast my mind back, I dimly recalled similar situations.Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revengehad been my first Sierra title. After my brother and I spent weeks on the game only to die repeatedly in some pitch-dark tunnels, we implored my dad to call Sierra's 1-900 pay hint line. He thought about it. I could see it pained him because he had never before (and never since!) called a 1-900 number. In this case, the call cost a piratical 75 cents for the first minute and 50 cents for each additional minute. After listening to us whine for several days straight, my dad decided that his sanity was worth the fee, and he called. Like the acorn example above, we had known what to do—we had just not done it to the game's rather exacting standards. The key was to use a glowing gem as a light source, which my brother and I had long understood. The problem was the text parser, which demanded that we \"put gem in mouth\" to use the gem's light in the tunnels. There was no other place to put the gem, no other way to hold or attach it. (We tried them all.) No other attempt to use the light of this shining crystal, no matter how clear, well-intentioned, or succinctly expressed, would work. You put the gem in your mouth, or you died in the darkness. Returning from my reveries to the conversation at hand, I caught Ars Senior Editor Lee Hutchinson's cynical remark that these kinds of puzzles were \"the only way to make 2–3 hours of 'game' last for months.\" This seemed rather shocking, almost offensive. How could one say such a thing about the games that colored my memories of childhood? So I decided to replaySpace Quest IIfor the first time in 35 years in an attempt to defend my own past. Big mistake. In my memory, the Space Quest series was filled with sharply written humor, clever puzzles, and enchanting art. But when I fired up the original version of the game, I found that only one of these was true. The art, despite its blockiness and limited colors, remained charming. As for the gameplay, the puzzles were not so much \"clever\" as \"infuriating,\" \"obvious,\" or (more often) \"rather obscure.\" Finding the glowing gem discussed above requires you to swim into one small spot of a multi-screen river, with no indication in advance that anything of importance is in that exact location. Trying to \"call\" a hunter who has captured you does nothing… until you do it a second time. And the less said about trying to throw a puzzle at a Labian Terror Beast, typing out various word permutations while death bears down upon you, the better. The whole game was also filled with far more no-warning insta-deaths than I had remembered. On the opening screen, for instance, after your janitorial space-broom floats off into the cosmic ether, you can walk your character right off the edge of the orbital space station he is cleaning. The game doesn't stop you; indeed, it kills you and then mocks you for \"an obvious lack of common sense.\" It then calls you a \"wing nut\" with an \"inability to sustain life.\" Game over. The game's third screen, which features nothing more to do than simply walking around, will also kill you in at least two different ways. Walk into the room still wearing your spacesuit and your boss will come over and chew you out. Game over. If you manage to avoid that fate by changing into your indoor uniform first, it's comically easy to tap the wrong arrow key and fall off the room's completely guardrail-free elevator platform. Game over. Get used to it because the game will kill you in so, so many ways: touching any single pixel of a root monster whose branches form a difficult maze; walking into a giant mushroom; stepping over an invisible pit in the ground; getting shot by a guard who zips in on a hovercraft; drowning in an underwater tunnel; getting swiped at by some kind of giant ape; not putting the glowing gem in your mouth; falling into acid; and many more. I used the word \"insta-death\" above, but the game is not even content with this. At one key point late in the game, a giantAliens-style alien stalks the hallways, and if she finds you, she \"kisses\" you. But then she leaves! You are safe after all! Of course, if you have seen the films, you will recognize that you arenotsafe, but the game lets you go on for a bit before the alien's baby inevitably bursts from your chest, killing you. Game over. This is why theofficial hint booksuggests that you \"save your game a lot, especially when it seems that you're entering a dangerous area. That way, if you die, you don't have to retrace your steps much.\" Presumably, this was once considered entertaining. When it comes to the humor, most of it is broad. (When you are told to \"say the word,\" you have to say \"the word.\") Sometimes it is condescending. (\"You quickly glance around the room to see if anyone saw you blow it.\") Or it might just be potty jokes. (Plungers, jock straps, toilet paper, alien bathrooms, and fouling one's trousers all make appearances.) My total gameplay time: a few hours. \"ByGrabthar's hammer!\" I thought. \"Lee was right!\" When I admitted this to him, Lee told me that he had actually spent time learning to speedrun the Space Quest games during the pandemic. \"According to my notes, a clean run of SQ2 in 'fast' mode—assuming good typing skills—takes about 20 minutes straight-up,\" he said. Yikes. The past was a different time. Computer memory was small, graphics capabilities were low, and computer games had emerged from the \"let them live just long enough to encourage spending another quarter\" arcade model. Mouse adoption took a while; text parsers made sense even though they created plenty of frustration. So yes—some of these games were a few hours of gameplay stretched out with insta-death, obscure puzzles, and the sheer amount of time it took just to walk across the game's various screens. (Seriously, \"walking around\" took a ridiculous amount of the game's playtime, especially when a puzzle made you backtrack three screens, type some command, and then return.) Judged by current standards, the Sierra games are no longer what I would play for fun. All the same, I loved them. They introduced me to the joy of exploring virtual worlds and to the power of evocative artwork. I went into space, into fairy tales, and into the past, and I did so while finding the games' humor humorous and their plotlines compelling. (\"An army of life insurance salesmen?\" I thought at the time. \"Hilarious and brilliant!\") If the games can feel a bit arbitrary or vexing today, my child-self's love of repetition was able to treat them as engaging challenges rather than \"unfair\" design. ReplayingSpace Quest II, encountering the half-remembered jokes and visual designs, brought back these memories. The novelist Thomas Wolfe knew thatyou can't go home again, and it was probably inevitable that the game would feel dated to me now. But playing it again did take me back to that time before the Internet, when not even hint lines, insta-death, and EGA graphics could dampen the wonder of the new worlds computers were capable of showing us. Space Quest II, along with several other Sierra titles, is freely and legally available online atsarien.net—though I found many, many glitches in the implementation. Windows users can buy the entire Space Quest collection throughSteamorGood Old Games. There's even afan remakethat runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

    "title": "MIT Backs Away From Paper Claiming Scientists Make More Discoveries with AI",
    "article_text": "Last year, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was touting the research of a PhD student on the impact of AI on the workforce that “floored” professors in the field. Now the university is backing away from it and calling for it to no longer be published. On Friday, MITannouncedthat it reviewed the paper following concerns and determined that it should be “withdrawn from public discourse.” The paper, titled “Artificial Intelligence, Scientific Discovery, and Product Innovation” snagged all sorts ofattentionandheadlinesfor its finding that scientists aided by AI tools were considerably more productive than their peers working without the technological aidâbut those same researchers making more discoveries were significantly less satisfied by their work. The work was considered a breakthrough, and Daron Acemoglu, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who recently won the Nobel Prize in economics, described it as “fantastic.” But the findings didn’t quite sit right with some. According to the Wall Street Journal, a computer scientist with experience in materials science approached MIT professors with questions about how the AI tool used in the experiment worked and just how big of a boost in innovation that it was actually responsible for. The professors took those concerns to the university, which started a review process that ultimately led to MITstatingthat it “has no confidence in the provenance, reliability or validity of the data and has no confidence in the veracity of the research contained in the paper.â The institution didn’t expand on what exactly was wrong with the paper, citing “student privacy laws and MIT policy.” But the researcher responsible for the paper is no longer affiliated with the university, and MIT has called for the paper to be pulled from the preprint site arXiv. It has also withdrawn the paper from consideration by the Quarterly Journal of Economics, where it had been submitted for evaluation and eventual publication. David Autor, an MIT economist who touted the paper,told WSJ, “More than just embarrassing, itâs heartbreaking.” It’s also a major blow to research on AI in the workforce. The paper seemed to suggest that researchers were making many more discoveries when aided by AI, suggesting that there may be a boom in scientific breakthroughs on the horizon. Now there’s doubt around just how much of that was genuine, and just how much we can learn from how the introduction of AI affects the people using these tools.

In the game, players can take the“Perfect Cup” side questin Chapter 8 and acquire ingredients to make the best cup noodles your party member Gladiolus has ever had. Completing the quest gives Ignis anew recipeh!to cook for everyone else and provides stat boosts. These weren’t just any cup noodles featured inFinal Fantasy XV: they weretheCup Noodle, from Nissin, a popular food manufacturer in Japan. Billboards for the noodles are placed around the game, and Square Enix later updated the game with even more cup noodle-themed cosmetics.XVwas no stranger to product placement; another side quest had Noctis gazing at a dress worn by his lover Luna that was made by Vivienne Westwood, and the American Express logo could be spotted throughout the game.

    "title": "Trump Demands Walmart ‘Eat the Tariffs’",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump is employing a new strategy to ensure that consumers don’t blame him for the increasing cost of goods: begging corporations to save him. In a post on Truth Social on Saturday morning, the President took aim at Walmart and said the corporation should stop blaming his ongoing trade war for rising prices and insisted the company “EAT THE TARIFFS.” “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain. Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected,” he wrote. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, ‘EAT THE TARIFFS,’ and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” Trump demands that Walmart âEAT THE TARIFFSâ and not raise pricespic.twitter.com/Fo2dNCUg03 — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar)May 17, 2025 Have to say: he had us in the first half there, not gonna lie. Trump, as he will do from time to time, stumbled into a “right for the wrong reasons” situation by calling out the fact thatcorporate profits continue to climbat a time when thecost of living is going upand wages are largely stagnantâand in some cases,declining. That is plenty of reason to press these companies to pay their employees a fair wage, improve the benefits and conditions of their workforce, cap executive compensation, or just tax them more and fund social services. Instead, he’s only calling out corporate greed because it might affect him. Consumer confidence is already at athree-year low, and hisapproval ratings are sinking, including hittingnew lows on economic mattersthat he is usually viewed as strong on. And that is all before we really see prices jump from Trump’s tariffs. Most retailers have kept their prices the same as they work through existing stock,per Bloomberg, but that is likely to change as new shipments come in and get hit by Trump’s tax on goods. Walmart received Trump’s attention because it has intentionallykept its prices downthrough the first couple of months of the President’s inexplicable trade war. But now it’s not so sure that it can keep that up. Walmart CEO Doug McMillonsaidduring an earnings call earlier this week that the company would do its best to keep prices down, but “we arenât able to absorb all the pressure given the reality of narrow retail margins.” That means price increases are coming, and consumers are going to know exactly what caused it: Trump’s tariffs. So now the President seems stuck between a rock and a hard place that he willingly crawled into. He can’tfurther back down from his trade war, especially with China or he’ll look weak. And he can’t really do anything to bring down costs for consumers despite loving totake credit for cheap gas and eggswhenever he can. So he’s stuck posting into the void, screaming at corporations to “EAT THE TARIFFS” for him. It’s a far cry from hisclaimthat tariffs are “a tax on a foreign country” that “doesn’t affect our country.” Donald TrumpTariffstrade warWalmart Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Palmer Luckey have stacked the deck. Trump called former FBI Director James Comey a \"dirty cop\" and said he would leave it up to his underlings.

A good pair of wireless earbuds has become every bit as much a must-have outdoor accessory as sweat-wicking clothes, running shoes, and sunscreen. (OK, not sunscreen â nothing’s more important than that.) As the temperatures climb and we return to the great outdoors for our runs, hikes, rides, or just to lie out and enjoy the sunshine, having our favorite music or podcast with us is essential.Which is why Amazon’s 32% off deal on the AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds is so well-timed. See at Amazon Now that they’re back to just $169, the AirPods 2 are the best upgrade you can make to bring your favorite content with you anywhere, along with crystal-clear calls and outstanding noise cancellation for when you just want to be alone with your thoughts or your tunes. Apple’s H2 processor chip, their latest and most powerful, is at the heart of the AirPods Pro 2 and gives them better sound quality and features than any of the previous iterations of the AirPods. Apple loaded the latest version of the AirPods Pro with significant upgrades across the board, starting of course with the sound. The H2 chip powers an improved low-distortion driver that covers the entire range of sound from sharp highs to booming bass. When you encounter music that’s optimized for spatial audio, the AirPods Pro 2 are ready and waiting with a personalized delivery that suits your unique ear shape and moves with your head. All in all, it’s the most immersive and true-to-life sound yet from any Apple earbuds. When you’re switching from your music or podcast to a call on your iPhone, the Voice Isolation technology of the AirPods Pro 2 kicks in, letting your voice come through clear and crisp even when you’re in a noisy environment. That music-to-phone toggling and all of the other controls you need are also upgraded in the AirPods Pro 2, with simple swipe, press, and hold motions to manage playback. Most impressively, Siri can detect when you nod yes or shake your head no when it asks if you want to hear a message, answer a call, or manage a notification from your iPhone or iPad. See at Amazon The biggest tech leap taken by the AirPods Pro 2 is the Active Noise Cancellation, which now eliminates up to 2 times more background noise than the first AirPods Pro, and even more than the AirPods 4.

    "article_text": "Two years ago, VFX artists acrossMarvel, theÂAvatarÂfranchise, andDisneyall seperately voted to form their own unions. With the help of theIATSE, the three worker groups have now “overwhelmingly” voted to ratify contracts which ensure better conditions for staff working on these respective projects. Both contractsâMarvel and Disneyfall under one agreement, andÂAvatarÂteam Lightstormhas its ownâoffer minimum wage increases and access to IATSE’s pension plans and meal penalties. In terms of differences, Lightstorm’s contract guarantees preferential hiring rights on futureAvatarÂfilms for current bargaining employees (and without a pay loss), new wage scale rates based on a 40-hour work week for those future films, and minimum call rates for the sixth and seventh days of work. This contract also has “protections against technological change and subcontracting” andAI-relatedlanguage adopted from IATSE’s Basic Agreement. Marvel and Disney’s specific contract ensures extra pay for “hazardous set conditions, and health and comfort during long postproduction assignments,” plus job descriptions for each role and legally binding agreements “enforced through a grievance and arbitration procedure.” Cael Liakos-Gilbert, a VFX wrangler for Marvel, considers the ratified contract “not just a victory for [us], but a much-needed win for the entire VFX industry. Seeing this come together after over two years as an organizer, contract negotiator, and now a founding union member is one of the proudest moments of my life. […] Weâve put ink to paper and given our people the contract we deserve.” “Just one more way our crew is leading the industry, and I deeply hope that other VFX crews will follow with us and vote to Unionize,” added Lightstorm’s virtual camera coordinator Justin Meade. “Our power is in our labor, and our voices are heard through our solidarity, and now theÂAvatarcrew will all have the chance at an equitable life working in one of our countryâs best industries.” VFX artists first started unionizing after reports in 2022 allegedintense crunchfor VFX-heavy projects, with Marvel and Disney the worst offenders.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. This Sunday afternoon,Seagate has just re-stocked its 22TB external hard drive on Amazon. The 20TB variant had been sold out for the past a few days, and the 22TB variant was nowhere to be found. Good news is that Seagate has replenished its stock and the timing could not be more opportune: the 22TB drive is now available for arecord low price tag of just $249, which is a massive discount from its usual $599 retail price. See at Amazon This is a record-low for an external drive of this enormous size, but it also trumps most other players and even used internal drives on sale. For comparison, the next step-up inSeagate’s line after this one is currently on sale for $329 as the 24TB HDD. It might at first glance seem reasonable to splurge on the larger-capacity one, but if you break down the price by the number of terabytes, the 22TB one gives you far more bang for your buck. You can get it for $249.99, and you’re only paying approximately$11.36 per terabytewhile the 24TB comes out to approximately $13.75 per TB. This Seagate external hard drive featuresUSB 3.0 connectivity for fast data transferand comes loaded with Seagate’s Rescue Data Recovery Services which offers peace of mind should there be involuntary loss of data. Over2,000 have been sold in one month alone, and it has a rating of 4.5/5 on over 200,000 reviews. Putting this offer into context withcloud storage servicessheds its price into even sharper perspective: Professional cloud storage services generally charge monthly or yearly fees which can mount in no time. To put it in perspective, maintaining 22TB or more in the cloud often costs hundreds of dollars a year, and that’s just for standard access. Within two years, the total cost of cloud storage far surpasses the initial price of a high-capacity external hard drive. Furthermore,with physical storage like the Seagate HDD, your data is entirely in your control, with no concern over account hacks, service outages, or terms-of-service changes. It’s also worth noting that, while the 24TB model is tempting at $329, the price jump simply doesn’t have the relatively minor increase in capacity to offer most customers. Unless you have a specific need for each and every terabyte,the 22TB drive is the more cost-effective option. The reality that the 20TB and 22TB models haven’t been available for days is evidence of how rapidly smart buyers are snapping up these deals. Whatever the reason of this external hard drive discounts, consumers stand to benefit: If youâve been waiting for the right moment to expand your local storage whether for backups, media libraries or professional archives, this is a rare opportunity that Amazon offers you.

Ugreen is one of the top names in the portable charging world, side by side with Anker at the very top of the market. Both are famous for innovation and their products are the go-to option if you need to keep your devices charged while on the go. But with tariffs looming that will have a major impact on the cost of electronics imported from Asia, there has never been a better time to purchase quality equipment while it is still available at current prices. TheUgreen 25,000mAh 145W power bankis one of the most powerful and advanced options available today, and it’scurrently on sale at Amazon for just $65, which is a full 34% discount from its usual $99 priceand anall-time low price! See at Amazon What truly distinguishes this UGREEN power bank from all other devices on the market is 1) its incredible charging speed and 2) its capacity. With atotal output of 145W and support for Power Delivery 3.1 and Quick Charge 3.0, this battery pack can fast-charge almost any device you can imagine. The main USB-C1 port delivers up to 140W which can be used tocharge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from dead to 56% in just 30 minutes. This is a game-changer for professionals and travelers who need to recharge laptops, tablets or gaming consoles like the Steam Deck in record time. The power bank features three output ports-two USB-C and one USB-A-making it easy to charge multiple devices at once, whether youâre topping up your phone, tablet, or even a drone. The massive capacity of25,000mAh (most of the competitors only offer 10,000mAh) means you can fully charge most laptops at least once, and smartphones up to five timesbefore you have to recharge the power bank itself. Despite this huge capacity, the unit is still fairly compact, light-weighted and portable. It fits smoothly into a laptop bag or backpack and is perfect for traveling, business trips or long days away from wall sockets. Another feature is the smart digital display that shows how much battery percentage is left with a glance, which is quite cool and useful. Charging the power bank itself is fast and efficient, thanks to its two-way fast charging: Using a 65W PD charger (not included), you can top up the entire battery in just two hours which is extremely fast for a device of this size. The bi-directional charging also means that you can charge the power bank and your devices simultaneously.

    "title": "How to Watch Eurovision 2025 Live from Abroad",
    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Eurovision 2025 marks the 99th edition of the contest and sees Switzerland as the host. If your life revolves around music, you’ll want to know how to watch Eurovision live from abroad. The good news is that a free channel broadcasts it. So, if you want to watch Eurovision outside the UK or from any other country, youâre in luck. The Grand Final, which starts on Saturday at 20:00 London time, will be broadcast on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. Hereâs how to access it overseas. Despite its growing popularity, this music spectacle isn’t available anywhere. If you’re a Brit abroad, on a business trip or vacation, you’ll be left without access to this significant event. As you know,it’s on BBC iPlayer. However,BBC iPlayer works only in the United Kingdom. The streaming service is subject to multiple licensing agreements, and as a result, can’t broadcast abroad. Simultaneously, it offers a free broadcast of Eurovision 2025 inFull HD and English commentary. People outside the UK have explained that they still use BBC iPlayer, despite its geo-restriction. As many people have agreed, a VPN is the key factor, as it allows the user toswitch their IP addressand online location. Watch Eurovision Abroad With NordVPN The trick with this streaming service is thatonly specific BBC iPlayer VPNs work. According to the fans of this streaming service and TV channel,NordVPN is the one that works most reliably and without issues. It also offers 400+ servers in the UK, all with 10 Gbps server ports, unlimited bandwidth, and fast speeds. NordVPN also works on all devices, so even if you’re on a bus or train, you can watch Eurovision live on your phone. BBC iPlayer is 100% freeand only requires an account.NordVPN is a paid VPN, but it’s also free for 30 days: a money-back guarantee lets people get the service, watch the Eurovision finale online, andbe refunded once it ends. With everything you’ve spent returned to you, you’re practically at “zero” in terms of costs. As for the workaround itself, it’s pretty simple. Users just need to connect to any UK VPN server from NordVPN and visit BBC iPlayer. Having a UK IP address, BBC iPlayer will register the user as if they were in this country. After signing in, the user can watch the event at 20:00 on Saturday. Depending on the country, you’ll also likely be able to access the live stream on TV. However, if you’re in the USA, you’ll be able tocatch it on Peacock TV, which is a paid channel that doesn’t offer a refund policy like NordVPN. In some countries, like Austria, you have ORF that broadcasts the event almost every year, albeit, in Germany. While RAI TV broadcasts the competition in Italy, RTVE has the streaming rights in Spain. That said, you can watch Eurovision live outside the UK in many European countries,but BBC iPlayer is the only English-speaking option that’s also 100% free.

On Thursday, Antirealhighlightedthe game’s recent alpha playtest and noted its environments “are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017.” To prove her point, she compared several graphics withinMarathonÂthat look similar to her own, and contrasted a graphic sheet from the game’s press kit with more of her 2017 work. She alsonotedseveral Bungie employeesâincluding Joseph Cross, the game’s art directorâhas followed her on social media for years and “never had any communication with her.” the Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs i made in 2017.@Bungie@josephacrosspic.twitter.com/0Csbo48Jgb — NÂ² (@4nt1r34l)May 15, 2025 “Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language I have refined for the last decade,” she wrote, “but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution.” On Thursday night, after “immediate investigation,”Bungiestated that a former artist included Antireal’s work “in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game.Â  This issue was unknown by our existing art team, and we are still reviewing how this oversight occurred. We’ve reached out to Antireal to discuss this issue and are committed to do right by the artist.” During aFriday livestream,ÂCross explained the former employee placed Antireal’s art “without permission or acknowledgement” in a decal sheet checked in back in 2020. He then issued an apology to Antireal, saying there was “no excuse for this oversight. […] I know how unfair this feels, and we’re doing everything we can to make this right with her.

    "title": "During the Viking Age, Pregnancies Were Political, Precarious—and Violent",
    "article_text": "Pregnant women wielding swords and wearing martial helmets, fetuses set to avenge their fathersâand a harsh world where not all newborns were born free or given burial. These are some of the realities uncovered by the first interdisciplinary study to focus onpregnancy in the Viking age, authored by myself, Kate Olley, Brad Marshall and Emma Tollefsen as part ofthe Body-Politics project. Despite its central role in human history, pregnancy has often been overlooked in archaeology, largely because it leaves little material trace. Pregnancy has perhaps been particularly overlooked in periods we mostly associate with warriors, kings and battlesâsuch asthe highly romanticised Viking age(the period from AD800 until AD1050). Topics such as pregnancy and childbirth have conventionally been seen as âwomenâs issuesâ, belonging to the ânaturalâ or âprivateâ spheresâyet we argue that questions such as âwhen does life begin?â are not at all natural or private, but of significant political concern, today as in the past. In our new study, my co-authors and I puzzle together eclectic strands of evidence in order to understand how pregnancy and the pregnant body were conceptualized at this time. By exploring such âwomb politicsâ, it is possible to add significantly to our knowledge on gender, bodies andsexual politicsin the Viking age and beyond. First, we examined words and stories depicting pregnancy in Old Norse sources. Despite dating to the centuries after the Viking age, sagas and legal texts provide words and stories about childbearing that the Vikingsâ immediate descendants used and circulated. We learned that pregnancy could be described as âbellyfulâ, âunlightâ and ânot wholeâ. And we gleaned an insight into the possible belief in personhood of a fetus: âA woman walking not alone.â An episode in one of the sagas we looked at supports the idea that unborn children (at least high-status ones) could already be inscribed into complex systems of kinship, allies, feuds and obligations. It tells the story of a tense confrontation between the pregnant GuÃ°rÃºn ÃsvÃ­frsdÃ³ttir, a protagonist in theSaga of the People of Laxardaland her husbandâs killer, Helgi HarÃ°beinsson. As a provocation, Helgi wipes his bloody spear on GuÄrunâs clothes and over her belly. He declares: âI think that under the corner of that shawl dwells my own death.â Helgiâs prediction comes true, and the fetus grows up to avenge his father. Another episode, from theSaga of Erik the Red, focuses more on the agency of the mother. The heavily pregnant FreydÃ­s EirÃ­ksdÃ³ttir is caught up in an attack by theskrÃ¦lings, the Norse name for the indigenous populations of Greenland and Canada. When she cannot escape due to her pregnancy, FreydÃ­s picks up a sword, bares her breast and strikes the sword against it, scaring the assailants away. While sometimes regarded as an obscure literary episode in scholarship, this story may find a parallel in the second set of evidence we examined for the study: a figurine of a pregnant woman. This pendant, found in a tenth-century womanâs burial in Aska, Sweden, is the only known convincing depiction of pregnancy from the Viking age. It depicts a figure in female dress with the arms embracing an accentuated bellyâperhaps signaling connection with the coming child. What makes this figurine especially interesting is that the pregnant woman is wearing a martial helmet. Taken together, these strands of evidence show that pregnant women could, at least in art and stories, be engaged with violence and weapons. These were not passive bodies. Together withrecent studies of Viking women buried as warriors, this provokes further thought to how we envisage gender roles in the oft-perceived hyper-masculine Viking societies. A final strand of investigation was to look for evidence for obstetric deaths in the Viking burial record. Maternal-infant death rates are thought to be very high in most pre-industrial societies. Yet, we found that among thousands of Viking graves, only 14 possible mother-infant burials are reported. Consequently, we suggest that pregnant women who died werenât routinely buried with their unborn child and may not have been commemorated as one, symbiotic unity by Viking societies. In fact, we also found newborns buried with adult men and postmenopausal women, assemblages which may be family graves, but they may also be something else altogether. We cannot exclude that infantsâunderrepresented in the burial record more generallyâweredisposed of in death elsewhere. When they are found in graves with other bodies, itâs possible they were included as a âgrave goodâ (objects buried with a deceased person) for other people in the grave. This is a stark reminder that pregnancy and infancy can be vulnerable states of transition. A final piece of evidence speaks to this point like no other. For some, like GuÄrunâs little boy, gestation and birth represented a multi-staged process towards becoming a free social person. For people lower on the social rung, however, this may have looked very different. One of the legal texts we examined dryly informs us that when enslaved women were put up for sale, pregnancy was regarded as a defect of their bodies. Pregnancy was deeply political and far from uniform in meaning for Viking-age communities. It shapedâand was shaped byâideas of social status, kinship and personhood. Our study shows that pregnancy was not invisible or private, but crucial to how Viking societies understood life, social identities and power.

With no antibiotics or modern dentistry, persistent ear and tooth infections were the norm for Viking-era residents of modern day Sweden. The remains are surprisingly well-preserved, which could pave the way for genetic analysis of the medieval seafaring raiders and traders. A new study suggests that Viking societies in Denmark were far less violent than their Norwegian counterparts, and with political centralization playing a key role.

    "title": "‘Textbook Case of Corruption’: Democratic Senators Call for Ethics Investigation Into Starlink’s Recent Trade Deals",
    "article_text": "Starlink, Elon Musk’s satellite internet constellation that is run through SpaceX, has caught legislators’ attention. Democratic Senators this week called for an investigation into whether the Trump administration is using trade negotiations to benefit Musk. InÂa letteraddressed to federal officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and acting director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics Jamieson Greer, a group of Democratic Senators wrote, “Musk may be using his official role and his proximity to the President as leverage for his own personal and financial benefit â even if it comes at the expensive of American consumers and the nation’s foreign policy interests.” The letter comes shortly after Musk accompanied Trump to Saudi Arabia on the president’s first overseas trip of his second term andannounced Starlink’s approval in Saudi Arabiawhile the White Housesharedits newest defense and trade agreements. The senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), and Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), noted that Starlink has an “aggressive goal” of gaining a million new customers each year. However, Starlink has “struggled to secure agreements to operate in certain emerging markets” and its growth seemed slow last year. But then things shifted. “Since President Trump took office, and Musk became a top Trump advisor, Starlink has seen a rush of new countries permitting the company to enter their markets,” the senators wrote. For example, Lesothoawarded Muskits first-ever satellite internet service license shortly afterTrump hit the country with high tariffs. Senators also highlighted recent deals with other countries “seeking a reprieve from the threat of the Trump administration’s unpredictable tariffs,” including India, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. The letter specifically mentions two articles from the Washington Post. First, anop-eddetailing that a Bangladeshi official met with Musk at the White House in February immediately after a trade meeting. There, Musk implied that the country “would not be able to get favorable trade terms” without granting Starlink access into Bangladesh. And then, areportin which the Post detailed how internal documents it obtained show that officials “have pushed nations to clear hurdles for U.S. satellite companies, often mentioning Starlink by name.” Although nothing shows the Trump administration “explicitly demand[ing] favors for Starlink in exchange for lower tariffs,” the Post reported that the State Department told officials to push for regulatory approvals. “Suggesting that a foreign government adopt Starlink in exchange for relief on tariffs appears to be a textbook case of corruption,” the senators said, while requesting an investigation into whether officials “pursued a quid-pro-quo exchange of Starlink access for tariff favors in violation of federal ethic laws.” In addition, the senators wrote that the State Department’s involvement raises additional concerns, including whether “these officials may be subverting the public’s interest in favor of Mr. Musk’s personal financial interests as they negotiate new tariff agreements â and whether they have been directed by [Musk] or [Trump] to do so.” The Senators requested that the State Department Inspector General investigate that matter.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. The old rule for shopping for portable power banks was something along the lines of“powerful, small, inexpensive: pick 2 because you can’t have all 3.”That thinking has clearly gone out the window, because UgreenÂ 100W portable charger is all of the above, especially now thatAmazon’s limited-time deal has brought it down to an all-time low price of just $53, down from $79. See at Amazon This pocket-sized powerhouse delivers a whopping20,000mAh of juice through three ports â two USB-C and one USB-A â along with a smart digital display to let you know when it needs to be recharged. Your smartphone, tablet, and earbuds can recharge at the same time, and the real kicker is the fact it’s powerful enough tocharge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from zero to 50% in just 40 minutes. On a business trip when you need to get in some critical last-second prep work on your laptop, or stay in digital communication with the office, you can’t afford to have your batteries conk out. The Ugreen portable charger is TSA-compliant, so it’s tailor made for travel. Good luck getting the airplane’s built-in seat chargers to amply charge even one of your devices, much less three. That is, when those seat chargers work at all. The 100W Ugreen charger is even better suited for leisure travel with the family, as it can juice up a Nintendo Switch 3.4 times and an iPhone 15 Pro 4.5 times, and is just as effective with tablets, Steam Decks, and anything else you need to keep everyone amused on a long trip. And with three ports, there’s no fighting over who gets to use the charger â everyone can power up their devices at the same time. The Ugreen Nexode charger’s 65W USB-C port doubles as an in/out charging port: When you need to recharge the charger, it can go from zero to fully charged in just 1.6 hours which is 5 times faster than most power banks. If you’re planning on giving the Ugreen 100W charger a constant workout and you’re worried about its durability or how it will handle the rigors of the road, there’s no need to fear. The internal battery cells are encased in a sturdy UL 94 V-0 rated flame-retardant outer shell, and it’s also designed to protect your devices from over-voltage or over-current damage, and also damage from overheating. We’ve seen many huge-capacity power banks before, and we’ve seen many pocket-sized chargers, but it’s almost impossible to find a charger this powerful that’s also this small. And of course the best part is the price â just $53 during this limited-time Amazon deal. See at Amazon Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Your Pruney Fingers After After a Bath Always Wrinkle the Same Way, Study Reveals",
    "article_text": "Pruney fingers and toes after a long time in the pool or the bathtub are one of those things we all expect but couldnât explain scientifically until recently. In 2023, Binghamton University biomedical engineer Guy German and colleagues found that this happens because the blood vessels in our digits contract when we spend too much time in water. Then a kid asked a brilliant question that triggered a whole new research project. âA student asked, âYeah, but do the wrinkles always form in the same way?â And I thought: I havenât the foggiest clue!â German explained in a Binghamton Universitystatement. âSo it led to this research to find out.â German and Rachel Laytin, a former graduate researcher at the universityâs Biological Soft Matter Mechanics Laboratory, revealed that the answer is, simply put, yes: pruney fingers always seem to wrinkle along the same patterns. They detailed their work in astudypublished in February in the Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials. The two researchers photographed study participantsâ fingers after they had been immersed in water for half an hour, then repeated the process at least 24 hours later. They compared the pruniness in the two images, looking for similarities, and found that the “topography” of the wrinkles was the same across both immersions. The blood vessels in our fingers and toes âdonât change their position muchâthey move around a bit, but in relation to other blood vessels, theyâre pretty static,â German said. “That means the wrinkles should form in the same manner, and we proved that they do.” The research also confirms something people have observed for decades: Individuals with median nerve damageâinjury to a major nerve in the handâdonât get wrinkles after prolonged water exposure. âOne of my students told us, âIâve got median nerve damage in my fingers.â So we tested himâno wrinkles!â German said. While the recent study was conducted to answer a childâs relatively simple question, the findings could have important implications for forensics, particularly in identifying fingerprints at crime scenes or bodies recovered from water. German explained that his father, a former U.K. police officer, encountered some of these difficulties while on the job. As such, âbiometrics and fingerprints are built into my brain,â he added. âI always think about this sort of stuff, because itâs fascinating.â It might be time to add pruney prints to law enforcement’s biometric database. skin conditionsWater Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Dozens of Silicon Valley Sycophants Now Work at Regulatory Agencies",
    "article_text": "Silicon Valley’s wealthiest and most galaxy-brained executives and venture capitalists went all-in on Donald Trump during the 2024 presidential election, and their investment is starting to pay off.According to the Wall Street Journal, more than three dozen people who have either worked under or are associates of Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Palmer Luckey have been placed in roles at federal agencies that oversee the businesses of their Silicon Valley bosses. Per WSJ, at least 18 federal agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Labor, Treasury Department, and Department of Defense, all employ at least one person with ties to one of Trump’s four favorite tech bros. Musk’s network is the most robust, with connections now occupying more than a dozen agencies. But all of the execs are positioned to benefit, as they have managed to place their own peopleâcurrent and former employees, lawyers, investors, and financial advisorsâin positions that oversee, regulate, and award government contracts to their companies. The WSJfoundthat companies founded, owned, or invested in by Musk, Thiel, Andreessen, and Luckey have already snagged about $6 billion worth of federal contracts just since Donald Trump took office. And while some of the bidding process started before Trump’s second term began, those companies are currently pitching themselves for many more contracts worth billions of dollars and will likely find themselves with a leg up in the procurement process. There have been some high-profile wins for these companies in that time. Palmer’s Anduril Technologiestook over a government contract originally awarded to Microsoftto build mixed-reality goggles for the Army, which could ultimately pay out $22 billion. Musk’s SpaceX scored$5.9 billionto launch Space Force missions. Thiel’s Palantir got tapped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement tobuild software for deportation processing. That’s a solid payout for the billionaires, who have poured their own money into Trump’s campaigns. Muskspent $290 millionon the project of getting Trump back to the White House, while Andreessengave at least $2.5 million, and Luckey gaveat least $400,000. Thiel, unlike these more recently Trump-curious opportunistic ghouls, has been a long-time Trump backer andgave around $1.5 millionto Trump-related groups going back to the 2016 election. All of this is on top of the cuts that Musk has managed to make at all of these agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency, which will likely reduce the resistance these companies will see in regulatory pushback. It’s hard to say some of those cuts didn’t seem at least in part targeted. USAID, which Musk tried to close the doors on entirely, wasreportedly investigating Starlink contractsat the time it got axed. Employees at the Food and Drug Administration tasked with overseeing reviews and applications related to Musk’s Neuralinkwere fired. Staffers at the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration who were researching the safety of self-driving technology like Tesla’s FSD wereforced out, too. Trump has always claimed his goal was to drain the swamp. Instead, it seems he’s just handed control of the swamp over to tech titans, who are happily swimming in it.

If you want to keep up with all the big game releases of the year, you’re not going to be able to do that without either immediately deleting them after playing or by expanding your storage capacity. When new titles clock in at over 100GB, you need to make some tough choices in terms of what gets to stay around. The easy solution it to just get yourself a much bigger solid state drive. The Samsung 990 Pro SSD heavily discounted at the moment over at Amazon: The savings range from$60 to $163 offdepending on the exact version you get, be it 1TB, 2TB, or 4TB. For instance, the 1TB model is available for$99 on Amazon, which is a almost a 40% discount from its regular price of $159, while the4TB version has dropped to $302 from $464. The 2TB model is also on salefor $164, down 34% from its $249 original price. See 1TB internal SSD at Amazon See 4TB internal SSD at Amazon Say goodbye to long load times in the games you play: The Samsung 990 Pro Gen 4 SSD is designed for superior performance with fast speeds while maintaining power efficiency. It has readspeeds of up to 7,450 MB/s and write speeds of up to 6,900 MB/s. This generation 4 SSD from Samsung will help you achieve this high performance while using less power overall. Compared to the 980 Pro, the 990 Pro is capable of up to 50% improved performance per watt. Great for not just gaming, but any intensive workflows like video editing, 3D modeling, or working with large datasets. Gaming consoles need the extra space just as much as gaming PCs do. The original PlayStation 5 comes with only 825 GB of internal storage. With the ballooning size of AAA games on the market, youâll be lucky if you can have more than three games downloaded onto your system at a time. We have good news: The PS5âs storage can be expanded by installing a compatible M.2 solid state drive. The Samsung 990 is compatible, but with a catch. Youâre going to want the heatsink option to prevent overheating. The heatsink also has futuristic RGB LED lights because of course it does. Right now, you can get the 1TB version of the 990 Pro with a heatsink for $108. The 2TB version goes for $180 while the 4TB version goes for $324. Thatâs just for the console players though. If you yourself or the loved one youâre buying for is gaming on PC, then the non-heatsink version will work out just fine.Â Get the Samsung 990 Pro startingÂat $100 for the 1TB versionÂ ($60 off),Â$170 for the 2TB versionÂ ($80 off), or$202 for the 4TB version($163 off).

    "article_text": "The comedian is actually named after the sheep, and the sheep can cast lightning magic. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In YouTuberSlimX's accounting of Baldur's Gate 3's behind-the-scenes secrets, he hit me with one that sent my jaw through the floor: You can summon a magical sheep who can cast endgame spells by killing a minor NPC and ringing both of Act 3's bell tower bells. You may have encounteredHarvard Willoughbyin normal play: This monocole-wearing, mustachioed comedian will challenge you to a duel of wits at the Elfsong Tavern's open mic night. Kill him,and your initiation to the Dark Brotherhood will be completeyou'll have taken your first step to meeting therealHarvard Willoughby. Next, you have to climb the Lower City guard tower, then the Church of the Open Hand belfry in Rivington and ring their respective church bells in that order. There won't be any pop-up or acknowledgement from the game, but a \"Mysterious egg\" will show up in your party camp. I found it by the chicken coop in the Rivington bivouac, but I would imagine it has a corresponding location at the Lower City docks and in the Elfsong Tavern. Click on the egg, and you'll receiveHarvard Willoughby, \"Nature's Fury,\"as a summoned helper. This Harvard only has 29-54 HP depending on your difficulty, but he can cast an impressive array of high-level spells, including Call Lighting and Wall of Thorns. He also lights on fire at the beginning of combat encounters, and has a chance of exploding at the beginning of each round that increases as the fight drags on. If Harvard Willoughby dies by this or any other means, he'll be gone for good. A developer comment in BG3's code describes the human Harvard as \"a tribute to our favorite sheep,\" so this summoned Harvard is presumably the original⁠—accept no substitutes.

I'm reminded ofDiablo 2's legendary Cow Level, which requires you to combine a dead NPC's peg leg with a town portal scroll to enter a dimension of \"Hell Bovines.\" There's also The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind'sEltonbrand, an upgraded version of the daedric katana, Goldbrand. To get Eltonbrand, you have to be a vampire with the standard sword, a specific key, and 11,171 gold in your inventory when you talk to a certain quest giver. It's all a confounding reference to former Duke and Chicago Bulls basketball player,Elton Brand, whose legacy on the court may wind up outlived by his one in CRPGs.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. For the 7th birthday of the House Flipper videogames, developer Frozen District has released (free) co-op DLC forHouse Flipper 2, letting you make busted houses into less-busted houses with your friends in real time. It's also cross-platform, which means you can play on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation with up to four players on any other the other ones. To celebrate the co-op release, and the series birthday, House Flipper 2 is also having a free weekend on Steam, on now. The co-op expansion works with the entire base game, including its sandbox mode, and comes with four brand new properties to flip that are designed with co-op gameplay in mind. One stands out especially—a cute little row of four attached beach bungalows, one for each co-op player to customize. You could have a little vote at the end for whose house is cutest. Just spitballing here. Like the base game, the co-op expansion is also fully compatible with the big ol' library of house flipping designs made by other playerson mod.io. It seems a bit weird to release a free co-op update as separate DLC rather than a normal patch, but free is free. House Flipper 2 released in 2023, and reviewer Tom Sykes called it a casual and cozy inan 81% PC Gamer review. \"It's not so detailed a renovation sim that it feels exhausting or overwhelming, nor so casual that you barely need to be there. Renovating feels cozy,\" he said. Since release it also got a big fat content update witha hundred plus new things to decorate with, followed by a few other updates of similar size, as well as an oddly enjoyableThe Floor is Lava modethat sounds like an April Fools' update but isn't but also was released on April 1.

    "article_text": "Labyrinth of the Demon King players: Save that katana hilt. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Labyrinth of the Demon Kingis a must-play: It's a first-person, survival horror dungeon crawler that feels like an unholy fusion ofKing's Field, Resident Evil, and Condemned. When you do check it out, though, I've got one big piece of new player advice. Actually four, come to think of it: Mild location and item spoilers for Labyrinth of the Demon King ahead. You begin the game with a broken katana, with Demon King's first real weapon being a grody, rusted sword for the first act. You'll soon meet a little blacksmithing Yokai who will upgrade your gear (+1, +2, etc.) in the classicFromSoftwarefashion, but he'll also offer to fix your broken katana⁠—he just needs an intact one to donate materials. Here's the rub: He explicitly says not to just use the first crappy sword you come across, and will even mock you if you use the first act's rusted blade. It's a one-time offer, and you'll get what you pay for. With that in mind, I kept the katana hilt in my back pocket until I unlocked the main shop, bought the much nicer Royal Katana, and combined that with the hilt. Turns out, I should have waited even longer. I messaged PCG Australia editor Shaun Prescott (who wrote ourLabyrinth of the Demon King review) something along the lines of, \"gee, I hope there isn't a better katana down the line I should have used instead.\" \"Yes there are multiple versions of the blade you can create,\" Labyrinth of the Demon King lead dev, J.R. Hudepohl told me in an interview this week. \"While the result will always be a Chrysanthemum Blade, the model and stats are unique based on the katana used for the repair. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"For example, if you’d used the rusty katana instead of the royal, you’d get a weaker sword with a slightly different look, and if you used the one found in the prison/bathhouse you’d get a repaired model that physically resembles them more and inherits some of their stats/applied status effects.\" Hudepohl then gave me a hint that now has me ready to take a second trip through the labyrinth. \"If you decide to replay it I’d recommend trying the prison sword to repair the broken katana as that’s my personal favorite result,\" he said. That really got me, because the prison sword in question is a bad ass cursed red blade in the spirit ofElden Ring'sRivers of Blood. The good news is I didn't even consider uninstalling the game from my Steam Deck after finishing it. I love to be surprised by a game after the fact, to feel like I knew it so well and find out it had secrets and systems I never even engaged with⁠—it's a hallmark of some of my very favorite games like Disco Elysium or Baldur's Gate 3. The fact that many players, like me, might completely miss the sheer depth of Demon King's weapon upgrades puts a big dumb grin on my face. Shaun gave Labyrinth of the Demon King an 81% score in hisreview, calling it \"the most potent weird horror we're likely to see in 2025.\" You can grabLabyrinth of the Demon King on Steam⁠—it runs flawlessly on Steam Deck⁠—for a launch price of $15, rising to an MSRP of $20 on May 27. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

    "title": "If the original Grand Theft Auto came out today, we’d call it a roguelike",
    "article_text": "Since the very beginning, permanent loss has been baked into the GTA experience. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. \"Knowledge was my main game, to figure out the law, to figure out the frame,\" rapped Robert De Negro in Joyride, the winningly goofy GTA title rap. \"Just when I thought I knew justice, a cop behind me said, 'You've just been busted.'\" I thought I knew the original Grand Theft Auto. That I had The Knowledge, like a London cabbie, and could find my way through Liberty City's maze of bridge-connected islands. Most of all, I thought I knew what it meant to be Busted—thrown on the ground by a blue-jacketed patrolman in the midst of a mission and booted to the nearest police station, with the admonishments of some gangster overlord ringing in my ear. As it turns out, despite many a 2D joyride in my early teens, I understood little of how DMA Design's game actually works. How it could be mastered, and what going to jail really costs you in the most brutal GTA ever made. Let me take you aside, like a local wiseguy, and explain the rules of this town. From the moment you step onto the streets, you're on the hook for every mistake you're about to make. There are no saves here, and no reloads. Five deaths and you're out—unless you can bag an extra life from a Kill Frenzy, the incredibly high-risk predecessor to the Rampage. The most likely outcome of being handed a flamethrower and 60 seconds to run up a bunch of points is that your sprite ends up covered in little yellow and orange pixels, burning to a crisp before your eyes. Fail a mission, and it stays failed. Afterwards, you'd better hope there's still a phone ringing somewhere in the city, because jobs are your primary way of building a score multiplier. And racking up millions of points, through mission rewards and murders, is the only way to beat a level and advance to the next. Short of a cheat code, of course. The original GTA is a '90s artifact through and through, and its dev team were evidently inspired by the arcades they'd grown up with—leveraging the structure of a scorechaser to grant players freedom in the way they approached its open world. By today's definitions, however, Grand Theft Auto is absolutely a roguelike. Its punishing permadeath mechanics teach hard lessons, and as your understanding grows—as you figure out the law, figure out the frame—you develop a personal set of rules for survival. Most are about preparation: memorising the locations of multiplier pickups on the map, and grabbing them up early to maximise point gains; keeping a PDF map handy so that you can find the next bridge and know where your nearest spray shop is; never starting a mission with cops on your tail. Its punishing permadeath mechanics teach hard lessons. Some of my selfset rules, however, are more idiosyncratic. Never attempting to run over a policeman in reverse, for example. You'll only miss, and they'll throw you out of your seat faster than a rodeo bull. If you must engage them in combat, meanwhile, you're best walking backwards while you fire. That way you'll have valuable extra seconds to steer the hail of bullets into the path of the oncoming officer. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. These are tools for coping with GTA's cruelest aspect: arrests. They happen immediately on physical contact with any cop. And every time you're busted, your multiplier total is halved. Which means, if you've racked up a x12 point modifier, you're suddenly on a x6—looking at a couple more hours of risk-taking on your remaining lives, rather than another 20 minutes. As a result, the most valuable pickup in all of GTA is the Get Outta Jail Free Card, which grants you one instance of clemency while, somewhere, the Monopoly Man twirls his moustache. You can argue that this framework isn't best suited to a knockabout criminality sim. While Grand Theft Auto's speeding vehicles and roster of rocket-propelled weapons encourage recklessness, its underlying structure enforces caution and brings a terrible weight to the consequences of any screw-up. The threat of failure is undeniably tense, but it's not exactly what you'd call joyriding. It's harder to argue with the influence of this initial setup on the direction of GTA down the years. If you've ever raged against the loss of your weapons in a pre-HD Rockstar game, then you've felt the ripples of design decisions first made in the mid '90s. Every player's relationship with Vice City was shaped by the need to remember where free guns and armour could be acquired after a setback. And lest we forget, GTA Online has a system for banking earned cash at an ATM machine, while looking over your shoulder for any player who might mug you. Exactly the kind of tension DMA baked into the series in the beginning. Those same ATMs in GTA Online are completely undermined by online banking you can access from your in-game phone—a concession that suggests Rockstar and its players aren't always on the same page when it comes to having progress snatched away. Over time, however, the developer has doubled down on the frisson of giving us something to lose—particularly with cargo sales which send out a global alert to every player on a server. The more rivals there are in the area, the more cash you stand to gain—but the higher the risk of losing it all to some chancer on a flying bike. Today, heists are perhaps the greatest expression of that sweaty pressure first seen in the '90s. It would be notable if GTA Online's centrepiece raids demanded that one player pulled off a series of feats in vehicle handling, shooting and underwater navigation with minimal mistakes. Instead, they demand the same offour players—all operating together in an unbroken sequence over multiple mission stages, while sharing a tiny pool of lives. In the midst of a prison break, a couple of slip-ups can easily cost you an hour. In this way, modern-day GTA somehow captures more of 1997's spirit than the series has in most of the intervening decades. Rockstar still leans on our shrieking frustrations and painful, permanent losses—all to create moments of exquisite triumph. We're not criminals out there in Los Santos. We're rogues.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You would think theSkyblivionandOblivion Remasteredteams would be the bitterest of rivals, given how Bethesda surprise dropped a comprehensive makeover of its 2006 RPG on the heads of a team of volunteers, one which had been diligently working on a similar project for years. Yet if anything, the relationship between the two groups of Oblivion overhaulers is turning into a game dev love story. It all started before Oblivion Remastered had even been revealed, with Skyblivion project lead Rebelzize sending\"all love and no hate\"to Bethesda as rumours of a remake swirled. Following the reveal, Bethesda responded byhanding out game keysof the remastered version to the entire Skyblivion team, while calling the modders' own efforts\"very special\". Now, that winged stealth archer Cupid has fluttered behind The Elder Scrolls' very own David and Goliath, striking both with a ranged sneak attack for 3x damage. Bethesda formally invited the Skyblivion team round to its house, and the modders accepted. Moreover, there are pictures to prove it. The news and images were shared by Rebelzize on X. \"Massive thanks for @BethesdaStudios for inviting us to the office and showing us around,\" he wrote. \"Seeing the excitement from the Bethesda team for @TESRSkyblivion has been absolutely unreal.\" The images include the Skyblivion team lined up with various Bethesda devs, including studio head Todd Howard, and the modders in discussion with Bethesda devs in one of the studio's meeting rooms. Massive thanks to @BethesdaStudios for inviting us to the office and showing us around. Seeing the excitement from the Bethesda team for @TESRSkyblivion is absolutely unreal.Thank you❤️🔥 pic.twitter.com/37S2F5KMlqMay 16, 2025 While this is all very wholesome, the cynical part of my brain says that Bethesda's reasons for having the Skyblivion team over are largely self-interested, as it doesn't want to be seen as steamrolling a highly anticipated, years-long modding project on the cusp of launch. That said, Bethesda didn'thaveto do any of this, and could possibly have taken a much harsher stance toward Skyblivion, attempting to shut the project down. Hence, whatever Bethesda reasons, it's great to see such a big studio being so supportive of a modding project like this. While Oblivion Remastered is already out (and generallywell received) Skyblivion's release date remains no more specific than 2025. But Rebelzizeconfirmedlast month that the overhaul is \"still on track for release\".

    "title": "Take-Two CEO reckons Civilization 7's mixed reception is just history repeating itself: 'Every time we've come out with a new platform iteration of Civilization, there's been some consternation on the part of consumers'",
    "article_text": "Strauss Zelnick admits the sequel \"definitely had some challenges\", but says that overall \"we're really happy with how it's going\". When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Civilization 7has proved one of the more divisive games of 2025 thus far. At present, itsSteam ratingis split almost precisely down the middle, between players who enjoy its attempt to streamline the experience, and those who believe the changes result in a shallow and predictable turn-based strategy. It's the most divided response to a new Civilization game that I can personally recall. But according to Strauss Zelnick, boss of Civ 7's publisher Take-Two Interactive, the reaction is nothing new when compared to the great span of the series' history. Speaking toGamesIndustry.bizin a wide-ranging chat, Zelnick was asked how he saw the post-launch journey of Civilization 7 playing out. While he admitted the game \"had some challenges at launch\", Zelnick pointed out this is hardly the first time a new Civilization game has met with a divergent response from its player base. \"Every time we've come out with a new platform iteration of Civilization, there's been some consternation on the part of consumers who love the franchise and are beholden to its prior iteration,\" Zelnick explained. \"Then, we will occasionally do updates, make changes, address concerns, and the sales cycle ends up being very long, and people—once again—fall in love with it.\" This isn't to say Zelnick believes the game is perfect. He concedes that \"we probably have a bit more work to do.\" But he's seemingly happy with the game's commercial performance, stating that \"sales are strong\". Moreover, he believes that the critical response will eventually catch up with the commercial one: \"We're really happy with how it's going—and I think in the fullness of time, it'll be just great.\" There's certainly some truth to Zelnick's comments. Civilization has detractors whenever Firaxis makes changes to the formula. That said, I think Zelnick's response downplays thenumberof detractors this particular iteration has. More than three months on from launch, just 48% of Steam reviewers view the game positively. That's only 4% better than when the game launched, which isn't exactly a dramatic improvement. As for the game's commercial performance, Zelnick's comment about strong sales does seem accurate. According to data from video games analyst Mat Piscatella (viaGamespot) Civilization 7 is the 8thbest-selling game of 2025 in the US. Yet at the same time, Civilization 7 seems substantially less popular than previous entries in the series. According to Steam charts, Civilization 7 had 9,537 players in-game at the time of writing, compared to 43,307 players in Civilization 6 and 15,981 players in Civilization 5. This doesn't seem to line-up so well with Zelnick's comment about Civ 7's longevity. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Among all this, it's worth noting that we fell on the more positive side of the Civilization 7 debate. Robert Zakreviewedthe game back on launch, and thought its changes to be largely, if not entirely, successful. \"It's the most streamlined and pared-back the series has been in a long time, which certainly helps with accessibility and pacing—particularly in multiplayer—but may leave some yearning for the depth and mechanical diversity of its predecessors.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "title": "REPO developer teases the game's 'most powerful weapon' yet, a mountable cannon that will 'turn your cart into a battle tank'",
    "article_text": "Balance changes to enemies and player health also in the works. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. REPO's latest community update video made me laugh so hard that the top half of my head almost fully flapped backward, much like the yapping mouths of the game's own pedal bin-shaped robots. This wasn't due to the video's typically goofy opening, though I did crack a slight smile at the introductory silliness. Rather, it's because presenter and semiwork designer Pontus spends the first half of the update talking about balance, then reveals a new weapon so powerful it risks obliterating the concept of balance from reality. Posted on Friday, the video initially discusses REPO's infamous health glitch, which, through a somewhat convoluted process, allowed players to completely refill their health between levels beyond what a health pack normally provides. Semiwork recently patched out this exploit to the chagrin of some players. But the glitch's popularity convinced semiwork to take a fresh look at REPO's health system. This resulted in an array of planned adjustments. An unspecified future update will boost the recharge given by the REPO truck's health beam, while also adding a team discount on health kits. As Pontus explains: \"The more players there are, the cheaper the health kits will get.\" This isn't the only balance change coming soon to REPO. The developer plans to make the game's enemies easier to stagger for players below level five, thus giving new semibots a better chance of fleeing from the game's creepy foes. Pontus also states that the game's crystal items will also be receiving a rework, though he doesn't specify how. All of this, Pontus says, forms part of semiwork's reactive, community focussed design, constantly tweaking and adjusting the game so that it fits with what players like. \"We always take a look at glitches that become popular, or even mods. And we take that as a sign that we need to tweak or change the gameplay design, or add to it.\" Immediately after saying this, Pontus reveals the cart cannon. Described by semiwork as \"the most powerful weapon in REPO yet\", the cart cannon is basically a turret that you mount inside the bed of the trolley used to transport valuable items back to your truck. The cannon has two fire modes. The first is, uh, canonically cannon, launching heavy projectiles that burst on impact. The second is a ferociously powerful laser beam that destroys anything caught in its path (including other semibots). Whichever you prefer, Pontus states the cannon will effectively \"turn your cart into a battle tank\". Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As mentioned, it's the contract that I found so amusing, the sudden switch from deeply sensible balance chat to going absolutely hog wild with a massive gun that seems, at a glance, preposterously OP. No doubt semiwork will device some clever limitations on the cart cannon's function, though part of me hopes it doesn't. I'm here for games that occasionally throw caution to the wind, letting youcackle like Hank Scorpioas you annihilate your foes. This is all for the future, though. At the moment, semiwork is testing REPO'sfirst major updatein open beta. The update adds a bunch of major features like a new level, several new useable items, and a mechanic called overcharge that allows enemies grabbed by players to repulse them after a certain amount of time. But it seems that overcharge was itself a little overcharged, making it thefirst targetfor tweaking following player feedback of the beta. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "title": "Two Warhammer 40,000 games will be delisted from Steam on Monday, and one of them is currently on a 90% discount",
    "article_text": "You've got two days before Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon and Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach leave Steam forever. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. UK publisher Slitherine Software has announced that its two Warhammer 40,000 titles—Warhammer 40,000: ArmageddonandWarhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach—will be delisted from Steam on Monday, May 19. Slitherine revealed the games would be leaving Steam earlier this week. \"We want to inform you that the Warhammer 40,000: Sanctus Reach and Warhammer 40,000: Armageddon franchises will soon be removed from Steam and our website,\" the publisher wrote in abrief blog post. \"Starting May 19th, the games and their DLCs will no longer be available for purchase on these platforms.\" No reason was given for why the games are being pulled from Steam, though the most likely explanation is that the publisher's licensing agreement with Games Workshop for these games has expired. Slitherine did point out that both games will still be purchasable viaGoG, while players who already own the game on Steam will \"still be able to download and play as usual.\" With two days left to pick up these games on Steam, one question remains: should you? Well, both games take inspiration from the classic turn-based wargamePanzer General. Armageddon is a 2D, top-down affair, while Sanctus Reach sees you manoeuvring units across 3D, grid-based battlefields. Both games have a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam, though the number of reviews for each isn't enormous. Armageddon has almost 900 reviews, while Sanctus Reach has just over 1,100. In PC Gamer'sranking of every Warhammer 40,000 game,Sanctus Reach placed at 36 out of 51 games. \"It's not bad, but it is basic\" wrote Jody MacGregor in his summary of Sanctus Reach, highlighting that everything from the presentation to the scenario objectives are built to do the job and not much else. \"Other games do this identical thing better,\" he concluded. One of those games is Armageddon, which ranks much higher on the list at 17. Despite its 2D visuals, Armageddon better represents the scale and ferocity of a 40k conflict. Set on a hive world devastated by pollution, it provides broader, chewier tactical scenarios as Jody explains. \"Each scenario is a puzzle where you'll have to decide whether to split your battlegroups or unite them in a single wedge, lock down the bridges or move into the bombed-out buildings, scout ahead with walkers or fliers, and so on.\" Armageddon and its various DLCs are also available at a 90% discount for what time they remain available on Steam. This means can pick up thebase gamefor $4 (£3.35), whileadding in all the DLCswill set you back $9.89 (£8.43). Out of the two, then, it's clear that Armageddon is the superior game and the better deal. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's a shame these games are leaving Steam, but on the plus side, we don't have long to find out what 40k goodness will be coming to the platform in the near future. Games Workshop recently revealed that its annual Warhammer Skulls eventreturns next week, and that usually brings with it an announcement or two. Moreover, there's the small matter that Space Marine 3 isofficially in development, though don't expect to be stepping into Titus' power armour again for at least another few years. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Get yourWordleweekend off to the best possible start without help. Why not even cut directly to the best bit (winning, of course) with a sneaky little peek at today's answer? Everyone's allowed a day off, and we promise not to tell. Too much? No problem. There's a clue for the May 17 (1428) game just a little further down the page, designed to help without instantly giving today's word away. I thought I was in for a glorious winning moment. I thought I'd found that wonderful part of a special sort of successful game where a few small clues become a full row of green letters. One… two… three… four… fi—oh. Oh no. Four. Four green letters. Ah heck, so close. I sorted it all out on my next row, but I wished I'd got it right that first time. To become larger in some way, or become a more complete version of itself. A sunflower going from seed to plant. An idea from vague sketch to finished art. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Confused? Nope. The answer to the May 17 (1428) Wordle isGROWN. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

Vietnam has set a new Guinness World Record with a drone light show involving 10,518 synchronized drones. The display, which took place in Ho Chi Minh City on April 28, 2025, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Liberation of the South and National Reunification. The certified record, officially recognized by Guinness as the “largest drone light show by number of drones flying simultaneously.” appears to have come from a rehearsal ahead of an official public event planned for April 30, which was later cancelled. AV Magazinereports Reddit users speculated that the cancellation followed public criticism over advertising placements by digital payments firm VNPay during a national holiday. According to reports, removing the ads may have caused issues with the drone choreography, resulting in collisions and the eventual cancellation of another scheduled show on May 1. espite the setback, the April 28 rehearsal included detailed formations celebrating Vietnam’s history and development. The drones formed a number of images such as national emblems, historical scenes, and city skylines.

    "article_text": "This sounds impressive When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're expecting theNothing Phone 3to break cover sometime in the next couple of months, and now some major specs have just leaked, giving us a better idea of what to expect from the handset's chipset, camera setup, and battery. According toSmartprix, the phone is going to come with a \"flagship Snapdragon chipset\" from Qualcomm, though it doesn't say which specific chipset. It could be the Snapdragon 8 Elite, or the more recently announced Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. As for the camera system, it sounds like we're getting a \"significantly reworked camera system\" with a triple-lens module around the back of the phone. It'll have a \"large primary sensor\" and a periscope telephoto lens that's potentially even bigger. Lastly, the battery capacity will \"possibly\" exceed the 5,000 mAh mark according to Smartprix's sources. TheNothing Phone 2, which made its debut back in July 2023, came with a 4,700 mAh-capacity battery packed inside. Only a few days ago,we got an official videofrom Nothing CEO Carl Pei, telling us that the upcoming flagship phone would have \"premium materials, major performance upgrades, and software that really levels things up\".

    "title": "The De'Longhi Primadonna Aromatic is an espresso machine with a personality, and after one week we're already best friends",
    "article_text": "A cheery barista who happens to live in your kitchen When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Back in April, De'Longhi launched a new smart bean-to-cup espresso machine that can learn your drink preferences throughout the day: theDe'Longhi Primadonna Aromatic. I've been using it for about a week now, and it basically feels like a super-attentive barista who remembers your order every day and whips it up with a smile – and who happens to live in your kitchen. At first glance, the Primadonna Aromatic looks very similar to the excellentDe'Longhi Eletta Explore. The most obvious difference is the extra-large touchscreen, which lets you flick through a vast menu of hot and cold drinks and provides super-simple instructions to help you set up your new machine and make your first espresso. In fact, the screen is so crisp and clear that De'Longhi has been able to replace the usual dry step-by-step lessons with a slick little video that demonstrates how easy it is to select and make your chosen drink. And that's just the start… The whole package is very beginner-friendly, and doesn't assume any prior knowledge of coffee-making terminology. Things as simple as referring to the hopper as a 'bean container' are a thoughtful touch, and the tone of the interface is refreshingly conversational. For example, rather than just displaying the word 'heating' when switched on (or rumbling away without telling you what's happening at all), the Primadonna Aromatic cheerily tells you “I’ll use some hot water to heat everything up” (it communicates via on-screen text; sadly one of the few things this machine can't do is talk). Instead of telling you to attach the milk container before making a cappuccino, it asks you nicely. De'Longhi's handy Bean Adapt system, which adjusts brew settings to suit your chosen beans, is present and accessible with a quick button tap, but using it is entirely optional, and the machine doesn't risk overwhelming new users by introducing it first thing. If you just want to get on with making an espresso as quickly as possible, just flick through the menu, choose a drink, and away you go. This virtual barista even knows your name. Most of thebest bean-to-cup coffee machineslet you make user profiles, and store favorites for each person in your household, but it's usually a rather impersonal process, and is sometimes buried in a list of menus. Not so with the Primadonna Aromatic. During setup the machine will ask how many people will be using it, then create profiles for each one automatically. You can pick an avatar for each one and enter a name, but there's nothing more complicated than that. What's particularly nice is that the profile information you enter isn't just used to differentiate between user profiles. The machine will also refer to you by name. There's something nice about turning on the Primadonna Aromatic to see a friendly 'Hello Cat' in the morning. The only thing it won't do is write it on your cup. I've yet to test all of the machine's settings (the menu has over 30 hot and cold options) but my first impressions of the coffee are very positive too. Even without delving into the Bean Adapt settings, the default brewing options produced a well-balanced espresso that poured in around 35 seconds (ideal for a double shot). I've been impressed by both the hot and cold foamed milk, too. There are two carafes (understandable since cold foam doesn't use steam), which you can keep in the fridge until you need them. Each one has three texture settings, and the machine will tell you which to select when you pick a drink from the menu. The thick foam setting creates froth ideal for a cappuccino or cortado, while the middle option makes a creamier texture for lattes and macchiatos (my personal favorite). You can use any type of milk for hot drinks, but De'Longhi recommends that you only use skimmed dairy or plant milk for cold foam. I've made several iced drinks using oat milk, and the results have been excellent; the froth is creamy and sits nicely on top of the drink without dissolving. The only drawback I can see so far is the price. At £1,549.99 (about $2,000 / AU$3,200) this is pricier than most of the machines in our roundup of thebest coffee makers, but so far it's working hard to justify the expense. I'll continue to test the Primadonna Aromatic for a few more weeks, and I'll bring you a full review very soon. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

The answers to today's Connections, game #707, are… A rare day for me without mysteries, getting things right by getting them wrong (as in, right words no idea why) or nit picking over annoyingly named categories. My only doubt was with TASKS FOR A STUDENT, which I momentarily thought were about physical training and included GAME instead of ASSIGNMENT. Meanwhile, I would have guessed ALMOST, CLOSE, NOT QUITE and WARM were describing being near to something, rather than ENCOURAGING RESPONSES IN A GUESSING GAME, having forgotten all about the childhood games to which they applied. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile. Johnny is a freelance pop culture journalist who has been writing about the internet, music, football and famous people since the iPhone was just a twinkle in Steve Jobs' eye. Previously known by the pseudonym the Pop Detective, his journalistic career began making up stories about Madonna's addiction to sausage rolls (this is not true by the way). A man of few talents, his career is rich and various and includes the highs of interviewing Elton John and Blur; and the lows of interviewing Right Said Fred, appearing on a Channel 5 documentary about Peter Kay, and fact-checking the instruction manual for a German cooker.

    "title": "Ironheart: release date, trailer, confirmed cast, story details, and more on the final Marvel Phase 5 TV show",
    "article_text": "Ironheart's long-gestating standalone series will land on Disney+ in late June When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - Will make its Disney+ debut in late June with a three-episode premiere- First trailer unveiled in mid-May- Dominique Thorne returns as Riri Williams/Ironheart- Numerous supporting cast members confirmed- Story synopsis revealed- No word on whether a second season will be made Ironheartis finally ready to see the light of day. Over four years after it was first announced by Marvel President Kevin Feige, the Dominique Thorne-fronted TV series will land onDisney+on June 24. With the live-action show's first trailer being released on May 14 and its actual release being only a month away, there's no better time than now to learn more aboutIronheart. With that in mind, I've compiled this handy guide to bring you more information (and the odd rumor) on the small screen project. Below, you'll learn more about its confirmed cast, story specifics, and wider ties to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), among other notable tidbits.Spoilers follow forBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever, the Marvel film in which the titular character made her debut. Marvel Television's all-new series #Ironheart launches with a 3-episode premiere June 24 at 6pm PT/ 9pm ET, only on @DisneyPlus. pic.twitter.com/ZGRhMf33fFMay 14, 2025 As I mentioned,Ironheartwill take flight onTuesday, June 24in the US, and Wednesday, June 25 in the UK and Australia (NB: it'll launch in other world regions on these dates). It'll launch with a three-episode premiere, too. Ironheart's release has been a long time coming. Initially conceived as a movie, theMarvel Phase 5project was reworked into a TV show in December 2020 – a developmental shift that came almost two years after its original announcement. Despite making her debut inWakanda Foreverin late 2022,Ironheart's standaloneMCUadventure has been trapped in development hell ever since. There's little to no public information on why it's taken so long for this project to get off the ground. But, withDisney confirmingIronheartwould be among its 2025 TV line-uplast October, the countdown is on to its long-awaited debut. Ironheart's official trailer made its worldwide debut on May 14. And, while it looks and sounds like a fun ride,Ironheart's rumored episodic release format has got me worriedabout how good it'll actually be. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Fans had expected it to be released a day earlier during Disney's Upfront 2025 presentation. Instead, Marvel opted to build excitement for the trailer's arrival by releasing a behind-the-scenes (BTS) featurette containing lots of new footage for viewers to pore over. Before the trailer's long-overdue unveiling and the BTS featurette's release,Marvel revealedIronheart's first official footage as part of a Disney+ sizzle reel teasercelebrating its 85th birthday last August. The brief clips showed Williams flying through the streets of Chicago in her new super-suit, but that's all we were treated to until this wave of new footage hit the internet one month before the show's debut. Possible spoilers follow forIronheart. Here are the actors you'll see, plus the characters they'll play, inIronheart: Thorne, who portrayed Williams inWakanda Forever, returns to play the same character in her standalone program. For those who need a refresher: Williams is an MIT student with a genius intellect who builds a super-suit not unlike the one Tony Stark invented. InWakanda Forever, Williams' first attempt to build said suit is still in early development. And, while she's gifted a souped-up version of her design by Shuri in that film's final act, Williams is told to leave it in Wakanda at Shuri's request. In short, she'll need to continue working on her own suit in her self-titled show. Meanwhile, Ramos (In the Heights,Transformers: Rise of the Beasts) will portrayIronheart's Big Bad in The Hood. In Marvel literature, he's a Chicago-based individual who wears a mystical hood that grants him the ability to use dark magic. In the MCU, he's initially billed as an ally of Thorne's Williams, with Robbins' street gang-turned-activists – the Young Lords – offering to help Williams create her suit of armor. Based on the trailer, though, the pair will be at odds with each other soon enough. That leading duo is joined by other familiar faces and newcomers. Ross (This is Us) is attached to play Natalie Washington, Riri's MIT roommate, whileStar Warsalumnus Ehrenreich (Solo: A Star Wars Story) is set to play Joe McGilllicuddy, who's reportedly another of Riri's friends and, according to some rumors circulating online, the son of Iron Man villain Obadiah Stane. Rounding out the confirmed cast are White (Fargo,Chicago PD) is as Riri's mom, Montana (Good Girls) as Cousin John, Elam (The Many Saints of Newark) as Xavier Washington, Rash (Harley Quinn,Captain America: Civil War) as the Dean of MIT, and Aliyah (XO, Kitty) in an undisclosed role. Additionally, Sacha Baron Cohen has reportedly been cast as the Marvel demon lord called Mephisto. Given The Hood will dabble in the dark side of the Mystic Arts, this isn't as big a stretch as it sounds. If true, it'll meanIronheartwill include a previously rumoredWandaVisionvillain. Indeed, MCU fans were convinced that Mephisto was the primary villain of that Elizabeth Olsen-starring TV show for much of its run. Kathryn Hahn's Agatha Harkness was eventually revealed to beWandaVision's antagonist. Potential spoilers follow forIronheart. Here'sIronheart's official plot brief: \"Set after the events ofBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever, Marvel Television’sIronheartpits technology against magic when Riri Williams – a young, genius inventor determined to make her mark on the world – returns to her hometown of Chicago. \"Her unique take on building iron suits is brilliant, but in pursuit of her ambitions, she finds herself wrapped up with the mysterious yet charming Parker Robbins, aka The Hood.\" This kind of synopsis is par for the course for Marvel projects, butIronheart's cast and crew have given us some other hints about the character's standalone MCU story. One of the most pertinent things to bear in mind is that Ironheart isn't replacing Tony Stark as the MCU's new Iron Man-esque hero. Long-time Marvel fans will know that the pair had a mentor-mentee relationship in the comics, which is something executive producer Ryan Coogler touches on in the BTS featurette that you can watch in this article's trailer section. However, discussing the series in the same video, Marvel's Head of Television Brad Winderbaum said of the MCU's take on Williams/Ironheart: \"The story of Ironheart is not one about the mantle of Iron Man getting passed. If anything, it's the opposite.\" \"It's about her proving herself and shaping her own legacy,\" Zoie Nagelhout, another of the show's executive producers, added. In short, this is a tale about Williams and finding her own path without outside intervention. Well, from Stark (or, rather, his posthumous hologram because, well, he died inAvengers: Endgame) anyway. At first, The Hood and his gang of misfits seemingly want to help Williams achieve her ambitions of creating a suit that can rival Iron Man's. However, while the trailer and BTS featurette confirm Williams will succeed in this endeavor, it's unclear how much of a role The Hood and company will play in its development. What is clear is how much time has passed sinceWakanda Forever's endingand the start of this program. PerIronheart's BTS video, head writer Chinaka Hodge revealed it takes place \"in the days after\"Black Panther 2. So, while many other Marvel films and TV shows are set in the MCU's \"present\" (i.e. around 2026/2027), this series is apparently taking a step back into the MCU's past and is actually set in mid-2025. But I digress. If you haven't picked up on it by now,Ironheart's story will be as much of a battle between two very different forms of creation: science (or, to be more specific, technology) and magic. That's a given when you consider Williams and The Hood occupy the roles of each field's creator-in-chief in this series. However, as Kevin Feige pointed out at D23 Expo 2022 (perThe Direct), this is the first time that these opposing forces will clash in an MCU production. \"[The Hood], from the comics, he deals in the dark arts,\" Feige said. \"He deals in magic. Riri is a technologist. We've had technological heroes and villains. We've had supernatural people dealing with magic. We've never had the two at the same time, so seeing Riri go up against [The Hood] in a way that is very unique is what I think I'm most excited for.\" Here's hoping there's more than an air of creativity when these characters collide physically, then, and we're not treated (if that's the right word to use) to more bland, VFX-infused battles where the hero's skillset mirrors that of the villain's. There's only one Marvel production you need to watch on Disney+, aka one of the world'sbest streaming services, beforeIronheartis released. If you've read through this guide so far, you'll know thatBlack Panther 2, i.e. one of thebest Marvel moviesof recent years, is all you need to stream to catch up on Williams' story. She's also appeared in season 3 of the animated MCU TV showWhat If...?but because it has no bearing on Ironheart's journey in the MCU, it isn't necessary to watch the episode she appears in. Not signed up to Disney+ yet, but want to know how much it costs? Read ourDisney+ priceguide. The short answer is: I don't know.Ironheartcould've become a fundamental part of the MCU if her solo series had released sooner – in fact, given her comparisons to a certain Tony Stark and his superhero alter-ego inIron Man, Thorne's Williams could've been his natural MCU successor. With Disney shaking things up at Marvel Studios sinceIronheartwas greenlit and the latter failing to capitalize on her potential popularity post-Wakanda Forever, though, the character's MCU fate is yet to be determined. IfIronheartis a hit, it's possible that she'll be a late addition to the cast ofAvengers: Doomsdayand/orAvengers: Secret Wars. However, should the series struggle to leave an impression, Williams could find herself relegated to the side lines. Land somewhere in-between the two and, given her relative age, she may join the ranks of the MCU's long-rumoredYoung Avengers(orChampions, whatever they'll be called...) production. Until her show ends, then, we're none the wiser about what impactIronheartwill have on Marvel's cinematic juggernaut.

It's the year of the ultra-thin phone, and after the grand unveiling of theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgeearlier this week, we now have some rumored specs for theiPhone 17 AirthatAppleis expected to be unveiling in September. According to well-known tipsterYeux1122(via@Jukanlosreve), the iPhone 17 Air is going to be a mere 5.5 mm front to back – that beats the 5.8 mm thickness of the Galaxy S25 Edge by a narrow margin. The other details revealed here are that it's going to come with a 2,800 mAh battery (compared to 3,900 mAh for the Galaxy S25 Edge) and weighs around 145 grams (compared to 163 grams for theSamsungmodel). Considering theiPhone 16comes with a 3,561 mAh battery packed inside, that raises some questions about just how long the iPhone 17 Air is going to last between charges – and whether you'll be able to make it through the day without plugging it in. iPhone 17 Air rumor:5.5mm thickness145g weight2800mAh battery???However, there's a possibility that a high-density battery will be used despite the 2800mAh capacity. pic.twitter.com/G8r9QayG7oMay 17, 2025 Let's hope Apple's engineers are able to find a way to get as much juice as possible from this smaller battery and super-thin frame. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, who is usually reliable when it comes to Apple rumors, says the iPhone 17 Air battery life isgoing to be on a parwith current iPhones. We've also heard that Apple is going to introducenew high-density battery technologywith this model, meaning more battery life from less capacity. Apparently the same tech is set for the upcomingfoldable iPhoneas well.

    "title": "Think ads are bad now? Netflix and YouTube just revealed AI-powered commercials that could make cheap tiers unbearable",
    "article_text": "The terrifying sequel to today's ads is coming to a screen near you When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It already felt like the golden age of streaming was well behind us, but Netflix andYouTubehave just confirmed it with new kinds of AI-powered ads that will seriously test your patience in the near future. Netflix was the first to talk glowingly about its ad tech this week – duringits Upfront showcase, the streaming giant said it will be launching AI-generated, interactive mid-roll ads, alongside pause ads, in 2026. What does 'AI-generated' mean? Unfortunately, it's as bad as you feared. Netflix explained duringUpfrontthat these new types of ads will use \"generative AI to instantly marry advertisers’ ads with the worlds of our shows\". In other words, mid-roll ads will soon harmoniously blend in with the show you're watching, bathing your eyeballs with subtle messaging. Netflix is supremely confident that its ad-supported tier subscribers will stomach these new commercials because, according to Amy Reinhard (its President of advertising), \"members pay as much attention to mid-roll ads as they do to the shows and movies themselves\". Perhaps subscribers hurling remotes at their TV also counts toward 'engagement'. Unfortunately, turning up the ad dial makes sense for Netflix's bottom line – its ad-supported tier recently hit 94 million monthly users, which is more than twice the number from the same time last year. And Netflix is far from the only streaming service dabbling with the dark arts of new, AI-powered ad techniques. During itsBrandcastevent this week (via9to5Google), YouTube also revealed an ad technique with a different twist – one that uses Gemini to work out how to place ads in the most important parts of the video you're watching. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. YouTube calls this 'Peak Points', because it uses AI to work out the most meaningful, or \"peak\", moments to yank you away from an important moment and dunk your head into an ad message. In the example that YouTube shared, the ad was actually served just after the 'targeted moment' (a marriage proposal) rather than during it, but it still looks like a pretty cynical way to hit you with advertising right when your emotional guard is down. YouTube didn't say exactly when this new 'feature' will be rolling out. But it seems likely to arrive before Netflix's interactive mid-rolls and pause ads. Talking of pause ads, that's another trick thatYouTube has already testedin its bid to break your resolve and push you toYouTube Premium(or, in many cases, uBlock Origin). There was an age when Netflix was the scrappy, ad-free upstart that we all flocked to from cable and its endless commercials, but those days are long gone. In fact, if you're already tiring of insidious ad creep, there were some chilling remarks from Amy Reinhard (Netflix's President of advertising) at Upfront. \"If you take away anything from today, I hope it’s this: the foundation of our ads business is in place,\" she said during Upfront. \"And going forward, the pace of progress is going to be even faster\". Pass me some smart glasses with AI-powered ad blockers, then, because this doesn't sound like a fun ride. I have no issue with ads at all – it'd be hypocritical to say otherwise, writing for a website that's partly supported by them – but making them a central part of a paid service seems a bit greedy, and I worry about the melding of AI-powered ads with entertainment. As TechRadar contributor Carrie Marshallalso recently argued, Prime Video's 'Shop the Show' feature – which lets you instantly buy products featured in its shows – represents a troubling trend that's only going to get worse as we head into 2026. Prime Video is, like Netflix, very much an ad company in disguise. With AI unlocking new opportunities, the temptation to saturate shows with marketing opportunities is going to be stronger than ever, and we may increasingly feel like Truman Burbank inThe Truman Show,wondering why we have thesudden urge to go and buy a Chef's Pal. I just hope escaping these next-gen ads doesn't exclusively become the preserve of the wealthy who can afford to shell out for 14 different ad-free monthly subscriptions.

    "article_text": "The Pride and Prejudice TV show commences filming later this year When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. - Six-part series coming to Netflix- Written by author Dolly Alderton- Will be a \"period-faithful\" adaptation- Production will commence in the UK later this year- No official release date yet- Three cast members announced, including Olivia Colman APride and PrejudiceTV show is on its way to Netflix and production is scheduled to begin in the UK later this year. Another adaptation of the iconic novel by Jane Austen is a more-than-pleasing revelation. For me, Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy was (and probably still is) my Roman Empire. And now it's time for someone new to step into the role and win over the hearts of many. Directed byHeartstopper'sEuros Lyn and written by Dolly Alderton, no doubt the romantic drama will be making a bid to become one of thebest Netflix shows. But there's a lot to live up to. Fortunately, as one of thebest streaming servicesit feels in safe hands. As we await the show's arrival, here's everything we know about thePride and PrejudiceTV show from release date, to cast, to plot and more. A post shared by Netflix UK & Ireland (@netflixuk) A photo posted by on ThePride and PrejudiceTV show does not have a release date yet. In fact, we imagine it won't have one for a while, given that the show was only announced on April 10. But, it has been at least been revealed that thePride and Prejudice TV showwill start production in the UK this year(as perTudum). In an Instagram post, featured above, influencer Jack Ben Edwards can be seen reading a copy of the book by Jane Austen whilst on the phone reciting information about the new TV show adaptation for Netflix, which we'll jump into more below. Considering the cast and crew are yet to start filming thePride and PrejudiceTV show, we don't have an official trailer to share just yet. A post shared by Netflix UK & Ireland (@netflixuk) A photo posted by on While news is fairly thin on the ground for when we can expect thePride and PrejudiceTV show, what we do have isthree very important casting announcements: Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Of course, the roles of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy are the most important casting choices of this entire adaptation. And speaking toTudumabout taking on the iconic titular role, Emma Corrin said: \"Playing Elizabeth Bennet is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. To be able to bring this iconic character to life, alongside Olivia and Jack, with Dolly's phenomenal scripts, is truly the greatest honor. I can't wait for a new generation to fall in love with this story all over again.\" Full spoilers forPride and Prejudiceto follow. Pride and Prejudicewas first published in 1813 and is one of the most iconic novels from author, Jane Austen. Unsurprisingly, it's had its fair share of adaptations across film, TV and theatre in the last 200 years with actors like Keira Knightley and Jennifer Ehle playing the Elizabeth Bennet's to Matthew Macfadyen and Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy. And it's also one of the most iconic love stories in the history of fiction. So, if you don't know the plot already, then you're in for arealtreat. We won't ruin it here though aside from saying that it follows the complicated and bewildering relationship between Elizabeth, the daughter of a country gentleman, and the rich and complex Mr. Darcy, a rich estate owner. Fortunately, for fans of the timeless tale, this six-part limited series for Netflix will be a classic retelling rather than a modernisation. Speaking to Tudum, Alderton expanded on the news that her adaptation will hew closely to the original text: \"Once in a generation, a group of people get to retell this wonderful story and I feel very lucky I get to be a part of it.\" Adding: \"Jane Austen'sPride and Prejudiceis the blueprint for romantic comedy – it has been a joy to delve back into its pages to find both familiar and fresh ways of bringing this beloved book to life. \"The book is a gift to adapt – packed with drama and depth as well as comedy and charm. In it lies the opportunity to examine the complexities of love, family, friendship and society, while aspiring to Austen's delightfully observational voice.\" Describe as a \"period-faithful\" adaptation, if like Mary Bennet you find yourself saying: \"I should infinitely enjoy a book\" then Netflix are set to turn your head from the pages and up to the small screen. ThePride and PrejudiceTV show has been described as a \"limited series\", which generally means that it will encapsulate the story into the six episodes it has been announced will be released on Netflix. As such, as can't imagine there will be more seasons of the show past this point.

    "title": "ICYMI: the week's 7 biggest tech stories from Samsung's ultra-slim Galaxy Edge to DJI's magnificent new drone",
    "article_text": "Here's your firmware update for May 17, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google I/O is starting next week to usher in a new era of Android (get ready for some major AI, XR, and Android 16 news), but before then, we still have plenty of tech news stories to cover from the past seven days. Samsunglaunched an ultra-thin phone,DJIgave us a best-in-class drone, and the boombox returned. To catch up on all that and more, scroll down to see the week's seven biggest tech stories. Once you're all caught up, be sure to check out our picks for theseven new movies and TV shows to watch this weekend (May 16). After months of teasers, we finally went hands-on with the Galaxy S25 Edge, and as ourhands-on reviewcalls it, the Samsung phone for people who love to hate Samsung phones. As US mobile editor Philip Berne wrote, “The Galaxy S25 Edge is the solution to a very simple formula. Take a Galaxy S25 Plus. Shave 1.5mm off the thickness by removing the zoom camera and shrinking the battery. Add a 200MP camera sensor. Wrap it in titanium. Voila: Galaxy S25 Edge!” The thinness and lightness are something you have to experience for yourself. The design has already won over several of our writers and our social media editor, who believes it not only looks fantastic but feels great in your hand. We’ve tested the latest DJI drone, and it has certainly impressed with fantastic flight performance, speed, and power, making it hands-down the best Mavic drone to date. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That’s why ourDJI Mavic 4 Pro reviewawarded it a full 5 stars. The camera can be tilted in almost any direction, making it super versatile, it boasts a fantastic triple lens setup, and the bigger battery means you can fly it for longer between charges, meaning it offers an unparalleled degree of creative options for your next film. It’s not just a great DJI drone, it might simply be the best drone you can buy right now. We were expecting one newGarminForerunner to drop very soon, but Garmin has gone and surprised us with two new specialist running watches. The Garmin Forerunner 570 and Garmin Forerunner 970 offer some new tools, such as a speaker and microphone (all the better to take quick calls on-wrist while working out), a new Evening Report, and Garmin's brightest AMOLED displays yet. The 970 packs extra features like a titanium bezel, some unique new metrics like Running Tolerance and an ECG function. If that's not enough, we also got a new heart rate monitor, the HRM 600, which can work with the 970 to generate those advanced running metrics. It's all flashy, cool-looking stuff, but these devices aren't cheap: the 570 costs $549.99 / £459.99 / AU$999 while the 970 clocks in at $749.99 / £629.99 / AU$1,399. We're looking forward to testing, but our first instinct is that either would be a great performance boost for serious runners and owners of, say, the much older Forerunner 945 – however, those who own more recent Garmin watches probably won't be tempted to upgrade. Don’t call it a comeback. The new We Are Rewind GB-001 is a bona fide cassette boombox complete with modern upgrades like Bluetooth 5.4, a 3,000mAh battery perfect for 10 hours of speaker playback, and 104W of power – more than our classic boombox ever had. It looks like everything you could ask for, frankly, perfectly combining 2020s and 1980s tech into a package that we’re very excited to try out when we can. We know it’ll launch at the very reasonable £379 / €449 (about $505 / AU$781), but for now, there’s no confirmed release date. It’s been another busy week in the world of entertainment. Indeed, not only have we been treated to anew Superman trailerand thefirst official teaser for Marvel’s Ironheart TV show, but also a wealth of big announcements at this year’s Upfront ad-based trade show. And when we say big, we mean it. From the news thatMax will be rechristened HBO Max once more in mid-2025, and awhole host of TV show renewals by Netflix, there’s been plenty to read about over the past week. Huge as those reveals are, though, we were most impressed with Disney’s Upfront 2025 presentation. If you missed them, you can catch up on theseven biggest Disney+ and Hulu announcements here. Believe us when we say you’ll want to do so, too! Ahead of Google I/O next week Google hosted the Android Show, offering us a glimpse at the interface changes coming with Android 16. We didn’t see any new devices running the software (urgh!) but the new Material 3 Expressive guidelines call for an extensive use of color, motion effects and a whole host of visual cues that feels like they’re directly targeting 18-24 year olds – read: the most stalwart iPhone fans. In its official blog post, Google says, “It's time to move beyond 'clean' and 'boring' designs to create interfaces that connect with people on an emotional level.”We’ll have to see how this approach plays out when Android 16 starts rolling out later this year. Apple’s next-gen CarPlay system was supposed to land back in 2024, but after an extended software pitstop, it’s finally arrived – well, if you own a new Aston Martin SUV, at least. CarPlay Ultra is currently only available on the new Aston Martin DBX, but its debut has given us a taste of what’s coming to other cars (including those from Hyundai, Kia, and more). And that is a slick, iPhone-style software experience that takes over your car’s whole infotainment system. As with iOS, you can tailor CarPlay’s color schemes and wallpapers, but you can also tweak the climate control, radio stations, and heated seats, all from the same place. It’s about time, but hopefully we won’t have to wait another year for it to get a wider rollout.

    "title": "Anti-Russia sanctions are a ‘plague’ – EU nation’s PM",
    "article_text": "The EU is wrong to slap Russia with a fresh round of sanctions against the backdrop of peace talks between Moscow and Kiev, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has said. He compared the restrictions to a“plague”and stated that they do more harm to the bloc itself while hardly affecting Russia. EU ambassadors on Wednesday approved a 17th package of sanctions against Russia, which targets nearly 200 oil tankers that the West claims are part of Russia’s“shadow fleet.”These are older vessels that operate outside the Western insurance system. The move came just two days before a meeting between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in Istanbul in what were the first direct peace talks between the two sides in three years. “Sanctions are like a plague and I reject the sanctions policy,”Fico told the Slovak STVR broadcaster, maintaining that the restrictions imposed by Brussels have so far only damaged the EU. He believes that Russia managed to quickly adapt to all the punitive measures. Fico also said he would support a national referendum on rejecting EU sanctions on Russia should someone call for one. If any new restrictions risk damaging the Slovak economy, he will veto them at the EU level, he stated. The Slovak leader also said that he discussed a potential ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine with Russian President Vladimir Putin during his visit to Moscow earlier in May. According to Fico, diplomacy is still the best way to resolve the Ukraine conflict, with negotiations between Putin and US President Donald Trump being key to reaching a settlement. On Friday, Moscow and Kiev agreed to a major prisoner swap and decided to continue contacts once each side prepares a detailed ceasefire plan and presents it to the other. Following the talks, several EU nations called for more pressure against Moscow. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot stated that the EU and US must“suffocate”the Russian economy“once and for all.” Slovakia took what Fico calls a“constructive”and pragmatic approach towards Russia upon coming to power in 2023.“Europe needs Russia, and Russia needs Europe,”he said in a video message last week, reflecting on his visit to Moscow.“We must pursue a policy of cooperation, not one of hatred and iron curtains.”",

    "title": "Presidential candidates in EU states call Trump ‘symbol of freedom’",
    "article_text": "A joint election campaign rally by Romanian election frontrunner George Simion and Polish presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki have announced plans for what the former described as a“pro-MAGA”union at a joint rally the two held earlier this week in Poland. Supporters at the event chanted the name of US President Donald Trump. Both EU nations are heading into presidential elections this Sunday. Poland will hold the first round of voting, while Romania will see a runoff between Simion and Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. Speaking at the rally in support of Nawrocki in Zabrze on Tuesday, Simion vowed to reverse what he called an“anti-American change in Europe.”A critic of the EU who has been banned from entering Ukraine, Simion won the first round of the presidential election rerun in Romania on May 4 with more than 40% of the vote. His words prompted the crowd to begin chanting:“Donald Trump! Donald Trump!”The politician joined the chant and called the American leader“not just a person but a symbol of freedom.” George Simion, who is a presidential candidate in Romania, came to support Karol Nawrocki at his rally.Karol Nawrocki is a candidate for President of Poland.Everyone in the background is cheering ,”Donald Trump! Donald Trump!”!!pic.twitter.com/hbXwpUGU3C Nawrocki, a conservative candidate who is supported by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party, is currently polling second behind Rafal Trzaskowski, who is aligned with Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s coalition. Addressing the rally, he vowed to“build a Europe of values, a Europe of homelands, in which we will not allow the EU to centralize and turn Poland and Romania into provinces.”Nawrocki opposes EU and NATO membership for Ukraine, as well as financial aid for refugees, while supporting continued military assistance to Kiev. Speaking to the magazine American Conservative a day after the rally, Simion stated that, together with Nawrocki, they“could become two pro-MAGA presidents committed to reviving our partnership with the United States.”He also vowed to“shift our focus to bilateral negotiations with the Trump administration”if elected. The rally prompted Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk to claim on X that“Russia rejoices”at seeing Nawrocki standing together with“his pro-Russian Romanian counterpart George Simion.” Simion responded by posting an image of Tusk meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin back in 2010 and calling him“Putin’s man in Poland.” Moscow has never commented publicly about any ties with either Simion or Tusk. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova earlier blasted the Romanian presidential election as“scandalous”after RT correspondent Chay Bowes was deported from the country right after arriving in the country to cover the vote.",

    "title": "US running out of patience over European troop reduction – envoy",
    "article_text": "Washington plans to start discussing the details of a partial European troop pullout with other NATO members later this year, the US ambassador to the bloc, Matthew Whitaker, has said. America has sought to do so for over three decades and is running out of patience, he added. NBC News reported in April that the US is considering withdrawing up to 10,000 troops from Eastern Europe. US President Donald Trump later confirmed that he is considering a partial pullout, but did not provide a timetable. Whitaker has now said discussions will take place later this year. ”It will be certainly after the summit, sometime later in the year, we are going to start those conversations... All our allies are ready to do it,” he told Reuters on Friday, referring to the bloc’s upcoming summit in The Hague. “We are not going to have any more patience for foot dragging in this situation... We just need to work through the practical consequences,”Whitaker said, adding that“nothing has been determined”yet.“But as soon as we do, we are going to have these conversations in the structure of NATO.” The cost of replacing the US equipment and personnel following the withdrawal could amount to around $1 trillion over 25 years, Politico reported earlier this week, citing a report by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The sum would include one-off purchase costs ranging from $226 billion to $344 billion, depending on the equipment to be replaced, as well as expenses regarding maintenance, personnel, and support. The list of military hardware that European NATO members would need to acquire after the pullout could include 400 tactical combat aircraft, 20 destroyers, and 24 long-range surface-to-air missiles, the news outlet said. As of early 2025, there were nearly 84,000 US troops stationed in Europe, with the largest concentrations in Germany and Poland, and smaller deployments in Romania, Estonia, and Lithuania, according to US European Command. The US is NATO’s largest financial contributor, and Trump has repeatedly criticized the bloc’s European members for failing to meet defense spending targets and urged them to take more responsibility for their own defense.",

    "title": "US government to sell propaganda HQ – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump is moving to sell the headquarters of state-funded media outlet Voice of America (VOA), Bloomberg has reported. VOA’s building is among several properties designated for“accelerated disposal”under Trump’s initiative to downsize government operations, the news outlet wrote on Thursday. Besides VOA, the Wilbur J. Cohen Federal Building houses offices for the outlet’s sprawling parent entity, the US Agency for Global Media, as well as for the Department of Health and Human Services. In March, the US president ordered sweeping cuts at USAGM, as part of a wider move to cut federal spending and realign foreign aid and other soft-power tools with his administration’s policy. While the move prompted legal pushback, last week a US court lifted an injunction that had stood in the way of the agency being further dismantled. Trump, who has described VOA as“radical propaganda”and an“unnecessary”burden on the US taxpayer, fired nearly 600 of the outlet’s contractors on Thursday. The state-funded outlet was established in the 1940s to counter Nazi propaganda and later shifted its focus to spreading pro-Western messaging in the Soviet bloc. VOA has liaised with and been fed intelligence by the CIA, and is widely regarded as one of Washington’s international propaganda arms. USAGM subsidiary outlets Radio Free Europe, Radio Free Asia, the Office of Cuba Broadcasting are also in the firing line as part of Trump adviser and government efficiency czar Elon Musk’s effort to trim the federal budget, Bloomberg noted. The US General Services Administration, which manages government real estate, briefly listed 443 federal properties for sale all at once in March, before retracting the listing within a day. The sales have since been moving forward with more deliberation, according to Bloomberg. Faced with backlash during the massive federal cuts Musk oversaw, the tech mogul has announced that he would cut back his role in the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to an ABC opinion poll from late April, 57% of respondents disapproved of Musk’s performance in government, while just over a third endorsed his work.",

    "title": "No single power should control the world – Myanmar PM",
    "article_text": "The world should not be controlled by a single power, Myanmar Prime Minister Min Aung Hlaing has said in an exclusive interview with RT. A multipolar system is the best approach to avoid conflict, he believes. In the interview aired on Saturday, the prime minister stressed that developing countries such as Myanmar have especially suffered“under a unipolar system.” “That is why transitioning to a multipolar world works best for us. It is better to share global resources, to act fairly, to distribute things more evenly. Conflicts arise from inequality, so if we want to avoid conflicts, I believe a multipolar system is the best approach,”he said. “The US and Western bloc controlled the world through unipolarity. Then it became bipolar, and from bipolarity it returned to unipolarity. This made the West stronger,”Hlaing said. However,“in this era, Russia, China and India have made tremendous progress militarily, economically and scientifically,”the prime minister noted.“As they have advanced, we have moved towards multipolarity and that is how it should be. No single power should control the world,”he said. If Moscow, Beijing and New Delhi, which are“three equally important global powers,”collaborate and“act in unison, multipolarity will become a global reality. No one will accept this unipolarity anymore,”the Myanmar leader emphasized. In order to succeed in the multipolar world, smaller countries“must try to cooperate”with Russia, China, and India, he said.“Making that attempt is absolutely worthwhile. We need to develop our own economic capabilities, while simultaneously increasing cooperation with each other,”he added. Hlaing was among the high-ranking foreign guests who visited Moscow for the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany on May 9. Earlier this year, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that relations between Moscow and Naypyidaw have been developing steadily and had“good potential.”In 2024 alone, trade turnover between the two nations increased by 40%, he noted. Putin also expressed gratitude to the leadership of Myanmar for facilitating Russia’s cooperation with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).",

    "title": "NATO setting ‘unrealistic’ targets for Germany – Welt",
    "article_text": "NATO is urging Germany to significantly expand its military forces, Die Welt revealed on Saturday, citing sources. Officials in Berlin reportedly believe that the country, which is burdened by high dropout rates, will struggle to meet the proposed targets.As NATO members are poised to convene for the July summit in The Hague, discussions about increasing national defense spending to 5% of GDP – a target the US reportedly insists on – and expanding troop numbers are expected to loom large on the agenda.Germany, for its part, is facing“particular challenges,”including a proposal to increase the Bundeswehr’s personnel to between 240,000 and 260,000 soldiers by 2030, an increase of up to 80,000 troops from current levels of around 183,000, according to Welt. Difficulties with ballooning the military are exacerbated by high dropout rates among new recruits, with up to 30% leaving within the first six months, the paper says. Other factors contributing to attrition include harsh training, distant postings, and limited career prospects, as many potential soldiers view the private sector as a much more attractive option. In addition, some military branches reportedly resist accepting soldiers trained in other divisions.The German paper also warned that if the Bundeswehr attempts to adopt the new target,“the debate about reactivating conscription is likely to flare up,”and the recruitment effort could be quite unpopular.On Wednesday, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius signaled that if there are not enough volunteers Germany may need to revive conscription, which was abolished in 2011. In April, the Interior Ministry also proposed introducing civil defense lessons in schools to prepare students for potential crises and conflicts. This comes as a number of Western officials have claimed that Russia could launch an attack on NATO within several years. Moscow has repeatedly denied having such plans, dismissing the speculation as“nonsense.”",

    "title": "Putin is ‘at the table’ for Ukraine talks – Trump",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin would like to resolve the Ukraine conflict, his US counterpart, Donald Trump, has said. He added that he is certain Washington and Moscow will be able to make a deal and put an end to the hostilities. On Friday, Russian and Ukrainian delegations held a meeting in Istanbul, which marked the first direct talks since 2022. Both sides agreed to exchange lists of conditions for a potential ceasefire, conduct a major prisoner swap, and discuss a follow-up meeting. In a Fox News interview aired the same day, Trump pushed back against the notion that Putin does not want to engage in any kind of talks over Ukraine.“He is at the table, and he wanted this meeting,”the US president said, adding:“I think Putin is tired of this whole thing.” According to Trump, however, his involvement is essential to a breakthrough in the peace process.“I always felt there can’t be a meeting without me because I don’t think a deal’s gonna get through,”he said. Nevertheless, he expressed optimism about the chances of reaching a settlement.“I have a very good relationship with Putin. I think we’ll make a deal. We have to get together, and I think we’ll probably schedule it.” When pressed again on whether he sees Putin as an“obstacle to peace,”Trump shifted the focus to Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky.“I had a real rough session with Zelensky, because I didn’t like what he said. He was not making it easy… He doesn’t have the cards,”he said, explaining that Ukraine is fighting against a“massive army.” Trump was apparently referring to a public spat with the Ukrainian leader during which he accused Zelensky of ingratitude for past US military aid and“gambling with World War III.” The US president went on to criticize the policy of assisting Ukraine adopted by his predecessor, Joe Biden.“Every time… he [Zelensky] came to Washington, he walks out with $100 billion… I think he’s the greatest salesman in the world, far better than me,”Trump said, adding that Congress has grown frustrated with this as well. The Ukrainian leader was initially reluctant to agree to the talks in Istanbul proposed by Russia without any conditions, insisting that they should be preceded by a 30-day ceasefire. Moscow has not ruled out the idea in principle, but said Kiev could use the pause to rebuild its battered military. Despite initial pushback, Zelensky sent a delegation to Istanbul after Trump insisted that“Ukraine should agree to this immediately.”",

    "title": "Lavrov and Rubio discuss Istanbul talks – Moscow",
    "article_text": "The top Russian and US diplomats have shared their assessments of the Istanbul talks in a phone call, the Russian Foreign Ministry has said. Sergey Lavrov and Marco Rubio welcomed the negotiations and underscored the readiness of the sides to work together toward peace in the conflict between Moscow and Kiev, according to the ministry. The conversation took place on Saturday at the initiative of the US, according to the statement. Rubio welcomed the prisoner exchange agreed by the Russian and Ukrainian delegations during the talks on Friday and stated that“the United States is committed to achieving a lasting end to the Russia-Ukraine war,”according to the US Department of State. Lavrov praised the“positive role”America played in bringing Kiev to the negotiating table and agreeing to resume the Istanbul peace process. He also expressed Moscow’s readiness to work with Washington on this. In addition, Lavrov and Rubio discussed other international and regional issues, as well as Russia-US bilateral contacts, the ministry said, without providing further details. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky initially ruled out any talks with Moscow unless Russia agreed to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. The Kremlin has rejected Kiev’s demands, arguing that Ukraine would use the pause to regroup and rearm its military. However, Zelensky agreed to talks after US President Donald Trump expressed his support for Putin’s initiative and urged Kiev to agree to it“immediately.” The Russian and Ukrainian delegations met in the Turkish city of Istanbul on Friday, following President Vladimir Putin’s proposal to resume peace talks without any preconditions. The peace process between the two nations was disrupted in spring 2022 after several rounds of talks in Belarus and Türkiye, when Kiev unilaterally walked away from the negotiations. David Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian delegation at the time, later stated that the decision was made after a visit to Kiev by then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who he said told the Ukrainian government to not sign anything and“just fight.”",

    "title": "What does Russia have to gain from the EU now?",
    "article_text": "When Russian President Vladimir Putin recently remarked that Russia and Western Europe would“sooner or later”restore constructive relations, it was less a statement of policy than a reminder of historical inevitability. For now, there are no signs of readiness on the part of the EU. But history is full of unexpected reversals, and diplomacy has always required patience. Still, when that moment comes, Russia will have to ask a hard question: what, exactly, does it have to gain from Western Europe? At present, the answer appears to be very little. EU leaders behave as though Russia remains the same country they remember from the 1990s – isolated, weakened, and desperate to be heard. That world is gone. Today’s Russia neither needs Western European approval nor fears its condemnation. And yet EU officials continue speaking in tones of paternalism and ultimatums, as if they still believe they represent something decisive on the world stage. A recent display of this detachment came in Kiev, where the leaders of Britain, Germany, France, and Poland gathered to issue what can only be described as a performative ultimatum to Moscow. The content was irrelevant; it was the posture that was telling. One could only wonder: who, exactly, do they believe is listening? Certainly not Russia, and increasingly, not the rest of the world either. Western Europe today poses no independent threat to Russia. It lacks both military capability and economic leverage. Its real danger lies not in strength but in weakness: the possibility that its provocations could drag others into crises it cannot control. Its influence has diminished, and it has largely burned the bridges that once made cooperation costly for Russia. The West’s cold war fantasies are now detached from the material realities of global power. The EU elite’s fundamental miscalculation is assuming that Russia still views the western part of the continent as a model to emulate. But today’s Russia has little reason to aspire to European institutions, politics, or economic design. Indeed, in areas such as digital governance and public administration, Russia is ahead. Western European efforts to“modernize”Russia through consulting and institutional outreach have long since lost relevance. EU stagnation is not just political but also technological. Strict regulations and cautious legislation have stifled innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence and digital transformation. In fields where other European nations could once have partnered with Russia, different global actors have already stepped in. The reality is that Western Europe has little to offer that Russia cannot obtain elsewhere. In education, too, Western Europe’s attraction has faded. Its academic institutions increasingly serve as conduits for intellectual siphoning, rather than genuine exchange. What was once a strength is now perceived as an instrument of cultural dilution. To be clear, Russia is not rejecting diplomacy with other European powers. But such diplomacy must be grounded in mutual benefit – and right now, Western Europe offers little. The real tragedy is that many European leaders were raised in a post-Cold War world that taught them they would never face consequences. That arrogance has calcified into a kind of strategic illiteracy. Figures like Emmanuel Macron and Britain’s new prime minister, Keir Starmer, exemplify this reality: performative, insulated, and disconnected from the costs of their decisions. Still, change is inevitable. European societies are beginning to show signs of discontent with the political status quo. Citizens are demanding more influence over their own futures. Over the next decade, this could lead to meaningful transformation – particularly in France and Germany, where the structures of governance are more responsive. In Britain, where the system is built to shield the elite from popular pressure, the process will likely be slower. Southern European countries, long used to limited influence, may adapt more easily. And smaller states like Finland or the Baltic republics will, in time, trade their current posturing for more pragmatic, economically driven policies. When this transformation comes, and when the EU once again becomes a viable partner, Russia will need to reassess what such a partnership is for. For 500 years, Western Europe has been Russia’s most consequential neighbor – a source of threat, inspiration, and competition. But that era is ending. The region no longer defines the terms of modernity. It no longer sets the example. And it no longer commands fear. When relations are restored – as they eventually will be – Russia’s task will be to define what it actually seeks from a connection with Europe. The days of automatic deference are over. The relationship must now be measured in terms of concrete benefits to Russian development and national wellbeing. In this new era, Russia does not seek revenge or dominance. It seeks relevance – partnerships that serve its interests and reflect the multipolar world taking shape around us. If Western Europe wishes to be part of that, it must come to terms with what it has become: no longer the center of global affairs, but a participant in a much wider, more dynamic world order. The rest of Europe’s pale shadow still lingers in the Russian memory. But memory is not destiny. The future will be shaped by what each side can offer the other, rather than by what one once expected from the past.

    "title": "Istanbul Talks 2.0 are a great chance for Zelensky to accept reality",
    "article_text": "Despite Ukraine’s and the EU’s worst efforts at underhanded sabotage, the Istanbul talks –the first direct Russian-Ukrainian talks in three years– have now taken place. They may be over for now, they may continue soon. They may still turn into a dead end or they may help get somewhere better than war. What is clear already is that they are not meaningless. The question is what that meaning will be once we look back on them from the near future of either peace or continuing war. The leader of the Russian team in Istanbul, Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky, cautiously praised the two-hour talks as satisfying“overall.”A substantial prisoner exchange has been agreed (but not in the“all-for-all”format Ukraine unrealistically called for). Ukraine’s request for a meeting between its superannuated leader Vladimir Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been made – this time apparently in a serious and diplomatic manner – and the Russian side has taken cognizance of it. Both sides have agreed to detail their vision of a potential future ceasefire and then to meet again. This is much better than nothing. It’s also not a miracle breakthrough. But those expecting or even demanding the latter only have themselves to blame. That sort of thing was never in the cards. And that’s normal. For diplomacy, especially to end a war, is a complex activity for patient adults, by definition. It is also historically normal that such negotiations take place while fighting is still ongoing. It is silly and simply dishonest to pretend – as do Ukraine, its obstinate European backers, and sometimes (now depending on the mood on any given day) the US – that negotiations can only happen with a ceasefire in place. Medinsky has pointed out this basic fact in animportant interviewon Russia’s most watched political talk show. Westerners should pay attention. Because he’s right and, perhaps even more importantly, it’s yet another clear signal from Moscow that it will not walk into the simple-minded Western-Ukrainian trap of a ceasefire without at least a very clear path to a full peace. Indeed, Medinsky referenced the Great Northern War of 1700-1721 to illustrate that Russia will fight as long as it takes. And that it’s a very bad idea not to take a comparatively good deal from Moscow when you are offered one, because the next one will be worse. Zelensky has already done this to his own country once or even twice (depending on how you count). During these second-chance Istanbul talks, an unnamed Russian representative warned Ukraine that if it misses this opportunity again, then the next one will involve additional territorial losses, again, as Russian TV reported. But let’s zoom out for a moment: There is a very simple thing about the current talks between Russia and Ukraine that virtually everyone in Western mainstream media and politics apparently cannot process. So let’s clarify the obvious: This Istanbul meeting has taken place because of Moscow’s initiative, not that of the West or Ukraine. It was Putin who, on May 11,suggested, in essence, two things: First to start direct talks without preconditions. And second – this is the part everyone in the West pretends to miss – to do so byre-starting talks where“they were held earlier and where they were interrupted.”That was, of course, a clear reference to the Istanbul negotiations in the spring of 2022. As intelligent observers suspected immediately, these first Istanbul talks ended without results because the West instructed the Kiev regime to keep fighting. This is not a matter of opinion anymore. The evidence is in and unambiguous.Even the head of Ukraine’s 2022 negotiating team, David Arakhamia, has long publicly admitted two things: First, that Russia was offering Kiev a very advantageous deal back then, demanding no more than neutrality and an end to unrealistic NATO ambitions; everything else, to quote Arakhamia, was merely“cosmetic political seasoning.”And second, that it was indeed the West that told Zelensky to bet on more war instead. And to his eternal shame, Zelensky chose to betray his country by obeying the West. That means – like it or not – that Putin’s offer of re-starting the Istanbul talks amounted to a second chance for a Kiev regime that – judging by its atrocious record of sacrificing Ukraine to brutal Western geopolitics – it certainly does not deserve. But ordinary Ukrainians do. Regarding Zelensky, he should have been elated and grateful to get a chance to, if not make up for his horrific decision in 2022 (that’s impossible), at least to finally correct it. But Zelensky has remained Zelensky. His response to the Russian offer was – as so often – stunningly narcissistic, megalomanic, and dishonest. Instead of seizing the chance for his country and himself, Zelensky started a transparent maneuver to put Russia in the wrong so as to impress, above all, US president Donald Trump. Western politicians and mainstream media, meanwhile, spent tankerloads of venom on denouncing Moscow and Putin, accusing them of sabotaging the talks – which, again, Russia actually initiated – in, allegedly, two ways: by Putin not attending in person and by, as they claim, sending only a“low-level”team instead. These Western information war talking points have been so ubiquitous that it feels – once again – as if everyone is copying from the same, daft memo. Take the Bloomberg version, for instance. It can stand for all the others. Bloomberg is right about one thing: The composition of the Russian delegation – while by no means“low-ranking,”actually – was bound to“fall far short”of Kiev’s expectations. But that was the result not of Moscow’s decisions, but of Kiev’s inflated expectations and the way Zelensky tried to realize them. Once Zelensky had, in essence, made a public ultimatum out of his baseless demand that Putin attend in person, it was, obviously, extremely unlikely to happen. Zelensky’s bad-faith move – really a transparent dare designed to start the conversation by publicly humiliating Moscow – was so predictably counterproductive that it seems hard to explain. No one forced the Ukrainian leader to climb out on a slender limb like that, but, as is his wont, he put loud public provocation over the substance of a chance to save lives. Or there may be another explanation, of course: Zelensky may have wanted to sabotage these talks even before they even started and do so in a way that would permit him to scapegoat Russia for their failure:“Look, I was ready, but Putin did not turn up.” The reality is, obviously, that the most efficient way to hold such talks at such a moment is to send teams of experts. Whether they are ministers, deputy ministers, or other high-ranking civil officials is not important. What is important is that they know what they are talking about and come with a modicum of sincere – not unconditional, but sincere – goodwill. Goodwill is clearly there. Otherwise the Russian delegation would not have waited for the Ukrainians to stop their pre-meeting temper tantrum. And there is no doubt that the composition of the Russian team for the Istanbul negotiations displays the necessary expertise and seriousness. In a way, US President Donald Trump fed in some goodwill as well: Western commentariat eyebrows have been arching up because Trump has been rudely frank once again, explaining that nothing was going to happen until he and Putin get together. In Trump’s defense: that’s true, actually. Don’t like it? Congrats: You are up against reality. Good luck. Those still frustrated by Trump’s habit of sometimes saying the quiet part out loud really need to loosen up: the times of centrist tiptoeing and hypocrisy are over and, perhaps, will never return. Fingers crossed. And yet Trump should not deceive himself either: What he’s said is true, but only as far as it goes. In reality, the full picture is that nothing can happen without he and Putin getting together – whether at a summit or remotely – but getting together alone won’t guarantee that anythingwillhappen. Because that will take more than just meeting but actually agreeing. Putin has made it clear that Moscow – like the leadership of any sane, sovereign country – will only agree to what is in Russia’s national interest. And Russia is winning this war against the West and Ukraine. There still is room for negotiations, quid-pro-quos, and compromise. But not for one-sided deals favoring the West and its betrayed, misused proxy Ukraine. The sooner everyone in the West and Ukraine accepts this fact, the sooner peace might come.",

    "title": "US planning to move Palestinians to Libya – NBC",
    "article_text": "The administration of US President Donald Trump is working on a plan to permanently relocate up to 1 million Palestinians from Gaza to Libya, NBC has reported, citing informed sources. The White House has denied the claim. Since taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly said that the US is prepared to take control of Gaza and transform it into a resort on the Mediterranean Sea. The idea has faced strong opposition from other nations in the region, who argue that such plans violate international law, threaten regional stability, and undermine the rights of Palestinians to remain on their ancestral lands. The plan to relocate around a half of Gaza’s population to Libya is under“serious”consideration in the White House, the broadcaster claimed in an article on Friday. According to the sources, in exchange for Libya accepting the Palestinians, the Trump administration could be ready to unfreeze some $30 billion in funds belonging to the North African state that were blocked a decade ago. The NBC report said that Washington had already discussed the idea with the Libyan leadership, although it did not specify which of the country’s rivaling governments it was. Libya remains in turmoil since a NATO-backed uprising ousted its long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. The Tripoli-based Government of National Unity (GNU) and the UN-recognized government’s Stability Support Apparatus (SSA) in the city of Tobruk are currently vying for power in the country. The head of the head of SSA government, Abdulghani al-Kikli, also known as Ghaniwa, was assassinated this past Monday, which led to clashes in Tripoli. The US State Department advises American citizens against traveling to Libya“due to crime, terrorism, unexploded landmines, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.” Israel is being informed about the discussion between the US and Libya, the sources said. No final agreement on moving Palestinians has been reached, according to NBC, which added that details about when or how the plan could be implemented remain“murky.” A Trump administration spokesman has said that the report by NBC was“untrue.”The spokesman stressed that the“situation on the ground [in Libya] is untenable for such a plan. Such a plan was not discussed and makes no sense.”",

    "title": "US considering migrant reality TV show",
    "article_text": "The US Department of Homeland Security is considering being part of a reality TV show in which migrants compete against each other for American citizenship, the agency’s assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, has said. In each episode, contestants would take part in American-themed challenges such as digging for gold in California and assembling a car at a plant in Detroit, according to the pitch, which has been seen by a number of outlets. It would reportedly conclude with a town hall meeting and a final vote to select the winner. The idea for the series, which has the working title ‘The American’, comes from Rob Worsoff, the producer behind reality shows such as ‘The Millionaire Matchmaker’, ‘Duck Dynasty’, and ‘The Biggest Loser’. The Daily Mail, which was one of the first outlets to report on the development on Thursday, claimed that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has been pushing for the series to be made. McLaughlin denied the report in a post on X on Friday, calling it“false”and“an affront to journalism.”Noem is not“even aware”of the reality TV show pitch, she insisted. The DHS receives hundreds of TV show proposals every year and each of them“undergoes a thorough vetting process prior to denial or approval,”the assistant secretary said. The pitch for ‘The American’“has not received approval or denial by staff,”she added. The pitch reportedly says:“contestants will represent a wide demographic of ages, ethnicities, and talents. We will join in the laughter, tears, frustration and joy – hearing their backstories – as we are reminded of how amazing it is to be American, through the eyes of 12 wonderful people, who want nothing more than to have what we have – and what we often take for granted: the freedom, opportunity and honor of what it means to be American.” Worsoff, who immigrated to the US from Canada, told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that none of the losers in the show would be penalized or face deportation.“This is not ‘The Hunger Games’ for immigrants,”he said. In an interview with CNN, Worsoff noted that he first pitched the idea for the series to the DHS during the administration of US President Barack Obama. He added that he recently held three meetings with DHS officials regarding the show.“I feel like we are trending in a good way,”he said.",

    "title": "Moody’s delivers first US credit rating downgrade since 1917",
    "article_text": "Moody’s has stripped the US of its perfect triple-A credit rating, citing increasing concerns over debt affordability. The rating agency had held the country’s sovereign credit rating at the highest possible level since 1917. The move brings the 116-year-old agency into line with its global rivals. Fitch Ratings downgraded the US rating to AA+ from AAA in August 2023, and Standard & Poor’s cut it to AA+ from AAA in August 2011. The reduction to Aa1“reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,”Moody’s said in a statement released on Friday. The agency noted that successive US administrations and Congress have failed to reach an agreement on measures to reverse the pattern of large annual fiscal deficits and rising interest costs. Moody’s stated, however, that the US retains exceptional credit strengths, citing its size, resilience, dynamism, and the role of the dollar as the global reserve currency. Earlier this month, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned about the possibility of a default as soon as August, calling for either raising or suspending the debt ceiling – a statutory limit on how much the federal government can borrow – to avoid running out of money to cover federal expenses. The US reached its ceiling of $36.1 trillion in January. Once the limit is hit, the government is legally barred from borrowing further to meet its obligations. The total federal debt has climbed to $36.2 trillion, according to official figures. The Treasury has avoided default by using so-called“extraordinary measures”– mainly accounting maneuvers such as suspending contributions to federal employee retirement funds – to keep up with its financial commitments. Under former President Joe Biden, the debt ceiling was raised three times. The current president, Donald Trump, has argued that the cap should be eliminated entirely, calling it pointless if it’s routinely lifted. He has argued that the concept of a debt ceiling“doesn’t mean anything, except psychologically.” Commenting on the rating downgrade, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said on Friday that Moody’s“would not have stayed silent as the fiscal disaster of the past four years unfolded”if the agency“had any credibility.”He also claimed that the Trump administration is currently dealing with the“mess”left by the previous administration.",

    "title": "Trump ‘frustrating’ Ukraine’s European backers – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "European NATO members are“frustrated”with US President Donald Trump’s“constant swerving”on Ukraine peace talks, which they believe undermines their ability to pressure Russia, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing sources. Kiev’s backers are uncertain regarding what Trump will do following the inconclusive Turkish-mediated talks between Russia and Ukraine in Istanbul on Friday, according to the news agency. The meeting was the first direct engagement between the belligerents since 2022. Key European NATO members initially believed that Trump supported their plan to impose new sanctions on Russia if it rejected the demand for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire with Ukraine, the article said. Moscow has stated that it is open to a ceasefire“in general,”but has expressed concern that it would only give Ukraine time to regroup and rest its battered forces. However, the West’s unified front apparently started to crumble after Moscow proposed direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul without any preconditions, according to Bloomberg. The overture prompted the US president to insist that Kiev“immediately”agree to restart dialogue, despite Vladimir Zelensky’s reluctance to do so without a ceasefire. One European official expressed hope that the Istanbul meeting would“make it clear to Trump that the Russians aren’t serious about peace talks,”prompting the US to respond decisively. Some European leaders reportedly believe that Trump may still follow through on earlier threats to impose secondary sanctions and banking restrictions on Moscow. Others, however, are said to be skeptical about whether Trump – who has repeatedly said he wants to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to settle the Ukraine conflict – has an appetite for drastic measures. At the Istanbul meeting, discussions included ceasefire options, a prisoner exchange, and plans for a potential follow-up meeting. Vladimir Medinsky, Russia’s top negotiator, said Moscow is“satisfied”with the results of the Istanbul talks and is ready to“resume contacts”with Kiev. Russia has stated that the Ukraine conflict could be settled if Kiev commits to permanent neutrality, demilitarization, denazification, and recognizes the“territorial reality on the ground.”Kiev, however, has ruled out any territorial concessions to Moscow.",

    "article_text": "France has been trying to subvert democracy in Romania, Euroskeptic presidential candidate George Simion has said ahead of Sunday’s runoff vote. Simion, a critic of the EU who has been banned from entering Ukraine, won the first round of the presidential election rerun on May 4 with more than 40% of the vote. The rerun was held after Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the results of a vote held in November, in which independent right-wing candidate Calin Georgescu came first with 23%. The authorities cited“irregularities”in his campaign, as well as intelligence reports alleging Russian interference in the election – claims Moscow has strongly denied. Simion, the leader of the right-wing Alliance for the Union of Romanians, has backed Georgescu and said he could appoint him prime minister if elected. In an interview published on Friday, entrepreneur Mario Nawfal asked Simion if he had received“indirect or direct threats”from abroad. Simion alleged that Paris was working behind the scenes to pressure Romania’s top court, media regulator, and businesses. “They are putting a lot of money and pressure – through their ambassador here, and through foreign institutions – in order to rob the Romanian people of their vote,”he said. Simion drew a parallel with the recent decision by a French court to bar veteran conservative politician Marine Le Pen from the 2027 presidential election due to an embezzlement conviction. “I want to address the free French people against this authoritarian [President] Emmanuel Macron, who doesn’t have the support of the French people, who banned Marine Le Pen, who is supporting the idea of imposing a dictatorship [in Romania] and canceling the will of the people,”Simion said. He denounced the invalidation of the 2024 election results in Romania as a“coup d’état,”and claimed there were similar“evil plans”being made against him. “The Romanian people were humiliated with the annulment of the election,”Simion said, vowing to resist foreign pressure.“We don’t have masters. The age of empires is over. We are free, sovereign nations. And these imperialistic reflexes Emmanuel Macron and others have will only backfire.” The French ambassador to Bucharest, Nicolas Warnery, claimed that Romania experienced a“hybrid attack”in 2024.“We understand your decision to completely restart the presidential election from scratch,”he told Digi24 earlier this month.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he was concerned that billions of dollars were being wasted on aid to Ukraine. In an interview aired on Friday, Fox News host Bret Baier asked Trump whether he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin is an“obstacle to peace”between Moscow and Kiev. Trump instead directed criticism at Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky. “I had a real rough session with Zelensky because I didn’t like what he said. He was not making it easy. And I always said he doesn’t have the cards,”the US president said. He went on to slam the aid sent to Kiev by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.“The money is the money. What bothered me–I hated to see the way it was, you know – excuse me – pissed away. I hated to see the cheques for $60 billion,”Trump said.“I think Zelensky is the greatest salesman in the world, far better than me. He comes to Washington – he walks out with a hundred million every time.” “Congress is very upset about it. You know, they’re saying, where is all this money going?”Trump added. He went on to say, however, that Zelensky’s ability to lobby for American aid has been“shrinking”over time. The US has provided around $128 billion to Ukraine since 2022, including $66.5 billion in military assistance. Although Trump has criticized both Zelensky and Putin in the past, he has mostly blamed Ukraine and the Biden administration for the ongoing conflict with Russia. During a heated exchange in the Oval Office in February, Trump accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for US support and claimed the Ukrainian leader was“gambling with World War III.” He has since softened his rhetoric toward Ukraine and has threatened to impose further sanctions on Moscow if no peace deal is reached. Russia and Ukraine held their first direct talks in three years in Istanbul on Friday. The head of Russia’s negotiating team, Vladimir Medinsky, said the two sides had agreed upon a major prisoner swap involving 1,000 POWs from each side, as well as continuing contacts once each side has prepared a detailed ceasefire proposal.",

In an interview aired on Friday, Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked Trump whether he would introduce new sanctions on Moscow.“Honestly, I will if we’re not going to make a deal,”the president said.“Nobody uses leverage better than me.” Trump added that the US would assess the outcome of Friday’s Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul.“We’ll see what happens. It will be crushing for Russia because they’re having a hard time with the economy,”he claimed. He also argued that his plan to boost domestic oil production would lower global prices, undermining Russia’s energy exports.

    "title": "Apps you’ll want to take on vacation: A digital packing list",
    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Experiences Experiences Your bags may be ready to go, but do you really have everything you need? Here are some apps that can make your travels smoother, safer and more fun. (Illustration: Weston Wei/The New York Times) So you can whip together a weekend bag or fit a fortnight’s worth of outfits into a rolling suitcase, but does your status as “packing guru” extend to your phone or tablet? Think of your device as a second carry-on, with its own packing list of apps that are essential for entertainment, getting around, safety and more. “Everyone talks about making the super app, the one place for everything you need,” said Gilbert Ott, partnerships director at Point.me,a website that helps travellers manage loyalty points, “but no one has done it yet.” Until that super travel app exists, here are some suggested apps to download before you go. Public Wi-Fi networks like those in cafes and hotels may not be secure, so to keep criminals from intercepting passwords, credit card numbers and emails, “it’s better to encrypt your internet activity,” said Ott. One method to keep data secure is to download and use virtual private networks likeNordVPNorExpressVPN, which encrypt your web doings. It may be tempting to store copies of important documents like passports, health insurance cards and prescriptions on your phone as photos, but it’s more secure to use apps that encrypt that information, like1Password(starting at US$35.88 per year) andMicrosoft OneDrive Personal Vault(included with a US$99.99-per-year Microsoft 365 subscription or, for nonsubscribers, three files free storage). For detailed information on public transportation that can go beyond Google Maps,Moovit(free with ads or Moovit+ with additional features and no ads for US$17.99 per year) andCitymapper(free with ads or US$9.99 per year) can help with routes, fares and trip length around the world. In cities like New York and London, make sure you’ve loaded a credit or debit card in yourdigital walletandset it up for transitto avoid lines by using touchless payment at turnstiles. In some countries, hailing a cab on the street may be difficult or unsafe. So where Uber and Lyft aren’t available, download local trusted ride-hailing apps that offer set fares and location tracking. In Vietnam, Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries, for example,Graboffers rides in cars, taxis and on the backs of motorcycles. In India,Olais a popular choice. For hours spent in planes, trains and hotel rooms, load your device with a mix of diversions and destination information.Taylor Beal, a travel blogger from Philadelphia, who leads highschool groups on trips to Europe, recommends borrowing electronic library books usingLibbyandHoopla. The apps are free but require a local library card from one of the more than 90,000 participating public libraries and schools. Keeping track of who paid for what among a group of friends can be a fun-killing chore. Jamie Larounis, a travel industry analyst forUpgraded Points, recommendsSplitwise Pro(US$39.99 per year, or a limited free version), which tracks and divides up expenses for taxis, meals and more. Other apps likeTricount(free) andSettle Up(free, or US$19.99 per year for the premium version) offer similar services. For tracking flights and making plans either solo or with companions, TripIt (free version orTripItPro US$49 per year) and Wanderlog (free version orWanderlog Pro for US$39.99 per year) can tame even complicated itineraries. You may already haveGoogle Translateon your device, but that app also has some lesser-known handy features. Point your camera at a foreign menu, train station sign or receipt, for example, and Google can translate it — even with non-Roman characters. The Conversation button in the app lets you pass your phone back and forth when you’re trying to get directions, order food, ask for help and more. You can even create a custom phrase book in the app. Bloomberg Connectshas teamed up with more than 800 museums and other cultural spaces, like theNew York Botanical Garden, around the world to offer free information on their exhibits, complementing local organisations like theMusee Carnavalet, a history museum in Paris, which often have institution-specific apps. Of course, there’s also always the good, old-fashioned way to travel — wandering around and letting serendipity take the lead. Is there an app for that, too? By Julie Weed © The New York Times.

    "title": "Bomb blast at fertility clinic in California kills one",
    "article_text": "World World The FBI says the bombing was a terror attack. The American Reproductive Centers clinic after an explosion in Palm Springs, California, May 17, 2025. (Photo: Andy Abeyta/USA Today Network via Reuters) LOS ANGELES: A bomb exploded on Saturday (May 17) outside a California fertility clinic, killing one person in what the FBI labelled a terror attack. The blast ripped through downtown Palm Springs, badly damaging the clinic and blowing out the windows and doors of other nearby buildings. \"Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,\" Akil Davis, the head of the FBI's Los Angeles field office told reporters near the site of the fatal explosion. \"This is probably one of the largest bombing investigations that we've had in southern California,\" he added. He confirmed that one person near the clinic at the time of blast had been killed and that four others were wounded. Work was ongoing to identify the deceased, he added. In response to a reporter's question on whether the clinic in Palm Springs was deliberately targeted, Davis answered: \"We believe so, yes.\" The city's mayor, Ron deHarte had earlier told AFP that investigators confirmed a bomb exploded in or near a vehicle outside the clinic. Eyewitnesses told local media they had seen human remains near the American Reproductive Centers clinic, with aerial footage of the scene showing the building's roof had collapsed. The charred remnants of a vehicle lay in a parking lot, some distance from the apparent epicenter of the explosion. Debris was blown straight through the building and scattered across the road, while the roofs of a number of nearby buildings had been damaged, indicating the intense force of the blast. The local ABC affiliate, which cited an unnamed law enforcement source, reported five people were injured in the explosion and the person who died was a suspect in the blast. A statement posted on social media by the clinic said no staff had been hurt, and that its lab, \"including all eggs, embryos, and reproductive materials, remains fully secure and undamaged.\" It said that \"a vehicle exploded in the parking lot near our building\". Reproductive care, including abortion and fertility services, remain controversial in the United States, where some conservatives believe the procedures should be outlawed for religious reasons. Violence against clinics providing such services is rare, but not unheard of. President Donald Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents were working to determine exactly what had happened. \"But let me be clear: the Trump administration understands that women and mothers are the heartbeat of America. Violence against a fertility clinic is unforgivable,\" she said in a statement on social media. People living near the clinic reported feeling the shaking from the blast throughout the city. Matt Spencer, who lives in a nearby apartment complex, told the Palm Springs Post he ran outside as soon as he heard the blast, and was confronted with the sight of the burnt out car and what appeared to be a body in the middle of the road. \"In front of the building [the car] was blown clear across four lanes into the parking lot of (Desert Regional Medical Center),\" he told the paper. \"I could see the back of the car still on fire and the rims, that was the only thing that distinguished it as a car.\" California Governor Gavin Newsom had been briefed on the explosion, his office said. US Attorney Bill Essayli said his office was aware of the blast. \"FBI is on scene and will be investigating whether this was an intentional act,\" he said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

    "title": "Commentary: The roots of dementia could start in childhood",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary Strategies aimed at reducing dementia risk usually target those around 40 to 60 years of age. We should start earlier and make prevention a lifelong goal, say these researchers. LONDON: More than 60 million people are estimated to be living with dementia, resulting in over 1.5 million deaths a year and an annual cost to the global healthcare economy of around US$1.3 trillion. Despite decades of scientific research and billions of pounds of investment, dementia still has no cure. But what of the old saying that prevention is better than cure? Is preventing dementia possible? And if so, at what age should we be taking steps to do so? Despite what many believe, dementia is not simply an unavoidable consequence of ageing or genetics. It is estimated that up to 45 per cent of dementia cases could potentially be prevented by reducing exposure to 14 modifiable risk factors common throughout the world. Many of these risk factors – which include things like obesity, lack of exercise, and smoking – are traditionally studied from middle age (around 40 to 60 years old) onwards. As a result, several of the world’s leading health bodies and dementia charities now recommend that strategies aimed at reducing dementia risk should ideally be targeted at this age to reap the greatest benefits. We argue, however, that targeting even younger ages is likely to provide greater benefits still. But how young are we talking? And why would exposure to risk factors many decades before the symptoms of dementia traditionally appear be important? To explain, let us work backwards from middle age, starting with the three decades covering adolescence and young adulthood (from 10 to 40 years old). Many lifestyle-related dementia risk factors emerge during the teenage years, then persist into adulthood. For example, 80 per cent of adolescents living with obesity will remain this way when they are adults. The same applies to high blood pressure and lack of exercise. Similarly, virtually all adults who smoke or drink will have started these unhealthy habits in or around adolescence. This poses two potential issues when considering middle age as the best starting point for dementia-prevention strategies. First, altering health behaviour that has already been established is notoriously difficult. And second, most high-risk individuals targeted in middle age will almost certainly have been exposed to the damaging effects of these risk factors for many decades already. As such, the most effective actions are likely to be those aimed at preventing unhealthy behaviour in the first place, rather than attempting to change long-established habits decades down the line. But what about even earlier in people’s lives? Could the roots of dementia stretch as far back as childhood or infancy? Increasing evidence suggests yes, and that risk factor exposures in the first decade of life (or even while in the womb) may have lifelong implications for dementia risk. To understand why this may be, it is important to remember that our brain goes through three major periods during our lives – development in early life, a period of relative stability in adult life, and decline (in some functions) in old age. Most dementia research understandably focuses on changes associated with that decline in later life. But there is increasing evidence that many of the differences in brain structure and function associated with dementia in older adults may have at least partly existed since childhood. For example, in long-term studies where people have had their cognitive ability tracked across their whole lives, one of the most important factors explaining someone’s cognitive ability at age 70 is their cognitive ability when they were 11.That is, older adults with poorer cognitive skills have often had these lower skills since childhood, rather than the differences being solely due to a faster decline in older age. Similar patterns are also seen when looking for evidence of dementia-related damage on brain scans, with some changes appearing to be more closely related to risk factor exposures in early life than current unhealthy lifestyles. Taken together, perhaps the time has come for dementia prevention to be thought of as a lifelong goal, rather than simply a focus for old age. But how do we achieve this in practical terms? Complex problems require complex solutions, and there is no quick fix to address this challenge. Many factors contribute to increasing or decreasing an individual’s dementia risk – there is no “one size fits all” approach. But one thing generally agreed upon is that mass medication of young people is not the answer. Instead, we – along with 33 other leading international researchers in the field of dementia – recently published a set of recommendations for actions that can be taken at the individual, community and national levels to improve brain health from an early age. Our consensus statement and recommendations deliver two clear messages. First, meaningful reductions in dementia risk for as many people as possible will only be achievable through a coordinated approach that brings together healthier environments, better education and smarter public policy. Second – and perhaps most importantly – while it is never too late to take steps to reduce your risk of dementia, it is also never too early to start.

    "title": "Germany, Italy say Europe's leaders 'far from' talks on troop deployment in Ukraine",
    "article_text": "World World Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, France's President Emmanuel Macron and Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer speak during a Ukraine security meeting at the 6th European Political Community summit at Skanderbeg Square in Tirana, Albania, on May 16, 2025 (Photo: Reuters / Leon Neal) ROME/BERLIN: Europe is a long way from talking about deploying troops in Ukraine as all its efforts are currently focused on securing anunconditional ceasefire from Russia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Saturday (May 17). \"The next step must be that the format for peace talks is made clear, as well as which security guarantees could possibly, one day, be necessary for Ukraine,\" Merz said, describing these matters as currently unforeseeable. \"There is no reason to talk about (troops) at the moment, we are far from that. We want the weapons to stop, the killing to end ... these are the questions we are dedicated to now, and no others,\" he added. The leaders of France, Germany, Britain and Poland, together with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met on the sidelines of a summit in Albania on Friday to discuss the situation. They also called US President Donald Trump, who said on Saturday he would speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. Meloni did not take part in the meeting - an absence that Italian media has described as a deliberate snub, suggesting that French President Emmanuel Macron had not wanted her involved. Meloni told reporters on Saturday that Italy was open to joining any international format aimed at ending the war, but warned against divisions within the West. \"Western unity has been our greatest strength since the beginning of Russia's invasion,\" she said. \"At a delicate time like this, it is important to set aside any personal (differences) that could undermine that unity.\" The European Union is working on a new package of sanctions to increase pressure on Moscow over the war, after the first face-to-face talks between Russia and Ukraine in three years on Thursday failed to yield a ceasefire, though Russia agreed to continue contacts. \"Yesterday's talks in Istanbul ended below our expectations despite the extremely constructive positioning of Ukraine's negotiators,\" Merz said. Merz's position on peacekeeping troops echoes that of his predecessor Olaf Scholz, who also prioritised peace deal talks over discussion of boots on the ground. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously expressed willingness to send peacekeeping troops, but only backed by a US security commitment for European countries. Russia has repeatedly rejected the idea of soldiers from countries in the NATO military alliance being stationed in Ukraine.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport LONDON :Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola was magnanimous in defeat after Saturday's FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace meant City's horrible season ended without a major trophy for only the second time of his otherwise glittering reign. But Guardiola's irritation at his side's inability to convert their remarkable 78 per cent possession against a spirited Palace rearguard was not far from the surface, even as he was effusive in his praise for their opponents. His frustration was writ large in the closing stages, gesticulating furiously as attacks fizzled out before exchanging words with Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson after the final whistle condemned City to a second straight FA Cup final loss. Guardiola bristled slightly when asked if Henderson ought to have seen red in the first half for handling the ball outside his area and denying Erling Haaland a goalscoring opportunity, which VAR checked and ultimately cleared.

    "title": "Jeremy Strong Matched His $156,000 Watch to His Bucket Hat at Cannes",
    "article_text": "Jeremy Strong’s style is built on two elements:bucket hatsandoutrageous Richard Mille watches. So it only makes sensethat the (in)famous method actorwould find a way to synchronize the two. That’s exactly what Strong did on the red carpet at Cannes this week. Jeremymade aStrong(sorry) showing at the film festival, where he was decked out in fullburgundy corduroy, including a $156,000Richard MilleRM 16-02 Automatic Extraflat in the same shade. Unlike the brand’s more typical tonneau-cased watches, this one features a rectangular profile with—you guessed it—extra flatproportions and a wrist-hugging, slightly curved shape. A three-part case with a separate bezel, caseband, and caseback, it was designed in tandem with the watch’s movement to maintain a distinctive harmony between each component. Boasting 30m of water resistance, it’s assembled using Grade 5 titanium spline screws and stainless steel washers. Much like a bucket hat, Richard Milles wares are an acquired taste—however, there’s no doubt that this relatively young brand is at the cutting edge of horological design, consistently releasing high-tech pieces and putting them on the likes oftennis players, race car drivers, dancers, skiers, actors, and more. Strong, for his part, has been spotted in the brand’s Ferrari collab, the RM UP-01, which was briefly the thinnest mechanical watch in the world. (Bulgari, not to be outdone,out-thinnedtheRM UP-01a few years later and has since lost the record, too.) Of course, his predilection for RM makes plenty of sense if you consider his most famous role, that of billionaireKendall Royon the wildly popularSuccession. Richard Mille watches areoften referred to as the “billionaire’s handshake,” and Strongwore the brand’s RM 67-01 in the show’s final season. Like all Richard Mille wares, Strong’s new RM 16-02 Automatic Extraflat is powered by a wildly over-engineered movement, the automatic, skeletonized CRMA9. Created in-house by Richard Mille specifically for this model and mounted to the watch case via rubber bumpers and titanium screws, it’s based upon a microblasted grey electroplasma-treated titanium baseplate with a black PVD-treated motionwork bridge and Grade 5 titanium bridges on the back. Like other RM calibers, it also features a free-sprung balance with variable inertia, which makes for better chronometric accuracy and shock resistance. (It’s also fun to say—try it: “free-sprung balance with variable inertia.”) Despite its futuristic design, the RM 16-02 is relatively reserved compared to numerous other,more colorful RM models. (It’s also available in a cool cream-like Terracotta colorway with a matching rubber strap, which is slightly more subtle than Strong’s burgundy version.) Looking at it from the side—and considering its rubber band—you might even mistake it for a significantly more pedestrian sports watch. Of course, that’s very muchnotwhat it is. To snag one, you’ll have to lay out about $134,000, so it’s best to start saving those bonus checksnow. Alternatively, you could always trade in your bucket hat collection. Greg Tarzan DavisofTop Gun: MaverickandMission: Impossible—Dead Reckoning Part One, is a proven action hero. Now he’s proving his horological cred as well. He wore the Chopard L.U.C XP Urushi Spirit of Shí Chen, a beautiful 40mm dress watch that measures just 8.28mm thick, at Cannes Film Festival. On the dial, golden signs of the Zodiac rendered in relief slowly rotate on an Urushi lacquer disc. Every two hours, a new sign appears, making for a beautiful rendering of the time that feels as much like a wearable piece of art as it does a more conventional timepiece. (Hat tip to Nick Gould for the spot.) Everyone’s favorite deadpanWhite Lotusstarhosted SNL in one of the year’s best new watches, theJaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Tribute Monoface Small Seconds. Released atWatches and Wonderslast month, it features a pink gold case and a matching Milanese bracelet—the first time this particular configuration has appeared in the JLC catalog. Being a Monoface model, it bears a blank caseback which can be engraved with an insignia, personal motto, or even a miniature painting.Goggins’wearing of this gorgeous Reverso comes hot on the heels of the brand’s total dominance at theMet Gala, where it seemed like even the wait staff were rocking pieces from La Grand Maison. Cartier has a good thing going for it inTimothée Chalamet, who’sfrequently spotted courtside wearing themaison’sbest offerings. Case in point: The actor showed up at game four of the Knicks-Celtics series in one of the newTank à Guichetsthat debuted back atWatches and Wondersin April. Available in several different metals and two configurations, Chalamet’s is the yellow gold variation that features the collection’s signature windows (“guichets”). The upper window displays jump hours, while the lower shows dragging minutes—the rest of the dial is solid metal, which gives the aptly named Tank an even more armored appearance. With a design dating back to 1928, it’s among the most compelling of the brand’s watches…and the most exclusive.",

    "title": "Nike Hyperboot Review: A Foot-Massaging Shoe That Actually Works",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Can you remember when you first saw the Nike Hyperboot? In the lead up to the 2024 Paris Olympics, LeBron James took to his Instagram, showing off some previously unseen, black-and-whiteNike shoesthat weren’t wholly dissimilar to theAir Mags fromBack to the Future,blinking lights and all. Except Marty McFly’s power-laced kicks didn’t sound like a helicopter preparing to take off when activated. And were these boots…expanding? “Just got back home from training and slipped my [feet] right into these babies,”LeBron’s caption read. “I don’t play about my recovery process.” The wellness nerd in me was intrigued. What exactly was Nike cooking up here? A month later, my question was answered. LeBron’s mysterious footwear wasn’t so much a shoe but rather a high-tech wearable created in partnership with Hyperice—makers of some of our favorite recovery tools, like theNormatec leg compression bootsand theVenom 2 back wrap—and officially dubbed as the Nike Hyperboot. Now, what exactly do these boots do, and why in the hell do they cost almost a grand? We laced up and found out. Nike × Hyperice Hyperice Specs Sizesavailable: Small (men's 6-8), Medium (men's 8-10), Large (men's 10-12), Extra-Large (men's 12-14), Extra-Extra-Large (men's 14-16)Heatlevels: Level 1 (111° Fahrenheit), Level 2 (118° Fahrenheit), Level 3 (125° Fahrenheit)Compressionlevels: Level 1(50 mmHg), Level 2 (130 mmHg), Level 3 (210 mmHg)Battery life: 1-1.5 hoursWeight: 3.7 pounds Incorporating Hyperice’s air-compression and HyperHeat technology, the boots not only sequentially massage your feet and ankles, but target both muscle and tissue with various levels of heat. And while LeBron was touting the boots for post-workout recovery in his IG story, they’re just as much intended to be incorporated into your warmup routine. “While we’ve long known that recovery is an important part of any athlete’s journey, we’re hearing from athletes that the concept of ‘pre-recovery’ is equally as important,” explained Tobie Hatfield, Nike’s senior director of athlete innovation (and younger bro ofTinker), when explaining the development of the Hyperboots last month. While nowhere close to a pro by any means, I have spent most of my life playing sports—years of AAU basketball growing up; tennis three or four times a week still to this day—and working out in the gym. About three years ago, all that wear and tear caught up to me and I tore my ACL. It was an illuminating moment, a dawning realization that I was not invincible. That I wasaging. That while my body wasn’t necessarily breaking down (I was only in my early 30s!), perhaps it could use some assistance in ensuring I could keep running and jumping and lifting and playing the way I was accustomed to. I started to look atrecoverywith the same attention to detail that I had training for so long. So when the opportunity to personally test out the Hyperboots presented itself, I jumped at the bit. The first time I slipped my feet into the Hyperboots was Saturday, April 19. I remember specifically because I had just moved back to New York City. The boots arrived at my new apartment shortly thereafter, but quickly became swallowed up amongst the chaos of all the other boxes of books and pillows and lamps I had yet to unpack. That Saturday, though, I decided to take a break from setting up my new space and spend the day with friends. With no real plan, we started the day off with a bike ride down the West Side Highway to the West Village. That led to hours of unplanned moseying, from neighborhood to neighborhood, simply allowing the day to unfurl in a way that NYC is so singularly capable of. We powered up onburekasthat we walked off in order to make room for coffees and pastries that we walked off en route to a nondescript spice shop one of our friends had been raving about. It was warm and sunny. It was a perfect day. And by the time I got home, my dogs were absolutely screaming. According to my iPhone, I had taken nearly 20,000 steps—just about 10 miles for the day. Maybe my feet simply hadn’t acclimated back to the sort of mileage that one can unexpectedly rack up on a random 80-degree Saturday in the city. But about 15 minutes after massaging my feet on my couch with my hands, wondering if the first time I was actually going to fill my new tub was to soak my feet, I remembered the high-tech boots sitting amongst the piled-up boxes, tailor-made for this exact scenario. When you first slip your feet into the Hyperboots and power them on, they automatically inflate to fit to your feet—not dissimilar to Marty’s aforementioned power laces. And while there are three different settings of compression offered, I knew well enough that my feet desired the highest level available. Following that same logic, I cranked the heat to its highest setting of 125 degrees. Whereas the compression level felt just right, the heat quickly became way too much for me. Feeling as if my leg hairs were about to be singed off, I quickly reversed course and switched the boots to their lowest temperature setting of 111 degrees and kicked up my feet on the couch. It was…glorious? For 20 minutes I sat there, just letting the Hyperboots sooth my tired feet, totally relaxed. And when they finished their automatic programming, I quickly reached down to hit start for another 20 minutes. Two days later, I was out on the tennis court for a hitting session with a friend. An hour and a half of solid hitting where he had me running side to side. Since my ACL surgery, I’ve been quite diligent when it comes to recovery for my knees. Less so for my feet and ankles, which I realize is short-sighted, especially since one of the lingering things I have dealt with post-injury is a mild but persistent numbness around the pinky toe area of my left foot that alleviates with certain stretches. It’s second nature now for me to grab myFreeze Sleevesto ice my knees after getting home from the courts, but this time I made sure to slip on my Hyperboots, as well. Twenty minutes later, my feet were feeling far less sore. And the usual numbness in my foot? Less noticeable. Over the last three weeks, I’ve made it a point to incorporate the Hyperboots into my recovery routine: post tennis, or leg day at the gym, or just when I feel like my feet could use some general TLC. (Disclaimer: At least 60 percent of this article was written with the Hyperboots on foot.) But I’ve also started to use them as part of my warmup. Perhaps the biggest downside to Hyperice’s Normatec leg compression boots is that you can’t move in them. For however long you use them for, you’re just stuck on your couch or bed. While the Hyperboot is focusing on a much smaller surface body area, you can actually walk around and move in them, making them super convenient to use while getting a stretch in before any sort of physical activity (or just when you’re doing laundry). At $899, the Hyperboot carries a hefty price tag that might automatically rule it out for folks. But if you’re someone who is serious about your training and recovery, Nike and Hyperice have created a product that not only works, but hones in on an area of wellness that is ripe for growth—hyper-localized wearables that allow people to truly customize their recovery to their most specific needs without leaving you immobile. If you don't have the dough to cough up for this, don't feel like you need to take out a second mortgage on your home, but if peak physical performance is your goal (and you randomly have a grand to spare), your dogs will thank you.

    "title": "Timothee Chalamet Is Dressing For This Knicks Playoff Run Like It’s His Latest Wild-Style Press Tour",
    "article_text": "Before theNew York Knicksface off againagainst the Boston Celticstonight, the surest bet you could place in advance would be that Timothée Chalamet will be there: sitting courtside, hyping up his beloved team, and wearing some sort of charmingly slovenly ensemble. Timothée Chalamet and Spike Lee, devoted Knicks fans, wore their spirit on their sleeves while celebrating the team's win on Monday. The actor and native Manhattanite, whose childhood apartment in Hell’s Kitchen was approximately a 15-minute walk from Madison Square Garden, has gone out of his way to attend the team’s playoff games this season, carving out time in his busy Hollywood schedule to jet between arenas. This love is serious: Hewent to Detroitto cheer on the Knicks. Heskipped the Met Galatowatch the game on an iPad. Hell, he’s even got his“born-and-raised LA baddie”girlfriend,Kylie Jenner, cheering on his home team! And for as long as Timmy’s been famous enough to sit (and be photographed) amongst the VIPs in the Garden’s Celebrity Row, he’s steadily built up his blue-and-orange wardrobe. Though the actor’s beenbing-bongingsince long before he was rubbing elbows with fellow Knicks fanatics like Ben Stiller and Spike Lee, he only recently started really dressing like a high-profile superfan. Luckily for us, the internet has photo documentation of every Knicks game Chalamet has attended in the last seven-ish years. Let’s review, shall we? ¡Nueva York! The moment Timmy postedthose filthy Timbson the ’gram, we knew what was going down. While Timmy’s girlfriend,Kylie Jenner, and her sister, Kendall, both opted for the standard courtside-baddie uniform (tank top, leather pants, strappy sandals), Chalamet followed a failsafe mantra of the diehead New York sports fan:Clear eyes, cooked Timbs, can’t lose.That, and he managed to dig up a pretty sickvintage Knicks teefrom the ’95 playoffs. 🎶Ricksout for the Knicks, Ricks out for the Knicks!🎶 (The vintage Starter jacket is cool, too.) Per my more sports-mindedGQcolleagues, these performance-style hoodiesseem to be a bit divisive. But given that Chalamet went all the way to chilly Detroit to see the Knicks’ round-one matchup against the Pistons, it made sense that he’d bundle up a bit. This is a classic Timmy Tim post-swag mash-up of niche streetwear and wonky luxury wares: a Juun.J hoodie, camo-print jeans,Dior loafers, and a Knicks snapback. And lest we forget,that mustache. Who else is pairing a Raf Simons fall 1997 jacket with some track pants andUggs? Only Timmy Tim, that’s who! When Chalamet was in the depths of dressing for his bonkersA Complete Unknownpress tour—which also happened to coincide with this Knicks-Grizzlies game at MSG—he leaned heavily into 2000s nostalgia. This outfit has several aughts-era relics at play including anAlexander McQueen skull scarf(a grail amongst Kitson-patronizing socialites of yore), heavily whiskeredTrue Religion jeans, and a punchy Knicks leather bomber jacket. A Yankees hat at a Knicks game: What wouldMayor Eric Adamshave to say about this? A self-referential moment from Timmy here: the bookshelf-printed sweater is from the Japanese label Sacai’s fall 2023 collection, which pulled imagery from Christopher Nolan’s 2014 filmInterstellar, in which Chalamet appeared as the teenage son of Matthew McConaughey’s Cooper. (To reference another Nolan movie,Inception, there’s diegetic levels to this!) Also featuring what appears to be a fresh-from-the-box pair of Nike Field General sneakers. A kooky Burberry hoodie, yes, but also an Ivy Park face mask! Does theBeyhiveknow about this? Aside from the Isabel Marant sneakers, the real star of this outfit—aScarfaceparody tee featuring Stewie fromFamily Guy—washiding beneathTimmy’s Prada puffer. Fun fact: Timothée Chalamet’s mom, Nicole Flender, danced at Lincoln Center with the New York City Ballet as a child and later appeared on Broadway inA Chorus Line—hence, perhaps, this hat. Or, asBritishVogueput it at the time, the cap proved that the then-rising star was also “the pin-up for every aspiring actress” and “a heartbreaker for the modern era.” This game took place a little over a week after Chalamet’s first Oscars ceremony, when he was nominated for his breakthrough performance in Luca Guadagnino’sCall Me By Your Name. He was well on his way to becoming a big star at this point, which you can tell because of one extremely Hollywood accessory: a trucker hat from Brentwood Country Mart, LA’s finest purveyor of upmarket goods. Way back in 2017, not long afterCall Me By Your Namehit select theaters, Chalamet watched the Knicks courtside with two former classmates, Ansel Elgort and Violetta Komyshan, from Manhattan’s Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, a.k.a. the school fromFame. At the time, Timmy had most recently beena student at NYU, and on this night, in a leather jacket, skinny jeans, and Dr. Martens, he really looked the part. More From GQ Connect ©2025Condé Nast.

    "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Is Astonishing in Postpartum Drama ‘Die, My Love’",
    "article_text": "The new filmDie, My Loveopens with snapshots of a flourishing relationship: a couple inspects their new home, which the man, Jackson (Robert Pattinson), has inherited from his late uncle. It’s in rural Montana, a far cry from New York City, where Jackson and Grace (Jennifer Lawrence) lived previously. They note the dirty floors, the rats scurrying upstairs. Though it’s a big change, they’re excited enough to christen the house in the way only two young and hungry lovers can. Writer-directorLynne Ramsayhas fun juxtaposing the banal and the carnal, and imbues both with a crackle of danger. The sound of those rats suggest that something is amiss under the surface—and asDie, My Loveunfolds, it becomes startlingly clear that not all is well with Grace. The trouble begins shortly after the birth of her first child, a bright and bouncy baby boy whom Grace loves dearly. She’s experiencing the onset of postpartum depression, a condition that gradually worsens into near psychosis. Her relationship with Jackson, once so fun and loose and bohemian, curdles badly. She acts out, she maybe hallucinates, she wanders around outside at night, searching for something. Ramsay is a keen purveyor of psychic distress, and here creates a fluid, dreamlike (or nightmarish) film grammar to express the cataclysm of Grace’s mind. She captures arresting images, many set against the backdrop of a dusky Montana wilderness, the sky’s ambient light casting Grace and her surroundings in hues of murky blue and heather gray. The film, which premiered here at Cannes on May 17, is a riot of sensory wonder, its lush visuals clashing with a droning soundscape of buzzing houseflies and dog barks. Scenes judder to sudden stops; we briefly journey backward in time with no warning. It’s a jarring film, deliberately so. As it alternately lurches and glides along,Die, My Lovegives us no indication of where it is heading—because, I suppose, Grace has no idea herself. Adapted fromAriana Harwicz’s novel,Die, My Lovejoins a recent handful of films about the mental wages of motherhood. But it’s got a flintier sensibility than last year’sNightbitch, and an even more sinister outlook than the upcomingIf I Had Legs I’d Kick You. Ramsay also invites in a daring idea: that amidst all the risk and agony of Grace’s condition, there is something like liberation. Grace’s sensitivity to the bullshit of small talk frees her from it. Her sudden allergy to Jackson allows her to better see his inadequacies. There is even an anarchic allure to some of Grace’s violence. She seems to be peering through a crack in the membrane of the known world, glimpsing some awesome truth on the other side. Or maybe that’s just what her illness has convinced her.Die, My Loveis a tricky film, one that offers neither therapeutic comfort nor remedy. It is sympathetic to Grace’s crisis, but does not really try to drag her out of it. There’s an unsettling ambivalence to the film, a half-embrace of Grace’s altered reality even when it grows frightening. Ramsay’s approach to this material feels radical, a kind of compassion that fascinatingly risks recklessness. As Grace drifts into fractured consciousness, the film grows a bit repetitive, as if Ramsay is circling the runway before her big, bold payoff. The film must keep a lot of the mental health wisdom of the modern day at bay in order to sustain all of Grace’s looping disarray—and while postpartum mental illness is still woefully under-diagnosed and treated, it strains credibility that this particular set of characters would let Grace deteriorate for so long. What keeps our attention during the film’s slightly sagging middle, and makes it such bracing viewing, is the marvel of Lawrence’s mesmerizing performance. She cannily balances mordant humor with existential unease and fury, a bolt of energy coursing through the film. Ramsay’s jumble of pictures and sound is bound together by Lawrence’s confident, fearless gravity. It’s quite something to behold: a comedic performance that manages convincing notes of devastation, or a dramatic turn that is also screamingly funny. What a thrill to see Lawrence expanding her artistry like this, a movie star reclaiming the talent that her celebrity once nearly obscured. She has strong chemistry with Pattinson—who is limber and natural in his role—and an even more powerful connection withSissy Spacek, who plays Jackson’s grieving mother, Pam, with a heartbreaking mix of cluelessness and concern. Something unspoken passes between Grace and Pam, as one woman staggers into motherhood and the other considers the end of her familial duties. The film’s most poignant moments are when we see Pam watching Grace unravel—as she, too, maybe unravels—with both alarm and a kind of awe. There she goes, Pam almost seems to murmur—as so many have gone before her. This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depthCannes coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "title": "Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years. Now She’s Embracing Her Mother, Jayne Mansfield—and Her Biological Father",
    "article_text": "Three-year-old Mariska Hargitay was asleep in the back seat of a car when it rammed into a truck. The toddler survived, her limp little body lodged underneath the passenger seat. But her mother, Hollywood star Jayne Mansfield, died instantly. “I don’t remember the accident. I don’t even remember being told that my mother had died,” Hargitay tells me nearly 58 years after the crash. She is sitting in her New York City apartment, staring into the black hole where her early memories should be. “I look at photos, and I don’t really remember anything until I was five.” In therapy, Hargitay used to fall asleep anytime she wandered too close to painful events—“like a narcoleptic!” She blamed that on her long hours playingLaw and Order: SVU’s Captain Olivia Benson, work she juggles with her personal life as a mother of three. Eventually, Hargitay’s therapist suggested that her sleepiness might be a powerful defense mechanism against trauma. In order to dismantle it, she’d finally have to process the shame she felt about her sex symbol mother and let go of the dark secret about her paternity that she’d been guarding for decades. (Don’t worry, we’ll come to that shortly.) And so, during the depths of the pandemic, Hargitay began transforming her personal Pandora’s box intoMy Mom Jayne—an emotional documentary that premieres May 17 at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival and will air Friday, June 27 on HBO and HBO Max. My Mom Jayneis Hargitay’s debut as a documentary director, a film she initially saw as an archeological dig into Mansfield’s life. Dubbed “Broadway’s smartest dumb blonde” byLifemagazine, Mansfield (born Vera Jayne Palmer) was an accomplished young woman who spoke several languages and played violin and piano. But like Hargitay, she’d experienced loss at a young age: Three-year-old Mansfield was in a car with her father when he died of a heart attack. By the time she was 20 she’d gotten married, had a baby, and begun to study acting in college. She moved to Los Angeles with her first child, Mariska’s sister Jayne Marie, in 1954, and soon ditched her husband. Mansfield auditioned for a casting agent with a Joan of Arc monologue, vying for serious roles. Then a casting director suggested she try bleaching her hair and wearing tighter dresses. She took that advice and added a breathy, Marilyn Monroe–style voice to the mix. Her hope was that once she got her foot in the door, she’d break out of pinup prison. But even after a starring role in the Broadway hitWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter?,its film adaptation, and several more big movies, Mansfield struggled to get anyone to see past her breasts. In 1962, she played classical violin on Jack Paar’s late-night talk show, attempting to introduce America to therealJayne Mansfield—but Paar interrupted her mid-note and shouted crudely, “Who cares? Kiss me!” The next year, she starred inPromises! Promises!A mainstream sex comedy, it featured Mansfield in various degrees of nudity and was banned in several American cities. By the time she died in 1967, she had become the floating signifier for a 1950s bombshell—famous mostly for being photographed. Hargitay grew up mortified by this image of her lost mother: a blonde bimbo, the butt of everyone’s joke. “It all started with the voice,” she remembers. “When I would hear that fake voice, it used to just flip me out. I’d think,Whyis she talking like that? That’s not real.” Her father, Mickey Hargitay—a Hungarian bodybuilding champion turned actor who married Mansfield in 1956 and raised their three children after she died—would insist that this was just her public image. “My dad would always say, ‘She wasn’t like that at all. She was likeyou.She was funny and irreverent and fearless and real.’” But for Hargitay, educated in Los Angeles Catholic schools, it was hard to swallow. “I just wanted my mom to be like the other moms! Like, Why are you always in a bathing suit? Why so much breast? I just wanted a maternal mother image,” she says, burying her head in her hands. “I was embarrassed by the choices that she made.” When I mention the famous photo of Sophia Loren glancing sidelong at Mansfield’s exposed bosom, Hargitay’s face crumples. “That was a rough one. To see another woman look at your mom like that was excruciating for me as a little girl.” All of this trickled down into Hargitay’s own sense of self. She played sports in high school, leaning toward a tomboyish aesthetic. “I didn’t want to bethatgirl, and I was judgmental about it. That’s the honest answer,” she says. “I definitely think that it informed some of my choices. What kind of actor am I going to be? I am going to be a different kind.” It’s probably not an accident that she’s spent 26 years inside the character of Olivia Benson, one of the fiercest, most nurturing female characters on television. “I’ve had so much strife and turmoil with this wordmother—and here I was, this iconic mother figure in the culture. Isn’t that ironic?” Though Hargitay had mommy problems growing up, her late father, Mickey, was beyond reproach. “He was my everything, my idol. He loved me so much, and I knew it,” she says, her voice wavering. “I also knew something else—I just didn’t know what I knew.” Hargitay had always felt that she was different from her siblings, but it wasn’t until her 20s that she understood why. In 1963, Mansfield filed for divorce from Mickey and began a well-publicized romance with an Italian entertainer named Nelson Sardelli—only to reconcile with Mickey several months before Hargitay’s birth in 1964. In her 20s, someone showed Hargitay a photo of Sardelli. She immediately knew in her bones that he was her biological father. “It was like the floor fell out from underneath me,” she recalls inMy Mom Jayne.“Like my infrastructure dissolved.” But when she confronted Mickey, he denied it. The encounter was so shattering that she swept the skeleton back under the family rug and never mentioned Sardelli to Mickey again. (Mickey died in 2006.) When she was 30, Hargitay went to see Sardelli perform in Atlantic City and introduced herself. He burst into tears—telling her, “I’ve been waiting 30 years for this moment.” It wasn’t a fairy-tale scene for Hargitay, though. “I wentfullOlivia Benson on him,” she tells me, switching into an icily aggressive voice. “I was like, ‘I don’t want anything, I don’t need anything from you.… I have a dad.’” She pauses dramatically. “There was something about loyalty. I wanted to be loyal to Mickey.” In the aftermath, Hargitay struggled to navigate the internal gymnastics of “knowing I’m living a lie my entire life.” Is this why she’d always felt so comfortable on family trips to Rome, accompanying Mickey while he acted in spaghetti Westerns? Was she Hungarian or Italian? A wanted child or an “illegitimate” mistake? Hargitay gradually forged a bond with Sardelli and his daughters and came to a realization: Her mother had returned to Mickey because she knew he would love and provide a stable home for baby Mariska. “I grew up where I was supposed to, and I do know that everyone made the best choice for me,” she says. “I’m Mickey Hargitay’s daughter—thatis not a lie.” Her eyes fill with tears. “This documentary is kind of a love letter to him, because there’s no one that I was closer to on this planet.” Hargitay points out that two of her own children are adopted: “They aremykids. Now I understand so much, and, boy, is it sweet.” Getting loved ones to understand why she needed to make the documentary wasn’t easy. “So many people were really hesitant for me to do it,” Hargitay says. But in time, both families gave her their blessing and agreed to appear in the film as well. Sardelli went first, making himself vulnerable on camera. Childhood pain and confusion are palpable in her interviews with her Hargitay siblings: Jayne Marie, Zoltan, and Mickey Jr. Watching the finished doc with them in a Los Angeles screening room was a cathartic experience. “Memory fragments you in so many ways, so to see the story organized felt like, “Oh, now we can deal with that,’” Hargitay says. The four of them sat, arms linked, throughout the film. A separate private screening for her Sardelli sisters in Las Vegas felt equally profound. “They just wept and wept and wept,” Hargitay recalls, then begins to cry herself. “These two women that I love so much—I made them secrets! It’s so heartbreaking to me.” She remembers the countless times she introduced them to people as “family friends,” then guiltily looked away. “I’m not good with lies. So I also made this movie to unburden all of us.” Hargitay sees a link between the familial silence-breaking ofMy Mom Jayneand her work with her Joyful Heart Foundation, a nonprofit for survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, and child abuse. In 2017 she producedI Am Evidence,a documentary about thousands of unprocessed rape kits languishing in America’s police lockers. Last year, sherevealedthat she had been raped by a friend during her 30s. “That was my own parallel journey with shame and not wanting to carry that anymore,” she says, “wanting for so long to be free of [the secret].” I Am Evidence(directed by Trish Adlesic, who also coproducedMy Mom Jayne,and Geeta Gandbhir) made Hargitay fall in love with filmmaking, and she plans to make more documentaries. “That’s one of the things I’m carving out in my future atSVU,making sure that I can have the balance.” When I ask about the fate of television’s longest-running character, she clutches her heart. “I’m not done with Olivia Benson yet,” she replies. “She’s got more work to do.” For now, though, Hargitay is preparing herself forMy Mom Jayne’s premiere at Cannes. Mansfield appeared at the festival in 1958, leaving behind a trail of glamorous photos. There’s Mansfield posing in a bikini with a chihuahua; Mansfield waving from the airplane steps; Mansfield in a gown facing a wall of photographers—always smiling, always in character as Jayne Mansfield, bombshell. “The fact that I get to take her back and to tellherstory there, I just don’t have the words,” Hargitay tells me, vibrating with nervous excitement. As we finish our conversation, she thinks about everything it took to get her to this point. “Thirty years, and now it’s coming out.… It’s wild.” She beams so hard, I worry that her cheeks might explode. “I feel like I’m seven!” HAIR, DENNIS LANNI; MAKEUP, DEANNA HAGAN; MANICURE, KAYO HIGUCHI; TAILOR, KATY PATEL; SET DESIGNER, ISAIAH WEISS.

    "title": "The Department of Homeland Security is Vetting a US Citizenship Competition Reality Show",
    "article_text": "The Department of Homeland Security might soon surf the current dystopian reality competition wave, if the man behindDuck Dynastyhas anything to say about it. Canadia-born reality TV producerRob Worsoff, who's also worked on the dystopia-adjacent veneration of disordered exercise and eating known asThe Biggest Loserand belief-in-romance quasherThe Millionaire Matchmakerhas asked DHS to participate in a show that will do nothing to soothe the worry thatAmerican life has turned intoone bigreality TV hate watchfor the rest of the world. It's also a presumable relief to those who think the latest tide of dramatic content depicting a horrific and inhumane near future is far too uplifting. The long-delayed film adaption ofStephen King'sThe Long Walk, for example, shows the doomed participants in the titular contestactually sharing snacks, a move incomprehensibleinDonald Trump'santi-food-stamp (pandemic be damned!) America. What a pack of cucks! The Long Walkstars left, Jordan Gonzalez as Richard Harkness, David Jonsson as Peter McVries, Cooper Hoffman as Raymond Garraty and Charlie Plummer as Gary Barkovitch might soon have some competition in the hellscape reality competition space. Worsoff's proposed series is a show where “immigrants compete to prove they are the most American,”The Wall Street Journalreports, citing a 36-page slide deck. On the series, participants will complete challenges such as “a gold rush competition where they are sent into a mine to retrieve the most gold” or will be “placed on an auto assembly line in Detroit to reassemble the chassis of a model T.” The competition would be hosted by a “famous naturalized American,” withSofia Vergara,Ryan Reynolds, orMila Kunispresented as possibilities. They would announce the weekly loser of the show, who, Worsoff hastens to note, won't face deportation (as if hecan guarantee that). “This is not, ‘Hey, if you lose, we are shipping you out on a boat out of the country.'\" (To be clear, none of these famous immigrants have announced any affiliation with the show, so please think of their inclusion in this pitch as one might the names on a marital hall pass.) And what would the show's winner go home with? Well, that's less clear, with the slide deck offering anything from a $10,000 gift card to Starbucks, a lifetime supply of gas from 76 (formerly Union 76), or a citizenship ceremony on Capitol Hill.According to Worstoff, whatever happens, it won't be \"mean-spirited. Instead, ‘The American’ is a celebration of what it means to be… well… American – At a time when our morale is at an all-time low.\" It appears, however, that Worsoff also pitched the show when our morale was higher, as he told theWSJthat he also approachedBarack Obama's andJoe Biden's administrations, but both declined. One can see, given the current presidency, how he might feel like the 2025 odds might be more in his favor. And this time around, Worsoff says, “feedback from DHS has been positive and he has already had preliminary discussions with networks” regarding the series. But according to Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairsTricia McLaughlin, Worsoff might be jumping the dystopian gun just a bit. Her agency “receives hundreds of television show pitches a year, ranging from documentaries surrounding ICE and CBP border operation to white collar investigations by HSI,” shesaid on X(formerly Twitter), in a post disputingaDaily Mailreportclaiming that Secretary of Homeland SecurityKristi Noemwas “pushing for” the series. “Secretary Noem has not ‘backed’ or [is] even aware of the pitch of any scripted or reality show,” McLaughlin says, andThe Americanstill has a way to go. “Each proposal undergoes a thorough vetting process prior to denial or approval.” But when speakingwith theNew York Times, it sounded like McLaughlin might already be a fan. \"The pitch generally was a celebration of being an American and what a privilege it is to be able to be a citizen of the United States of America,” she said. “It’s important to revive civic duty.\" It's a scenario that seems straight fromSuzanne Collins's newHunger Gamesbook,Sunrise on the Reaping. Released in March, the novelhas seen record-breaking sales; a film adaptation will be released in 2026. SpeakingwithVanity Fair, Collins says thatReapingwas \"inspired by David Hume’s idea of implicit submission and, in his words, ‘the easiness with which the many are governed by the few,’” a reference to an Enlightenment-era philosopher who argued that people are far more driven by emotion than fact. “The story also lent itself to a deeper dive into the use of propaganda and the power of those who control the narrative. The question ‘Real or not real?’ seems more pressing to me every day.” Uh-oh, a philosopher quote? Sounds like woke-ass nonsense to me! With Collins's stated opposition to theunthinking ass-kissing of dictators,once can see why Worsoff started making the rounds yesterday to distinguish his idea from Collins's anti-a-hole ethos. Speakingto CNNand toThe Wall Street Journal, he insisted that his idea “isn’t ‘The Hunger Games’ for immigrants.\" Sure, because inThe Hunger Games, the despot is toppled, and the good guys (eventually) win! You can certainly see why Worsoff would distance himself from that kind of narrative.

    "title": "Trump Administration Plans Not To Recommend COVID-19 Vaccines For Pregnant People, Teenagers, and Children: WSJ",
    "article_text": "In the coming days, Health SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.is poised to announce that the Department of Health and Human Services will no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for children and pregnant people, according toreportingfromTheWall Street Journal. “Something just happened that’s really special,”Leland Lehrman, the Executive Director of a new Make America Healthy Again-affiliated think tank called the MAHA Institute, told attendees at a daylong event for the Institute on Thursday. \"I was asked to please make this announcement,” hecontinued, according to STAT. “You might’ve already heard, but today the secretary is announcing that HHS and the CDC are going to stop recommending routine COVID shots for children and pregnant women.” The room applauded. Lehrman said, laughing, “That’s good! That’s really good.” The MAHA Institute, officially launched this week, is the latest spinoff group by Kennedy supporters. According to STAT, the first event for the group featured a crowd including “numerous figures with controversial views, including proponents of raw milk, union leaders against vaccine mandates, and psychiatrists who want to wean patients off of mental health drugs.” HHS halting the long-held recommendation for children over 6 months old and pregnant people to get one of the approved COVID vaccines is the latestexampleof the department,stewarded by RFK Jr., opting for skeptical messaging around vaccine efficacy and safety. Spokespeople for HHS, the CDC, and the White House didn’t immediately respond to theWSJ's requests for comment. STAT also attempted to reach HHS for comment. A pharmacy advertises the COVID-19 vaccine as the nation marks the fifth anniversary of the COVID-19 pandemic on March 13, 2025 in New York City. The Health Department’s expected move to stop recommending the COVID vaccine to pregnant people, teenagers, and children could further endanger immunocompromised people across the nation, according toRichard Hughes, a lawyer and vaccine advocate. Doing so would “have a behavioral impact on whether people choose to get vaccinated,” he told theWSJ. If HHS is no longer recommending routine vaccinations for COVID for these groups, insurance companies “will no longer have to cover these vaccines,”Dorit Reiss, a law professor who studies the anti-vaccine movement, said to STAT’sIsabella Cueto. Kennedy, before and after joining PresidentDonald Trump’s administration, continuously spreads misinformation about vaccines, amplifies anti-science solutions to medical ailments, and sows doubt about widely used vaccines, including those to protect against coronaviruses In 2021, RFK Jr.askedthe federal government to revoke its emergency authorization of all COVID vaccines, filing a citizen petition on behalf of Children's Health Defense, a Kennedy-founded group that advocates against the recommended vaccine schedule for children. Since taking on the role as Health Secretary, following his failed presidential campaign,Kennedy and his department havetried to discredit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research which found that increases in autism diagnoses are largely due to broader screening and identification of people in “previously underidentified groups,” and not, asRFK Jr.hasadvanced, due to the MMR vaccine. In March, the CDCrolled back$11.4 billion in funds for state and community health programs that, in part, include immunizations and vaccines for children. And, in May,announcedthat all new vaccines would need to undergo placebo testing—a requirement that is likely to delay the availability of certain vaccines and complicate the process of getting vaccines approved. Karen White (C) and Christina Stile (R) from Bethesda raise signs during Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD) “Sick Of It” rally against the Trump administration's health care policies in front of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) on May 10, 2025 in Bethesda, Maryland. One legacy already forming for Kennedy is how he’s handled theongoing measles outbreakstarted in West Texas. According to The Texas Department of State Health Services, 718 cases have been confirmed since late January and there have been two confirmed deaths—two young girls, ages 6 and 8. As unvaccinated people continue to spread the disease—many of them from the Mennonite community at the epicenter of the outbreak—Kennedy has continued to amplify untested theories about how to fight measles without vaccination, like steroids, antibiotics, and cod liver oil. This week, Kennedysaidduring testimony before a House panel that he would \"probably\" vaccinate his child for measles, if he had one today. During that same panel on Wednesday, Kennedy said, “I don't think people should be taking medical advice from me.” Also at the MAHA Institute conference on Thursday wasMary Holland, president of Children’s Health Defense. She was celebrating with attendees that the group’s ideas have reached such a stage as this. “Wow, we’ve come a long way,” Holland said. “We have all been waiting for this moment.” WhatScarlett JohanssonWants Inside LA’s Young, Testosterone-FueledSperm Race Live Updates From the2025 Cannes Film Festival Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act See All the Looks From the2025 Cannes Red Carpet Creator Tony Gilroy Breaks DownAndor’sGut-Wrenching Finale The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Why Buckingham Palace Tried to Stop a Photo ofPrincess Diana and David Bowie Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal’s ‘Eddington’ Skewers a Divided America—And Promptly Divides Cannes",
    "article_text": "You never knew when Friday’s world-premiere crowd ofEddingtonwas going to laugh. This was surely expected on the part of writer-directorAri Aster,who unflinchingly and often comically dives into the extremities of the immediate post-COVID moment in the U.S. His portrait of that unsettling period ranges from broadly silly to agonizingly specific, and while not every audience member was bound to recognize every reference in every given scene—the debates over masks, racial injustice, and police corruption are very specific to its milieu—the movie’s generally discomfiting nature informed much ofthe reactiontoo. “I don’t know what to say—I don’t know what you think,” Aster said with a smirk after the film ended to a respectful standing ovation. “I don’t know, sorry?” On Saturday, Aster was joined at a press conference by his cast:Joaquin Phoenix,who plays an anti-mask town sheriff in May 2020;Pedro Pascal,the mayor and his primary adversary;Emma Stone,Phoenix’s character’s alarmist wife, and more. “I wanted to show what it feels like to live in a world where nobody can agree on what is real anymore,” Aster said beside his colleagues. “I wanted to make a film about what America felt like at that time—and it felt bad. I am very worried. We need to re-engage with each other. That’s the only hope.” It’s inevitably ironic, then, thatEddingtonhas already sparked spirited debates among crowds on the Croisette, in busy waiting areas around the Palais, and at cocktail parties. It’s a movie people can’t stop talking about even if they don’t always seem to enjoy talking about it with others all that much. (I’ve heard a few instances of raised voices.) As of this writing,Eddingtonsits at a mediocre 60% on Rotten Tomatoes and is the worst-scoring movie onScreen Daily’scritical aggregate of moviesin the Cannes Competition so far. The widely spread Letterboxd star-score curve indicates audience reception will be similarly polarized. Eddingtonwill be released in theaters on July 18, giving studio A24 a few more months to build momentum. It’s another big, tonally ambitious swing for Aster, following his surrealist epicBeau Is Afraid, which bombed at the box office on a $35 million budget and similarly struggled to win over critics en masse. LikeEddington, that movie was designed to be divisive—but Aster ultimately came away frustrated with how it landed with audiences. “I fantasize about there having been a time during which a film like this might’ve come out and divided audiences, and it would’ve made people excited to go to the theater in order to determine how they felt themselves, as opposed to just people hearing, ‘Oh, the response is all over the board, so I’m not going to bother,’”Aster told meofBeauin 2023. “I was hoping that the draw of a debate would be greater.” Eddingtonoffers that draw again, certainly. But in speaking so directly to the state of the U.S. right now, it’s reasonable to hope for that to create more curiosity among potential viewers. Aster may have moved away from the strict horror genre since his career launched withHereditaryandMidsommar, butEddington’s got a haunting quality of its own. “It felt like the first time that we had a mole, a whistleblower almost—someone from the inside being like, ‘This is what’s happening,’” Pascal said at the press conference of what he felt Aster accomplished. “That was really powerful to me. I don’t think I understood that until I saw it.” This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depth2025 Cannes Film Festival coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "title": "Shari Redstone and Paramount’s Own Mission: Impossible—Survive a Trump Lawsuit and a Billion-Dollar Merger",
    "article_text": "Call it Mission: NotTotallyImpossible.Shari Redstone,the controlling shareholder of the $8 billion media giant Paramount Global, began talks to sell her stake in December 2023. A year and change later, staff, shareholders, and even viewers are on the edge of their seats, wondering what will happen next. Paramount’s lawyers are in the midst of settlement talks with PresidentDonald Trumpover his complaints about the editing of a60 Minutesinterview with Vice PresidentKamala Harris.CBS said it left out a clumsy answer to a question about US-Israel relations because of time constraints, though it had used the answer in a promotion for the upcoming interview. Trump believes CBS’s top news show portrayed Harris in a positive light, interfering with the election, and sued under theTexas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a law usually employed to protest false advertising claims. Trump had declined the show’s invitation to speak ahead of the election. He expanded his case in February, claiming $20 billion, up from an initial $10 billion, for having been harmed as a competitor to CBS via his social media network, Truth Social. The network, meanwhile, believes its edited interview has First Amendment protections. Redstone hasreportedlysaid that she is taking herself out of the talks, leaving it to her three chief executives to figure out the mess. That has left some feeling frustrated. “She needs to resolve this. Shari has the most to lose,” said one person familiar with the position of Redstone, who would have to pay a $400 million breakup fee if the deal were not to happen. (A CBS News spokesperson declined to comment. The White House press office didn’t respond for comment.) If things go in Trump’s favor, Paramount Global will become the latest media organization to pay Trump millions, sending one more chill down journalism's spine. On April 30,The Wall Street Journalreported that Paramount is ready to settle the dispute for between $15 million and $20 million. But if the president doesn’t like the number, a deal may not happen at all. Adding to the pressure, a group of nine senators wrote aletter​​, made public on May 7, to the Paramount Global controlling shareholder, imploring her not to settle the case with Trump: “In our view, that would be a grave mistake.” “Rewarding Trump with tens of millions of dollars for filing this bogus lawsuit will not cause him to back down on his war against the media and a free press,” the lawmakers wrote. “It will only embolden him to shakedown, extort, and silence CBS and other media outlets that have the courage to report about issues that Trump may not like.” Trump shared a furious statement onTruth Socialon Wednesday, May 7, about the Emmy nomination that the60 Minutesinterview with Harris received in the editing category. “These antics are why the American People have no trust in the Press, and demand that the Media, very much including60 Minutes,CBS and its owners, be held responsible for their corruption and lies, which is exactly what we are doing in Court!” Meanwhile, Redstone hadbeen in on-again-off-again merger talks withDavid Ellison,the owner of Skydance Media. At one point Redstone even walked away from those negotiations before returning to finalize a complicated deal that will involve her shedding her voting control in Paramount by selling her stake in National Amusements, Inc. The current agreement with Skydance is backed by both Oracle cofounderLarry EllisonandGerry Cardinale’s private-equity firm,RedBird Capital(where former CNN chiefJeff Zuckerhas a joint-venture business). IfBrendan Carr’s Federal Communications Commission gives the deal the go-ahead, Redstone will get to cash a check worth more than $1.75 billion and exit the business her grandfather Mickey Redstone helped establish. Redstone inherited her father Sumner’s controlling stake in what was then known as ViacomCBS in 2020, after his death at age 97. Despite Redstone’s rocky relationship with her father, who, according to a2015WSJarticle, once tried to buy her shares for $1 billion, he would likely be proud of the cards she’s played. Perhaps surprisingly, Redstone is well acquainted with Trump, which may help her navigate these stormy seas. Redstone is also trying to steer the tricky merger through the FCC, which is overseeing the request for the transfer of28 local CBS TV stationsand other licenses to Ellison family–controlled assets, even as it investigates the network for“news distortion” and isforcing Paramountto limit specific corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Paramount owns BET, one of the top cable destinations for African American viewers. Redstone has shown she is unafraid to make tough decisions. But even after the ouster of Paramount CEOBob Bakish(whose salary had hit nearly$87 million) and the installation of three chief executives (being paid around $20 million each), the 71-year-old, one of the most powerful women in media, is left with few good choices. Her relationships may help her survive it. Redstone has done her best to curry favor with Republicans. “She’s right of center, but not by any means extreme,” according to one person who knows her. “She’s generally interested in news being as accurate as possible. People are a mix of things. She’s very supportive of race relations and things that would be called DEI. She’s not dogmatic, and she’s not a party regular for anyone at all.” In January, Paramount hired Trump fundraiser and lobbyistBrian Ballardto help see the company through the rocky merger-approval process. Ballard Partners is also working for big tobacco companies in a fight against unlicensed vape products. Perhaps hoping a Republican government would be more likely to sign off on her plan, Redstone, through the company PAC, gave slightly more to Republican candidates than to Democrats in the most recent full-year cycle, according toopensecrets.org. And Redstone might have hoped for some goodwill from Trump, who once called to offer words of support amid her fight to get rid of former company management before he was ever a presidential candidate. “He would call and tell her to keep up the good fight,” according to the person who knows her. “I think she feels personally appreciative of that.” (Another possible connection:Mark Burnett, producer ofThe Apprentice,soldSurvivorto CBS.) Redstone and Trump have even lunched together. “Part of what is surprising is that he is giving CBS such a hard time when Shari is on one side and [Larry] Ellison is on the other,” that source said. The Oracle cofounder appeared in February at theOval Officeand is an ally of Trump. Speaking at theNew York TimesDealBook Summit in 2016, just after Trump won the presidency, Redstone told interviewerAndrew Ross Sorkin,“I’m actually really optimistic for someone to come in and unify the country. I think he listened to a lot of voices around this country that people weren’t listening to about some of the challenges that we have, and I’m hopeful that he’ll surround himself with really good people and start to solve some of the problems we have.” In 2019, Redstone discussed launching a right-wing news channel to take on Fox News, according toThe Hollywood Reporter. At the centerof Redstone’s dilemma is a news division that is at odds with both her mission to make peace with Trump and her life’s work fighting antisemitism. Redstone’s passion for Israeli causes has caused friction with news operatives for years. “She has no interest in understanding life in the Palestinian world,” one person told me, claiming Redstone did not understand journalism. A source close to Redstone denied this, saying she cared about innocent people on all sides of war. (Redstone declined to comment for this story.) Redstone has weighed in on news coverage numerous times in recent months, including sticking up for anchorTony Dokoupilafter he challengedTa-Nehisi Coateson air. Coates had been onCBS Morningsto discuss his bookThe Message,which is about censorship and includes a section on Israel and Palestine (Vanity Fairexcerpteda portion of the book). But the interview got heated and Dokoupil was accused ofnot meeting editorial standards. (Dokoupil didn’t respond to a request for comment sent via a CBS PR representative.) Only a fewblocks away from its New York headquarters, an adaptation ofGood Night, and Good Luckopened to packed houses on Broadway. The play starsGeorge Clooneyas CBS journalist Edward R. Murrow, who bravely challenges Senator Joseph McCarthy. Amidst all this came the resignation of Bill Owens, the executive producer of60 Minutes,one of American broadcasting’s longest-running, most respected, and most lucrative TV news series. Owens has claimed to be a victim of corporate interference, telling staff in a memo, “Over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for60 Minutes,right for the audience,” according to a copy shared withThe New York Times.“So, having defended this show—and what we stand for—from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward.” Staff wonder if Owens’s departure might have been a gesture of self-sacrifice, aimed to allow the news division to avoid having to apologize to the White House. His close friend and anchorScott Pelleywent further, unspooling the unhappy tale for viewers on air on April 27, explaining that the company’s corporate parent is waiting on merger approval from the Trump administration for the deal with Ellison. “He did it for us, and you,” Pelleytoldthe60 Minutesaudience in an on-air segment, speaking about Owens’s exit. “Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires.” Pelley has pusheda series of segments critical ofthe president, who has a long-standing beef with the show. (Trump walked off the set asLesley Stahlbegan interviewing him back in 2020. A previous dispute in 2005 between Republican presidentGeorge W. BushandDan Ratherand his producer ultimately ended Rather’s career at the network.) Owens’s accusations have prompted questions internally about what exactly happened, though it appears that Owens felt that the heat kept getting turned up on him viaSusan Zirinsky,who was appointed in January to a role overseeing sensitive news stories. The news division had been beefing up its oversight of news, which had become stretched by multiple growing responsibilities and under fire from critics, including the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Committee, which had complained about a segment coveringState Department resignationsover PresidentJoe Biden’s Israel defense policies. Two TV news executives said that60 Minutesmade a mistake in the editing of the Harris interview. “You are not supposed to make the edit that they made,” said one person, describing the use of the shorter answer given by the then vice president in response to a question about US relations with Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu.CBS News released thetranscripts,showing it had used one portion of Harris’s wordy answer in a promo duringFace the Nationand a more succinct answer during the Sunday show. “If Mike Wallace had done the interview, he would have said, ‘I can’t believe what you just said to me because it was garbage, and you’re supposed to be president?’” A second experienced TV news executive agreed and said: “Let her do the word salad, and then say, ‘She finally said this…’ You are being true and reflective of the conversation, and they didn’t do that. It’s relevant if you have a commander in chief who can’t communicate.” A person close to the show pushed back on the idea of a mistake: “This is absolutely untrue.” The company responded to the Trump lawsuit in a statement that read: “The interview was not doctored; and60 Minutesdid not hide any part of…Vice President Kamala Harris’s answer to the question at issue.60 Minutesfairly presented the interview to inform the viewing audience, and not to mislead it. The lawsuit Trump has brought today against CBS is completely without merit and we will vigorously defend against it.” The first TV news executive believes that Pelley has become too zealous. “The problem is, Trump is a crazy, kooky, dangerous president. It’s not our job to be the place that looks for every angle possible to take him down. The audience as well. It’s not what60 Minutesis meant to be.” This person continued, “It’s hurting the broadcast.” The May 4 edition of60 Minutesincluded a Pelley segment on Trump’s targeting of law firms. The final broadcast of the season, airing this coming weekend (Sunday, May 18), is not expected to include Pelley. Owens’s estimated $3 million contract is being honored, according to a person familiar with discussions. The question is: Who is now running the show? Technically, executive editorTanya Simon,the daughter of legendary anchor Bob Simon, is in charge, but sources say Pelley had made himself the unofficial executive producer, in part because of his close partnership with Owens. A person close to the show said there was no question that Simon was in charge, while another person said staffers were taking their lead from Pelley because of his long tenure, leadership, and tough stance on Trump actions. (Pelley declined a request for comment via a spokesperson.) Several people familiar with internal conversations said there’s also been friction between the Owens-Pelley camp and Zirinsky, the former CBS News chief. She stepped down from CBS News in 2021 and was given a wide-ranging programming-making role at the company, but stepped back in January after asegmentabout Biden’s State Department attracted criticism. Zirinsky returned as part of a broader effort to improve standards oversight across the board, which involved reviewing sensitive content at60 Minutes.The announcement of Zirinsky’s appointment was made not by president of newsWendy McMahon,but by CBS CEO and presidentGeorge Cheeks.The beefed-up standards team includes a returningAl Ortiz,a former EP ofCBS Evening Newswho had previously retired, andTom Cibrowski,working as president of news. (Zirinsky declined to comment.) Zirinsky was given the title of interimexecutive editor. One rumor around CBS News is that Owens banned Zirinsky from appearing at their offices. While a person close to the show said that was untrue, Zirinsky has not physically been to the60 Minutesoffices, which are located near the CBS News main headquarters. Another source said that Zirinsky is close to Redstone and had a difficult relationship with Owens. Management of the show is complicated by the fact that60 Minuteshas historically been given leave to operate outside of the control of CBS News. The new layer of fact-checking, albeit one that had previously existed in other eras, had clearly irked Owens, though he noted in his exit comments that the show’s segments had not been blocked. One TV executive wondered why Owens didn’t call out Redstone by name or reference Trump in his departure statement. As this person put it, “He’s still taking their blood money.” (Owens did not respond to a message requesting comment.) Some people familiar with corporate politics point to McMahon, the president and CEO of CBS News and stations, who also runs CBS Media Ventures, which is jostling in court to retain the rights to distributeWheel of FortuneandJeopardy!And jeopardy is what they say McMahon may be in. She had gone to bat for Owens to get him a significant raise, one source told me, but she isn’t viewed as having strong footing at the moment given that the revamp ofCBS Evening News,which saw the departure ofNorah O’Donnellfrom the anchor chair, ended up losing viewers. “She supported Bill until the very end,” said one TV executive familiar with the company. McMahon declined to comment. As the show’s month-to-month season comes to a close, Trump is scoring some wins—China agreeing to a pause on trade tariff tit-for-tat and the return of the last living American hostage held in Gaza. “The obvious fact is there are wins—tariffs and Trump directly dealing with Hamas. There are victories and they will be reported. CBS has to report the wins when they exist,” said one CBS News insider. Another person familiar with the company summed up the problem thus: “It’s a no-win situation. If you want a deal to go through, you’re going to be in a compromise with the government.” If the deal were to get blocked, the news division would be low on the list of anyone’s investment priorities, according to this person.",

    "title": "Alexander Skarsgård Is the Dom, Harry Melling the Sub, and Pillion Their Kinky, Sweet Love Story",
    "article_text": "Few movies have achieved are both as emotionally resonant and deeply horny asPillion. Perhaps they could learn a thing or two from writer-directorHarry Lighton.While helming his feature debut, Lighton left a message pinned to his bedroom wall, intended to serve as a reminder before rushing to set every morning: “Don’t sacrifice the real for the sake of the laughs—or the sake of the gasps.” There are laughs, and gasps, aplenty inPillion. The A24 film, adapted from the novelBox Hillby Adam Mars-Jones, starsHarry Melling(of theHarry Potterfilms andThe Pale Blue Eye) as Colin, a meek traffic warden who lives with his parents and sings in a barbershop quartet on the side for fun. He meets Ray (Alexander Skarsgård), the leader of a local gay motorcycle club, and falls head over heels. Ray brings Colin into his particular world, where pillions—that is, those who ride the passenger seat on the motorcycle—are designated submissives. Colin doesn’t know much about any of this, but he goes with the flow because Ray is, well, hot—but also enigmatic and direct and, in his own odd way, protective. What unfolds is a frank, kinky, utterly idiosyncratic first feature from Lighton. He deftly depicts a sexual relationship that some might deem extreme or unusual as the engine for a moving rom-com (with, yes, some dashes of trauma skirting the edges). This is not to say he tamps down on the specifics of the sub-dom dynamic—Pillioncomes complete with orgies, cock rings, and boot-licking. But as Melling and Skarsgård dig into some of the most intricately wild material of their careers, you wonder if these two crazy kids are going to make it: leather, lube, and all. Ahead ofPillion’s Sunday premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in the Un Certain Regard section, Lighton and his stars explained toVFjust how they pulled that off. Vanity Fair:Harry L., how did you come to this novel and then decide to make your first feature out of it? Harry Lighton:I was sent it during the pandemic. I’d been working on a different project for a good five years, and that was set in Japan, and obviously when the pandemic happened, the wheels came off of that pretty quickly.Eva Yates,who’s one of the executive producers and the head of film at the BBC, sent me the book and said, “I think you’ll like this.” Which maybe says something about what she thought about me. But I read the book, and I remember thinking that it was very funny and bracing and thought-provoking. The previous project which I mentioned had been about sumo wrestling. I was quite interested in setting my first feature within a male subculture, and then queering that subculture somehow. And there was a really interesting quality to Colin’s narrative voice in terms of the way he processed events which, from I guess a majority perspective, might be seen as borderline traumatic. Let’s talk about bringing these actors aboard. Lighton:Firstly, I saw Harry sing inThe Devil All the Time, and he’s got a great voice. But then across various roles there was this very interesting magnetism, which wasn’t your typical alpha male magnetism. I found he demanded attention when I was watching him. Harry Melling:When we first started talking about Colin, we spoke about how this thing shouldn’t ever come from a traumatic place. He should always be filled with a stubborn optimism. We thought that was such a lovely thing to carry through the film; to stretch it out, to see how long that can live before the cracks start to appear. We’re with Colin experiencing, for the first time, all these things. So actually, the most important thing I kept thinking to myself is, “Just listen. Listen to these events that are happening to him, and literally experience them for the first time.” I went on this big pillion trip to this Pride festival in Cambridge, and it was as if I was Colin. I was being taught all these new things, being told what a successful boot-licking would look like. The journey would be to watch this person open out into this world, and that was what I kept coming back to if ever I thought I was getting ahead of myself. Lighton:What I wanted from Colin—and Harry—was that magnetic beta quality. What I wanted from Ray was not necessarily an inverse, but another version of that where you had someone who had all the surface of the world’s hottest biker, and then an unknowability. Wherever I’m talking aboutSuccessionor even his interviews on talk shows, Alex is an interesting combination of things. He’s very playful and mischievous, and the roles he’s chosen reflect that. Alexander Skarsgård:When I got a little brief from my agents about the project, biker and sub-dom, it just sounded quite intriguing to me…and from our first conversations, he just felt a lot of confidence in me and his vision for the project. I definitely wanted to put on the leather gear and jump into the trenches with it. In the film, most of the members of the biker gang in the movie are basically playing themselves—they are members ofGBMCC. I’m forever grateful and indebted to them for their generosity and support and patience. They told us about their lifestyle, and how they socialize and about these gatherings, when they go out riding together, down to details in terms of the outfits, and the dynamics between the subs and the doms and what that would look like. I credit everything to those guys. The film is obviously graphic, and sex is a key engine of the storytelling. Harry L., this is also a relatively commercial film. So how did you figure how much you wanted to, essentially, show? Lighton:I remember trying to ignore the practicalities of wanting it to get seen for as long as possible. Because so much of Colin’s experience through the film is driven by transgressive sex, and the way in which he experiences that, I didn’t want to be too hands-off or prudish in the handling of that. I thought that that might feel like it was a judgment on the part of me as the filmmaker, and I wanted to leave it to the audience to be able to decide at which point sex strays into something which is unpalatable to them rather than to give them that information by keeping too much off screen. Once we got into the nitty-gritty, it emerges that you can’t just chuck a load of dicks on screen. But we shot some stuff which was more explicit, and it wasn’t the case that I was told to remove it out of the cut. I chose to remove it out of the cut because I think it was always important to me that the provocation of it didn’t override the sentiment, the experience. For the actors, what was your comfort level filming the sex scenes going in? Skarsgård:You can’t just apply the kind of the sub-dom structure to every relationship. I talked to some people who are in sub-dom relationships, and certain aspects of Colin and Ray’s relationship rang very true to them. And others, they’re like, “Well, I know people who have that kind of relationship…” It was just important for us to figure out what worked for us, in between Harry and myself. I knew that it was going to be graphic, and Harry was very clear on his vision for it—when and how nudity was going to be depicted. I felt that it really served the story, and it made sense to me. I was very, very comfortable with all that. We had a really terrific intimacy coordinator namedRobbie [Taylor Hunt]who was there with us the whole way. Melling:Alex is just the most generous, dreamy scene partner, so what could have been quite a daunting experience couldn’t have been more different, really. When you sort out the choreography of it, which is often the most difficult part—you sort out what everyone’s doing, where their hands are going—and then once action is called, you’re in the world of Colin and Ray. Skarsgård:I fell in love with Harry from the first second I saw him. He’s just the sweetest, nicest, loveliest human being. I felt comfortable going as far as we needed to go in these situations with him. I also discovered a lot of things about Colin and Ray’s relationship that I didn’t anticipate discovering when we first started working on it. There were these tender, beautiful moments that just happened organically, and some moments that were weird and some moments that were funny. But he was incredibly game, very brave in just throwing himself out there. Harry L., how did you work with the intimacy coordinator and others to figure out how best to depict this kind of sub-dom relationship? Lighton:I was speaking to Robbie three months before we started production, about the way in which we were going to approach it. So it wasn’t the case that he just turned up and did the blocking of the scene at that moment. What was key was that whichever way we achieved it, it didn’t feel like the symbol of sub-Dom sex—that it felt like there was a reality to it. And that meant embracing moments of clumsiness or discomfort as well as the highs of the sex. A lot of the supporting biker-gang people we cast from both the GMBCC and the kink world—we definitely leant on them to tell us, like, what lube you might be using if you were doing an orgy. I wanted anyone who watches it from the kink community, or whatever community, to feel like what they’re watching is accurate. Melling:In a way, that made it easier. It wasn’t close-ups of hands. It felt very real. This wonderful community of supporting actors was so valuable. Just in terms of taking me through what a successful boot-lick would be so that I knew how to do it...notsuccessfully. Skarsgård:There are orgy scenes in the film, and with a combination of actors and non-actors with different levels of experience in that field, it was great to have Robbie there to kind of help and guide the team. Lighton:It was the moments of mundanity that I most took away from that [research]. There are 80 men in leathers getting onto bikes at the beginning of the day, but then an hour-and-a-half later, you’re having a pork pie and talking about what people thought ofKylie’s Glastonbury performance. And the GMBCC are not definitionally a kink-based or a sex-based organization. It’s for queer people to go biking. So the bike gang in our film, and the way pillions and riders are delineated, that’s very much a fictional creation. Skarsgård:The way it’s set up in the script, the audience knows as little about Ray as Colin does, and we kind of maintain that kind of level of mystery around the character. In terms of the specifics of the sub-dom relationship, he’s very clear and very upfront with Colin about what he wants, and that also creates an interesting trajectory for their relationship as the story and the love relationship evolve. The film has a surprising sweetness to it that might not be what you expect in a film with this subject matter. Lighton:There’s a knee-jerk reaction when you hear about BDSM—that it’s going to be either very ironic or it’s going to be very severe—and I knew that I didn’t want to lose the fun of it. But I also didn’t want to create a distance between the audience and Colin and Ray through irony. That’s probably where the sweetness comes through. The film is meant to be funny, and I want people to laugh. But it’s not meant to be funny in a way which detaches you from the people in front of the camera. Melling:It grounds it in an interesting way. It’s familiar, and then suddenly we’re somewhere else. That tone is constantly what Harry L. was playing with. Lighton:No matter how atypical your sex life is, the likelihood is that you’ll have some aspect of typicality from family life or something like that—those two things can live side-by-side. You can go from a family lunch to an orgy, and those two things can not feel incompatible. The hardest thing for me was allowing the characters to exist as extremes without turning them into cartoons—and allowing for that to be quite broad humor at times without compromising the realism.

    "title": "Harris Dickinson Makes a More Than Promising Directorial Debut With ‘Urchin’",
    "article_text": "There’s an old go-to gag about Hollywood ambition: an actor saying, “What I really want to do is direct.” It became a punchline for a reason—for all the actors who have become brilliant filmmakers, just as many have crashed and burned when stepping behind the camera. The Cannes Film Festival is littered with such tales of woe, from the noxious hubris ofSean Penn(The Last Face) to the irksome pretension ofRyan Gosling(Lost River). And so I rolled my eyes—just a little!—when I saw that rising 28-year-old movie starHarris Dickinsonwould debut his first directorial effort,Urchin, on the Croisette this year. I rolled them a bit harder when I read the film’s synopsis.Frank Dillane,son ofGame of ThronesactorStephen Dillane,stars as a London vagrant, scrambling about the city trying to hustle up money and lodging and some sense of purchase in life. Might this all be akin to the NYU students I’ve often seen wandering Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, taking photographs of unhoused people sleeping on benches—as if their leering camera was somehow conferring noble, artistic dignity upon these downtrodden people? Dickinson is a fine actor with a proven track record of good taste—by my count, he’s only done one bad Hollywood YA cash-in—so perhaps it was rash to pre-judge his film. But that apprehension was there nonetheless, the niggling suspicion that yet another actor might reveal an unbecoming shallowness and vanity. To my happy relief,Urchin—which premiered here at Cannes in the Un Certain Regard sidebar on May 17—is the thoughtful, stylistically assured debut of a natural filmmaker. Dickinson, who wrote the film’s script and appears in a small supporting role, wears some of his influences on his sleeve while binding them into something distinctly his. With Dillane’s invaluable help,Urchinpaints a sad and compelling portrait of someone lost in the fringes, a victim of an often indifferent system and of the complex wiring of his brain. Dillane plays Mike, a man drifting from post-adolescence into true adulthood while living on the street. His halting movement and glazed-over eyes suggest that some kind of drug addiction has gripped him, but he is often lucid enough to reveal a sharp, charming person struggling to stay upright. A nasty robbery lands Mike in prison for a few months. When he reemerges, he is sober and dedicated to the task of getting his life in order. As the film unfolds, one expects Dickinson to hit the hoary narrative beats common in these stories. There will be a low, then the ascent to recovery, then a second-act setback, and then something approaching hope at the end. But Dickinson, calm and probing and sensitive in his filming, messes with that timeline just enough to keepUrchinsurprising, unpredictable. He ventures into artsy abstraction, moments in which we glimpse the interior of Mike’s psyche, journeying into both the wilds and Edens of a mind at war with itself. Dickinson smartly fuses that surreality with a realism perhaps inspired by filmmakers likeSean Baker(there’s the youthful energy) andMike Leigh(there’s the weary observation of life in all its plainness). The film drifts alongside Mike as he makes brief connections with other people—mostly coworkers with whom he finds some solace and companionship. But he never finds any real refuge from the pressures and torments of his addiction, from the itchiness of his existence. Dillane, in a nuanced and keenly felt performance, keeps Mike in the liminal space between pitiable and frustrating, endearing us to him while not shying away from his heedlessness and selfishness. It is, in that way, a convincing and fair depiction of addiction—or, at least, one credible version of a condition widely varying in its symptoms. WatchingUrchin, one never feels the smarm of the slumming student artist. There is none of the overly mannered, crassly articulated grit that has plagued too many recent films about the lower class. (Look to billionaire heiressNicola Peltz’s 2024 filmLolaif you want some of that. Or, better yet, don’t.) There’s no condescension in Dickinson’s gaze; he proves a far more compassionate filmmaker than one might (unfairly) expect from a handsome, famous 20-something. A few indulgent missteps into indie-movie cliché—young people waving sparklers in a parking lot to signify their carefree joie de vivre, for example—are not enough to blow the film off course. It’s awfully exciting not only to savor a strong debut, but to eagerly look forward to what Dickinson might make next. Perhaps more aspiring actor-directors ought to spend some timein the Criterion closet.
