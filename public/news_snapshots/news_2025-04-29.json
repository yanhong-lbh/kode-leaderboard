(Courtesy: KDFW) A jury has decided the fateof a Texas teenwho was charged with allegedly stabbing his high school classmate to death in a bathroom in 2022, finding him not guilty of murder and guilty of criminally negligent homicide. After being unable to reach a verdict on Monday and tabling court till Tuesday,KWTX reportedthat a Bell County jury announced that they did not find Caysen Allison guilty of murder in the stabbing death of Joe Ramirez Jr. at Belton High School in May 2022. The jury found Allison guilty ofcriminally negligent homicide. Allison was released under the conditions of his bond, the outlet reported, which will remain in place until his sentencing hearing on June 16, where he faces anywhere from six months to two years in a state prison, in addition to a possible fine of up to $10,000. TEXAS HIGH SCHOOLER CHARGED WITH MURDER AFTER STABBING CLASSMATE TO DEATH IN BATHROOM: POLICE Bell County jury finds Caysen Allison not guilty of murder in death of Joe Ramirez.(Belton Police Department/GoFundMe/Joe Ramirez’s Funeral & Burial Expenses) Allison had been out on bond, under house arrest, since July 2022 after a judge dropped his $1-million bond down to $175,000 in the stabbing death of Ramirez Jr., according to KWTX. The Belton Police Departmentsaid that Allison ran away from the school after the stabbing in 2022, but was arrested 20 minutes later. The fatal altercation happened during a fight in the school's restroom, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by KWTX. The report stated that Allison waived his rights against self-incrimination and admitted to detectives he fatally stabbed Ramirez Jr. TEEN SUSPECT FREE ON BOND AFTER ALLEGEDLY STABBING TEXAS TRACK STAR AUSTIN METCALF TO DEATH Jose Luis Ramirez Jr. was fatally stabbed to death inside a bathroom at his Texas high school in May 2022, according to police.(Viktoria Ramirez Facebook) Officers found Ramirez Jr. suffering from \"large puncture wounds to his chest\" and he was rushed to a local hospital in critical condition. At the hospital, KTWX reported that officers noticed Ramirez sustained \"multiple stab and slashes injuries along his chest, back, legs and arm.\" He was later pronounced dead. During previous testimony, one of Allison's friends, Chris Bittle, described the events leading up to the fatal altercation and being in the school's bathroom during the fight. There was a heated argument between Allison and Ramirez at a prom night after party, according Bittle's previous account. Text messages revealed that Allison sent a text to Bittle after that party asking, \"bro, bring me a gun.\" Bittle also recalled what happened the day of the stabbing, explaining that while there was a plan for Allison and Ramirez to fight, they did not plan to fight in school and were surprised to bump into Ramirez and his friends in the school restroom, KTWX reported. Bittle testified he and Allison tried to leave after using the restroom, but Ramirez and his four friends wouldn’t let them.

Allison’s defense argued he acted in self-defense in a \"fight for his life\" after he was attacked by Ramirez in the school’s bathroom. Officers went to Allison's home following the fight after he fled the scene, where officers overheard him speaking to someone on the phone saying \"I did something at school,\" and asking them to come and take him to Waco. Detectives also snapped photos of Allison's white shoes being covered in blood as he told investigators what kind of knife he used to kill Ramirez and where he had dumped the weapon. Madison Barnes, Ramirez’s ex-girlfriend and a close friend of Allison’s, testified that Allison made threats against Ramirez to her before the stabbing, according to KWTX. She also told the jury that Allison warned her that he \"wanted Joe on life support, wanted to stomp his head in, wanted his jaw dangling from his face, and wanted him in the hospital.\" Ramirez Jr.,a senior at the school,was described on a GoFundMe page raising money for his family as a \"very kind, loving and gentle young man.\" Allison’s defense attorney, Zachary Boyd, told KWTX that he was happy with the jury’s decision in a very challenging case. \"The Allison family is so sorry for their loss, cause there is no good outcome to this. There is no happy ending in terms of everyone’s going to leave here feeling happy,\" Boyd said. \"The world is not black and white. The world is shades of gray and, ultimately, we were left with the question of what do you do when the issue is one of bullying or one of a child who is so scared that he brings a knife to school to defend himself with?\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Nearly three years later, another Texas teen was violently killed while attending a high school track meet. Karmelo Anthony, the 17-year-old accused of stabbing Frisco, Texas track star Austin Metcalf to death, was released from jail after his bond was dropped from $1 million to $250,000. Like Allison, Anthony's bond conditions include house arrest and an ankle monitor, and he will only be able to leave his home with the judge's permission. If convicted, Anthony cannot face the death penalty because he is a juvenile, thanks to a 2005Supreme Courtruling in a case called Roper v. Simmons.

    "article_text": "FOX Sports' Joel Klatt joins Colin Cowherd to dive into what led to Shedeur Sanders dropping to the fifth round and how he can stand out in the Cleveland Browns' crowded QB room. Columnist Jemele Hill offered her own take onShedeur Sanders’draft slide over the weekend as he fell to the fifth round and was taken by the Cleveland Browns. Hillappeared on\"The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz\" on Tuesday and dismissed the narrative that Sanders fell so far in the draft because he was a confident Black man, which pundits claimed throughout the weekend and even going as far as accusing NFL teams of colluding with each other to make sure the former Colorado Buffaloes star dropped. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) during a spring game event at Folsom Field.(Ron Chenoy/USA TODAY Sports) She didn't think Sanders' draft slide was about race \"at all\" and offered a suggestion to Black people in her diatribe. \"The bottom line is maybe we should accept the fact — and this is not to say that Shedeur Sanders cannot go on to have a greatNFLcareer, can’t do great things — but maybe we, as Black people need to accept the fact that Deion Sanders may have overplayed his hand a little bit,\" Hill said. \"And there’s no crime in him infusing all the confidence in Shedeur. I was not bothered by the wrist flexing, none of that. NFL teams, if you’re talented enough, they don’t care. And we have seen this countless times.\" Hill pointed to the Baltimore Ravens selecting defensive end Mike Green in the first round. The former Marshall standout faced accusations of sexual assault in the past and set a school record with 17 sacks for the Thundering Herd in 2024. The Ravens said they investigated the claims thoroughly. \"In the NFL, they make these talent decisions all the time, but if the talent is worth it, they don’t give a damn if he showed up in gold-plated everything, flashing whatever, as long as you can play. That’s all they care about,\" she said.

Ward had a stellar season with the Miami Hurricanes after he transferred from Washington State. Ward entered the collegiate ranks with Incarnate Word as he was a zero-star recruit. He ultimately bet on himself and proved to be one of the best quarterbacks in the nation. \"But the person I really feel sorry for is Cam Ward. Cam Ward went No. 1. Cam Ward was a zero-star recruit from a two-parent home — because you know how we like to throw that around on some respectability type of stuff,\" Hill said. \"He is a fantastic player, confident, did all the things, drafted No. 1, and with the way people have so embraced this narrative that Shedeur was done so wrong, it’s like they’re basically making Cam Ward sound like he’s Steven from ‘Django.’ \"And I’m like, you don’t even know this kid! Suddenly, he’s painted in this light because, 'Oh, the NFL will accept that type of Black but not this type of Black.’ It’s like do you know how many players, how many Black players, went ahead of Shedeur Sanders? It’s a lot of them.\" Miami quarterback Cam Ward poses after being chosen by the Tennessee Titans with the first overall pick during the first round of the NFL football draft, Thursday, April 24, 2025, in Green Bay, Wisconsin.(Jeff Roberson/AP Photo) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Ward will likely be the Week 1 starter for the Tennessee Titans, while Sanders will have to move up the depth chart in hopes of getting some playing time in 2025.

    "article_text": "Fox News' Chanley Painter reports the latest on Kohberger's case. A judge in Idaho denied a motion from Bryan Kohberger's defense team asking to remove thedeath penaltyas a potential punishment if he's found guilty. Kohberger is charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of four students at theUniversity of Idaho, including Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; Madison Mogen, 21; and Ethan Chapin, 20. The former student at the University of Washington was also charged with one felony count of burglary. During a hearing on April 9, Kohberger's defense team presented the motion to strike the death penalty, arguing that discovery produced by prosecutors has been both voluminous and unorganized. Kohberger argued this meant he was unable to meaningfully review and investigate the evidence in preparation for trial, which is currently scheduled to begin in August. Judge Steven Hippler wrote in his order on Tuesday that Kohberger's complaints about the amount of discovery produced \"ring hollow.\" JUDGE RULES DEATH PENALTY TO REMAIN AS POSSIBLE PUNISHMENT AMID BRYAN KOHBERGER AUTISM DIAGNOSIS Bryan Kohberger enters the courtroom for his arraignment hearing in Latah County District Court, May 22, 2023 in Moscow, Idaho. Kohberger is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022.(Zach Wilkinson-Pool/Getty Images) \"[Kohberger] has been receiving discovery in the same manner for over two years,\" Hippler wrote. \"[Kohberger] has not sought additional resources…to hire additional staff to review discovery or obtain litigation document control software to help organize and sort the evidence. His lead counsel insisted that she be allowed to take on a second high-profile capital case despite the voluminous discovery in this case.\" Hippler also wrote that Kohberger's lawyer, Anne Taylor, \"indicated that her practice is to personally review all the discovery herself, rather than rely on associates and staff to review materials to cut through the less relevant information and point to what materials need review by lead counsel.\" WHAT WENT BRYAN KOHBERGER'S WAY – AND WHAT DIDN'T – AT EVIDENCE MOTIONS HEARING Bryan Kohberger, accused of murder, arrives for a hearing on cameras in the courtroom in Latah County District Court on September 13, 2023 in Moscow, Idaho. Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, was indicted earlier this year in the November 2022 killings of Madison Mogen, 21; Kaylee Goncalves, 21; Xana Kernodle, 20; and Ethan Chapin, 20, in an off-campus apartment near the University of Idaho.(Ted S. Warren-Pool/Getty Images) \"These actions are not indicative of an overburdened defense team,\" Hippler wrote of the motion.

    "article_text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters at Shannon Airport in Ireland that the detention and possible deportation of former Columbia University anti-Israel protest organizer Mahmoud Khalil is \"not about free speech.\" A New Jersey federal judge ruled that anti-Israel ringleader,Mahoud Khalil, can sue the U.S. government as the Trump administration seeks to deport him. The ruling by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey came after a Louisiana judge ruled that the U.S. government could deport the Ivy League graduate. Khalil has separate court cases playing out in two states – the Louisiana case is focused on his deportation order and the New Jersey case is focused on his habeas petition challenging the legality of his detention. Federal authorities attempted to dismiss Khalil’s case, arguing that provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act stripped the court of jurisdiction to review his constitutional claims at this stage. Judge Claire C. Cecchi disagreed on Tuesday, ruling that Khalil’s lawsuit must be heard. COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTER MAHMOUD KHALIL CAN BE DEPORTED, JUDGE RULES Anti-Israeli activist Mahmoud Khalil trashed the Trump administration's case against him in a Washington Post column this week.(Selcuk Acar/Anadolu via Getty Images REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton) Khalil, who was approved for deportation by a U.S. immigration judge, has argued that his free speech rights were being \"eroded\" by the Trump administration. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) attorneys have argued that Khalil's free speech claims were a \"red herring,\" saying that the 30-year-old green card holder lied on his visa applications. TRUMP DEFENDS STUDENT DEPORTATIONS, DISMISSES FREE SPEECH CRITICISMS Khalil, they said, willfully failed to disclose his employment with the Syrian office in the British Embassy in Beirut when he applied for permanent U.S. residency. Federal officials alleged that Khalil was \"inadmissible at the time of his adjustment\" because of \"fraud or willful misrepresentation of material fact\" in his status application. The agency also accused Khalil of failing to disclose his work with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees and membership inColumbia University Apartheid Divest.

The DHS has also alleged that he \"led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,\" though Khalil has denied the allegations. Following the ruling, Khalil's immigration attorney, Sabrine Mohamah, called the decision \"unjust as it is alarming.\" \"This is a blatant violation of theFirst Amendmentand a dangerous precedent for anyone who believes in free speech and political expression,\" she said. \"Mahmoud is currently imprisoned in Louisiana, a state that detains over 7,000 people daily and serves as the second-largest hub for immigration detention in the U.S. Louisiana's nine detention centers, eight of which are privately operated, include the only ICE facility in the country directly connected to an airport, thus streamlining mass deportations across the state.\" MAHMOUD KHALIL RIPS ‘REPRESSIVE’ TRUMP ADMIN FOR ERODING HIS RIGHTS IN WASHINGTON POST OP-ED A pro-Palestinian demonstrator holds a flag on the rooftop of Hamilton Hall at Columbia University in New York, US, on Tuesday, April 30, 2024.(Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images) DHS Secretary Kristi Noemalso weighed in on the ruling, saying that the Columbia University graduate \"hates America.\" \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa or green card to live and study in the United States of America.

Israel's foreign minister slammed the United Nations on Monday as the organization's court opened a hearing on Israel's legal responsibilities in Gaza. Gidon Sa’ar said that the U.N. is a \"rotten, anti-Israel, and antisemitic body,\" which ought to be on trial for covering up terror affiliates within the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), who he said participated in the attacks of Oct. 7 2023. \"The U.N. must answer for these crimes,\" Sa’ar said. He told reporters that Israel had decided \"not to take part in this circus,\" which is intended to deprive Israel of its \"most basic right to defend itself.\" OFFICIALS IN BIDEN ADMIN WORKED TO UNDERMINE NETANYAHU AFTER CEASEFIRE TALKS COLLAPSED, FORMER AIDE SAYS The IDF and ISA eliminated Hamas terrorist, Nukhba commander, Mohammad Abu Itiwi. He was involved in the murder and abduction of Israeli civilians on October 7th. Itiwi worked for UNRWA according to the Israelis.(IDF Spokesman's Unit) \"Secretary-General [Antonio] Guterres is personally accountable. He knew what was going on in UNRWA. He knew very well and he knows very well. Israel repeatedly warned him. He did nothing. He went out of his way to whitewash UNRWA. He continues to cover upthe crimes of UNRWA andits terrorist employees.\" Jewish News Syndicatereported that Sa’ar later presented evidence that 25% of UNRWA staff \"were implicated in terrorist activity\" prior to Oct. 7, 2023.  Sa’ar said that UNRWA is a proxy of the terror group Hamas. Fox News Digital reached out to Guterres’ spokesperson seeking comment on Sa’ar’s accusations, but did not get a response. In a statement to the press on Monday, Guterres' spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, told a reporter that he didn’t \"think the Secretary General is a big fan of a circus.\" Calling the presentation to the ICJ \"extremely detailed and very clear and very legal,\" he also said that Guterres was \"very clear [and] straightforward\" when the U.N. \"first revealed the Israeli allegations against UNRWA.\" Dujarric said that UNRWA Commissioner-General Phillipe Lazzarini \"took extremely quick action\" responding to the complaints. HEAD OF UN WATCHDOG SAYS UNRWA HIRED PEOPLE ‘WHO WERE SUPPORTING TERRORISM’ Photos released by the Israeli Defense Force show three individuals that the Israeli military claims are Hamas terrorists inside an UNRWA compound in Rafah.(IDF) Lazzarini terminated the appointments of some of the UNRWA staffers who participated in the Oct. 7 attacks. Dujarric also noted the \"depletion of critical stocks\" in Gaza since Israelblocked all aid to Gazain March in an attempt to force a ceasefire with Hamas. Not only is food running out, but Dujarric said that trauma-related medical supplies, surgical supplies, therapeutic milk, medicines, and other important items are in short supply. In a statement regarding the ICJ hearings on April 28, U.N. Legal Counsel Elinor Hammarskjöld outlined the U.N.’s concerns about Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. Referencing the Israeli Knesset’s law banning UNRWA’s operation, passed in October 2024, she stated that Israelcannot deny impartial humanitarian organizationsfrom providing relief, and that concerns about the impartiality of such organizations may not be made unilaterally by an occupying power. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres delivers a statement at UN Headquarters on the situation in the Middle East following the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel.

    "title": "India's Modi gives army freedom to act as tensions rise with Pakistan after deadly terror attack",
    "article_text": "Vice President JD Vance told an audience in Jaipur that a successful U.S.-India partnership would bring about a \"prosperous and peaceful\" rest of the 21st century, warning of a \"dark time for all of humanity\" otherwise. India’s Prime Minister,Narendra Modi, is giving the armed forces near complete freedom of action to respond following a deadly attack on tourists in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region on April 22 that saw 26 people killed by terrorists. India and Pakistan have exchanged fire every day since the attack along the Line of Control that separates the Indian and Pakistani areas of Kashmir. TheTimes of Indiareported on Tuesday that Modi has given the military the operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets, and timing of the response to the attack in Kashmir. PAKISTAN FEARS INDIA INCURSION 'IMMINENT' AMID HEIGHTENED TENSIONS FOLLOWING TERROR ATTACK Kashmiri villager women walk past the blown-up family home of Asif Shiekh, a militant who officials all is involved in the deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam, at Monghama village in Tral, south of Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Friday, April 25, 2025.(AP Photo/Dar Yasin) Modi is set to convene another meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Wednesday to coordinate India’s next moves. The move comes as Pakistan's Minister for information and broadcastingclaimed on Xthat his country has \"credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.\" Modi recently said India will \"identify, track and punish every terrorist, their handlers and their backers,\" in a post on X. \"We will pursue them to the ends of the earth,\" Modi added. India’s Defense Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif told Reuters that the country has mobilized its forces because retaliation is \"something which is imminent now.\" The Resistance Front (TRF), an extremist group linked to the Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist organization based in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for the attack in Pahalgam. Lashkar-e-Taiba was responsible for the2008 Mumbai attacksand is known to have links with the Pakistani military and a partnership with Pakistan’s Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). Pakistan has denied any involvement in the attack. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is garlanded by senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders Rajnath Singh, left, party President JP Nadda, right, and Amit Shah, at the party headquarters in New Delhi, India, Tuesday, June 4, 2024.(AP Photo/Manish Swarup) The attack, which killed 26 people and was the worst terrorist attack on India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has increased tensions on the Indian subcontinent between two nuclear-armed powers. \"An Indian military response is likely reflecting the more muscular foreign policy of the Modi government as noted by its actions following previous terrorist attacks,\" Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, told Fox News Digital. HERE'S WHY A FLARE-UP BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN OVER KASHMIR MATTERS Bajpaee noted that a surgical strike or airstrike is the most likely form of retaliation, and the response will likely take a calibrated approach to limit collateral damage and civilian casualties and to control the escalation ladder in order to keep the conflict below thenuclear threshold. \"However, this is easier said than done given the possibility of accidental escalation\" and a \"broader tit-for-tat military escalation cannot be ruled out,\" he warned. Although there was limited outreach from Modi in the past, two rounds of escalation in 2016 and 2019 have soured relations. Indian army officers stands guard near Pahalgam in south Kashmir after assailants indiscriminately opened fired at tourists visiting Pahalgam, Indian controlled Kashmir, Tuesday, April 22, 2025.(AP Photo/Dar Yasin) Sadanand Dhume, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told Fox News Digital that Modi is facing pressure to mount a tough response. \"The Indian public is outraged by last week’s terrorist attack in Kashmir, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi is under immense pressure to respond to the atrocity by strikingPakistan, which has long sponsored attacks on India,\" Dhume said. INDIA VOWS TO HUNT TERRORISTS ‘TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH’ AS TENSIONS WITH PAKISTAN RISE AFTER KASHMIR ATTACK Already India has suspended the landmark 1960 Indus Water Treaty, a key water-sharing agreement covering rivers that overlap both countries. Pakistan’s Minister of State for Law and Justice toldReutersthat Islamabad plans on challenging India’s suspension of the treaty and is raising the issue with the World Bank. Pakistan said the impediment to the free flow of water would constitute an act of war. Supporters of the Pakistan Murkazi Muslim League party protest against the suspension of water-sharing treaty by India with Pakistan, in Lahore, Pakistan on Thursday, April 24.(AP/K.M. Chaudary) The rivalry between India and Pakistan dates back to the partition of the former British colony of India in 1947, with the establishment of Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India. The partition plan also provided the contested regions of Jammu and Kashmir with the opportunity to choose if they wanted to join either newly established nation. Kashmir ultimately decided to join India in exchange for help against invading Pakistani militias, with India and Pakistan fighting three wars over the territory since 1947.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. A leaked budget proposal sent on April 10 from the White House Office of Management and Budget to the U.S. State Department highlighted the Trump administration’s posturetoward Afghan allies, particularly those awaiting transportation to the U.S. through the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts (CARE) as part of Enduring Welcome. The OMB budget proposes ceasing additional funds to CARE and using the program’s $600 million balance \"for the orderly shutdown of the CARE program by end of [fiscal year] 2025.\" The National Security Council and State Department did not answer Fox News Digital’s questions about whether these funds would be used to transport additional Afghans in the Special Immigrant Visa and the suspended U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) pipelines to the U.S., or simply to disassemble processing platforms in the Philippines, Qatar and Albania.

U.S. Navy veteran Shawn VanDiver, founder and president of the #AfghanEvac, told Fox News Digital that Operation Enduring Welcome is \"the safest, most secure legal immigration pathway our country has ever seen\" and allows well-vetted Afghans \"to show up in our communities and start businesses and become job creators… in a time when we have a labor shortage.\" VanDiver noted areas where Trump could improve on the Biden administration operation, which was carried out \"so slowly that people have been left behind in Pakistan, in Afghanistan, in 90 countries around the world… for three and a half years.\" Particularly in Pakistan, the Biden administration promised the Pakistani government \"that it would process Afghans quickly,\" VanDiver said. \"We haven’t been keeping up our end of the deal; 10,000 people are stuck in Pakistan right now because President Biden couldn’t house them fast enough.\" Josh Habib, left, a U.S. Marine translator, speaks with Afghan villagers and two Marines in Afghanistan's Helmand province, July 2, 2009.(AP Photo/David Guttenfelder) VanDiver emphasized that \"President Trump has an opportunity to be a hero to veterans and our wartime allies, and demonstrate that when the United States makes a deal, it keeps its promise.\" Inan open lettersent on April 23 to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and national security advisor Michael Waltz, #AfghanEvac states that \"over 250,000 Afghans remain in the relocation pipelines.\" Andrew Sullivan, executive director of the nonprofit No One Left Behind, told Fox News Digital that his organization supported congressional authorization in 2024 for the three-year appointment of a Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, which had \"wide bipartisan\" and \"wide bicameral support.\" RETIRED ARMY CAPTAIN DEDICATES HIS MEDAL OF HONOR AWARD TO FELLOW SOLDIERS IN AFGHANISTAN \"Our belief is that Congress spoke for a reason and CARE should exist,\" Sullivan said. \"We have a moral obligation and a national security imperative to ensure that we’re continuing the facilitation of movement and safe refuge for our wartime allies.\" Ending Operation Enduring Welcome and the CARE program \"just spits in the face of veterans like myself, who’ve been working to try and keep our promise to the Afghans who fought with us for 20 years,\" Sullivan said. In addition to two Iraq deployments, Sullivan deployed to Zabul, Afghanistan, as a U.S. Army infantry company commander in 2013. In February, he \"deployed forward\" with No One Left Behind to processing platforms in Tirana, Albania, and Doha, Qatar, after a Jan. 20 executive order reassessing foreign funding, thus ending government-funded flights for SIV applicants.

This includes \"10,000 principal [SIV] applicants and their families,\" who, according to State Department quarterly reports, have already received Chief of Mission approval, theSIV program’s first hurdle.

    "article_text": "'Fox News Sunday' anchor Shannon Bream breaks down President Donald Trump's first 100 days of his second term. PresidentDonald Trump's second term has taken the world by storm in his first 100 days, leaving allies and adversaries scrambling to respond to new U.S. tariffs, stalled peace negotiations and hardball diplomacy from the White House. On the campaign trail, he pledged to hit allies and foes alike withmassive tariffs, end Russia’s war in Ukraine within 24-hours and threatened that \"all hell\" would break out if all hostages were not freed from the clutches of Hamas in Gaza by the time he entered the Oval Office. While Trump has been able to make good on some of his promises, other ambitions remain unmet. Here’s what Trump has accomplished and what challenges remain: POLL POSITION: WHERE DONALD TRUMP STANDS WITH AMERICANS 100 DAYS INTO HIS SECOND PRESIDENCY U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to the media in the Oval Office at the White House in Washington, D.C.(REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein) Trump last week conceded that his pledge to end the three-year-old war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office was \"figurative,\" acknowledging it was never a realistic goal. The conflict has claimed a reported1 million casualties. \"I said that as an exaggeration,\" he told reporters. While Trump has faced criticism over his ability to bring Russian PresidentVladimir Putinto the negotiating table, his team — led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Secretary of State Antony Rubio — has made some headway, securing a 30-day ceasefire protecting Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. But Putin has so far refused to enter any other brokered agreements, despite Kyiv’s willingness to play ball even after the historicOval Office blow-upbetween Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in February. Though Trump appeared to hold a grudge against Zelenskyy after Ukraine rejected a proposed mineral deal — even blaming him in part for Russia’s illegal invasion — relations between the two leaders appeared to improve over the weekend. Trump also set a new ultimatum for Putin, issuing a deadline to reach a ceasefire deal. \"Two weeks or less,\" Trump told reporters Sunday, though he later added a bit more time would be acceptable. \"We'll see what happens over the next few days. We'll probably learn a lot.\" TRUMP AND ZELENSKYY HAVE 'VERY PRODUCTIVE' TALK AS THEY ATTEND POPE FRANCIS' FUNERAL Trump said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" after Putin last week levieda barrage of missilesat Ukraine’s capital city of Kyiv in a strike that killed 12 civilians and injured nearly 100 more. \"I want him tostop shooting, sit down and sign a deal,\" Trump said in reference to Putin. \"We have the confines of a deal, I believe, and I want him to sign it and be done with it and just go back to life.\" Trump has not said how or whether he will hold Putin accountable if he doesn’t agree to a ceasefire and the White House has not responded to Fox News Digital’s repeated questions regarding the issue. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak in Rome where they both attended Pope Francis' funeral on April 26, 2025.(Vatican and Ukraine Ambassador to Holy See) Before entering office,Trump repeatedly threatened Hamasthat \"all hell\" would break out if they didn’t return all hostages by the time he arrived at the White House. But the Palestinian terror group has ignored his threats and rejected Trump's February proposal to turn the Gaza Stripinto the \"Riviera of the Middle East,\" saying it would adhere to a ceasefire agreement brokered between the terrorist organization and Israel, mediated by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt. Trump has not hit Hamas, nor have his negotiations to release hostages looked all that different from his predecessor's. The first phase of what was intended to be a three-phase ceasefire saw the return of 33 hostages taken by Hamas, the majority of whom were abducted in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel, as well as the release of 1,800 Palestinian prisoners held by Jerusalem. But 59 hostages remain in Gaza, includingAmerican-Israeli Edan Alexander,and hopes of a second phase collapsed after negotiations stalled on terms surrounding future hostage releases, and in March Israel reignited military operations in the Gaza Strip. A Qatari official on Sunday said the main hiccup in securing a ceasefire following the latest round of talks last week is that Israel has not presented a clear solution to end the war in exchange forhostage releases, Reuters reported. Trump on Friday said he pushedIsraeli Prime Minister Netanyahuto reopen aid corridors into Gaza, which have been blocked since March 2, in order to allow food and medicine to reach Palestinians, though humanitarian corridors have not yet been opened.

It remains unclear if the Trump administration is pursuing a halt to Tehran’s nuclear advancement or acomplete disarmamentarrangement, which would see the destruction of Iran's centrifuge facilities and its stockpiles of near-weapons-grade enriched uranium. It also remains unclearhow much timethe president will allow for the negotiations to carry on.

The initial U.S.-China trade war started during Trump’s first term, in which he hit China with 25% tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods in April 2018. Beijing responded by slappingreciprocal tariffson $50 billion worth of U.S. goods, mostly targeting U.S. agricultural products worth some $16.5 billion — a trade war that saw the loss of a quarter of a million U.S. jobs by January 2021, according to the U.S.-China Business Council (USCBC). From the campaign trail, Trump threatened to hit China with 60% tariffs — which he nearly did in early April when he announced an additional 34% tariff on top of the existing taxes already in place. But what had already sent geopolitical shockwaves and sparked near-immediate market concerns was further escalated just over a week later when Trumpratcheted up tariffson Beijing to 145%. China has responded by hitting Washington with its own 125% reciprocal tariffs on U.S. imports and, according to aBloomberg reporton Monday, cargo supply shipments have already dropped by 60%. Americans are expected to begin feeling the pains of the trade war come mid-May.

He paused the tariffs for 90 days earlier this month following intense backlash. The status of trading relations with U.S. partners remains unclear, along with whether the administration will implement the blanket tariffs on those nations come July. The 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and imported vehicles remain in effect. The White House did not directly respond to Fox News Digital's questions regarding next steps Trump will takes when it comes to handling thus far unresolved conflict in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip.

    "title": "Officials in Biden admin worked to undermine Netanyahu after ceasefire talks collapsed, former aide says",
    "article_text": "The president discussed his long history with Israel prime ministers in a meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. A new bombshell report on an Israeli TV news show revealed Biden officials discussed the idea of working to trigger an election with the hope of defeating Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu so they could push the president's ceasefire deal. The plan was ultimately blocked by the president. One of the president's advisors on the region said that after the first ceasefire deal in the Israel-Hamas war collapsed, the idea of working against Netanyahu started to circulate inPresident Joe Biden’sadministration, according to former White House officials interviewed on Israel's Channel 13 show \"HaMakor.\" The idea floated was that Biden would give a speech directly to the Israeli public, presenting two options, according to his Middle East advisor Ilan Goldenberg. \"A lot of people were talking about, including in the Oval Office at times, the idea of, like, the President going out and giving a speech. Benny Gantz (the opposition leader) was at 37 [seats] and Bibi was like at 15, right? Like, he was very weak. Joe Biden was still incredibly popular in Israel,\" he claimed.

Your sons and daughters are going to keep fighting. Most of the hostages are going to come home dead. The idea would be either toforce Netanyahuto come on board with that or scramble Israeli politics and see if you could trigger elections. That's what people were saying, like, ‘let's just break this up because it's not going anywhere good.’\" However, Goldenberg said Biden blocked the move. \"I think at the end of the day, he [Biden] was uncomfortable with the idea of going out that directly against Netanyahu.\" At a moment when U.S.-Israeli cooperation was vital, the deep mistrust and personal tensions between former President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu threatened to derail key diplomatic opportunities. The recent report featured insights from nine senior Biden administration officials and sheds light on the complexities that defined their interactions.

Biden saw all of that.\" KAMALA HARRIS' PICK FOR JEWISH LIAISON DRAWS CRITICISM OVER ISRAEL, IRAN VIEWS: 'RED FLAG' Before Oct. 7, tensions focused on Netanyahu’s push for judicial reform, which sparked massive demonstrations and clashes among theIsraeli public. \"I was in the middle of all this… I had many a screaming match with Ron Dermer (Israel's Minister of Strategic Affairs) about this,\" Nides said. Biden repeatedly urged Netanyahu to slow down and seek consensus, while anxieties rose over figures like far-right nationalist Minister Ben Gvir. \"There were lots of anxieties over the issues around judicial reform, which I thought was insane,\" Nides said. The personal tension sometimes erupted publicly. When asked if Biden ever used harsh language for Netanyahu, Nides said, \"President Biden likes to use colorful language, and on occasion, the prime minister was able to extract that colorful language from the president.\" He said Netanyahu questioning Biden’s commitment to Israel particularly infuriated him.

According to Michael Herzog, Israel’s then-ambassador to Washington, Biden believed Netanyahu was aiding Trump politically, while Netanyahu suspected Biden of deliberately \"walking on his head.\" The tension extendedto hostage negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Hamas was reluctant to talk seriously for months. When asked if Netanyahu added conditions, he said, \"I’m not saying that.\" Unlike their public statements, Arab leaders were quietly supporting Israel’s efforts to defeat Hamas, Dan Shapiro, former deputy assistant secretary of Defense, revealed in the interview. \"They said very clearly, please tell the Israelis they have our support to wipe out Hamas,\" he said.

Amos Hochstein, former U.S. special envoy for International Energy Affairs, called Saudi Arabia \"the most important Muslim country in the world,\" describing Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as a historic figure capable of reshaping the region. Herzog, Israel’s former ambassador to Washington, confirmed that serious discussions had taken place about advancing normalization during the transition period before Trump could return to office. \"Biden would bring Democrats, and Trump would bring Republicans,\" Herzog explained, but said that Trump preferred to wait, not wanting to share the achievement. \"I believe it will happen, I just don’t know when,\" Herzog said.

(Credit: AP/UME Military Emergency Unit) The massive power outage that wreaked havoc inEuropeis being blamed on a pair of likely solar plant breakdowns in southwest Spain, a report said. By 7 a.m. local time Tuesday, more than 99% of energy demand in Spain had been restored, the country's electricity operator Red Eléctrica announced. Portuguese grid operator REN said on Tuesday morning that all the 89 power substations had been back online since late last night and power had been restored to all 6.4 million customers. Red Eléctrica said it identified two power generation loss incidents in southwest Spain – likely involving solar plants – that caused instability in the Spanish power grid and contributed to a breakdown of its interconnection to France, according toReuters. The economic cost of Monday's blackout across the Iberian Peninsula could range between $2.5 billion to more than $5 billion, it cited investment bank RBC as saying.

    "article_text": "Canada's Mark Carney reacted to winning election as prime minister Monday. (Reuters) Canada's Liberal Partyis projected to win the country's federal election for the fourth consecutive time. The Liberals, led by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who took over after Justin Trudeau resigned earlier this year, won theelection in a shocking turnaround sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of annexation and his tariffs on America's close ally and northern neighbor. As of late Monday, the Liberal Party was leading with 161 seats won in Parliament as opposed to the 150 seats held by the Conservative Party. A party needs to win 172 of Parliament’s 343 seats to hold the majority. Carney won his Ottawa riding on Monday. He is the first prime minister to represent a capital riding since Canada's first prime minister, John A. Macdonald. Former Liberal deputy prime minister and finance minister Chrystia Freeland, whose resignation last December led to Trudeau announcing his plans to resign in January, won re-election in her Toronto riding.

The majority party appeared to be giving up control whenTrump started a trade warwith Canada and suggested the country should become a U.S. state. Trump’s moves infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in nationalism that aided the Liberals in flipping earlier election projections to retain power. \"We were dead and buried in December. Now we are going to form a government,\" David Lametti, a former Liberal Justice Minister, told CTV. \"We have turned this around thanks to Mark,\" he added. The Conservative Party's leader, Pierre Poilievre, sought to make the election areferendum on Trudeau, whose popularity dropped before he ultimately stepped down in January. In Trudeau's final months, Trump repeatedly referred to him as Canada's governor amid continued comments about turning the country into America's 51st state. After Trudeau resigned, Carney, a two-time central banker, became prime minister and the Liberal Party’s leader. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, center, dances to Canadian band Down With Webster as they play live from campaign headquarters after the Liberal Party won the election in Ottawa on Tuesday, April 29, 2025.(Sean Kilpatrick/The Canadian Press) Trump even suggested on election day that he was on the ballot and again said Canada should become the 51st state. He also incorrectly claimed that the U.S. subsidizes Canada. \"Good luck to the Great people of Canada,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Elect the man who has the strength and wisdom to cut your taxes in half, increase your military power, for free, to the highest level in the World, have your Car, Steel, Aluminum, Lumber, Energy, and all other businesses, QUADRUPLE in size, WITH ZERO TARIFFS OR TAXES, if Canada becomes the cherished 51st. State of the United States of America.\" \"No more artificially drawn line from many years ago,\" he continued. \"Look how beautiful this land mass would be. Free access with NO BORDER. ALL POSITIVES WITH NO NEGATIVES. IT WAS MEANT TO BE! America can no longer subsidize Canada with the Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year that we have been spending in the past. It makes no sense unless Canada is a State!\" TRUMP SAYS HE WASN'T 'TROLLING' ABOUT ACQUIRING GREENLAND, CANADA AS 51ST STATE Poilievre responded to Trump, urging him not to attempt to influence Canada's elections. \"President Trump, stay out of our election. The only people who will decide the future of Canada are Canadians at the ballot box,\" he wrote on X. \"Canada will always be proud, sovereign and independent and we will NEVER be the 51st state. Today, Canadians can vote for change so we can strengthen our country and stand up to the United States.\" Trump’s attacks have frustrated many Canadians, leading many to cancel U.S. vacations, refuse to buy American goods and possibly even vote early. A record 7.3 million Canadians cast ballots ahead of election day. \"The Americans want to break us so they can own us,\" Carney said before the election. \"Those aren't just words. That's what's at risk.\" Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre with his wife Anaida, speaks Tuesday, April 29, 2025, in Ottawa.(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Carney and the Liberals made history by securing the party's fourth consecutive term, but there are challenges ahead.

The video titled \"Never Kneel Down!\" was posted Tuesday, April 29 by theChinese Foreign Ministry’sofficial X account, @MFA_China.

    "title": "Trump repeatedly walked back tariffs in first 100 days as White House announces latest duty tax relief",
    "article_text": "OMB Director Russ Vought discusses President Donald Trump's tariff standoff with China on 'America's Newsroom.' PresidentDonald Trumphas championed tariffs as the economic tool that will bring parity to the nation's chronic trade deficit with foreign countries while boosting U.S. jobs and the economy. But many of Trump's tariff polices have been walked back or paused after going into effect. \"I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" Trump declared in his inaugural address Jan. 20, teeing up an onslaught of tariff policies that will take effect in the coming weeks and months. Tariffs are taxeslevied on imported goods and services that historically have contributed to a nation's federal tax revenue. Developed countries, however, have since moved away from relying on tariffs as a main source of federal funding and have shifted to other forms of taxes — such as income, payroll or sales taxes. On Tuesday, which marked Trump's 100th day back in the Oval Office, Trump signed an executive action easing tariffs targeting car manufacturers as he headed to Michigan, historically the heart of the American auto industry, for a rally celebrating his return to the White House. PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS: COMPANIES THAT WILL INVEST $1B OR MORE IN THE US President Donald Trump has championed tariffs as the economic tool that will bring parity to the nation's chronic trade deficit with foreign countries while boosting U.S. jobs and the economy.(Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty Images) The upcoming auto plan will keep a 25% tariff on imported cars and a 25% tariff on imported auto parts but will offer offset credits to U.S. manufacturers for a two-year period in an effort to bolster the U.S. supply chain of car parts and encourage manufacturing in the U.S., according to the administration. The plan will also not stack both auto and steel and aluminum tariffs on the auto industry. Only the higher tariff will be applied to car manufacturers, not a combined tariff. The announcement is the latest of Trump walking back, pausing or easing tariffs as he looks to even the trade playing field for the U.S., while encouraging U.S. manufacturing and job creation. Industries that manufacture products on U.S. soil do not face any tariffs. A White House official who spoke to Fox News Digital explained that while the past few months of tariff changes might seem chaotic in their entirety, each change was born out of a need to be flexible and an effort to bring manufacturing and jobs into the U.S. while ending the nation's chronic trade deficit. The official noted that, as tariffs took effect, many nations and industry leaders have made good-faith efforts to negotiate terms favorable to the U.S., adding to the tariff changes. AMAZON DENIES TARIFF PRICING PLAN THAT WHITE HOUSE CALLED 'HOSTILE AND POLITICAL' Trump's tariff policies overwhelmingly focused on China, Mexico and Canada at the start of his second administration, as he looked to crack down on illegal immigration. It also was an attempt to stem the flow of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, which overwhelmingly originates in China, from coming across the northern and southern borders. Citing the threat of illegal aliens in the U.S. and the flow of fentanyl, Trump declared a national emergency in February under the International EmergencyEconomic Powers Actand imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% additional tariff on imports from China. The tariffs sparked swift outrage from the three nations, and Trump paused the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after the nations agreed to concessions, such as sending additional security personnel to their respective borders with the U.S. Migrants walk along a road in a caravan in an attempt to reach the U.S. border, in Tapachula, Mexico, in November 2023.(Jose Torres/Reuters) China, on the other hand, imposed tariffs on some U.S. imports in response to Trump's tariffs.China's Finance Ministrysaid Feb. 4, shortly after the tariffs started, that it would impose a tariff of 15% for coal and liquefied natural gas and 10% for crude oil, agricultural equipment and large-engine cars imported from the U.S. GROCERY GIANT WARNS ITS SUPPLIERS THAT SUPERMARKET WON'T BE ACCEPTING TARIFF-RELATED PRICE HIKES The administration official who spoke to Fox Digital pointed to the tariff changes for Mexico and Canada as part of negotiations to secure the border after Trump declared a national emergency under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The tariffs on Mexico and Canada went into effect March 4 after the pause, while the tariffs on China were increased to 20%. A day later, after speaking with auto industry officials from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, Trump walked back the tariffs if they affected the auto industry, granting a one-month exemption to tariffs \"on any autos\" from the two countries that abide by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement's rules of origin. Those rules were established under the first Trump administration, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a  news conference at the time. President Donald Trump(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) On March 6, Trump again walked back the 25% tariffs on many imports from Canada and Mexico while praising Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for helping secure the U.S.-Mexico border. He postponed the tariffs for 30 days and touted that his highly anticipated reciprocal tariff plan would take effect in the coming weeks. DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR SIGNALS HE MIGHT COOL TARIFF FIGHT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PRAISES \"I did this as an accommodation, and out of respect for, President Sheinbaum,\" Trump said on Truth Social of the March 6 tariff pause. \"Our relationship has been a very good one, and we are working hard, together, on the Border.\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum speaks during a press conference at the National Palace in Mexico City, Mexico, Jan. 8, 2025.(Henry Romero/Reuters) While announcing and imposing tariffs on nations such as Mexico and Canada, Trump previewed a reciprocal tariff plan that would take effect April 2. \"On trade I have decided for purposes of fairness, that I willcharge a reciprocal tariff— meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them no more, no less,\" Trump said at the White House in February. \"In other words, they charge us a tax or tariff, and we charge them the exact same tax or tariff. Very simple.\" Trump announced his highly anticipated reciprocal tariff plan as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement April 2. Trump announced customized tariffs on dozens of nations to help bring parity to what he said were decades of foreign nations installingtrade barrierson U.S. goods, while also imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all countries. \"For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating,\" he said. \"And because we are being very kind, we will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us. So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal. I could have done that. Yes. But it would have been tough for a lot of countries.\" TRUMP SAYS INCOME TAX CUTS, AND PERHAPS ELIMINATION, COMING DUE TO TARIFFS The EU for example, was hit with a 20% tariff in the reciprocal tariff plan, compared to its39%tariffs on the U.S., while Japan saw 24% tariffs compared to the 46% the country charges the U.S. China was hit with an additional34% tariff, compared to the 67% it charges the U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" trade announcement event in the Rose Garden at the White House April 2, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) The same day the reciprocal tariffs were about to take effect April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the customized duty taxes he had imposed on dozens of nations, which was an abrupt change of course from his previous comments that there would be no pause to those tariffs, only negotiations. The pause did not include the 10% baseline tariff on all nations. \"You have to have flexibility,\" Trump told the media when asked about his credibility after pausing the tariffs. \"I could say there's a wall. ... Sometimes, you have to go around or under the wall. Financial markets change. Look how much they changed. I think the word would be ‘flexible.’ You have to be flexible.\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, President Donald Trump and Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent(Getty Images) White House officials told Fox News Digital at the time that dozens of countries had reached out to the White House looking to make good-faith deals, and that the administration was zeroing in on renegotiating more favorable deals for the U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated in recent days thattrade negotiationswith at least South Korea and India are entering the final stages. Other tariffs, such as a 25% tax on all steel and aluminum imports or the 10% baseline tariff on foreign nations, have remained in effect without change. Trump has touted that with increased revenue from tariffs, U.S. citizens could see lower taxes and the possible elimination of the income tax. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"When Tariffs cut in, many people’s Income Taxes will be substantially reduced, maybe even completely eliminated. Focus will be on people making less than $200,000 a year,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social April 13. \"Also, massive numbers of jobs are already being created, with new plants and factories currently being built or planned. It will be a BONANZA FOR AMERICA!!! THE EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE IS HAPPENING!!!\" Fox News Digital's Eric Revell contributed to this report.",

He has used his presidential powers to to bring change to bordersecurity, trade, education, civil rights, technology and innovation. Trump has also notably used his executive powers to slim down the federal government's bureaucracy, including through both spending and staffing cuts at various federal agencies. \"I read an editorial today that this is the most consequential presidency in history, and it wasn't even by a group that would normally be supporting us,\" Trump added during his address to supporters, without clarifying where the editorial originated. \"It was a group of people that I think tend to be on the liberal side, but they said it's the most important election.\" While Trump supporters and Republicans have touted the president's accomplishments during his first 100 days, Trump'slatest poll numberssuggest Americans are less thrilled with the way Trump has steered the nation.

Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Houston Rockets and CEO of Landry’s Restaurants group was confirmed as the upper chamber to be Trump's ambassador to Italy and San Marino by a margin of 83-14.

During Trump’s first term, Fertittatold CNBCthe president was doing \"a fantastic job for the economy.\" \"Businesses are booming, unemployment is low. He understands what drives this country,\" Fertitta said in 2018. Fertitta’s praise of Trump often steers more toward business-focused than overtly-political, as in the CNBC interview. Trump’s choice of Barrack played into two different aspects of the investor’s history. Before he was a friend of the future president’s, Barrack served as an undersecretary in the Reagan Interior Department, focusing on energy policy including Middle East oil.

Later in that decade, Barrack helped Trump secure financing for his short-lived ownership of the Plaza Hotel – during which time the future president famously told a lost Kevin McCallister its lobby was \"Down the hall, and to the left\" in 1992’s Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. The two real estate moguls remained friends in the years after Trump ultimately gave up the Midtown landmark. Barrack was a strong supporter of Trump’s first presidential campaign and raised millions for his first inauguration’s events.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and ‘Gutfeld!’ panelists discuss the billions in government waste that Elon Musk and the DOGE team have found and continue to find. Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, who is considered one of the most vulnerable incumbent Democrats heading into next year’s midterm elections, is facing criticism for her recent opposition to President Trump’s tariff plans despite a long history of fighting for tariffs while representing union-heavy northwest Ohio. Kaptur, who has served in Congress since the early 1980s, has been vocally criticizing Trump over his tariff plan, includingon the House floorlast month when she argued that a 25% tariff on Canada would \"raise your prices on everything.\" In February,Kaptur said, \"Across our country, people are experiencing a worrisome economic reality. Prices are on the rise. Trade wars and short supply of goods will cause more inflation. Prices are up 3% across the board. Egg prices are up 53%. Too many families are overwhelmed and facing really hard choices.\" Kaptur’s criticisms of tariffs, which have been echoed by many other Democrats as well as some conservatives within the GOP and have alsoresulted in lawsuitsfrom Democrats who say they will lead to inflation, come after years of promoting the idea of tariffs as a way to \"level the playing field\" on trade. DONALD TRUMP SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR SIGNALS HE MIGHT COOL TARIFF FIGHT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PRAISES L- Dem. Rep Marcy Kaptur R- Donald Trump(Getty/AP) \"Actually, he’s agreeing with my 25-year battle to try to get attention to America’s trade accounts, to the fact that we have not had balanced trade accounts. They’ve been over half a trillion dollars in the red for over a quarter-century. We have lost thousands and thousands and thousands of jobs. We’ve had production platforms shut down in many major industries, including those I represent,\" Kaptur,speaking to BBC in 2018, said in response to concerns that Trump’s steel tariffs in his first term could start a \"trade war,\" adding that the \"whole trade regimen globally needs to be reformed.\" Two years earlier, Kaptur called for the need to \"have a real reckoning\" on trade while also supporting the use of tariffs during an interview on C-SPAN. \"Every billion dollars of deficit translates to a million lost jobs in this country,\" Kaptur said. \"A loss of millions of American jobs every year. We have to face that directly.\" AIR FORCE VETERAN JUMPS INTO KEY HOUSE RACE TO UNSEAT 22-TERM VULNERABLE DEM: 'TIME TO PASS THE TORCH' Democrat Rep. Marcy Kaptur(AP Photo/Ken Blaze, File) \"We have to do something. We have to have a response here, whether it's tariffs on imported goods, whether it's slowing down the admission of those goods into our country. We don't want to create walls. We want to create open trade and that would [save] the incomes and livelihoods of millions of Americans across this country.\" The United Auto Workers (UAW) — who Kaptur has previously supported, even touting that her parents were members of the union — has come out in favor of Trump’s tariffs, and in 1994, Kaptursaid on C-SPANthat a \"large share of our trade deficit is in the automotive area\" and largely due to \"outsourcing production all over the world,\" which had a \"tremendous impact on the ability of ordinary people in communities across this country to earn a decent living because we pay our workers more than they do in Mexico or China.\" Kaptur, who narrowly won re-election in 2024 by less than 1 percentage point, is widely considered one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the House. Her district will be home to one of the most highly watched races as Republicans attempt to hold a thin majority in the chamber. Cook Political Report ranks the race as a \"Democrat toss up\" in a state that Trump carried by over 10 points. Trump won the district in 2024 by about 25,000 votes. Kaptur’s praise of tariffs in the past contrasted with her current objections has sparked criticism from the National Republican Congressional Committee. President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, in West Palm Beach, Fla.(Evan Vucci/AP) \"Democrat Marcy Kaptur is so consumed by Trump Derangement Syndrome that she can’t even do what’s right for Ohio workers,\" NRCC spokesperson Zach Bannon said. \"Time and time again, Kaptur proves just how out of touch she is with real Ohioans—flip flopping to push partisan nonsense instead of real solutions.\" Kaptur, who haspreviously saidshe stands \"shoulder to shoulder\" with UAW, has taken thousands of dollars from General Motors Company PAC and Ford Motor Company Civic Action Fund, FEC records show. Both GM and Ford have faced criticism foroutsourcing jobsoutside the United States. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Kaptur defended the use of targeted tariffs while taking issue with the across-the-board approach from the Trump administration that some have linked to recenteconomic uncertainty. \"The hollowing out of our manufacturing base to the benefit and enrichment of Wall Street has been a decades-long attack on working men and women in my district, and across America,\" Kaptur said. \"Smart and targeted tariffs are a critical tool in the arsenal to protect workers, and can operate as part of a strategy to fight unfair trade practices from authoritarian nations such as China and Russia.\" \"But, the arbitrary and sudden tariffs across the board on more than 180 countries and territories, with exemptions only given out depending on who was able to pay $500,000 for a seat at 'The Executive Branch' or $250,000 a piece for a table Mar-a-Lago is unfair,\" Kaptur continued. \"This comes at the same time this Administration is cutting off critical investments in manufacturing from the CHIPS Act, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and American Rescue Plan Act, which is eliminating tens of thousands of American manufacturing jobs, and is a recipe for pain and failure.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, questions  Energy Secretary Rick Perry during a House Appropriations Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies subcommittee hearing in Rayburn Building on the department's FY2019 budget on March 15, 2018.(Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call) Kaptur added that the tariffs on Canada \"in particular\" are \"exacting great pain on families, workers, and companies across our region struggling to compete, and are raising the cost of gas, groceries, lumber, housing, cars, and so much more.\" \"Trump's Tariffs hurt working families, while killing the livelihood of those who work in manufacturing, farming, and construction. The Trump Tariffs are a recipe for disaster that are already hurting tens of thousands across the region I represent in Northwest Ohio — we deserve a comprehensive strategy on trade that prioritizes workers, not Wall Street speculators.\" Despite criticisms from both sides of the aisle, Trump's tariff plan appears popular with several unions, including the UAW, whose president, Shawn Fain,said in late March, \"Yes, I disagree with Donald Trump on virtually everything, but [tariffs are] one thing I don’t disagree on.\" Andrew Mark Miller is a reporter at Fox News.

(Credit: Nicholas Ballasy) EXCLUSIVE:Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., did not rule out 2028 presidential aspirations when asked by Fox News Digital about the viral video that had pundits guessing if she was soft-launching her campaign. \"I think what people should be most concerned about is the fact that Republicans are trying to cut Medicaid right now, and people's healthcare is in danger. That's really what my central focus is,\" the New York Democrat said when asked if she was considering a run for president, despite PresidentDonald Trump'sassurances that he wouldn't cut Medicaid. \"This moment isn't about campaigns, or elections, or about politics. It's about making sure people are protected, and we've got people that are getting locked up for exercising their First Amendment rights. We're getting 2-year-olds that are getting deported into cells in Honduras. We're getting people that are about to get kicked off of Medicaid. That, to me, is most important,\" Ocasio-Cortez said on Capitol Hill on Trump's 100th day in office. Ocasio-Cortez has crisscrossed the United States with Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., on the \"Fighting Oligarchy\" tour, and Americans have been speculating about whether the New York Democrat is launching a shadow campaign for president. AOC CLAIMS 'WE ARE ONE' IN CAMPAIGN-STYLE VIDEO DESPITE YEARS OF INVOKING RACE, GENDER IN POLITICS Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez did not rule out a 2028 presidential bid when pressed by Fox News Digital but said her main focus right now is protecting Medicaid.(Fox News Digital) Ocasio-Cortez's campaign accountposted a video on X last weekthat invigorated those rumors as the four-term Democrat from New York City and a progressive leader proclaimed, \"We are one.\" 'WE ARE ONE': AOC CAMPAIGN VIDEO SWIRLS 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RUMORS \"I'm a girl from the Bronx,\" Ocasio-Cortez said on a campaign-style stage in Idaho. \"To be welcomed here in this state, all of us together, seeing our common cause, this is what this country is all about.\" FiveThirtyEight founder and prominent pollsterNate Silversignaled earlier this month that Ocasio-Cortez is the leading Democrat to pick up the party's presidential nomination in 2028. In a draft 2028 pick with FiveThirtyEight's Galen Druke, Silver chose Ocasio-Cortez as his top choice to lead the Democratic Party's presidential ticket.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will almost undoubtedly run for president in 2028,\" political reporter Eric Daugherty said in response to the video. SCHUMER SINKS, AOC SOARS IN NEW POLL AS LIBERAL VOTERS DEMAND HARDER LINE ON TRUMP As rumors swirl over Ocasio-Cortez's ambition for higher office, back at home in New York, a Siena College poll found Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumer'sfavorability is down, at 39% among New York state voters questioned in the poll, which was conducted April 14-16. Meanwhile, Ocasio-Cortez's favorability soared to 47%. The longtime senator from New York faced pushback from the Democratic Party in March for supporting the Republican budget bill backed by Trump that averted a government shutdown and stirred up outrage among congressional Democrats who planned to boycott the bill. That growing disapproval among Democrats was reflected in the poll, and the shifting perception comes as DNC vice chair David Hogg, through his political arm, Leaders We Deserve, faced blowback from the DNC this week for investing $20 million into electing younger Democrats to safe House Democrat seats.

The record-breakingfundraising haulwas one of the biggest ever for any House lawmaker. Ocasio-Cortez's team highlighted that the fundraising came from 266,000 individual donors, with an average contribution of just $21. \"I cannot convey enough how grateful I am to the millions of people supporting us with your time, resources, & energy. Your support has allowed us to rally people together at record scale to organize their communities,\" Ocasio-Cortez emphasized in a social media post. THESE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo, a veteran of Sanders' 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, said that Ocasio-Cortez appears to be one of a small group of politicians in his party who \"are test ballooning a potential 2028 run for the presidency\" as Democrats search \"for a path out of the wilderness.\" \"We're not really sure who or what it will be, but one of the pathways there is to drill down on economic populism. There are many people that occupy that lane and she is one of them. And there's clearly energy behind what her and Bernie Sanders did criss-crossing the country.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) speaks onstage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on Aug. 19, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois.( Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Colin Reed, a Republican strategist, said Ocasio-Cortez \"shouldn't be discounted\" by Democrats \"who are standing in her way\" of running for whichever office she decides to seek — whether as a U.S. senator or president of the United States. While Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders garnered plenty of national attention as they jetsetted across the country, Reed said their passion and energy might invigorate the progressive portion of the Democratic Party, but \"her ideas are way too outside the mainstream to ever be electable at a nationwide level.\" \"Ultimately, in a Democratic base there's always going to be a percentage of voters who are drawn to that message. The issue they run to is it's just not the majority of Americans. The majority of Americans don't want to transform our country into some sort of ‘European-style government rules all’ vision. That's why America was founded in the first place — to get away from oppression, from an overbearing, overreaching government,\" Reed said. Rep.

The house of cards will come crumbling down, especially when you've got two folks out there, Sen. Sanders and Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, holding themselves out as climate warriors as they jet around the country on private jets spewing untold carbon emissions into the air. That hypocrisy is one that's tough for a lot of folks' stomachs,\" Reed added. Deirdre Heavey is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.",

    "article_text": "Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and ‘Gutfeld!’ panelists discuss the billions in government waste that Elon Musk and the DOGE team have found and continue to find. As President Trump marks his 100th day in office on Tuesday, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) says that it has cut at least $160 billion in waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government, including several high-profile cuts that have been highlighted over the past few months. One of the most talked about DOGE targets in Trump's first term was spending at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the Senate DOGE Caucus Chairwoman, who says she speaks to Musk about spending cuts every few days,published a listof projects and programs she says the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) has helped fund across the years. HOW A DOGE REVIEW CAN ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE PROGRAMS THAT FIGHT HIV/AIDS President-elect Donald Trump greets Elon Musk as he arrives to attend a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket on November 19, 2024 in Brownsville, Texas(Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Ernst highlighted that the agency \"authorized a whopping $20 million to create a ‘Sesame Street’ in Iraq.\" Under the Biden administration, USAID awarded $20 million to a nonprofit called Sesame Workshopto produce a show called \"Ahlan Simsim Iraq\" in an effort to \"promote inclusion, mutual respect and understanding across ethnic, religious and sectarian groups.\" Several more examplesof questionable spending have been uncovered at USAID, including more than $900,000 to a \"Gaza-based terror charity\" called Bayader Association for Environment and Development and a $1.5 million program slated to \"advance diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia's workplaces and business communities.\" Fox News Digitalpreviously reportedthat nearly 15,000 grants worth $60 billion are set to be eliminated, according to internal documents. The grants amount to about 90% of foreign aid contracts and come after a review on spending by the State Department. DOGE's efforts at USAID did not come without opposition, including a federal judge in Maryland who ruled that the moves were unconstitutional. In March, a federal appealscourt grantedthe Trump administration's motion to extend a stay allowing DOGE to continue operating at USAID. On the campaign trail and since taking office, President Trump has made it clear he aims to slash DEI spending in the federal government while making the case that a system of meritocracy should be the focus. DOGE SLASHES 'WASTEFUL' 'PROBLEM-SOLVING' CONTRACT WORTH $50K IN LATEST ROUND OF ELIMINATIONS DOGE leader Elon Musk has been hit with 96% negative coverage on ABC, NBC and CBS evening newscasts, according to the Media Research Center.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) DOGE has announced over the last few months that it has cut hundreds of millions in DEI contracts. Earlier this month,DOGE announcedit had worked with the U.S. National Science Foundation to cancel 402 \"wasteful\" diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) grants, which will save $233 million, including $1 million for \"Antiracist Teacher Leadership for Statewide Transformation.\" The Department of Defense could save up to $80 million in wasteful spending by cutting loose a handful of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, the agencyannounced last month. The Defense Department has been working with the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in slashing wasteful spending, DOD spokesman Sean Parnell said in a video posted to social media. Parnell listed some of the initial findings flagged by DOGE, much of it consisting of millions of dollars given to support various DEI programs, including $1.9 million for holistic DEI transformation and training in the Air Force and $6 million to the University of Montana to \"strengthen American democracy by bridging divides.\" The Trump administration announced earlier this month it isslashing millions of dollarsin DEI grants from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) as part of its overall DOGE push. DAVID MARCUS: WHAT AMERICA OWES ELON MUSK AFTER DOGE President Donald Trump gestures to the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference, CPAC, at the Gaylord National Resort &amp; Convention Center, Saturday, Feb. 22, 2025, in Oxon Hill, Md.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) In February, the Department of Education (DOE)said it is cancelingmore than $100 million in grants to DEI training as part of DOGE's efforts. DOGE has made efforts to cut federal spending by cutting the federal workforce, which it argues has become bloated with many employees doing jobs that are unnecessary or could be streamlined. In February, DOGEterminated employmentfor 3,600 probationary Health and Human Services employees in a cut it says is estimated to save about $600 million in taxpayer dollars annually. FOX Business reportedin early April that over the previous two months,DOGE's cutbackshave been attributed to 280,253 layoffs of federal workers and contractors at 27 agencies, according to Challenger tracking. There were an additional 4,429 job cuts attributed to the downstream effect of cutting federal aid and ending contracts, mostly at nonprofits and health organizations. Roughly 75,000 federal employees accepted a deferred resignation program,Fox News Digital reportedin February, which DOGE has argued will save the government money in the long run. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), inspired by DOGE's crackdown on federal spending, said it had located $20 billion in tax dollars within the agency that the Biden administration reportedly \"knew they were wasting.\" \"An extremely disturbing video circulated two months ago, featuring a Biden EPA political appointee talking about how they were ‘tossing gold bars off the Titanic,’ rushing to get billions of your tax dollars out the door before Inauguration Day,\" EPA administrator Lee Zeldin said in a video posted to X on Wednesday,citing another videofrom December. The EPA found that just eight agencies were controlling the distribution of tens of billions of taxpayer dollars to different entities \"at their discretion,\" such as the Climate United Fund, which reportedly received just under $7 billion.

    "article_text": "The president said the jet would be ‘the most advanced, most capable, most lethal aircraft ever built.’ PresidentDonald Trumpunveiled new plans Tuesday to swap out the retiring A-10 Warthog aircraft based out of Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan with 21 brand-new F-15EX Eagle II fighter jets. Trump shared details of the new fighter jet mission during a speech to National Guard members at the Michigan base for an event commemorating his 100th day in office. Selfridge will become the fourth military installation to operate the fighter jet, which entered operational service in July 2024. \"Fresh off the line. That means they are brand new,\" Trump said. \"They've never been anywhere. This is where they're going to be for a long time. And I saw one of them, flew over my head, and I said, ‘What the hell is that?’ That plane has serious power. So, this is the best there is anywhere in the world, the F-15EX Eagle II.

The fighter jet is an updated version of the F-15C Eagle aircraft the Air Force introduced in 1989 and features bolstered fuel efficiency, radar and avionics, according to the Air National Guard. The jet is designed to work alongside other Air Force aircraft, including the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II fighter jets. \"America's military will soon be stronger and more powerful than ever before, and Selfridge Air National Guard Base will remain at the center of the action,\" Trump said.

While Congress put a stop to former PresidentBarack Obama'sadministration's attempts to retire the aircraft, Trump's first administration called to keep the aircraft in service. Former PresidentJoe Biden'sadministration moved to start retiring the aircraft more aggressively in 2023.

However, the Trump administration revived the program. \"I’m thrilled to announce that, at my direction, the United States Air Force is moving forward with the world’s first sixth-generation fighter jet,\" Trump said in March. \"Nothing in the world comes even close to it, and it’ll be called the F-47.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke with Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill about President Donald Trump's greatest accomplishments during the first 100 days of his second term. (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy and Fox News Digital) Tuesday marks PresidentDonald Trump'sfirst 100 days back in the White House, and it's been defined largely by the nearly 140 executive orders he has signed. The eye-popping number is all the starker when compared to the number of laws passed by Congress and signed by the commander in chief – just five total. Three of those were aimed at repealing Biden administration regulatory policies put in place during the previous four years. Another item includes the stopgap government funding extension passed in March to avoid a partial federal shutdown. MEET THE TRUMP-PICKED LAWMAKERS GIVING SPEAKER JOHNSON A FULL HOUSE GOP CONFERENCE President Trump's executive orders have far outpaced Congress' lawmaking.(Reuters) And the first bill signed into law by Trump – and the only item of new policy on the list – is the Laken Riley Act. It's a landmark new law that allows Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to take into custody any illegal immigrant who has been charged with theft or other crimes. But so far, Trump has largely acted alone in his endeavors, with executive orders aimed at dismantling the Department of Education, keeping transgender women out of biological women's spaces, and others. In comparison, Congress passed 30 bills that were signed into law by Trump in the first 100 days of his first term. The first 100 days of the Biden, Obama and Bush administrations saw 11, 14, and seven laws signed, respectively. Two Trump allies in Congress, Reps.

I'd give Congress a D.\" \"Congress needs to reciprocate the kind of bold vision and courage that Trump has taken, particularly with DOGE,\" Burlison said. Meanwhile, Democrats have accused congressional Republicans of giving up their power to Trump with his flurry of executive actions. \"I believe now is the time for Congress to reassert the constitutional authority it continues to cede to the executive branch,\" Rep.

So as we make these reforms and as we cancel future contracts that we don't believe were within the original intent or mission of the program, or the USDA, or the government, you're going to hear the Democrats and the left basically start, you know, yelping about how we hate children and old people and we're stealing the food out of their mouths.

    "article_text": "The secretary calls it the \"No More Walking On Eggshells\" policy. Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethannounced that he had \"proudly ended\" the Women, Peace and Security program at the Pentagon on Tuesday, a program signed into law by PresidentDonald Trumpin his first term. \"WPS is yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops – distracting from our core task: WAR-FIGHTING,\" Hegseth wrote in a post on X. \"WPS is a UNITED NATIONS program pushed by feminists and left-wing activists. Politicians fawn over it; troops HATE it.\" Hegseth said the department would comply with the minimum requirements of the program dictated by law and lobby to fully end it in the next budget. \"GOOD RIDDANCE WPS!\" he added. HEGSETH VOWS CRACKDOWN ON MILITARY OBESITY AFTER SHOCKING RESERVE, GUARD REPORT The Women, Peace and Security program was implemented across departments in 2019.(U.S. Army photo by Cpl. Clay Beyersdorfer) But the message raised eyebrows as much of the rest of Trump’s administration has supported the WPS programs. Trump signed the WPS Act into law in 2017 andreleased a WPS strategy in 2019. Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noempenned the 2017 Women, Peace and Security Act as a House member from South Dakota alongside Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.). Secretary of State Marco Rubio co-sponsored the legislation when he was in the Senate, and national security advisor Mike Waltz was a founding member of the WPS congressional caucus when he was in the House. \"The WPS Strategy recognizes the diverse roles women play as agents of change in preventing and resolving conflict, countering terrorism and violent extremism, and building post conflict peace and stability,\" the strategy read. Hegseth later clarified that he meant the Biden administration had \"ruined\" WPS. \"The woke & weak Biden Administration distorted & weaponized the straight-forward & security-focused WPS initiative launched in 2017. So—yes—we are ending the \"woke divisive/social justice/Biden (WPS) initiative,\" he added in a follow-up post on X. \"Biden ruined EVERYTHING, including 'Women, Peace & Security.'\" The White House could not be reached for comment on whether it still supported the program. EX-PENTAGON AIDE URGES TRUMP TO FIRE HEGSETH, CITING 'FULL-BLOWN MELTDOWN' AND 'TOTAL CHAOS' Hegseth said he would work to undo the WPS program.(FRANCO BRANA/AFP via Getty Images) \"The WPS Strategy seeks to increase women’s meaningful leadership in political and civic life by helping to ensure they are empowered to lead and contribute, equipped with the necessary skills and support to succeed, and supported to participate through access to opportunities and resources,\" the Trump-era strategy read. It guided WPS plans at the Defense, State and Homeland Security departments as well as USAID. \"Around the world, conflict and disasters adversely and disproportionately affect women and girls, yet women remain under-represented in efforts to prevent and resolve conflict, and in post-conflict peacebuilding or recovery efforts. Research has shown that peace negotiations are more likely to succeed, and result in lasting stability, when women participate,\" the document went on. Trump promoted the program on his\"Women for Trump\" accomplishments pageof his campaign website. The Women, Peace and Security Act originated with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 in 2000, and the U.S. became the first country to adopt a whole-of-government approach to undertaking the WPS agenda in 2019. Trump signed the WPS Act into law in 2017.(Donald Trump 2024 campaign) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Rubio touted the legislation as recently as this month. \"President Trump also signed the Women, Peace, and Security Act, a bill that I was very proud to have been a co-sponsor of when I was in the Senate, and it was the first comprehensive law passed in any country in the world – the first law passed by any country anywhere in the world — focused on protecting women and promoting their participation in society,\" he said at a Women of Courage awards ceremony on April 1.",

Alzheimer’s diseasenow affects more than seven million people in the U.S., and nearly four in five Americans say they would want to know if they have it before symptoms emerge. This data comes from the Alzheimer’s Association's annual report, titled \"Alzheimer’s Disease Facts and Figures.\" \"For a long time, it was like, ‘Oh, I wouldn’t want to find out.’ And so knowing that people can do more now is making a difference in the stigma,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Edgerly, senior director for Community Programs and Services for the Alzheimer’s Association, in an interview with Fox News Digital. EXERCISE CAN PREVENT COGNITIVE DECLINE EVEN WHEN ENERGY LAGS, RESEARCHERS DISCOVER Edgerly was referring to the advancement of technology that allows for earlyAlzheimer’s detection, making testing more accessible than ever. \"People struggle to try to figure out: Is that normal aging, or something we should get checked out?\" an expert said.(iStock) Traditionally, pre-symptom Alzheimer's testing has involved costly, invasive methods like PET scans and spinal taps. And when it comes tosenior health, it can be difficult to determine the level of urgency in potential red flags, according to Edgerly. \"We’re trying to get to the place where cancer is today — more openness, support and survivorship.\" \"People struggle to try to figure out: Is that normal aging, or something we should get checked out?\" Another obstacle is that testing can take a very long time. \"That process can take months or even years to get to the point where someone has a definitive diagnosis,\" Edgerly said. A new blood test can predict the likelihood of Alzheimer’s developing in a person before symptoms begin, the expert said.(iStock) The introduction of anew blood test— one that can predict the likelihood of Alzheimer’s developing in a person before symptoms begin — makes the process a lot less daunting, the expert noted. \"It’s much more common, more affordable, more accessible.\" RETIREMENT COULD BE BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH, SAYS WELLNESS EXPERT: 'POWERED BY PURPOSE' The growing desire for transparency could also be related to the sharp rise in caregiving costs and the labor of caregiving itself. The national cost of caring for those with Alzheimer's and other dementias is projected to reach $384 billion in 2025 — up $24 billion from just a year ago, according to the Alzheimer's Association.

The threat ofultraprocessed food consumptionis in the spotlight amid the U.S. government's plans to phase out artificial food dyes. New researchis supporting this movement, revealing that foods in this category are linked to premature deaths in eight countries. The study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, focused on the risk of all-cause mortality and the \"epidemiologic burden\" from ultraprocessed food consumption. FOOD DYES TO BE PHASED OUT BY TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IN LATEST ROUND OF BANS The meta-analysis of observational cohort studies, conducted from November 2023 to July 2024, looked at people with low consumption ofultraprocessed foodsin Colombia and Brazil, intermediate consumption in Chile and Mexico, and high consumptions in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and Canada. The researchers found an association between ultraprocessed foods and all-cause mortality in all eight countries, varying from 4% risk in Colombia to 14% risk in the U.K. and U.S. New research confirms that ultraprocessed foods are linked to increased risk of all-cause mortality.(iStock) \"The findings support that ultraprocessed food intake contributes significantly to the overall burden of disease in many countries, and its reduction should be included innational dietary guidelinerecommendations and addressed in public policies,\" the researchers concluded. 3 FOOD SWAPS TO MAKE RIGHT NOW FOR BETTER HEALTH AND NUTRITION, SAYS DOCTOR In a statement sent to Fox News Digital, study co-author Eduardo A.F. Nilson, a food and nutrition researcher in Brazil, shared how the evidence of health risks connected to ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) has \"increased significantly over the last decade.\" \"UPF consumption has been associated with 32 adverse health outcomes, including obesity,cardiovascular disease, diabetes and even mental health issues,\" he listed. \"UPF consumption has been associated with 32 adverse health outcomes, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and even mental health issues.\" \"Our estimates show that the magnitude of the impact of UPFs onall-cause mortalityis relevant in all countries involved in the analysis, especially in those where they are predominant in the diets, such as the U.S. and the U.K.\" The difference between countries with \"lower, yet increasing\" UPF consumption and those with higher consumption suggests that \"large impacts on preventable deaths could be potentially achieved by reducing UPF consumption.\" \"What's in them that's allowing them to stay in your pantry for a couple of years?\" one doctor questioned about ultraprocessed foods.(iStock) In a previous interview with Fox News Digital in New York City, WebMD Chief Medical Officer Dr. John Whyte shared a word of caution about ultraprocessed food exposure.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to discuss the ‘amazing’ brain-implant technology that uses thought to provide movement. Brad Smith, an Arizona husband and father with ALS, has become the third person to receive Neuralink, the brain implant made byElon Musk’scompany. He is also the first ALS patient and the first non-verbal person to receive the implant, he shared in a post on X on Sunday. \"I am typing this with my brain. It is my primary communication,\" Smith, who was diagnosed in 2020, wrote in the post, which was also shared by Musk. He went on to thank Musk. Smith is completely paralyzed and relies on a ventilator to breathe. He created a video using thebrain-computer interface(BCI) to control the mouse on his MacBook Pro, he stated. \"This is the first video edited with [Neuralink], and maybe the first edited with a BCI,\" he said. \"Neuralink has given me freedom, hope and faster communication.\" The video was narrated by Smith’s \"old voice,\" he said, which was cloned byartificial intelligencefrom recordings before he lost the use of his voice. \"I want to explain how Neuralink has impacted my life and give you an overview of how it works,\" he said. An Arizona husband and father with ALS has become the third person to receive Neuralink, the brain implant made by Elon Musk’s company.(Getty Images) ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis),also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, according to The ALS Association. Over time, the disease impairs muscle control until the patient becomes paralyzed. ALS is ultimately fatal, with an average life expectancy of three years, although 10% of patients can survive for 10 years and 5% live 20 years or longer. HOW ELON MUSK'S NEURALINK BRAIN CHIP WORKS Neuralink, which is about 1.75 inches thick, was implanted in Smith’s motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls body movement. The implanted device captures neuron firings in the brain and sends a raw signal to the computer. Neuralink is made by Elon Musk's company of the same name.(Getty Images) \"AI processes this data on a connected MacBook Pro to decode my intended movements in real time to move the cursor on my screen,\" Smith said. \"Neuralink has given me freedom, hope and faster communication,\" he added. \"It hasimproved my lifeso much.

He has answered our prayers in unexpected ways. He has blessed my kids and our family. So I'm learning to trust that God knows what he is doing.\" The wireless device was implanted in Smith’s motor cortex, the part of the brain that controls body movement.(iStock) Smith also said he is grateful that he gets to work with the \"brilliant people\" at Neuralink and do \"really interesting work.\" \"Don't get me wrong, ALS still really sucks, but I am talking about the big picture,\" he said. \"The big picture is, I am happy.\" Dr. Mary Ann Picone, medical director of the MS Center at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, New Jersey, applauded Neuralink's capabilities.

But Johnson's teammates supported Petgrave,with one saying there\"isn't a chance that it's deliberate.\" Debate also sparked about hockey player protection on the ice, and the English Ice Hockey Association quickly mandated neck protection for all players.

Kittle, 31, announced the deal on the \"Bussin’ With The Boys\" podcast on Tuesday.

Throughout his eight-year career, Kittle has been a great all-around tight end and emerged as a leader in the 49ers locker room. \"In 2017, our first year with the 49ers, we selected a skinny tight end from Iowa whom we were really excited about.

    "title": "Co-founder 'not proud' to host fundraiser for alleged track meet murder suspect, says some donors are 'wrong'",
    "article_text": "GiveSendGo co-founder Jacob Wells spoke to Fox News Digital about his platform hosting a fundraiser for alleged murderer Karmelo Anthony after a deadly incident at a track meet. EXCLUSIVE:More than $514,000has been donatedto the \"Help Karmelo Anthony Official Fund\" on the crowd-sourcing site GiveSendGo.com. This half-million-dollar sum is the result of analleged murderthat occurred at a track meet in Frisco, Texas, on April 2. The victim was 17-year-old Austin Metcalf of Memorial High School, who died in a deadly stabbing. The suspect, 17-year-old Karmelo Anthony of Centennial High School, was just released from jail on bond after lawyers reduced his bail from $1 million. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Anthony has told police that he \"did it\" – meaning the murder – but has claimed it was in self-defense. He has been charged withfirst-degree murder. Now, GiveSendGo is leading in online fundraising for the Anthony's family legal expenses. Other major crowd-sourcing platforms, including GoFundMe and Kickstarter, have not platformed a campaign for Anthony on their sites. But GiveSendGo co-founder Jacob Wells and his leadership team are featuring Anthony's campaign. \"How proud am I of this campaign? I don't, I wouldn't say I'm proud at all,\" Wells told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. \"I have no pride in having this being on GiveSendGo. I just have appreciation for what GiveSendGo is doing in the midst of these tragic moments, which is standing on principle, which is loving people even in the midst of very hard and dark places.\" Wells admitted that there have been other campaigns on his site, like a foster home for boys fundraiser, that he is proud of. But Anthony's fundraiser is not one of those. Wells claimed his company has only ever removed campaigns for causes deemed \"illegal,\" or raising money under false pretenses. He says he's taken down a fundraiser for fraudulently raising money for travel expenses while the organizer intended to use the money to buy a gun. Wells declined to directly say whether there were any conversations about removing the campaign, but insists that \"pretty much\" everyone involved in leadership at the company has been supportive of platforming it. Wells compared the Anthony fund to the one his platform hosted for Kyle Rittenhouse in 2020. That effort raised over $250,000 after Rittenhouse shot three men in Kineshoa, Wisconsin, during the Jacob Blake riots. But now Anthony's campaign has raised more than twice that number, and is looking for more. As Wells and his colleagues have faced backlash and death threats, he said he's had a conversation about donating the profits of the fundraiser to the Metcalf family to try and make a point that they aren't just platforming Anthony's fund for financial gain. SLAIN TEXAS TEEN AUSTIN METCALF’S HOME SWATTED HOURS AFTER TENSE PRESS CONFERENCE SHOWDOWN Wells has also paid special attention to this campaign in recent weeks, as it's been one of the biggest and most notorious his platform has ever hosted. He's gone out of his way to take note of the types of people who are donating, and why they are donating. And to him, some of these people are donating for the \"wrong reasons.\" \"There will always be people who are donating for the wrong reasons, on any campaign. There are people that believe the best way forward is racial division. That's what they believe. So they're going to stoke the flames of racial division however they can,\" Wells said. \"When you live in free societies, which we do, there's a price to pay, and that is it allows for some people to do things that might not be good. And I think people do that all the time.\" Wells pointed specifically to \"championing a racial narrative\" as the wrong reason for wanting to donate to the campaign, when asked. \"When someone is championing a racial narrative that is divisive and not unifying, then I would claim that that's a wrong reason to be donating. And there are people that have donated that are making claims that are divisive and not unifying. And those are in some of the comments. \" Unfortunately, in free societies, people can say stuff that is divisive and not unifying,\" Wells said. \"They go both ways too. We've seen people who have made donations because donating is a way for you to comment on the campaign page… you have people that are on the other side of the aisle and they'll donate the minimum $5 donation just so they can post a comment being derogatory to the Anthony family.\" Still, Wells claims that the \"overwhelming majority\" of engagement on the fundraiser has not been \"derogatory.\" Wells declined to point to any specific comments that represent the \"wrong\" reasons. However, some public comments reviewed by Fox News Digital reflect Wells' \"racial narrative\" reference. \"Honestly, even if Karmelo stabbed Austin for no reason at all, I'd still donate and support. Whites have gotten away with killing us for hundreds of years. I could care less about White lives,\" read a comment with 53 likes. TEEN SUSPECT FREE ON BOND AFTER ALLEGEDLY STABBING TEXAS TRACK STAR AUSTIN METCALF TO DEATH Wells blamed \"right-wing outrage\" for driving support to the fundraiser. \"The outrage of the right has fueled the response of the other side,\" Wells said, adding that he saw similar patterns occur due to the left-wing response to the Rittenhouse fund and when his site hosted a campaign to support Daniel Penny after killing Jordan Neely in defense of New York City subway riders in 2023. Representatives for the Anthony family have referenced race while comparing Anthony's situation to Rittenhouse's and Penny's. Next Generation Action Network (NGAN) president Dominique Alexander made the comparison at a press conference on April 17. \"Because these racist bigots try to prevent us from standing up for our baby, our boy, he should be afforded the same rights that Kyle Rittenhouse had, Daniel Penny and all the people who have claimed whatever their defense was – he should be afforded the same right,\" Alexander said. Anthony was recentlymoved from his hometo an \"undisclosed location to ensure his immediate safety\" following an \"alarming increase in death threats, continued harassment, and physical intimidation targeted at the family's home,\" NGAN said in a statement last week. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Meanwhile, the Metcalf family has been victims of swatting in recent weeks, the Frisco Police Department (FPD)previously confirmed. Swatting is when a 911 call is made, usually to report a fake violent crime, to get police and sometimes even SWAT teams, to respond to the address given by the caller. Metcalf's father, Jeff Metcalf, previously toldFox News, \"I want to clarify something right off to start because I've already heard some rumors and gossip. This was not a race thing. This is not a political thing. \"Do not politicize this. It's not … this is a human being thing.

Former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason unloaded onShedeur Sanderson Monday following his dramatic slide in the 2025 NFL Draft, claiming that several teams took the former Colorado quarterback off their draft board because owners did not want an \"entitled person\" on their roster. Sanders was drafted by theCleveland Brownsin the fifth round of the draft with the 144th overall pick.

His attitude off the field – all those bad meetings that he had at the combine. His dad didn’t help him either,\" Esiason said on Monday’s episode of the \"Boomer and Gio\" show. \"I mean, he’s very high on himself and I think he was very off-putting to many coaches and general managers in the league. And I’m telling you right now, and I know this after talking to three different personnel people in the NFL this weekend, they didn’t even have him on their board. They took him off and they took him off because the owner said ‘Take him off, I don’t want that guy. I don’t want this kind of person in our – this entitled person on our team.’\" Boomer Esiason, former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback, waives before being announced at halftime as a Bengals Ring of Champions inductee at halftime of the NFL game between the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams at Paycor Stadium in Cincinnati on Monday, Sept. 25, 2023.(IMAGN) NFL NETWORK'S KYLE BRANDT SLAMS MEDIA OVER SHEDUER SANDERS DRAFT COVERAGE Sanders faced significant criticism in the lead up to last week’s draft. One longtime NFL assistant coach recently told theNFL Networkthat Sanders was \"the worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life.\" \"He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates,\" the coach continued. \"But the biggest thing is, he's not that good.\" Sanders was a projected first-round pick. Among the projected landing spots were theNew York Giants,who had the third overall pick, and the New Orleans Saints, who had the No. 9 pick. When both teams moved in different directions, the Pittsburgh Steelers at No. 21 seemed like the next viable option, but Sanders' name again remained on the board.

When you listen to the way he was talking about himself, some of the actions that you’ve seen on the field in terms of his interactions with other players, shoving a referee in the back, building his own draft room, legendary, having all this crap hanging off – I mean, this is basically a wake-up call to I think a lot of these athletes.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Sanders was thought by most NFL Draft experts to be picked in the first round, which is why so many NFL fans and analysts alike were surprised that he fell to the fifth round. \"I didn’t think it was a bit of a shock. I thought that the NFL spoke, the draft spoke and said, ‘Hey, we don’t have a first-round grade on this kid’ and that’s OK,\" George said during a recent appearance on OutKick’s \"Don’t @ Me with Dan Dakich.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Colorado Buffalos quarterback Shedeur Sanders looks on prior to the game against the Arizona Wildcats at Arizona Stadium in Tucson, Arizona, on Oct. 19, 2024.(Mark J.

He’s a phenomenal talent, but when you do your due diligence, and you vet these kids out, and you have the combine, you have the personal interviews, some things come out that are consistent. And was consistent was that they felt that he wasn’t a starting quarterback right now.\" TheCleveland Browns, despite taking Oregon quarterback Dillon Gabriel with their third-round pick, selected Sanders with their fifth-round pick, the 144th overall pick in the NFL Draft. George said that Sanders’ draft slide will turn into his \"finest hour.\" \"I think this will be Shedeur’s finest hour. He has an opportunity now to go and compete for the job and show people that, hey, you missed out on a big opportunity. You know, I tell kids all the time it’s not how you start in the NFL, it’s how you finish. So he got his foot in the door, he got drafted, he’s got an opportunity to compete. Now it’s up to him to show and prove people wrong how they missed out on him,\" George said.

I know a lot of people figure that he is arrogant and not serious, but I had the opportunity to coach against that kid and he can spin it.

A pair of former UPenn women's swimmers who went through the experience of sharing a pool and locker room with Thomas opened up on what the recent declaration by PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration means to them. Conservative influencer Paula Scanlan, who was one of the first of Thomas' teammates to speak up against the school, told Fox News Digital that the news \"excited\" her, but she is also skeptical of its impact. \"I was excited to hear that the Department of Education is cracking down on the University of Pennsylvania. Ultimately, though, I’m skeptical that my alma mater will take meaningful action.

The government’s finding of sex discrimination by Penn is an important first step, but the protection of female athletes cannot stop here. Women must be protected by a bulletproof policy that completely removes men from our sports and from entering our locker rooms,\" Estabrook said. HOW TRANSGENDERISM IN SPORTS SHIFTED THE 2024 ELECTION AND IGNITED A NATIONAL COUNTERCULTURE \"Future generations of girls and women must be safeguarded against the hideous emotional and sexual harassment that my teammates and I endured at Penn. The current policy which Penn and the NCAA are now trying to use to cover their tracks and put this issue behind them is inept, and it continues to leave women vulnerable. I and my teammates who are suing Penn, Harvard, the Ivy League, and the NCAA, will not be appeased by half measures that fail to fully protect women.\" TheEducation Department’sOffice for Civil Rights said it will give the university 10 days to be in compliance with Title IX or risk facing a criminal referral to theJustice Department. The compliance would include issuing a statement on its intention to follow Title IX along with two other key actions. \"Restore to all female athletes all individual athletic records, titles, honors, awards or similar recognition for Division I swimming competitions misappropriated by male athletes competing in female categories. \"Send a letter to each female athlete whose individual recognition is restored expressing an apology on behalf of the University for allowing her educational experience in athletics to be marred by sex discrimination.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the University of Pennsylvania for comment.

As the length of games has significantly shrunk in recent years, Major League Baseball sawincreased attendance in back-to-back yearsfor the first time since the early 2010s in the last two seasons.

I think if you can have an impact like that as a player, you should do it.\" So, in order to do that, Yelich, Dodgers star pitcher Dustin May, and Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson teamed up with DirecTV, whose \"Nothing On Your Roof\" campaign with the MLB stars is telling potential providers that dishes are no longer necessary to enjoy ball games. Yelich, May and Swanson star in the commercial for the campaign where there is nothing on their roofs – in this case, their heads. Each wore bald caps, which is quite the look for the long-haired May. \"I like my hair, and I have a lot of it, and then they wanted to do the Nothing On Your Roof, and I thought it was really cool twist on things,\" the 27-year-old May, who began growing it out as a junior in high school, said. \"I was excited to be a part of the commercial to kind of boost that they don't need anything on your roof to be able to broadcast baseball.\" For Kelly Jo Sands, DirecTV's senior vice president of digital and marketing, the campaign hits close to home, as her 103-year-old grandfather is a die-hard Brewers fan. \"They're fun and really quirky personalities. We thought they'd give us a lot to work with for the brand, Sands said of the MLB stars,\" and the dynamic with them has been delightful.\" \"It's the national pastime. There's a sense of pride in this country for baseball.

People are able to watch baseball, access Major League Baseball games without having to have satellite. I think it was a unique way for DirecTV to get that message across, putting us in bald caps and the Nothing On Your Roof campaign. I didn't really know how I’d look bald and stuff, but I thought that was a cool part because it looked so realistic. Once they finished with all the hair and makeup stuff, it was a lot of fun.\" \"So being able to partner up with DirecTV with this campaign, show baseball fans that they can consume Brewers games, Major League Baseball games without satellites, it was an easy decision to do the commercial.\" Milwaukee Brewers' Christian Yelich follows the flight of his solo home run off Colorado Rockies starting pitcher Chad Kuhl, Sept. 6, 2022, in Denver.(AP Photo/David Zalubowski) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As for continuing to grow the game, \"We're here to put out a good image,\" added May. \"So people want to come back and want to watch.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.",

    "article_text": "Archaeologists in Brussels, Belgium, recently came across the remnants of an old cemetery located in a busy part of the city. The remains date back to the Middle Ages. (Source: @mijnmivb via Facebook) Archaeologists recently announced the discovery of over 100 buried horses dating back toancient Rome– but the skeletons weren't found in Italy. The excavation took place at Bad Cannstatt, a borough insouthwestern Germany, said an April 16 press release from the Baden-Württemberg State Office for Monument Preservation (LAD). The statement, translated from German to English, noted the town was one of the region's \"most important Roman military sites\" in ancient times. A cavalry unit there boasted around 700 horses at its peak. HISTORIC MARYLAND CHURCH OPENS DOORS TO VISITORS 320 YEARS AFTER CLOSING DOWN Pictures from the site show horse skeletons buried in the soil as excavators worked to clear them. The excavationbegan last July, spurred by recent construction projects that \"necessitated archaeological investigations,\" according to LAD. Archaeologists discovered over 100 horse skeletons at the German site. The scientists believe the horses were brought there over time as opposed to dying in a single battle.(State Office for Monument Preservation in the Stuttgart Regional Council/ArchaeoBW.) Experts say the remains are just under 2,000 years old, dating back to the second century A.D. \"The first horse bones discovered were dated to the second century using the radiocarbon method,\" said Sarah Roth, an archaeologist at LAD. \"Based on the archaeological and historical knowledge of Roman Bad Cannstatt, the horses can be attributed to the cavalry unit - a so-called 'Ala' - stationed at Hallschlag from around 100 to 150 AD.\" She also noted that \"the troop of nearly 500 riders likely had a total horse stock of at least 700 animals, with losses needing constant replacement.\" LONG-LOST CAPITAL OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION MAY HAVE FINALLY BEEN UNCOVERED, ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY: 'UNIQUE FIND' The horseswere buried roughly a quarter of a mile away from the cavalry fort and one-eighth of a mile away from civilian residences. \"The carcasses were usually dragged individually into shallow pits, where they were buried lying on their side with legs extended or bent,\" LAD explained in the statement. \"The site was likely marked above ground. Despite a sometimes dense arrangement, there were few overlaps of the pits.\" The horse remains discovered by archaeologists date back to the second century A.D.(State Office for Monument Preservation in the Stuttgart Regional Council/ArchaeoBW) Roth added that the horses did not appear to die during a single event, such as a battle. Rather, the animals were probably ill or injured when they were buried, or may have been otherwise unfit for military service. For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"If the horse could still walk, it would have been brought to the horse cemetery and killed on site to avoid transporting the heavy carcass,\" she said. Archaeologists believethe cemetery sitewas more extensive than the construction site itself, but its exact size is unknown. There have been several ancient Roman grave discoveries in the past year. Interestingly, some horses were buried together with items, perhaps as tokens for the journey to the afterlife. One animal was found with two jugs and a small oil lamp, and the items were \"placed in the crook of its arm as a farewell.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER \"Here we see a particularly close bond between the owner and his horse,\" Roth said. \"Even after around 1800 years, the grief over the death of this one animal is still evident.\" There have been several ancient Roman grave discoveries in the past year.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says opening emails is safe, but risks arise from interacting with links, attachments or HTML content. We've all been there: Trying to clean out our inbox only to find that the same sketchy emails keep showing up, even after clicking \"unsubscribe.\" Robert from Danville, Virginia, wrote in with a question that many of us can relate to. \"When you unsubscribe to a junk email that you know you didn't authorize, do you really unsubscribe and no longer get [emails]? I scroll to the bottom of the email and process the 'unsubscribe' function and even block the email using the block option within my email. Seems the same emails reappear. Is unsubscribing worth my time? Any remedies?\" he wrote. Robert, you're not alone in asking this, and the trust is more complicated (and frustrating) than you might think. While unsubscribing can work in some cases, there are situations where it might actually make things worse. Let's break down when it's safe to unsubscribe, when it's not and what you can do instead to take back control of your inbox.

Beware of scammers(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Unsubscribing isn't always safe, especially with spam. If an email is from a legitimate business, like a store you bought something from or a newsletter you signed up for, it's usually OK to unsubscribe. These companies are bound by email marketing laws and will typically remove you. However, emails that you never signed up for are completely different. Here are the key differences. Legit email Spam/scam email Email app on smartphone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO STOP PROMOTIONAL EMAILS WHERE YOU CAN’T UNSUBSCRIBE Not all unsubscribe links are safe. In fact, clicking on one in a suspicious email can make things worse by signaling to spammers that your address is active. Avoid clicking unsubscribe if: In these cases, clicking unsubscribe might invite even more junk mail instead of stopping it. THE ‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ EMAIL SCAM IS TARGETING AMERICANS Here's what you should do instead to counteract spam. 1) Mark it as spam or phishing:Every email provider (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, etc.) has a \"report spam\" button. Use it. This feature trains your inbox to recognize and filter future junk. It also helps others by flagging known spam sources all while not tipping off the spammer. 2) Block the sender (but know it's temporary):Blocking a sender can help, but temporarily, because spammers often use rotating addresses. It's a continuous game, but it still has short-term value. How to block senders on major email platforms: 3) Use your email’s built-in alias or disposable tools:Before switching to a third-party service, it’s worth checking what your current email provider already offers. Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo have handy tricks for separating junk from legit messages without signing up for anything new. Here’s how it works with the major platforms. This trick is great for organizing your inbox, tracking how your email is being used and filtering out spam before it becomes a problem. Check out the full how-to guide here:How to create a disposable email address. Gmail on a tablet(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 4) Upgrade to a spam-killer inbox service:Anonymous email tricks are a smart move, but if you want full control over spam, privacy and organization, a dedicated alias email service is the way to go. Analias email addressis an additional address that forwards to your primary inbox. It lets you receive messages without ever exposing your real email. By using different aliases for online sign-ups, shopping, newsletters and more, you can easily manage incoming mail and instantly shut off spam by deleting an alias whenever needed. Creating multiple aliases also protects your real email address from being flooded with junk or compromised in a data breach. It's one of the easiest ways to stay organized and secure online.

IT'S JUST ANOTHER SNEAKY SCAM 5) Use a burner email service for short-term sign-ups:If you want an extra layer of separation from your personal inbox, burner email services are a great option. They create temporary email addresses you can use for quick sign-ups with no commitment and no spam in your real inbox. Burner emails are especially useful for: You can refer to acomprehensive list of popular temporary email servicesthat generate disposable addresses lasting from minutes to hours, which offer features like anonymous inboxes, attachment support, browser extensions and easy expiration to protect your privacy and reduce spam. DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON'T: HERE'S WHY YOU NEED BOTH Unsubscribing from suspicious emails can do more harm than good, so it’s best to mark them as spam and block the sender instead. Use your email provider’s built-in tools to filter messages and create aliases to track where spam is coming from. For short-term sign-ups, disposable email services are a great way to protect your real inbox.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson talks about how the first nonstop beating heart transplant, called zero ischemic time, at Taiwan hospital changes surgery. For the first time ever, surgeons at National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) successfully performed a heart transplant in which the donor organ never stopped beating. This revolutionary procedure eliminates the traditional pause in blood flow, known as ischemic time, dramatically reducing damage to the heart muscle and improving the chances of a successful transplant. By keeping the heart continuously pumping oxygenated blood throughout the entire process, NTUH has set a new benchmark in cardiac surgery that promises better outcomes for patients worldwide.

A custom organ care system that acts like a portable life-support machine (NTUH)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Traditional heart transplants rely on cold storage, which pauses blood flow to the organ. Even a few hours without oxygen can damage heart muscle, raising the risks of rejection or complications post-surgery. NTUH’s method? A custom organ care system that acts like a portable life-support machine, delivering oxygenated blood to the heart from donor to recipient; no pauses, no cold storage. Custom organ care system illustration (NTUH)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MECHANICAL ARTIFICIAL HEART IS USING HIGH-SPEED RAIL TECH TO KEEP PATIENTS ALIVE Inspired by ECMO life support, NTUH’s organ care system keeps the heart pumping outside the body using a system of pumps, oxygenators and reservoirs. During the first surgery, the team transported a donor heart between operating rooms while it was still beating, hooked up to this device. The recipient, a 49-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy, recovered smoothly and showed remarkably low cardiac enzyme levels, which is a key indicator of heart muscle health. NTUH doctor with the woman who received a new heart via NTUH organ care system (NTUH)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH While Stanford University pioneered \"beating-heart\" transplants in 2023, their method still included brief ischemic periods (10–30 minutes) during organ transfer. NTUH’s zero-ischemic approach? The heart never stopped, not even for a second. \"The hearts were still beating before procurement, continued beating after procurement and never stopped,\" said Chen Yih-shurng, head of NTUH’s organ transplant team. Custom organ care system illustration (NTUH)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) META UNVEILS NEW AR GLASSES WITH HEART RATE MONITORING With two successful transplants under their belt, NTUH aims to refine the organ care system and expand access. Their groundbreaking findings, published in theJournal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery Techniques, could redefine global transplant protocols. As demand for donor hearts outpaces supply, this innovation offers hope for shorter wait lists and healthier recoveries. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES NTUH’s milestone isn’t just about technical prowess, it’s about saving lives. By cutting out ischemic time, they’ve turned \"impossible\" into \"I’m possible.\" For patients awaiting transplants, this breakthrough means stronger donor hearts, fewer complications and a brighter shot at a second chance. As the team puts it, zero ischemic time equals zero unnecessary risks. After learning about this new procedure, do you feel more hopeful about organ transplants? Why or why not?

Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. I watchedDonald Trumpswat at his ear as if being stung by a bee. And then he fell to the ground. I was about to appear on \"The Big Weekend Show\" that hot Saturday afternoon on July 13, 2024, and was watching all of this unfold from the Studio M Green Room at Fox News headquarters in New York. TRUMP STEAMS AHEAD ON THESE CAMPAIGN PROMISES AS HE REACHES 100 DAYS IN OFFICE After what was about a minute, in what felt like hours, I watched as Trump rose to his feet. At that moment, almost anyone, including myself, would have kept their head down and let the Secret Service rush them to the closest vehicle to get the hell out of there. Trump did the opposite. \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\" he declared defiantly with blood on his face, the result of being struck in the ear by a bullet. \"I think he just won the election,\" I said to no one in particular in the Green Room. President Trump survived an assassination attempt on his life in Butler, Pennsylvania in July.(Rebecca Droke/AFP via Getty Images) Two days later, Trump would choose Ohio SenatorJD Vanceto be his running mate. Three days after that, he accepted his party's nomination for the third time. And three days after that,Joe Biden-- at the urging of his own party and George Clooney -- would bow out of the race. Kamala Harris, the most unpopular vice president in polling history and a failed 2020 presidential candidate who didn't even get to 2020 before dropping out, became the nominee instead despite not receiving one vote from the public. 'VIEW' CO-HOST WHO SUPPORTED HARRIS SAYS SHE MADE BIG MISTAKE REACHING OUT TO REPUBLICANS From there, Harris rode a wave of slobbering press through August. At one point, according to the Media Research Center, ABC News did 100 straight \"news\" stories on her campaign where every single one was positive. The network also hosted the one and only debate between Trump and Harris, which ended up being a textbook example of overwhelming bias and dishonesty. ABC's news division is run by Dana Walden, who is not only best friends with Harris, she even set the former vice president up with her current husband, Doug Emhoff. Overall, Trump got fact-checked five times by moderators during his single presidential debate with Harris and was on the receiving end of six follow-up questions. Harris was not fact-checked or followed up with once. Thelegacy mediadeclared Harris the big winner, while I argued on the air that it was incumbent on her to make the sale on her policies, especially the economy. She failed miserably. Her poll numbers would only drift downward from there. But it was the vice-presidential debate that ended up playing a huge role in the election. Harris could have chosen popular as her vice presidential running mate, Gov. Josh Shapiro from the crucial state of Pennsylvania. Instead, Harris went with goofy Minnesota Gov.Tim Walz, the Democratic leader who was best known for allowing Minneapolis to burn to the ground during the George Floyd riots and the guy also known for having tampon machines installed in boys’ bathrooms. JD Vance wiped the floor with Walz that night, who literally looked like a deer in the headlines throughout the debate. It was Trump and Vance who appeared to be normal, all while Harris and Walz looked and sounded, well... weird. EX-VP HARRIS RETURNS TO POLITICS TO HEADLINE DNC FUNDRAISER WITH TICKETS STARTING AT $25,000 Trump also ran an unorthodox campaign by sitting down with podcasters like Joe Rogan for three hours while Harris was running toOprah Winfrey, who was last relevant whenBill Clintonwas in office. Trump would also work a shift at McDonald's, which was ridiculed by legacy media but was a stroke of genius, because it's hard to imagine Hitler donning an apron and working a McDonald's drive-thru. And the photo you see on the cover of my new book this image went viral to non-propensity voters in a way any Harris event couldn't. Trump would go on to win every swing state, with 89% of counties in the U.S. going more red than blue. He also won the popular vote. Republicans took back the Senate and held the House. The greatest comeback ever was complete. In the end, Harris' campaign blew through $1.5 billion in cash in the span of under 100 days and had nothing to show for it. Democrats were (and still are) rudderless and devastated. \"Why will people buy your book if they know how it ends?\" my 9-year-old asked me recently. It was a good question. And this is what I told her: \"We also know how \"Titanic\" ends, yet it made more than $1 billion at the box office in the 90s. Everybody went to go see it because, in my case, I wanted to know the story behind the hows and the whys.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The same thing applies here. In my new book, those \"hows\" and \"whys\" include: - How did Trump overcome 91 felony charges — rogue *judges* and the weaponization of the justice system by the likes of Manhattan D.A.Alvin Braggand New York Attorney General Letitia James and Atlanta D.A. Fani Willis and Special Counsel Jack Smith? - How did the Secret Service and local law-enforcement allow a 20-year-old kid to completely outflank them and get on the one roof with the most perfect line of sight to Trump on that July day in Butler,Pennsylvania? - How did the Secret Service still allow Trump to go out on stage when they knew there was an active threat? - How was no one fired by the Biden administration after trump was almost killed? - How was a second would-be assassin —- Ryan Ruth, able to sit for more than 12 hours in a sniper’s nest near the sixth hole at Trump International Golf Course inFlorida? - Why didn't anyone in the Secret Service check the perimeter? - Why did Harris decide not to join Joe Rogan on his insanely popular podcast — while Trump did for nearly 4 hours? - Why didn’t Harris attend the Al Smith dinner… When theRoman Catholicvote is so critical and the election was considered so tight?

    "title": "ANDREW BATES: Trump killed our economy in just 100 days. Democrats must act now",
    "article_text": "People in Tennessee, Texas, Washington D.C. and Michigan deliberate the Trump Administration's first 100 days in office. Are you better off now than you were 100 days ago? My 401(k) sure as hell isn’t. On January 20, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris left Donald Trump an economy that was outmatching every competitor. In October, The Economist magazine called America’s economy \"the envy of the world,\" praising us for leaving \"other rich countries in the dust.\" But America is nowon trackto have the lowest economic growth and the highest inflation of any leading nation. In January, Trump guaranteed, \"we will turnthe economyaround very quickly,\" \"the United States is going to take off like a rocket ship,\" and \"inflation\" would fall. He also claimed he’d stand up to a wealthy establishment that was taking advantage of middle-class families. TRUMP STEAMS AHEAD ON THESE CAMPAIGN PROMISES AS HE REACHES 100 DAYS IN OFFICE The only promise he kept from those pre-inauguration pledges was to \"turn the economy around very quickly\" -- in the worst way. Trump’s \"rocket ship\" exploded at takeoff. And the only Americans spared from his debris are crony capitalists who are effectively paying himbribes for exemptionsfrom an agenda that is devastating consumers and businesses. It’s been 100 straight days of breaking his word. At the Republican National Convention, Trump said, \"I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately\" and \"drive down prices.\" Democrats have an opportunity to prove to the American people that we are listening to them; that their top priority -- the economic success of their families -- is also our top priority. But we’re all paying higher prices because of the biggest middle-class tax hike in modern history --Trump’s tariffs. By definition, a tariff is a regressive tax that disproportionately hurts the non-wealthy. And Trump admits the revenue the government makes from his tariffs will be redistributed to fellow billionaires through the tax plan congressional Republicans are rushing to pass. SEN. ANGUS KING: A 'DECLARATION OF CONSCIENCE' ON DONALD TRUMP'S 100TH DAY Trump’s tariff taxes are also killing the manufacturing jobs he claimed they would protect - atMack Truck factoriesin Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, atauto plants in Michigan and Indiana, and elsewhere. It’s no surprise that amajorityof American manufacturing workers oppose Trump’s tariffs. At the same time, Trump is knifing the policies that actuallyhadbeen revitalizing American manufacturing, like Biden’s bipartisan China competitiveness law and the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump’s broken promises and self-inflicted economic losses don’t end there. He and congressional Republicans are plotting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act cuts. Trump let the richest man in the world cutSocial Security benefits. Trump’s also slashing the investments that are the lifeblood of our technological and medical innovation edges. All of this is to make room for the tax cuts for the rich that his tariff taxes finance. And even though the rule of law, American courts, and the independence of the Federal Reserve are critical to keeping the United States as the top economy in the world, Trump is eroding all of those pillars. He’s even raging against judges and other leaders he himself nominated, includingSupreme Courtjustices, law enforcement officials, andFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Taken together, Trump is weakening our economy so profoundly that he’s setting-off the deadliest exodus of investment away from America since the 1940s. The dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency -- an anchor of our economic strength thatChinaor Russia would literally kill for -- is in crisis and slipping away. But while most of the country is suffering from this nosedive, Trump and his family are benefitting. They are exploiting their elite private clubs and businesses to sell safety from his economic train wreck -- like immunity from his tariff taxes. This weekend, as polls from NBC News, The Washington Post, ABC News, the Associated Press, and more all backed upFox’s own pollingabout the unpopularity of Trump’s economic record, news broke that his son, Donald Trump Jr. is starting an exclusive new D.C. club literally called \"Executive Branch.\" Politico reports that this club for the \"ultra-rich\" will \"cater to the business and tech moguls who are looking to nurture their relationships with the Trump administration.\" Membership costs $500,000. Days before, Trump himself announced that the top owners of his $TRUMP meme coin would be rewarded with a private dinner at his own D.C. club --generating an estimated $100 millionfor himself. The Trump Crime Family is practically charging businesses for \"protection\" from itself. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION President Trump is double-crossing our nation, rapidly draining the American Dream that every other generation sacrificed to make possible. Which means Democrats have an opportunity to prove to the American people that we are listening to them; thattheirtop priority -- the economic success of their families -- is alsoourtop priority. We’ll do that by opposing Trump’s price-raising middle-class tax hike that funds welfare for the rich. And by fighting to make the American Dream affordable -- lowering costs likehealth care, child care, and elder care by having billionaires and rich special interests pay their fair share in taxes. We’ll get Americans together with a shared national mission tomake our economy strongerthan ever by empowering our middle class and ensuring the industries of the future are falling over themselves to invest and build in America -- not running away, like Trump has them doing. That’s the shake-up we need and deserve. Democrats will also recognize that the way we communicate -- and especially, the way you make people feel -- is just as important as what we have to say. That means going everywhere, both online and geographically, across the country. It means being open about who we are on a personal level and proudly owning that the values we’re advocating for are in line with the best traditions of American culture. SomeDemocrats-- not most, but some -- have mistakenly spent more time tearing America down than lifting it up, and alienating huge swaths of our country with divisive, counter-cultural elitism -- demeaning people of faith or even male voters as a whole. But that is not who we are. There is nothing more American than pushing for aneconomyand society that provides opportunity and respect for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules. Just like there’s nothing more American than ensuring that elected leaders are subject to the rule of law and held accountable when they violate our rights. After getting elected based on false promises, Trump is leeching wealth from the middle class. He’s also breaking the law to steal our freedoms, like the right to a fair trial or to disagree with our government. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Speaking of faith, his behavior reminds me of something I learned growing up in the Moravian Church in Winston-Salem,North Carolina: \"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits.\" The fruits of these 100 days are rotten. So is the political future of congressional Republicans, who continue to choose Trump’s incompetence and corruption over the interests and values of their constituents.

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Trump's first 100 days matter. But the next 100 days will tell the tale of the Trump era",
    "article_text": "People in Tennessee, Texas, Washington D.C. and Michigan deliberate the Trump Administration's first 100 days in office. The key thing to understand about PresidentDonald Trump’saction-packed first 100 days in office is that his base, the 40% or so of the country that loves him, are not only thrilled, they are yelling \"more, more, more,\" as if they were Billy Idol. Meanwhile, the similarly sized group of Americans who detest Trump see in this second term a threat to democracy unfolding that is second to none in history, even Trump’s first term, which was also supposedly a harbinger of fascism. What we have on our hands here, folks, is a good old-fashioned Rorschach test. How Americans feel about Trump today tells us more about them than about Trump’s policies, which for the most part have not reached fruition. STEVE MOORE: 9 TOP TRUMP ECONOMY WINS AFTER HIS FIRST 100 DAYS There is no question that Trump entered office on a high note, with polls showing him at or near 50% approval, and in his first 30 days, a keen focus on the low-hanging fruit of 80/20 issues kept him mostly above water. The actual closing of thesouthern border, for example, something the Biden administration called impossible, has been miraculous, with daily interactions falling in some cases from tens of thousands to dozens. It is likely that no major problem facing the American people has ever been solved so quickly by an incoming president. Likewise, on cultural issues, Trump has done well. Americans do not want men playing in women’s sports and do think thatDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion(DEI) have gone too far. Trump took a hatchet to both lefty policies. As good as things seemed, it was inevitable that as March snow turned to April showers, Trump was going to have to tackle closer issues, harder issues upon which a large majority consensus does not exist. TRUMP STEAMS AHEAD ON THESE CAMPAIGN PROMISES AS HE REACHES 100 DAYS IN OFFICE The biggest of these 50/50 issues is Trump’stariff policies, rolled out on April 2nd, or as the administration called it, Liberation Day. The on-again-off-again tariffs and hectic negotiations sent the major stock market indices flying around like super balls in a fish tank, and media coverage was widely negative. Likewise, on immigration, the closing of the border was a huge hit, but some voters, even those who pulled the lever for Trump, are worried that the deportations are coming too fast, and without enough due process. Put simply, everyone seems to agree we should not letillegal immigrantsin, but what to do once they are here is a much closer question. Even on foreign policy, Trump’s approach to Ukraine has been too coddling of Russia for many Trump critics, and too tolerant ofIsraelfor others. These are also areas that require some convincing by Trump. Here we come to the crux of why the next 100 days will make or break not just Trump’s second term, but likely his entire historical legacy. One of the most difficult positions a politician can be in is when he or she truly believes that a very popular goal can best, or even only, be achieved by far less popular means and this is precisely what we see in all three of Trump’s toughest issues. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Almost everyone wants our small industrial towns to thrive again, but tariffs are a scary way to get there. Almost everyone wants the worst criminals among the ranks of illegal aliens removed, but what if a federal judge says no? Almost everyone wants peace in Ukraine but cutting off aid and lettingVladimir Putinrampage his way to Kiev is off-putting. In the next 100 days, all three of these thorns in Trump’s side will come to some kind of crescendo, with tariffs or deals set to take hold, with mass deportation kicking into full gear, and with a clear answer to whether or not Trump can bring peace toUkraine. The ambition and zeal of the Trump administration’s first 100 days is like nothing in living memory, and given that, as well as an out-of-the-box cabinet with controversial figures like FBI Director Kash Patel and Health and Human Services chief Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump’s 45% standing in the Real Clear Politics polling average is pretty solid. There are those in the GOP, reasonably concerned about next year’s midterms, who would like to see Trump slow down, or moderate his policies, but those voices will likely fall on deaf ears. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP No, Trump is not in a mood to back down, and core supporters, the working-class folks who made him the new face of the Republican Party could not be happier, could not feel more represented by their president. The next 100 days will tell the tale of the Trump era, but win, lose or draw, one thing is all but certain, Trump is going to go out as he came in, fighting.

    "title": "SEN. ANGUS KING: A 'Declaration of Conscience' on Donald Trump's 100th day",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Almost 75 years ago, the junior Republican Senator fromMaine, Margaret Chase Smith, delivered a speech from her heart about a crisis then facing our country: a crisis not arising from a foreign adversary, but from within. A crisis that threatened the values and ideals at the base of the American democratic experiment. Her ‘Declaration of Conscience’ turned out to be one of the most important speeches of the 20th Century and defined Smith as a person of extraordinary courage and principle. Reflecting back on the speech, she later told me that she was so nervous about the speech—this was the height of the Red Scare of the early fifties—that she told her chief aide, Bill Lewis, not to hand out the copies of the text tothe pressuntil she actually started talking on the floor, because she was afraid she might lose her nerve. But she went through with it, and the rest is, literally, history. TRUMP STEAMS AHEAD ON THESE CAMPAIGN PROMISES AS HE REACHES 100 DAYS IN OFFICE Here is how she began that speech: \"Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national condition. It is a national feeling of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide and the end of everything that we Americans hold dear. It is a condition that comes from the lack of effective leadership either in the legislative branch or the executive branch of our government.\" Maine Republican Senator Margaret Chase Smith in her office, Washington D.C., in 1948.(PhotoQuest/Getty Images) She continued, \"I think that it is high time for theUnited States Senateand its members to do some real soul searching and to weigh our consciences as to the manner in which we are performing our duty to the people of America and the manner in which we are using or abusing our individual powers and privileges.\" Later in the speech, Smith concluded, \"It is high time that we stopped thinking politically as Republicans and Democrats about elections and started thinking patriotically as Americans about national security based on individual freedom. It is high time that we all stopped being tools and victims of totalitarian techniques – techniques that, if continued here unchecked, will surely end what we have come to cherish as the American way of life.\" Sen. Margaret Chase Smith (R. Maine) walks across the Capitol Plaza in this undated photo.(Getty Images) I fear that we are at a similar moment. Echoing Senator Smith, the ‘serious national condition’ we are facing today should not be viewed as a partisan issue;it’s about the idea of America and the system of government that has sustained us for more than two centuries.It’s not about thepresident’s agenda(and yes, I disagree with most of it), but it’s about the manner in which he is pursuing it. This roughshod non-process endangers all of us, his detractors and supporters alike. Although many of my colleagues seem determined to ignore it, this president is engaged in the most direct assault on theConstitutionin our history, and we in this body, at least thus far, are inert. And therefore complicit. It’s worth pausing for a moment to look at the terms of Article II, which outline the powers and responsibilities of the president: the power to issue pardons and the role of commander-in-chief of the armed forces in wartime. But even this latter power is constrained by the reservation to the Congress of the power to declare war in the first place. The United States Constitution(iStock) The principal responsibility of the president, however, is spelled out explicitly: the chief executive \"shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" The job of the president is simply to execute the laws passed by Congress, without exception—a responsibility this president is spectacularly failing to meet. The administration has also taken a series of apparently unconnected actions which, taken together, spell out our rapid path toward one-man rule. While this is the most serious breach, the administration has also taken a series of apparently unconnected actions which, taken together, spell out our rapid path toward one-man rule. Here’s a partial list: This is not a complete list, but it does present a disturbing pattern—that this president is attempting to govern unbound by law or Constitutional restraint. To those who like thepolicies of the presidentand are therefore willing to ignore the unconstitutional means of effectuating them, I (and history) can only say: watch out. Today, the target may be federal workers, but tomorrow (perhaps under a different president), it could be you. President Donald Trump at the White House on April 21, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) So what can we do? The first guardrail is theCongressitself. But unfortunately, the majority in Congress has wholly abdicated these fundamental responsibilities. The second guardrail is the courts, which are generally holding up their end of the constitutional bargain. As easy as it may be to rely entirely on the courts, that’s a cop-out; reclaiming power must be a joint project. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The final guardrail is the people, who more and more are speaking up—in rallies, in correspondence, in town halls, and in conversations at the grocery store. We can’t escape the responsibility of our oath to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic;\" [and that we would] \"bear true faith and allegiance to the same.\" So, with thanks to Margaret Chase Smith for her example and inspiration, this is my ‘Declaration of Conscience.’ I don’t relish this moment, but feel I have no choice but to call out the clear implications and dangers ofPresident Donald Trump’sfirst 100 days. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Many years ago,President Abraham Lincolncame to the Congress at a time when our forebears—like us—were reluctant to face the responsibilities that had been thrust upon them. At that critical moment, this is what he said, \"Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this Administration will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.\" I deeply hope that amid our fiery trial, we will choose honor—and the Constitution.

    "article_text": "Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks tells the tale of how one young man from the South Side of Chicago successfully clawed his way out of poverty through trade school education. Several years ago, a young man by the name of Devin Howard came to my non-profit, Project H.O.O.D., on the South Side ofChicago. Like most kids around here, Devin grew up in a world of violence and poverty where one wrong turn or false move can have dire consequences. However, Devin always had the strong inner drive to become a somebody. He went to school at nearby Urban Prep where he played football and graduated with a 3.8 GPA. He then went on to Eastern Illinois University where his goal was to become a nurse. But something wasn’t right. School wasn’t working for him and he wasn’t interested in nursing. So, he left and returned to my neighborhood where he potentially jeopardized his future by putting himself back in the danger zone. He even made the rash decision to join the Navy only to back out on the day he was to ship out. Was Devin yet another lost soul? Would he find his fire, his passion? Or would the neighborhood consume him? CHICAGO, MY HOMETOWN, KEEPS WINNING IN ONE SHAMEFUL WAY But Devin kept searching and when he came to me the first thing he said was, \"I hear you have a carpentry program.\" I told him that we did and that he was more than welcome to apply. I created this program because I believe in the trades as a way out. I went to college myself, but I know it’s not for everybody. I saw a lot of people drop out and there were no trade classes around to break their fall. Whenever I drive by a construction site, I wonder if Devin is managing it — what a wonderful feeling. There’s something magical about working with ones’ hands and creating something. It’s not for everyone but we’ve long denied our youth the opportunity of learning thecraft of a tradeand taking tremendous pride in it. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Devin quickly rose to the top of his construction class, never missing a day. As he earned certification after certification, he met a man by the name of Bill who was the CEO of Reed Construction. Devin got Bill’s business card. Thenthe pandemic struck, dashing Devin’s job search. He thought of quitting. But one day when he was cleaning out his room, he came upon Bill’s card and left him a voice message. Bill called back that same day and wound up offering him the job of project engineer. This was supposed to be a boy who ended up in the gangs or on the streets. Now, he had a job that he was passionate about. That is why I believe so much in the trades and will make it a featured part of the community center I am building right now. It heartens me to know that many other Americans have also come to believe in the trades as a way forward. Recently, I listened to Jan Jekielek interviewMike Roweabout how New Hampshire, North Dakota, andSouth Dakotaare reviving the trades in schools. Rowe said, \"They’ve got a giant campaign to get shop class back in schools…welding, electricians, HVAC, plumbing, woodworking, automotive repair.\" I wish they would come toIllinoissince I cannot keep up with the demand for trades.

    "title": "An American father's plea: President Trump, please bring my son and the other hostages home from Gaza",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump answers questions about the assassination attempts on his life and efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza during a Fox Noticias interview. It has been 100 days since the new U.S. administration took office amid a clear policy of \"America First.\" But for American families like mine, families whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas for over 560 days, we should have already seen results from this policy. My son, Itay Chen, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, remains in captivity. So do four other Americans: Edan Alexander, Omer Neutra, Judy and Gadi Weinstein. Every day that passes without their return is another day of anguish, uncertainty, and pain. As a father, I wake up every morning hoping this will be the day I get the call from the White House telling me my son is coming home. When PresidentDonald Trumpwon the election, I felt a renewed sense of hope. I believed that his leadership, strength, and personal concern for American hostages would lead to real movement. And I deeply thank President Trump for demanding the release of all hostages even before his inauguration that led to the release of 33 hostages in Gaza, including two U.S. citizens. FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE: LET TRUMP CLOSE DEAL OF THE CENTURY President Donald Trump met with seven hostages freed from Hamas captivity.(Photo provided by Hostages Families Forum) I believe he cares profoundly, but the truth is, the first 100 days of this administration have not delivered what the president himself demanded - releasing all of the U.S. hostages in Gaza and sending a clear message that holding U.S. hostages anywhere is a liability, not an asset. This is not a critique made in anger. It is a plea made in desperation. I understand that diplomacy is complex. I know that the negotiations around hostages—especially in a war zone and involving multiple international actors— require discretion, patience, and nuance. But I also know that time is not on our side. As the weeks pass, the fear grows that the window to bring our loved ones back is narrowing and they will disappear forever. We have seen this administration act boldly in other arenas to implement the America First policy, particularly when it comes to economic policy. Tariffs and financial pressure have already been deployed as tools of American strength. From left to right, Edan Alexander, Itay Chen, Judy and Gadi Weinstein, and Omer Neutra.(Fox News) Why not apply similar pressure now to release the U.S. hostages? Instead of the administration being proactive, U.S. families like mine, out of despair, are taking matters into our own hands. We’ve been lobbying Congress to impose direct financial sanctions against Hamas, pressuring banks and financial institutions to freeze assets and urging stricter enforcement of existing measures. Just this month, U.S. families filed alawsuit against Bashar Masri, an American businessman charging that he provided assistance in constructing infrastructure that allowed Hamas militants to carry out their cross-border rampage, including killing 45 U.S. citizens. We’ve urged the Administration, the Department of Justice and the Treasury to expand these efforts. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The administration can, and must, do more. Americans – children, fathers, sisters – are all still being held in underground tunnels by a terrorist organization, in conditions we can barely imagine. The previous administration told the American families the way to release our family members would be via Israel as a proxy. Though the plan did not work, the Biden administration kept doubling down on the same plan despite not getting the expected results. The Trump administration inherited this policy and should re-evaluate the game plan. President Trump is an extremely gifted negotiator. His team successfully released several U.S. citizens from war zones with direct negotiations. As such, why isPresident Trumpnot directly negotiating for the release of U.S. citizens in Gaza, but instead using third parties such as Qatar to negotiate for the release of U.S. citizens? In January, we saw what the president’s direct involvement can do to release hostages. The U.S. has a legal obligation to get its citizens out of harm’s way and if the proxy is not capable of releasing them, then the U.S. must find a different path to release its citizens. American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen was released as part of the Trump administration's hostage deal in February 2025.(Jonathan Dekel-Chen) Trump administration officials have sent a clear message to the world that American lives are not bargaining chips. This administration has the opportunity to reinforce that principle—to lead with strength and show that \"America First\" means never leaving Americans behind. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I will not lose hope. My faith in America’s power and promise is unbroken. But that hope needs to be matched with action. For Itay. For the other hostages. For the credibility – and the soul - of a nation that is seeking to reset the table with the world based on a true \"America First\" policy. What a victory it would be if President Trump, in his upcoming visit to the Middle East, will bring on his plane back home the 5 U.S. hostages from Gaza. Ruby is the father of Itay Chen, a 19-year-old Israeli-American who was taken captive by the Hamas terrorist organization on Oct. 7, 2023. Although the Israel Defense Force believes Itay may have been killed, Ruby, who lives in Israel with his wife, Hagit, and their two other children, continues to hold out hope his son is alive.",

    "article_text": "'Outnumbered' panelists discuss the Trump administration's latest efforts to crack down on illegal immigration after Tom Homan touted 'the most secure border in the history of this nation.' Today, April 29, 2025, isPresident Donald Trump’s 100th dayin office. The liberal media, which has underestimated and misrepresented this president for the past decade, would have us believe that his second term so far has been a disaster. Many of us who voted for Trump disagree. Pollsters tell us that Trump’s approval ratings are in free fall. Critics (and the president) suggest some polls don’t pass the smell test. GOP pollster John McLaughlin reports that in the new NY Times/Siena poll, which showed Trump with a meager 42% approving of how the president is handling his job, only 37% of the survey group voted for Trump in 2024. The recent ABC/Washington Post poll showed Trump at 39% approval – \"The Lowest in 80 Years\" blared a headline – but included, according to McLaughlin, only 34% Trump voters. As McLaughlin asked pointedly on Truth Social, \"Didn’t we win popular vote with 50%?\" SEC. BESSENT SAYS TRADE DEALS ARE 'MOVING VERY QUICKLY': PARTNERS BROUGHT 'THEIR A GAME' A firm called Quantus Insights, that claims to have achieved better accuracy than most polling outfits in 2024, shows in a recent survey that Trump still commands 91% backing from Republicans and that his overall approval is still about 48%, higher than most other surveys. Coal miner Jeff Crowe winks at President Donald Trump after he signed Crowe's speech during an event on energy production in the East Room of the White House, April 8, 2025. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Still, Trump’s support has undeniably softened, and no wonder. Economists tell us that prices are set to soar, the U.S. is likely to tumble into recession, a \"supply shock is coming\" and thatthe dollar is under attack. Never mind that inflation has eased over the past two months and actually turned negative in March.  Never mind that the jobs market remains solid and that Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently told Bret Baier on Fox News that \"consumers are still spending.\" The end is near, we are told, all because Trump is attempting something that should have happened a decade or two ago: he is trying to make America competitive again. He is trying to undo the damage done by allowing China to join the World Trade Organization, looking the other way while China broke everyrule meant to promote fair trade(Thank you Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama.) and by a series of trade agreements that allowed U.S. companies to ship jobs overseas. The liberal media’s take on Trump’s tariff battle is relentlessly and universally negative. Isn’t there anyone who worries that the U.S. is dependent on Chinese industry and pharmaceuticals? Isn’t anyone irate that America’s EU allies put 10% tariffs on U.S. autos while we impose only a 2.5% tariff on BMWs and Volvos? Does anyone see any upside at all to the Trump trade agenda? Why yes, it turns out that possibly a great many people agree with the president’s actions. Pollster Frank Luntz convened a group of some 15 Trump voters recently, taking their pulse on the rocky past few weeks and expecting them to blast their elected leader, especially on tariffs and the stock market downturn. Luntz seemed surprised to find out that the Trump voters remained solidly in the president’s camp. On predicted tariff-generated price hikes, they said they were willing to pay more for goods made in the U.S. and supported trying to bring home production. On the stock market, they observed that markets go up and down, and that there had been corrections even under President Joe Biden. Overall, the group appeared willing to give Trump time to work through his agenda, noting that it was only a few months into his term, and that he had three and a half years to go. That is certainly not the view of the liberal press, which has fought Trump every step of his political journey. Whether it was pushing our NATO allies to up their defense spending or calling out China for breaking trade rules and stealing our intellectual property, or advocating for a border wall, the establishment fought him until voters took his side. The end is near, we are told, all because Trump is attempting something that should have happened a decade or two ago: he is trying to make America competitive again. Trump does not have much time. Since he can serve for only four years, and since he might lose the GOP majority in Congress in less than two years, he entered the Oval Office moving at what is now called Trump Speed on a host of initiatives. He is giving Democrats heartburn by tackling so many ambitions at once. Of 31 main campaign promises, even The Washington Post has had to acknowledge that he has made progress on all but eight, and that summary is dishonest. Of the eight described as \"Hasn’t Happened,\" the promise to \"cut taxes\" and \"eliminate taxes on tips and overtime\" is clearly \"underway\" (another category) as Congress works toward a reconciliation bill. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The Post points out that numerous initiatives face \"roadblocks,\" with judges stepping in to deny progress on ending birthright citizenship and cutting funds to sanctuary cities; some of these proposals will succeed, others will not. Trump supporters will cut him some slack for not being able to overcome judicial interference. But they will also applaud those promises that Trump is quickly moving to fulfill: expanding oil and gas production, rolling back destructive environmental regulations, eliminating offensive race and gender curriculms in schools, preventing girls from having to compete in sports with biological males and drastically reducing the flow of people entering our country illegally. These policies offend the liberal establishment, but that isn’t the group that elected Trump. Working-class, common-sense Americans voted for Donald Trump and for the most part I’m guessing that – like the Luntz sample – they like what he is doing. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP For sure, because the president has taken on such a boatload of initiatives, mistakes have been made. The roll-out of the tariff program, in particular, was choppy and has created uncertainty. But if the White House can ink deals with India, Japan and South Korea in the next month or so, those wins will calm markets and cheer voters. Trump should continue to deliver on his campaign promises.  The polling will take care of itself… and become great again. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE LIZ PEEK",

    "title": "MORNING GLORY: President Trump won’t ink a bad deal with Iran",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Mark Levin gives his take on Iran’s nuclear program and ongoing talks with the United States on ‘Life, Liberty & Levin.’ It seems as thoughPresident Donald Trumpwakes up every morning and checks the calendar. If the date is an odd number he threatens Iran with bombing if the Islamic Republic does not dismantle its nuclear enrichment facilities and abandon its ballistic missile production. On even days, the president makes an optimistic statement or post about the likelihood of a deal that accomplishes meaningful, verifiable and rapid disarmament byIranof its nuclear and missile programs. Trump is, of course, negotiating with the mullahs via the open-source yo-yo of statements. The effect on friends of Israel is, however, disconcerting. They can only remember the betrayal of Israel that was President Obama’s and then Secretary of State John Kerry’s \"Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action\" (\"JCPOA\"). The JCPOA was agreed to July 14, 2015 by the P5+1 —China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), the European Union (EU), and Iran, a plan that purported to guarantee that Iran’s nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful. The JCPOA was, according to Trump and many others, the \"worst deal in history,\" as it was simply a series of speed bumps onIran’s road to nuclear weaponsand was also completely silent on Iran’s ballistic missile program and its export of terrorism and arming of its proxies. Obama caved. Completely. Friends of Israel in the United States tightly fear the negotiating prowess of the ayatollahs as they have been confounding American presidents since Jimmy Carter. Only Trump in his first term took a hard line with Tehran and kept to it, withdrawing from the JCPOA, instituting the \"maximum pressure campaign\" that brought Iran to its fiscal knees, and by ordering the January 3, 2020 drone strike that killed Qasem Soleimani, Iran’s most feared warrior and strategist near Baghdad International Airport in Iraq. Along with the Abraham Accords, the tax cuts Trump successfully pursued, and Operation Warp Speed which successfully developed the COVID vaccines in record-shattering time, the crippling of Iran and the rejection of the JCPOA will always be Trump’s major accomplishments of his first term. In this second term it is hard to imagine that Trump would forfeit his legacy for abad deal with Iran. A good deal is theoretically possible. Libya disarmed and allowed the removal and destruction of its WMD in late 2003 in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. Iran could choose that route too. The regime is as weakened as it has ever been after Israel’s repeated blows to its air defenses and proxy armies over the past year-and-a-half since 10/7 and Trump is methodically overseeing the destruction of the Houthis as he did ISIS early in his first term. Trump would surely prefer a serious disarmament agreement with Iran to bombing Iran, either on our own or in concert with Israel and perhaps the United Kingdom. The latter means an escalation of conflict with unknown effects throughout the region and the world. Bombing is, however, the \"means of last resort\" and time is running out as Iran is believed to be weeks away from \"break out\" tonuclear weaponsand that’s only what we suspect. There well could be sites and programs of which the West is wholly unaware, though Israel seems to have thoroughly penetrated the Islamic Republican Guard Corps. (To such an extent, in fact, that Mossad was able to blow up Hamas senior leader Ismail Haniyeh on July 32, 2024 in the IRGC’s guest house for VIPs in Tehran.) CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION If there is no rapid, verifiable deal soon, expect the bombs to fall. It may be that a dozen sites are targeted. It might take two weeks. It wouldn’t be a \"war\" unless Iran escalated against much stronger foes, an escalation that would risk the regime’s very existence. Trump always punches back, harder. Always. So to the people who worry about the \"even days\" when Trump talks up a deal: Remember the Iranians have been trying to assassinate Trump and other senior American officials from Trump’s first term since the hit on Soleimani five years ago. The president knows exactly who he is dealing with: fanatics. But he also knows that even fanatics have existential worries and concerns. A real deal is possible. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Keep your eye on Senator Tom Cotton. He’s a strong supporter of Trump and a hawk’s hawk on Iran as well as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Cotton would assess any deal with very critical eyes and would not hesitate to assess it as a disaster or close to one, or to praise it if it deserves praise. If Trump gets hornswoggled by the mullahs that will define his second term and his lasting legacy. There’s no coming back from a second JCPOA even as Obama can’t escape having signed the first one. So let not your hearts be troubled —yet. The \"Art of the Deal\" is at play here. Trump knows that a bad deal with Iran makes that phrase a punch line instead of a brand. It is difficult to imagine he’d want \"taken to the cleaners like every other president\" as the lead paragraph in the biographies that are guaranteed to roll off the presses for years and decades to come.

    "article_text": "Patty Morin's attorney Randolph Rice joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the verdict after a Maryland jury found an illegal immigrant guilty of Rachel Morin's murder. As an angel mom from Maryland grieving the brutal murder of my daughter by anillegal immigrant, I can tell you this: we do not have the luxury of feeling safe under Democratic control. Not in our homes. Not in our communities. And certainly not here in Maryland under Democrat rule. My daughter, Rachel Morin, was a vibrant, loving mother of five. She brought light into every room she entered. Even on her hardest days, she still managed to shine. On August 6th, 2023, her life was taken from her by Victor Martinez-Hernandez, anillegal immigrantfrom El Salvador who entered our country under the Biden administration. Just this month, he was rightfully convicted of first-degree murder, rape, and kidnapping. Unfortunately,Rachel’s storyis not an isolated tragedy. She is one of many victims across our state and country who suffered at the hands of individuals who should never have been here because of the failures of the Biden administration. And instead of standing with the victims, his party is still making it worse. ANGEL MOM OF RACHEL MORIN CONDEMNS DEMS' TRIP TO SEE DEPORTED MIGRANT, MAINSTREAM MEDIA BIAS This month, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen took it upon himself to usetaxpayer dollarsto charter a plane to El Salvador and advocate that a MS-13 gang member in prison be brought back to the U.S. Rather than working for Americans and the victims of migrant crime, Van Hollen spends his time actively making American lives worse and championing dangerous criminals from another country. This isn’t compassion. It’s recklessness. It’s a slap in the face to my family and his other constituents. Not only to my daughter and others who’ve been affected by migrant crime, but to every Marylander whose lives are put in danger because of Van Hollen's new sanctimonious initiative advocating for illegal criminals. Marylanders hear his message to us loud and clear: the protection of our families is not a priority for Democrats. Thankfully, we are blessed to have a president in the White House who actually cares about the people that elected him. Someone who is taking real steps tosecure our borders, and keep Americans safe. I saw this first hand when I visited the White House this month to share my family’s story with the White House press corps. After speaking with President Donald Trump and sharing an emotional moment with him after my remarks, I know that he cares and I am confident that he has secured the southern border and has a plan to completely reverse the damage done by the past administration by also addressing crime at the northern border. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION President Trump said it best: \"Every state in this country is a border state\" and he knows that these threats don’t just come from the south. After speaking with White House officials and experts, it’s clear that our next fight will be at our northern border — drug cartels, human traffickers, and illegal migrants will take their same tactics they used in Mexico up north. All of our neighborhoods are vulnerable if we don’t have strong enforcement nationwide. I trust that President Trump has a plan for this and he will bring that same sense of sanity and protection that he brought to the southern border. The fight is not over; and that’s why it’s even more important that all of our political leaders — including Democrats like my Senator Chris Van Hollen — get on board with President Trump’s agenda and fight to protect all Americans. I don’t want another family to experience what we’ve gone through. I don’t want another child’s life to be stolen because our leaders failed to act. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP I recently read a quote from A. C. Dixon, who said it best: \"When we depend upon our organizations, we get what organizations can do; when we depend upon education, we get what education can do; when we depend upon man, we get what man can do; but when we depend upon prayer, we get what God can do.\" Let us pray for the safety and security of all families, in Maryland and across the country. Patty Morin is the Angel Mom of Rachel Morin, who was killed in August 2023. An illegal immigrant from El Salvador has been charged in her murder.",

The two companies have signed a preliminary agreement to look into developing and deploying an autonomous vehicle platform, according to ablog posted by Waymo. The language used by the companies is vague — and essentially comes down to a hey-let’s-see-how-we-might-work-together arrangement. A spokesperson said more details will be shared if there is a definitive agreement. The goal, if Waymo and Toyota officially partner, is twofold. The companies would combine their respective strengths to develop a new autonomous vehicle platform that would be used for a robotaxi service. The companies would also look at bringing Waymo’s technology into the next generation of Toyota vehicles sold to consumers. The scope of the collaboration will continue to evolve through ongoing discussions, Waymo said in the blog post. “Toyota is committed to realizing a society with zero traffic accidents and becoming a mobility company that delivers mobility for all,” Hiroki Nakajima, member of the board and executive vice president of Toyota, said in a statement, adding the automaker shares “a strong sense of purpose and a common vision with Waymo in advancing safety through automated driving technology.” The timing of the announcement is notable. Last week, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai made remarks during the company’s earnings call that suggestedWaymo was looking at personally owned autonomous vehicles. Waymo has talked vaguely about licensing its tech before. However, this was the first time that the top executive of its parent company spoke publicly about the possibility.As Waymo has transitioned from a research and development program to a commercial operation, the company has sought partnership with other businesses. Waymo has a robotaxi service in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Austin, and soon Atlanta. Historically, Waymo has handled all aspects of the robotaxi business, including the app, maintenance, and ride-hailing operations. That changed in recent months. Waymo has hired Moove to manage its fleet of AVs in Phoenix. It has alsoturned to Uberto share the responsibility for robotaxi operations in Austin, and soon in Atlanta. Under the “Waymo on Uber” robotaxi service, Waymo is responsible for vehicle testing, roadside assistance, and certain aspects of rider support. Uber manages the fleet services such as vehicle cleaning, maintenance, inspections, charging, and depot operations through a company called Avomo.

These people said Figure AI’s cease-and-desist letters demanded that they stop marketing the company’s stock. Both brokers said they received the letters for the first time afterBloomberg reportedin mid-February that Figure was seeking a $1.5 billion round at a $39.5 billion valuation — a fifteenfold increase from the$2.6 billionvaluation it achieved in February 2024. A spokesperson for Figure AI told TechCrunch that the company sends such letters when it hasn’t authorized the broker to sell its stock, suggesting that it has a long history of sending such letters. “This year, when we discovered an unauthorized third-party broker was marketing Figure shares without approval from the Figure Board of Directors, the company sent a cease and desist asking the unauthorized broker to stop, as it has done previously when other unauthorized brokers were discovered,” the spokesperson told TechCrunch in a written statement. “We do not allow secondary market trading in our shares without board authorization and the company will continue to protect itself against unwanted third-party brokers in the market.” Because Figure is a private company, not a public one, its stock cannot be easily sold at will by its investors, particularly without a company-authorized event. This restriction is why secondary markets have emerged at all, including ones that offer investors alternative ways to get cash from shares ahead of an IPO,such as loans secured by their startup sharesthat become repayable when a company goes public. The secondary markets on the receiving end of Figure’s letters told TechCrunch that they have other theories about why some CEOs dislike share sales on their markets. Existing shareholders were trying to sell their stock at a price that was below the new hoped-for $39.5 billion valuation, these brokers said. Both brokers told TechCrunch that some companies chafe at the prospect that lower-priced secondary shares could compete with the new round. Without commenting on Figure’s case specifically, Sim Desai, founder and CEO of secondary shares marketplaceHiive, told TechCrunch that companies sometimes block direct secondary sales because they believe “it’s a zero-sum game.” Desai, naturally, argues that the reverse could be true: Active secondary market trading could attract more interest for primary shares in a new raise. But if secondary market activity fails to drive interest in the primary round, the issue may lie with the valuation itself. “If someone is having a hard time selling something, it’s merely a function of price and valuation rather than availability of capital,” Desai said. Figure has also lately been the subject of several news articles, describing Figure’s progress with its marquee customer, BMW. Figure has responded, in at least one case, by saying the article had so many inaccuracies that it’s threatening to sue. As for how much Figure AI raises next — and at what valuation, that remains to be seen. Whether existing investors will be able to cash out early in secondary transactions is also to be determined.

Instead of continuing to test the simplified version, the social network is now going to begin experimenting with a “refined five-tab interface” that keeps all of the app’s existing tabs and makes it easier to access Spotlight. “In terms of the simple Snapchat design, we learned a lot from the redesign, but ultimately found that it was difficult, especially for power users, folks who really love Snapchat the way that it is who use the map and stories all the time, to really adopt the three-tab design, which made it harder to find stories and subscriptions and harder to find the map,” Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said on a call with investors. “So ultimately, we’re taking a bunch of learnings from the three tab simple Snapchat design and evolving the five-tab design with those learnings.” The company says it found that a more prominent Spotlight experience and the integration of Friend Stories within chats significantly boosted daily content viewership and total content views, especially among more casual users. “Our most engaged Snapchatters consistently demonstrated a preference for a five-tab layout, favoring the familiarity of tile-based content discovery and a dedicated Map tab,” Snap said in its letter to investors. “Informed by these insights, we have begun testing a refined five-tab interface that combines the best of both approaches: bringing more Stories to the messaging experience and adding easier access to Spotlight, now placed directly to the right of the Camera.” The reversal comes as Snap shares that it lost 1 million users in North America in Q1 quarter-over-quarter. Snapchat DAUs (daily active users) in North America stood at 99 million, compared to 100 million in the past quarter and 100 million in the prior year, according to Snap’s shareholder letter. The company also saw an increase of more than 55% year-over-year in the number of My AI daily active users in the U.S., as Spiegel teased some AI-related announcements to come later this year. “As we look at the areas where we really want to differentiate, it’s really around that visual communication,” he said. “And so as we look at the way that people are interacting with My AI, by sending snaps and either receiving snaps or a chat response in return. I think that starts to show the way that these multimodal models are going to play a powerful role in people’s lives. I think looking even longer term beyond that, the way that people are going to integrate AI into augmented reality, and I think provide a totally new user interface powered by AI is something that we’re investing a lot in. We’ll have more announcements around that later this year.” Snap reported first-quarter revenue of $1.36 billion, a 14% year-over-year increase. The company says the uptick was driven by growth of its Snapchat+ subscription service and progress that it has made with its advertising solutions. Snap also reached a new milestone: more than 900 MAUs (monthly active users) worldwide. In addition, the social network’s DAUs grew to 460 million globally, an increase of 38 million year-over-year.

F Lite was developed in partnership with AI startup Fal.ai and trained using 64 Nvidia H100 GPUs over the course of two months, according to Freepik.

It’s frequently developed using massive amounts of content — including copyrighted content — from public sources around the web. Most companies developing these models arguefair useshields their practice of using copyrighted data for training without compensating the owners. Many creators and IP rights holders disagree. Freepik has made two flavors of F Lite available, standard and texture, both of which were trained on an internal dataset of around 80 million images. Standard is more predictable and “prompt-faithful,” while texture is more “error-prone” but delivers better textures and creative compositions, according to the company. Here’s an image from the standard model generated with the prompt “A person standing in front of a sunset, in majestic surroundings.” Freepik makes no claim that F Lite produces images superior to leading image generators like Midjourney’s V7, Black Forest Labs’ Flux family, or others. The goal was to make a model openly available so that developers could tailor and improve it, according to the company. That being said, running F Lite is no easy feat. The model requires a GPU with at least 24GB of VRAM. Other companies developing media-generating models on licensed data includeAdobe,Bria,Getty Images,Moonvalley, and Shutterstock. Depending on how AI copyright lawsuits shake out, the market could grow exponentially.

From the start of 2024 to the present, the Android app marketplace went from hosting about 3.4 million apps worldwide to just around 1.8 million, according to a new analysis by app intelligence providerAppfigures. That’s a decline of about 47%, representing a significant purge of the apps that have been available to Android users globally. The decline is not part of some larger global trend, the firm also notes. During the same period, Apple’s iOS App Store went from hosting 1.6 million apps to now just around 1.64 million apps, for instance — a slight increase. In Google’s case, the decline in apps could be a relief for Android device owners who have had to sort through scammy, spammy, and otherwise poor-quality apps to find the best ones to install. The reduction could also help developers who have had to fight for visibility. Over the years, Google Play’s less stringent requirements for app review have led to the marketplace being overrun with lower-quality apps. While Apple continues to enforce strict app review measures before publication, Google often relies on automated checks combined with malware scans to speed up the app-review process. It tends to have a shorter app-review period as a result of its lighter touch in terms of human review. In July 2024, Google announced it wouldraise the minimum quality requirementsfor apps, which may have impacted the number of available Play Store app listings. Instead of only banning broken apps that crashed, wouldn’t install, or run properly, the company said it would begin banning apps that demonstrated “limited functionality and content.” Thatincluded static appswithout app-specific features, such as text-only apps or PDF-file apps. It also included apps that provided little content, like those that only offered a single wallpaper. Additionally, Google banned apps that were designed to do nothing or have no function, which may have been tests or other abandoned developer efforts. Reached for comment, Google confirmed that its new policies were factors here, which also included an expanded set ofverification requirements,required app testingfor new personal developer accounts, andexpanded human reviewsto check for apps that try to deceive or defraud users. In addition, the company pointed to other 2024 investments in AI for threat detection, stronger privacy policies, improved developer tools, and more. As a result, Googleprevented2.36 million policy-violating apps from being published on its Play Store and banned more than 158,000 developer accounts that had attempted to publish harmful apps, it said. One factor Google didn’t cite was the new trader status rule enforced by the EU as of this February, which began requiring developers to share their names and addresses in the app’s listing. Those who failed to do so would see their apps removed from EU app stores. (It’s worth pointing out that Applealso began requiring trader statusinformation in February and did not see a decline in available apps as a result.) Appfigures additionally notes it began seeing a decline in the number of apps on the Google Play Store even before the official start of the purge last summer; it doesn’t yet have an explanation for this change. However, the firm says there have been 10,400 releases on Google Play so far this year, up 7.1% year-over-year as of April.

Asfirst reported by Axiosand by suits seen by TechCrunch, CaaStle is being sued by P180, a vehicle it launched to invest in companies that used CaaStle technology, and by EXP Topco, an apparel company that says CaaStle never paid it after reaching a settlement for copyright infringement. A representative for CaaStle did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment. TheP180 suitalleges, “Nothing about CaaStle was true.” The lawsuit claims that CaaStle tried to hide details of its income and financial stability from P180. “It then fraudulently induced P180, among other things, to raise capital and take out multiple loans in the expectation that P180 would acquire viable assets, which P180 ultimately did,” the suit alleges, adding that CaaStle also tried to force the two to merge. The suit goes on to say that because P180 believed it was misled, its “investors took full control of the board,” the suit continues. “P180 has been harmed in excess of $58 million and seeks recovery of those proceeds, rescission of contract, and unwinding of corporate ties between itself and CaaStle.” Meanwhile, EXP Topco is also suing. Italleges that CaaStle breacheda settlement agreement by not paying fines after reaching the settlement over alleged copyright infringement. And Axios is alsoreporting on rumors of a possible class-action lawsuitagainst an investment firm that brought CaaStle retail investors, although it didn’t report the name of the investor. Axios first reported the news of CaaStle’s financial troubles a month ago. Hunsicker, the company’s founder, resigned from the board and stepped down from her role as CEO when the company said it was investigating allegations of financial misconduct. The company is exploring bankruptcy and secured $2.7 million in financing to help that process, Axios further reported. CaaStle raised over $530 million total, with its last round raised in 2019 at $43 million, PitchBook estimates. In April, the board confirmed to TechCrunch that its financial circumstances were so dire at that time that it had to furlough employees. Should that whole $530 million be gone, this would be one of the largest startup fraud cases in recent history. In comparison, Frank, the student loan application startup, was purchased by JPMorgan for $175 million. Frank’s founder, Charlie Javice,was found guilty of fraud last month. TechCrunch spoke to two former employees who said they were not surprised to hear that the company had financial troubles, though they didn’t witness any of the alleged fraud. One former employee, who asked to remain anonymous, doesn’t recall the company holding updates about its financial health or how well it was doing. “I think everyone laughed it off and was like, ‘Oh, we probably don’t make any money,” the employee told TechCrunch. When asked for a reaction to the fraud allegations, this person said, “I don’t think anyone expected it.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Dominic-Madori Davis is a senior venture capital and startup reporter at TechCrunch.

Available inlimited preview, the Llama API lets developers explore and experiment with products powered by different Llama models, per Meta. Paired with Meta’s SDKs, it allows developers to build Llama-driven services, tools, and applications. Meta didn’t immediately share the API’s pricing with TechCrunch. The rollout of the API comes as Meta looks to maintain a lead in the fiercely competitive open model space. While Llama models have racked upmore than a billion downloads to date, according to Meta, rivals such as DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen threaten to upend Meta’s efforts to establish a far-reaching ecosystem with Llama. The Llama API offers tools to fine-tune and evaluate the performance of Llama models, starting with Llama 3.3 8B. Customers can generate data, train on it, and then use Meta’s evaluation suite in the Llama API to test the quality of their custom model. Meta said it won’t use Llama API customer data to train the company’s own models and that models built using the Llama API can be transferred to another host. For devs building on top of Meta’s recently released Llama 4 models specifically, the Llama API offers model-serving options via partnerships with Cerebras and Groq. These “early experimental” options are “available by request” to help developers prototype their AI apps, Meta said. “By simply selecting the Cerebras or Groq model names in the API, developers can … enjoy a streamlined experience with all usage tracked in one location,” wrote Meta in a blog post provided to TechCrunch. “[W]e look forward to expanding partnerships with additional providers to bring even more options to build on top of Llama.” Meta said it will expand access to the Llama API “in the coming weeks and months.” Topics AI Editor Google Play sees 47% decline in apps since start of last year Google launches AI tools for practicing languages through personalized lessons Meta launches a stand-alone AI app to compete with ChatGPT Indian court orders blocking of Proton Mail Alibaba unveils Qwen3, a family of ‘hybrid’ AI reasoning models Hugging Face releases a 3D-printed robotic arm starting at $100 OpenAI upgrades ChatGPT search with shopping features © 2025 Yahoo.",

While the experiments are still in the early stages, it’s possible that the company is looking to take on Duolingo with the help of Gemini, Google’s multimodal large language model. The first experiment helps you quickly learn specific phrases you need in the moment, while the second experiment helps you sound less formal and more like a local. The third experiment allows you to use your camera to learn new words based on your surroundings. Google notes that one of the most frustrating parts of learning a new language is when you find yourself in a situation where you need a specific phrase that you haven’t learned yet. With the new “Tiny Lesson” experiment, you can describe a situation, such as “finding a lost passport,” to receive vocabulary and grammar tips tailored to the context. You can also get suggestions for responses like “I don’t know where I lost it” or “I want to report it to the police.” The next experiment, “Slang Hang,” wants to help people sound less like a textbook when speaking a new language. Google says that when you learn a new language, you often learn to speak formally, which is why it’s experimenting with a way to teach people to speak more colloquially, and with local slang. With this feature, you can generate a realistic conversation between native speakers and see how the dialogue unfolds one message a time. For example, you can learn through a conversation where a street vendor is chatting with a customer, or a situation where two long-lost friends reunite on the subway. You can hover over terms you’re not familiar with to learn about what they mean and how they’re used. Google says that the experiment occasionally misuses certain slang and sometimes makes up words, so users need to cross-reference them with reliable sources. The third experiment, “Word Cam,” lets you snap a photo of your surroundings, after which Gemini will detect objects and label them in the language you’re learning. The feature also gives you additional words that you can use to describe the objects. Google says that sometimes you just need words for the things in front of you, because it can show you how much you just don’t know yet. For instance, you may know the word for “window,” but you might not know the word for “blinds.” The company notes that the idea behind these experiments is to see how AI can be used to make independent learning more dynamic and personalized. The new experiments support the following languages: Arabic, Chinese (China, Hong Kong, Taiwan), English (Australia, U.K., U.S.), French (Canada, France), German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil, Portugal), Russian, Spanish (Latin America, Spain), and Turkish.

Residents in Arkansas, Montana, Puerto Rico, and West Virginia will soon be able to save their U.S. government-issued digital IDs to Google Wallet. Plus, people in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, and New Mexico will be able to use their mobile IDs at the DMV. As the REAL ID deadline of May 7, 2025, approaches, Google notes that you can use an ID Pass created from your U.S. passport to pass through TSA security for domestic travel at supported airports, even if you don’t have a REAL ID driver’s license or state-issued ID. However, your ID pass isn’t a replacement for your physical ID, so you should still keep that with you. Users will also soon be able to use their digital ID to recover Amazon accounts, access online health services with CVS and MyChart by Epic, verify profiles on platforms like Uber, and more. In addition, Google is rolling out the ability for residents in the U.K. to create digital ID passes with their U.K. passports and securely store them in Google Wallet. As verification is required across many websites and services, Google says it wanted to create a verification system that not only verifies users’ ages but also protects their privacy throughout the process. To achieve this, Google is integrating zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology into Google Wallet. This integration will allow Google to provide fast age verification across mobile devices, apps, and websites that use its digital credential API. The company will use ZKP in other Google products and partner with apps like Bumble, which will use digital IDs from Google Wallet to verify user identity and ZKP to verify age. Google will also open source its ZKP technology to other wallets and online services. As for Wallet’s expansion to 50 more countries, Google didn’t provide a list of the specific countries. TechCrunch reached out to learn more.

Audio Overviews launched last year to give users the ability to generate a podcast with AI virtual hosts based on documents they have shared with NotebookLM, such as course readings or legal briefs. The idea behind the feature is to give users another way to digest and comprehend the information in the documents they have uploaded to the app. With this expansion, more people can use Audio Overviews in their preferred language. Google notes that up until now, Audio Overviews have been generated in your account’s preferred language. Now the company is introducing a new “Output Language” option that will allow users to choose which language their Audio Overviews are generated in. You can change the language at any time, making it easy to create multilingual content or study materials as needed, Google says. “For example, a teacher preparing a lesson on the Amazon rainforest can share resources in various languages — like a Portuguese documentary, a Spanish research paper, and English study reports — with their students,” Google wrote in a blog post. “The students can upload these and can generate an Audio Overview of key insights in their preferred language.” Google told TechCrunch in an email that the new supported languages include Afrikaans, Arabic, Azerbaijani, Bulgarian, Bengali, Catalan, Czech, Danish, German, Greek, Spanish (European, Latin American, Mexico), Estonian, Basque, Persian, Finnish, Filipino, French (European), French (Canada), Galician, Gujarati, Hindi, Croatian, Haitian Creole, Hungarian, Armenian, Indonesian, Icelandic, Italian, Hebrew, and Japanese.

To win over users, Meta is trying to leverage what makes it different from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic — Meta already has a sense of who you are, what you like, and who you hang out with based on years of data that you’ve likely shared on Facebook or Instagram. Meta’s AI app can differentiate itself from existing AI assistants because it can “[draw] on information you’ve already chosen to share on Meta products,” the company said, such as your profile and the content you engage with. So far, these personalized responses will be available in the U.S. and Canada. You can also give Meta more information about you to remember for future conversations with its AI — for example, you can tell the AI that you are lactose intolerant, which it could remember before recommending that you go to a wine and cheese tasting on your next vacation. As with any AI product, users should be aware of how Meta may use the data they share with its chatbots. Meta relies on its wealth of user data to power its targeted advertising business, which makes up the bulk of its revenue. Meta’s AI app also introduces a Discover feed, where you can share how you’re using AI with your friends — in a mock-up image, Meta shows someone asking the AI to describe them in three emojis, which they then shared with their friends. A user’s interactions with Meta AI will only be shared to the feed if they choose to do so. This feed might amplify certain generative AI trends, like the recent trend in which people tried to make themselves look like Barbie dolls orStudio Ghiblicharacters. But then again, not every app needs to have a social feed — we’re looking at you, Venmo.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us On Tuesday, Meta is hostingits first-ever LlamaConAI developer conference at its Menlo Park headquarters, where the company will try to pitch developers on building applications with its open Llama AI models. Just a year ago, that wasn’t a hard sell. However, in recent months, Meta has struggled to keep up with both “open” AI labs like DeepSeek and closed commercial competitors such as OpenAI in the rapidly evolving AI race. LlamaCon comes at a critical moment for Meta in its quest to build a sprawling Llama ecosystem. Winning developers over may be as simple as shipping better open models. But that may be tougher to achieve than it sounds. Meta’slaunch of Llama 4 earlier this monthunderwhelmed developers, with a number of benchmark scores coming in below models like DeepSeek’s R1 and V3. It was a far cry from what Llama once was: a boundary-pushing model lineup. When Meta launched its Llama 3.1 405B model last summer, CEO Mark Zuckerbergtouted it as a big win. In ablog post, Meta called Llama 3.1 405B the “most capable openly available foundation model,” with performance rivaling OpenAI’s best model at the time, GPT-4o. It was an impressive model, to be sure — and so were the other models in Meta’s Llama 3 family. Jeremy Nixon, who has hosted hackathons at San Francisco’s AGI House for the last several years, called the Llama 3 launches “historic moments.” Llama 3 arguably made Meta a darling among AI developers, delivering cutting-edge performance with the freedom to host the models wherever they chose. Today, Meta’s Llama 3.3 model is downloaded more often than Llama 4, said Hugging Face’s head of product and growth, Jeff Boudier, in an interview. Contrast that with the reception to Meta’s Llama 4 family, and the difference is stark. But Llama 4 was controversial from the start. Meta optimized a version of one of its Llama 4 models, Llama 4 Maverick, for “conversationality,” which helped it nab a top spot on the crowdsourced benchmark LM Arena. Meta never released this model, however — the version of Maverick that rolled out broadlyended up performing much worseon LM Arena. The group behind LM Arena said that Metashould have been “clearer”about the discrepancy. Ion Stoica, an LM Arena co-founder and UC Berkeley professor who has also co-founded companies, including Anyscale and Databricks, told TechCrunch that the incident harmed the developer community’s trust in Meta. “[Meta] should have been more explicit that the Maverick model that was on [LM Arena] was different from the model that was released,” Stoica told TechCrunch in an interview. “When this happens, it’s a little bit of a loss of trust with the community. Of course, they can recover that by releasing better models.” A glaring omission from the Llama 4 family was an AI reasoning model. Reasoning models can work carefully through questions before answering them. In the last year, much of theAI industry has released reasoning models, which tend to perform better on specific benchmarks. Meta’steasing a Llama 4 reasoning model, but the company hasn’t indicated when to expect it. Nathan Lambert, a researcher with Ai2, says the fact that Meta didn’t release a reasoning model with Llama 4 suggests the company may have rushed the launch. “Everyone’s releasing a reasoning model, and it makes their models look so good,” Lambert said. “Why couldn’t [Meta] wait to do that? I don’t have the answer to that question. It seems like normal company weirdness.” Lambert noted that rival open models are closer to the frontier than ever before and that they now come in more shapes and sizes — greatly increasing the pressure on Meta. For example, on Monday,Alibaba released a collection of models, Qwen3, which allegedly outperform some of OpenAI’s and Google’s best coding models on Codeforces, a programming benchmark. To regain the open model lead, Meta simply needs to deliver superior models, according to Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an AI researcher at NYU’s Center for Data Science. That may involve taking more risks, like employing new techniques, he told TechCrunch. Whether Meta is in a position to take big risks right now is unclear. Current and former employees previously toldFortuneMeta’s AI research lab is “dying a slow death.” The company’s VP of AI Research, Joelle Pineau,announced this month that she was leaving. LlamaCon is Meta’s chance to show what it’s been cooking to beat upcoming releases from AI labs like OpenAI, Google, xAI, and others. If it fails to deliver, the company could fall even further behind in the ultra-competitive space.

On Tuesday, the Karnataka High Court directed the Indian government to block Proton Mail, a popular email service known for its enhanced security, following a legal complaint filed by New Delhi-based M Moser Design Associates. The local firm alleged that its employees had received emails containing obscene and vulgar content sent via Proton Mail. In aTuesday hearing streamed on YouTube, Justice M Nagaprasanna ordered the Indian government to “block Proton Mail, bearing in mind the observations made in the course of the order,” under the Information Technology Act 2008. In itscomplaintfiled in January, the New Delhi-based firm called for the regulation or blocking of Proton Mail in India, as the email service reportedly refused to share details about the sender of the allegedly offensive emails, despite a police complaint. Additional solicitor general Aravind Kamath, representing the Indian government, had earlier told the high court that the government might have a limited role in addressing the petitioner’s concerns and suggested criminal courts could seek the required information from Swiss authorities since the petitioner had made a complaint. The block of Proton Mail has yet to take effect, based on TechCrunch’s checks of Proton Mail’s website in India. TechCrunch contacted Proton Mail for comment and will update this story if we hear back. This is the latest legal tussle facing Proton Mail in India, its second ruling in as many years aimed at blocking the encrypted email service from operating in the country. Last year, the police department of the southern state of Tamil Nadu hadsought to blockProton Mail after the email service was found to have been used for sending hoax bomb threats to local schools. The Indian government’s IT ministry reportedly notified internet providers to block Proton Mail at the request of law enforcement. However, the Swiss federal authoritiesintervened to preventthe blocking of Proton Mail taking effect. “Blocking access to Proton Mail simply prevents law-abiding citizens from communicating securely and does not prevent cybercriminals from sending threats with another email service, especially if the perpetrators are located outside of India,” Proton said at the time. Nonetheless, in October 2024, the Delhi High Courtaskedstate police and the Indian government’s home ministry to investigate the alleged use of Proton Mail across the country. Kamath, the additional solicitor general, had assured the Karnataka High Court that he would examine the Delhi High Court’s observations on Proton Mail’s use in India.

    "title": "Trump congratulates Canada's Carney as they agree to meet in 'near future'",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has called Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to congratulate him on his victory in the country's general election and the two have agreed meet in the near future. The two countries were expected to enter talks about a new economic and security relationship after Monday's vote. Trump's trade tariffs and repeated comments undermining Canada's sovereignty overshadowed the race, which ended with Carney's Liberals projected to win a minority government, according to public broadcaster CBC. That result will make Carney's pressing tasks of negotiating with his US counterpart and tackling a range of domestic issues more of a challenge, as he'll need to wrangle support from other political parties. In their first call since the election, Trump congratulated Carney on his victory, according to the prime minister's office on Tuesday. The office also said the two leaders had \"agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together – as independent, sovereign nations – for their mutual betterment\". The Liberals will need to rely on their support to pass legislation through the House of Commons. They also face possible defeat in any vote of confidence in the chamber. The Liberals are most likely to find willing partners with the diminished left-wing New Democrats, who have in the past supported the Liberals, and the Bloc Québécois. The Liberals are projected to have won 169 seats, three short of the 172 needed for a majority in Canada's House of Commons. It still marks a historic turnaround for a party that had seemed on course for collapse just months ago. Carney, a former central banker for Canada and the UK, will continue as prime minister, having stepped into the role last month following his unpopular predecessor Justin Trudeau's resignation. One issue where it may be easy for the Liberals to find support in the House is in passing legislation to help workers and industries affected by US tariffs - something all parties swung behind on the campaign trail. On Tuesday morning, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-Francois Blanchet suggested Carney could benefit from at least a period of stability in the House. Blanchet urged a \"truce\" among parties while Canada negotiated trade with the US, saying it was clear Canadians wanted political stability in unstable times. He said it wasn't time for other parties to \"threaten to overthrow the government anytime soon\" and didn't see any scenario \"other than collaboration for a period of slightly over a year\". The leader of the sovereigntist party, which only runs candidates in Quebec, did urge Carney to avoid pressing the province on certain issues, noting that collaboration goes both ways. On Tuesday, the White House commented on Carney's win, with deputy press secretary Anna Kelly saying: \"The election does not affect President Trump's plan to make Canada America's cherished 51st state.\" Inan interview with the BBC, Carney said that Canada deserves \"respect\" from the US and he will only allow a Canada-US trade and security partnership \"on our terms\". Carney has told the BBC that a 51st state scenario was \"never, ever going to happen\". Meanwhile, new US ambassador to Canada, Pete Hoekstra, said in a video statement that he is \"committed to making progress in this great relationship\". Carney has also promised action on a range of domestic issues, including tackling the country's housing crisis and tax cuts for lower- and middle-income Canadians. The prime minister also needs to prepare for the G7 summit in June, which Canada is hosting in the province of Alberta. In Monday's election, both the Liberals and the Conservatives saw a significant rise in their share of the national vote compared with four years ago. The Conservative Party came in second, on track to win 144 seats, and will form Official Opposition. Increased support for Canada's two largest parties has come at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the NDP, whose share of the popular vote is down by around 12 percentage points. Voter turnout for the election was 67%. Both Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh lost their seats, with Singh announcing he will step down as leader of the left-wing party. A resident of the city has been charged with murder and work to identify victims is ongoing. The victims at the YNOT After School Camp are believed to range in age from seven to 18, authorities say. Here's how what to know about what comes after a projected Liberal win. The Clayborn Temple in Memphis, Tennessee, was the organising centre for Martin Luther King Jr's final campaign in 1968. The murder case that has captivated the US is back on after the first trial collapsed.",

    "title": "Woman's eyesight saved by cutting-edge test after mystery infection",
    "article_text": "A 29-year-old doctor from Bristol has had her eyesight saved after a \"game-changing\" test identified a mystery infection that had plagued her health for five years. Ellie Irwin suffered persistent inflammation in her right eye resulting in blurred vision and underwent intensive treatment to no avail. At one point she even considered having her eye removed. It was only after Ellie was offered a \"last resort\" analysis called metagenomics, that she was diagnosed with a rare bacterial infection which was cured with antibiotics. \"It's been transformative,\" Ellie told the BBC. \"I feel so fortunate.\" Professor Carlos Pavesio, consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, says Ellie's case is a \"breakthrough in the diagnosis of infectious diseases\". \"There are many patients we treat with chronic infections for years, but despite multiple tests we cannot identify the bug responsible,\" he says. In 2019, while still at medical school, Ellie began suffering from inflammation in her right eye. All tests for infection came back negative and it was assumed she had an autoimmune condition. Ellie was prescribed steroid eye drops and immunosuppressants, some of which needed to be given by intravenous infusion. \"It was completely dominating my life,\" Ellie says. \"I needed eye drops every single hour and it was difficult to balance that alongside starting work as a junior doctor. My vision was really variable, and I would have some bad days. \"I was on so much medication and going to so many appointments, yet I didn't feel I was getting any better.\" The treatment and inflammation led to Ellie developing a cataract that had to be surgically removed, just after she graduated from medical school. Ellie says she eventually reached \"breaking point\", and even began considering having her affected eye removed. \"Whilst losing sight in one eye is terrifying,\" she says, \"my biggest fear was that it might spread to my left eye.\" It was one of Ellie's doctors at Southmead Hospital in Bristol who suggested metagenomics - a last resort test not generally available to patients and only used where standard diagnostic tools have failed to identify or rule out infection. Metagenomics technology uses cutting-edge genomic sequencing, which can identify all bacteria, fungi or parasites present in a sample by comparing them against a database of millions of pathogens. A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital arranged for a sample of fluid to be taken from inside Ellie's eye and sent to the metagenomics labs at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) - the only lab in the UK officially recognised to carry out these diagnostic tests for patients, and one of only a few in the world. Currently, the standard method for detecting bacterial infections is by trying to grow a sample of it in a Petri dish. For viruses, the most common diagnostic tool is a PCR test. These will be familiar to many from the pandemic, when millions sent off swabs in the post to confirm whether they had Covid. However, Dr Julianne Brown, principal clinical scientist at the GOSH metagenomics service, says PCR has some drawbacks. \"The trouble with PCR is that you have to think of the viruses that might be causing an infection and do a separate test for each and every one,\" she says. \"So if you've got an infection with something that's unexpected, rare or not previously known, you won't find it.\" Dr Brown says metagenomics is \"an enormous step up - it's a complete game-changer\". In Ellie's case, metagenomics diagnosed a rare strain of the bacterial infection leptospirosis found in South America. It is now presumed Ellie picked up the bug swimming in the Amazon river in 2018, while on a trip to Ecuador and Colombia. Ellie says it was an emotional moment when she was given the results of the test. \"I broke down - I just had to cry. I never imagined that it would come back positive and be for something that was treatable,\" she says. \"I was given three weeks of antibiotics and within days my vision was clearer and the inflammation subsided.\" A single metagenomics test costs around £1,300, which is far more than standard diagnostics. However, as the technology is developed that price is likely to fall rapidly. Virologist Professor Judy Breuer, who has been developing metagenomics at GOSH and University College London (UCL) for more than a decade, says her team currently receives three or four samples a week from hospitals around the UK for metagenomic testing in addition to those it carries out on its own patients. These are often samples from parts of the body that are normally sterile sites, where bacteria are not usually found such as the brain, central nervous system, liver and eye. \"In the future, we think metagenomics will become a first line test and be able to diagnose infection in any sample, probably within the same day,\" she says. It's also likely to become faster, cheaper and easier to do, explains Dr Brown, meaning it will become available to more patients rather than just a small number who are severely unwell. Resolving her eye problems has allowed Ellie to concentrate on her training as a GP and arrange her wedding. Ellie was married in Newcastle on 29 March, the same day the city celebrated   Newcastle United's win in the Carabao Cup. She says: \"We got a shout-out from Ant and Dec and went up on a scissor lift above the Newcastle United fans, which was incredible.\" Prof Breuer says she is thrilled with how the treatment is changing lives. \"It is amazing to see the impact it is having for patients like Ellie.\" Calls to a mental health support hotline double between 2023 and 2024 and gets 6,000 calls a month. Campaigners warn new mental health law will not reduce detention of disabled people in secure hospitals. The scheme in Hemsworth could have \"negative impacts\" on the \"health-deprived\" town, council says. Research by the countries eye care industry found significant confusion about children's eye health. The States says work taking place includes the development of a mental health service directory.",

    "title": "Warning meters in 300,000 homes could stop working",
    "article_text": "Hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of losing hot water or heating when their old type of electricity meter goes out of action. Energy companies have said it will be \"very, very difficult\" to replace all Radio Teleswitching System (RTS) meters with smart meters before the old technology is switched off on 30 June. Campaigners estimate more than 300,000 homes could lose heating - or have it stuck on constantly - in what energy regulator Ofgem has called \"an urgent consumer welfare issue\". The government said the industry had to \"work urgently to continue to increase the pace of replacements\". Since the 1980s, RTS meters have used a longwave radio frequency to switch between peak and off peak rates. The technology is becoming obsolete and energy companies have a deadline to change their customers' meters by 30 June. At the end of March, there were still 430,000 households using RTS meters for their heating and hot water, according to Energy UK, which represents energy companies. It said more than 1,000 RTS meters were now being replaced each day. But based on the 430,000 figure, this daily rate would need to be more like 5,000 to stand a chance of reaching everyone. Ned Hammond, Energy UK's deputy director for customers, toldBBC Radio 4's You and Yoursthe rate of replacement was rising, but added: \"Obviously we'd need to increase from there significantly still to replace all the meters by the end of June.\" Asked whether it was impossible to get every RTS meter switched over by 30 June, he said: \"I wouldn't want to say impossible - but clearly very, very difficult to get to that point.\" Simon Francis, from campaign group the End Fuel Poverty Coalition, said the Energy UK figures suggested more than 300,000 households could be left with a meter that doesn't work from 1 July. He added: \"With pressures on the replacement programme growing and with limited engineer availability, especially in rural areas, there's a real risk of prolonged disruption, particularly for vulnerable households.\" RTS meters typically control heating and hot water on a separate circuit to the rest of the household's electricity, so things like plug sockets and lights are unlikely to be affected by the switch-off, Ofgem said. The RTS network was originally planned to be switched off in March 2024, but this was extended to give energy companies more time to get through everyone. Energy companies are still targeting 30 June \"as things stand\", Mr Hammond added, and are developing plans for a \"managed and very careful phase down of the system\", aiming to protect vulnerable customers. One challenge of changing everyone on to the new system is a distrust of smart meters.The BBC has previously foundthat smart meters can sometimes give inaccurate readings and can work worse or better depending on where you live. Jane from Norfolk told the BBC she is on an RTS meter and does not want a smart meter but feels as if she is being forced into getting one. She is currently on an Economy 7 tariff and does not want to switch. \"It's not yet lawful to say I've got to have one. And I really, really don't want one. I'm perfectly happy with the way things are,\" she said. Diane Gray, who lives near Cockermouth in Cumbria, uses RTS to control the heating and hot water in her home on an Economy 7 tariff. She wants a smart meter but has been told one won't work in her house. In December, her supplier wrote to her to say: \"At the moment we're not able to install a new meter in your home that works with your current meter's heating set up. Please bear with us. We are working hard on a solution for your meter type.\" She's since received another notification that a smart meter will be fitted in early June. \"I've got no idea where it's going to leave us,\" she told the BBC. \"It is very concerning. Because they're doing it in the summer, come the winter I keep thinking there must be some solution they're going to give us before we need to start using the heating.\" If your energy supplier cannot fit a smart meter in your home,Ofgem says your supplier must install a \"suitable meter\"with no disruption to your service. According to Ofgem, you may have an RTS meter if Bosses at The Tawny say the solar farm will produce enough electricity to meet the estate's needs. The forecast fall in the cost of energy would reverse three consecutive increases in the price cap. Borders councillors agree not to oppose plans for tens of thousands of panels in the Lammermuir Hills. Vale of White Horse District Council rejected the application last year but that was overturned. The pause is a major blow to the US's wind energy industry which has been targeted by President Trump.",

    "article_text": "A historic Black church in Memphis, Tennessee caught fire early Monday morning and suffered significant damage. The Clayborn Temple was the staging point for marches to City Hall, including a march led by Martin Luther King Jr on 28 March 1968, which turned violent when police and protesters clashed on Beale Street. Before the fire, the church was undergoing a $25 million restoration that was slated to be completed in 2026. The fire is still under investigation, according to the Memphis Fire Chief.

    "title": "Life inside Iraq's 'Forbidden Zone' controlled by Turkey",
    "article_text": "Nestled in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan sits the picturesque village of Sergele. For generations villagers have made a living growing pomegranates, almonds and peaches and foraging in the surrounding forests for wild fruits and spices. But Sergele, located 16km (10 miles) from the border with Turkey, has become increasingly surrounded by Turkish military bases, which are dotted across the slopes. One, perched halfway up the western ridge, looms over the village, while another in the east is under construction. At least seven have been built here over the past two years, including one by a small dam that regulates Sergele's water supply, rendering it off limits to villagers. \"This is 100% a form of occupation of Kurdish [Iraqi Kurdistan] lands,\" says farmer Sherwan Sherwan Sergeli, 50, who has lost access to some of his land. \"The Turks ruined it.\" Sergele is now in danger of being dragged into what's known locally as the \"Forbidden Zone\" - a large strip of land in northern Iraq affected by Turkey's war with the Kurdish militant group the PKK, which launched an insurgency in southern Turkey in 1984. The Forbidden Zone spans almost the entire length of the Iraqi border with Turkey and is up to 40km (25 miles) deep in places. Community Peacemaker Teams, a human rights group based in Iraqi Kurdistan, says that hundreds of civilians have been killed by drone and air strikes in and around the Forbidden Zone. According to a 2020 Kurdistan parliamentary report, thousands have been forced off their land and whole villages have been emptied out by the conflict. Sergele is now effectively on the front line of Turkey's war with the PKK. When the BBC World Service Eye Investigations team visited the area, Turkish aircraft pummelled the mountains surrounding the village to root out PKK militants, who have long operated from caves and tunnels in northern Iraq. Much of the land around Sergele had been burned by shelling. \"The more bases they put up, the worse it gets for us,\" says Sherwan. Turkey has been rapidly growing its military presence in the Forbidden Zone in recent years, but until now the scale of this expansion was not publicly known. Using satellite imagery assessed by experts and corroborated with on-the-ground reporting and open-source content, the BBC found that as of December 2024, the Turkish military had built at least 136 fixed military installations across northern Iraq. Through its vast network of military bases, Turkey now holds de-facto control of more than 2,000 sq km (772 square miles) of Iraqi land, the BBC's analysis found. Satellite images further reveal that the Turkish military has built at least 660km (410 miles) of roads connecting its facilities. These supply routes have resulted in deforestation and left a lasting imprint on the region's mountains. While a few of the bases date back to the 1990s, 89% have been constructed since 2018, after which Turkey began significantly expanding its military presence in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Turkish government didn't respond to the BBC's requests for interviews, but has maintained that its military bases are necessary to push back the PKK, which is designated a terrorist organisation by Ankara and a number of Western nations, including the UK. The sub-district capital of Kani Masi, which is only 4km (2.5 miles) from the Iraqi-Turkish border and parts of which are within the Forbidden Zone, may offer a glimpse into Sergele's future. Once famous for its apple production, few residents remain here now. Farmer Salam Saeed, whose land is in the shadow of a large Turkish base, hasn't been able to cultivate his vineyard for the past three years. \"The moment you get here, you will have a drone hover over you,\" he tells the BBC. \"They will shoot you if you stay.\" The Turkish military first set up here in the 1990s and has been consolidating its presence since. Its main military base, featuring concrete blast walls, watch and communication towers and space for armoured personnel carriers to move inside, is much more developed than the smaller outposts around Sergele. Salam, like some other locals, believes Turkey ultimately wants to claim the territory as its own. \"All they want is for us to leave these areas,\" he adds. Near Kani Masi, the BBC saw first-hand how Turkish forces have effectively pushed back the Iraqi border guard, which is responsible for protecting Iraq's international boundaries. At several locations, the border guards were manning positions well inside Iraqi territory, directly opposite Turkish troops, unable to go right up to the border and potentially risk a clash. \"The posts that you see are Turkish posts,\" says General Farhad Mahmoud, pointing to a ridge just across a valley, about 10km (6 miles) inside Iraqi territory. But \"we cannot reach the border to know the number of posts\", he adds. Turkey's military expansion in Iraqi Kurdistan - fuelled by its rise as a drone power and growing defence budget - is seen as part of a broader foreign policy shift towards greater interventionism in the region. Similar to its operations in Iraq, Turkey has also sought to establish a buffer zone along its border with Syria to contain Syrian armed groups allied with the PKK. In public, Iraq's government has condemned Turkey's military presence in the country. But behind closed doors it has accommodated some of Ankara's demands. In 2024, the two sides signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly fight the PKK. But the document, obtained by the BBC, did not place any limitations on Turkish troops in Iraq. Iraq depends on Turkey for trade, investment and water security, while its fractured internal politics have further undermined the government's ability to take a strong stance. Iraq's national government did not respond to the BBC requests for comment. Watch Turkey’s hidden war: The Forbidden Zone on iPlayer People outside the UK canwatch the documentary on YouTube Meanwhile, the rulers of the semi-autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan have a close relationship with Ankara based on mutual interests and have often downplayed the civilian harm due to Turkey's military action. The Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), an arch enemy of the PKK, dominates the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and has officially been in charge since 2005, when Iraq's constitution granted the region its semi-autonomous status. The KDP's close ties with Turkey have contributed to the region's economic success and have strengthened its position, both against its regional political rivals and with the Iraqi government in Baghdad, with which it tussles for greater autonomy. Hoshyar Zebari, a senior member of the KDP's politburo, sought to blame the PKK for Turkey's presence in Iraqi Kurdistan. \"They [the Turkish military] are not harming our people,\" he told the BBC. \"They are not detaining them. They are not interfering in them going about their business. Their focus, their sole goal is the PKK.\" The conflict shows no signs of ending, despite the PKK's long-jailed leader Abdulla Ocalan calling in February for his fighters to lay down arms and disband. Turkey has continued to shell targets across Iraqi Kurdistan, while the PKK claimed responsibility for downing a Turkish drone last month. And while violent incidents in Turkey have declined since 2016, according to a tally by the NGO Crisis Group, those in Iraq have spiked, with civilians living on the border region facing growing risk of death and displacement. One of those killed was 24-year-old Alan Ismail, a stage-four cancer patient hit by an air strike in August 2023 while on a trip to the mountains with his cousin, Hashem Shaker. The Turkish military has denied carrying out a strike that day, but a police report seen by the BBC attributes the incident to a Turkish drone. When Hashem filed a complaint in a local court about the attack he was detained by Kurdish security forces and held for eight months on suspicion of supporting the PKK - an accusation he and his family deny. \"It has destroyed us. It's like killing the whole family,\" says Ismail Chichu, Alan's father. \"They [the Turks] have no rights to kill people in their own country on their own land.\" Turkey's Defence Ministry did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment. It has previously told the media that the Turkish armed forces follow international law, and that in the planning and execution of their operations they only target terrorists, while taking care to prevent harm to civilians. The BBC has seen documents suggesting Kurdish authorities may have acted to help Turkey evade accountability for civilian casualties. Confidential papers seen by the BBC show a Kurdish court closed the investigation into Alan's killing, saying the perpetrator was unknown. And his death certificate - issued by Kurdish authorities and seen by the BBC - says he died because of \"explosive fragments\". Failing to mention when victims of air strikes have died as a result of violence, rather than an accident, makes it difficult for families to seek justice and compensation, to which they're entitled under both Iraqi and Kurdish law. \"In most of the death certificates, they only wrote 'infijar', which means explosion,\" says Kamaran Othman from Community Peacemaker Teams. \"It can be anything exploding. \"I think the Kurdish Regional Government doesn't want to make Turkey responsible for what they are doing here.\" The KRG said it acknowledged the \"tragic loss of civilians resulting from military confrontation between the PKK and Turkish army in the region\". It added that \"a number of casualties\" had been documented as \"civilian martyrs\", meaning they have been unjustly killed and entitling them to compensation. Almost two years after Alan was killed, his family is still waiting, if not for compensation, at least for acknowledgement from the KRG. \"They could at least send their condolences - we don't need their compensation,\" says Ismail. \"When something is gone, it's gone forever.\" All Christians, from Orthodox and western churches, are celebrating Easter on the same day this year. The sandstorm blanketed southern regions in an eerie, orange haze and shut down airports. But Amnesty International also says only 15 countries carried out the death penalty, the lowest on record Abdallah Makki Muslih al-Rifa was head of IS's most senior decision-making body, the US Central Command said. Angela Eagle says the ads will expose the \"dangerous lies\" spread by \"ruthless criminal gangs\".",

    "title": "The TikTokers accused of triggering an election scandal",
    "article_text": "Cristina Horez, an influencer from the Northern city of Iasi Romanians are returning to the polls this weekend, following the unprecedented cancellation of presidential elections last December which fuelled protests and nationwide turmoil. Far-right candidate Calin Georgescu's shock victory in the first round of elections was annulled amid accusations of Russian interference, suspicious TikTok accounts and secret payments to online influencers. Moscow denied interfering in the election. Georgescu is now banned from running, and was detained, facing a criminal investigation including attempting to overthrow constitutional order. He has denied the charges and accused the authorities of \"inventing evidence to justify stealing the election\". The leader of Romania's far-right AUR party, George Simion, has been polling as the frontrunner in the first round of the election re-run on Sunday. He is followed in the polls by Crin Antonescu of the National Liberal Party and independent candidate NicuÈor Dan. At the centre of this unprecedented political crisis are TikTok influencers accused by the Romanian authorities of participating in social media campaigns which artificially boosted Georgescu's online presence. The BBC has spoken to some of them. Protesters took to the streets in March, after it was announced Georgescu couldn't run in the May elections. Pro-Russian independent candidate Calin Georgescu's victory in the first round of elections came as a surprise. Georgescu was relatively unknown in the months before the election, polling at between 3-5%. He declared a zero campaign budget, had no campaign office and didn't engage in traditional campaigning. Instead, he focused on TikTok videos including some showing him riding horses in traditional Romanian outfits, and practising judo. He went viral on TikTok weeks before the election and soared in the polls, ultimately winning almost 23% of the vote. An independent think tank, Expert Forum, published a report saying Georgescu's explosive rise on TikTok was \"created suddenly and artificially - consistent with the way he exploded in the polls\". Authorities say TikTok's algorithm was exploited in the November vote in three different ways: over 100  influencers for hire who posted paid content indirectly promoting Georgescu, thousands of inauthentic accounts whose comments boosted Georgescu on the platform, and finally a \"King of TikTok\" who supposedly paid thousands of dollars to facilitate the campaign. The authorities said that one of these campaigns was \"identical\" to an operation \"run by the Russian Federation in Ukraine\". Separately, declassified intelligence documents also stated that Russia carried out \"cyberattacks, leaks, and sabotage\" in Romania. But authorities still haven't provided any concrete evidence of Russian interference in the election, frustrating many Romanians. The Foreign Intelligence Services and Romanian Police declined to comment on ongoing investigations. Calin Georgescu has been barred from running in May's re-run of the election Shortly before the election, a campaign using the hashtag \"stability and integrity\" flooded Romanian TikTok. Influencers uploaded videos describing what they were looking for in a future president: \"stability\", \"progress\", \"a patriot\". They did not name a specific candidate. They had been paid to upload videos with these messages through a marketing platform called FameUp, which allows brands to hire influencers at scale to promote products. But the influencers say they didn't know who paid for it. FameUp declined to comment to the BBC. Cristina, an influencer from the city of Iasi, says that when she took the job she felt \"there was nothing shady about it\". She says \"in the back of [her] mind\" she thought one of the 14 candidates likely paid for it and she \"just thought it was a smart approach. That's not doing any political propaganda. It's just encouraging people to go out and vote\". Some influencers did not mark the posts as paid content. This goes against TikTok rules, where paid political advertising is banned. While the adverts didn't mention Georgescu's name, influencers we spoke to described a \"wave of comments\" supporting him that appeared under the videos. Romeo Rusu, a micro-influencer from the city of Constanta with 25,000 followers, said: \"Right after I posted the video, within a few seconds, I started receiving dozens of comments. In the end, I received around 300 comments, all backing the independent candidate Calin Georgescuâ¦ I was absolutely surprised.\" The comments came into focus after TikTok stated in a report it had removed a network of over 27,000 inauthentic accounts that \"used fictitious personas to post comments related to the Romanian elections\". It is still not clear who created these bot accounts. Experts say that flooding unrelated videos with pro-Georgescu comments was a tactic to game TikTok's algorithm and get his name trending, which would in turn push his content into more users' feeds. A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC that, during the presidential campaign, the company \"blocked millions of fake engagement attempts, removed hundreds of thousands of spam accounts, prevented impersonation of political candidates, and disrupted three covert influence networks with limited reach\". \"We continue to work closely with local and EU authorities and partner with local organisations to elevate reliable election information,\" they said. The uncertainty around the campaign lasted into the new year, until a surprising twist in January. The Romanian Tax Authority revealed that the #stabilityandintegrity campaign was paid for by the centre-right National Liberal Party (PNL), who were backing their own candidate in the elections. In response, the PNL told Romanian journalists at news outlet Snoop that their campaign was hijacked to support Georgescu. Romeo couldn't understand why he'd been named in declassified documents Then, in March, TikTok influencer Bogdan Peschir was arrested for \"corrupting voters through electronic means of communication\". Peschir was known across Romania as the \"King of TikTok\", famous for awarding influencers with TikTok gifts, online tokens worth real money. The prosecution is reported to have claimed that Peschir paid over $900,000 to over 250 influencers \"to induce them to vote for \"a certain candidate\" in the presidential elections\" via TikTok gifts. His lawyers are reported to have said \"none of the donations made by Peschir on TikTok were for electoral purposes\". We spoke to Lucian Elgi, a musician and influencer who admitted being paid thousands of dollars by Peschir via TikTok gifts. He says he believes these payments were made in support of his work as a musician. Elgi denied that he promoted Georgescu. The BBC could not confirm this, as his videos on TikTok â along with those by others who were paid by Peschir's TikTok handle â have been removed. Elgi says his content wasn't about the election, but aboutmanelemusic, a genre of pop-folk music with roots in the Roma community.  Several high-profile manele musicians have been accused of taking payments from Peschir to campaign for Georgescu. Elgi said this content was flooded in pro-Georgescu comments. \"It was madness,\" he says. \"Every single post, comments like: Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President, Georgescu for President!\" Much is unknown about the election's annulment. Investigations are ongoing at the European Commission and Romania's highest courts. While Romanians are concerned about the alleged foreign interference, many are outraged that there is still no publicly available evidence undeniably proving Russian interference in the election. It's painstaking and complex work untangling an influence operation and its effects. Razvan Lutac, the Editor of Romanian news outlet Snoop, fears it could take a very long time to get clarity. \"We have these small pieces now, like a puzzle,\" he says, \"I think that maybe in a year or two years we will have a complete image of why they cancelled the elections.\" Additional reporting by Georgiana Tudor and Oana Marocico.",

    "title": "Faisal Islam: Carney wants to lead a G7 fightback on Trump tariffs",
    "article_text": "The global significance of Mark Carney's election as Canadian Prime Minister is he now sits at the centre of an alternative pole of global economic thinking. Everything but Trump. There was a half expectation here that Carney would immediately sue for peace with President Trump when the polls closed on the election. It has emphatically not happened. In the final days of polling, in his victory speech in Ottawa,and in his interview with me, he clearly intends to continue with the approach that has brought him to elected power, with a majority still possible. Even if he falls just short of a majority, two of the other main party leaders have lost their seats, and are likely to sign up to some degree behind a united Canada agenda on issues facing the US. Underpinning this approach is absolute conviction that the US is making a mistake that will primarily and visibly backfire on itself, its companies, and its consumers. The fact the White House isattacking Amazon for \"hostile acts\"in publishing tariffs is a cast-iron example of this. President Trump's gun is pointed primarily at his own feet, the thinking goes. Jordan Peterson, an implacable opponent of Mark Carney, recently lamented on Joe Rogan's podcast that \"once Carney is elected, Trump will not have a more seasoned enemy in the West. Carney is very well connected especially in Europe and the UK.\" While \"enemy\" is overstating it, Peterson was right, and additionally Carney is also very adept at understanding the nexus between markets and headlines. He made a number of announcements as PM about rethinking the purchase of US fighter jets, slightly changing the purchases of US government debt, all of which would have quickly focused some minds in the US. That said, there is significant potential economic damage about to be wrought by these tariffs on a Canadian economy, with three quarters of its exports going to the US. There is no getting away from that. Carney's answer during the campaign was to accept the US has changed and to diversify. A credible push in that direction might also help any chance of US businesses, Congress, or forces within the administration rowing back on the tariffs. Carney was abundantly clear to me that he is in no rush to go to the White House or Mar-a-Lago. \"We'll have a partnership on our terms. There's a win-win possibility there, but on our terms, not on their terms,\" he said. A key part of that is forging new strategic alliances elsewhere, with Europe, and the UK. \"One would assume\" that Canada and the UK could do a free trade agreement that has been stalled, he told me. Co-operation on defence and Canada's abundant critical minerals is also on the table. He also dismissed President Trump's territorial ambitions not just for his country, but Greenland and Panama too. On the campaign trail in his hometown of Edmonton, I heard him say \"America's leadership of the global economy is over\" and that was a \"tragedy\". Implicitly, he is saying, with the help of the rest of the G7, he will step up. And by an incredible quirk of fate, it is he who will host the G7 summit in Alberta in June, just days before the expiry of President Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs pause. Will Trump attend on the land he both tariffs and covets? All roads lead to Kananaskis in the middle of June. The university pledges to review its policies, though the proposals appear to fall short of White House demands. He tells a crowd in Michigan that he is using his presidency to deliver \"profound change\". A resident of the city has been charged with murder and work to identify victims is ongoing. Here's how what to know about what comes after a projected Liberal win. The South East Asian country is on a path to prosperity. The US-China trade war could change that.",

    "title": "Fifty years after the war, Vietnam faces a new US threat: tariffs",
    "article_text": "On a searing afternoon in Vietnam, Tung Linh declared she \"basically knows nothing\" about the bloody, decades-long war that pitted her country's Communist-run North against the United States-backed South. \"My grandparents fought in the war and because of that today we can look at the sky and see an airplane and we don't feel scared, like they did,\" says the 20-year-old college student. Stuck to her right cheek was a little yellow star on a red rectangle - the Vietnamese flag. Like her, Ho Chi Minh City, where she lived, was gearing up to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the end of the war, when the Communists triumphed. Today's Vietnam is a remarkably different country than the one American troops withdrew from in defeat – it's enterprising, it's growing fast and it's getting richer. Its authoritarian Communist leadership has embraced capitalism. They aspire to follow in China's footsteps, and have ploughed money and effort into becoming a reliable manufacturing hub, even an alternative to China. But that is a risky ambition during US President Donald Trump's trade war – it's partly why he is threatening a 46% levy against the South East Asian nation. That could shatter the country's economic potential. Vietnam was a French colony, a Chinese vassal and for 20 years, the proxy battlefield in America's bloody struggle to stop China spreading communism across South East Asia. But it cannot escape its geography. Nestled beneath China's wide rump, it is once again on the frontline in a new American battle –which hopes to stem Beijing's rise as an economic superpower. Vietnam is a young country in a hurry. The median age is 33, considerably younger than Thailand or China (40), and far younger than Japan (50). \"I want to do a job that will bring more success to Vietnam,\" said Linh in fluent English. She is studying economics and marketing. \"And yes, success for me too,\" she admits, with a smile, when prodded. It's a dream that suits her bustling city – now a sprawling metropolis of 10 million people, Ho Chi Minh City has the same choking traffic, glass-clad skyscrapers, five-star hotels, restaurants and seedy massage parlours as any Asian mega city. You would be hard put to find traces of the socialist ideology that led to the city's capture in 1975, when it was the capital of South Vietnam. The victors renamed it city Ho Chi Minh, after the revolutionary father of North Vietnam. But to locals, it is still Saigon. And when it fell on this day 50 years ago, South Vietnam ceased to exist as North Vietnamese tanks smashed through the tall iron gates of the presidential compound and raised the red flag with a yellow star over the presidential palace. America's ally, the southern regime, was vanquished. Its last president had fled the previous day. More than two decades of bitter conflict was over. The victory had come at an enormous cost. An estimated three million dead and millions more injured. Between 1968 and 1975, a greater tonnage of bombs was dropped on this slender piece of land than in all theatres in World War Two. But few here want to talk about the war even as they celebrate the anniversary of their \"reunification\". Linh and her friends screamed in delight as a truck carrying soldiers drove past. The shy idols waved back – they were on their way to the barracks after rehearsals for the anniversary parade. \"I am excited because this is the day when we reunited, when we became one country again,\" Linh said. Her answer sounded a little rehearsed, not least because of the government-appointed minder who accompanied the BBC throughout. But her enthusiasm for her future – and her country's - is not uncommon. A little further down the road, 18-year-old Minh, who did not want to share her last name, told us she was studying to be a lawyer so she could \"become successful\".  With a laugh, she added: \"And rich!\" When we asked about how young people feel about Americans, the minder winced visibly and tried to stop her answering. \"We're not angry,\" she says. \"We don't hate them. That was the past. Now we want to trade with America. You know globalisation? We want to learn from America.\" Vietnam's new leaders appear to have the same ambition. In January the country's new Communist party chief, To Lam, embarked on a program to slash bureaucracy that could impress Elon Musk, who has been overseeing the Trump administration's controversial cost-cutting team. The country's 63 provinces and municipalities are being reduced to 34, and government ministries and agencies cut from 30 to 17. This year, 100,000 government employees are being laid off, according to official estimates. The ambition is huge. So far only one country in South East Asia, Singapore, has managed to escape the \"middle-income trap\", where economic growth slows before countries become rich. Vietnam, whose economy is growing at a steady 5%, intends to be the second. It has flung its doors wide open to investment – and is welcoming back those it once drove from its shores. After the 1975 victory around two million southern Vietnamese fled the country. Many were ethnic Chinese. They packed on to flimsy boats and set out across the South China Sea. They became known as \"the boat people\". Today their descendants make up a diaspora of nearly six million stretching from the United States and Canada to France, Germany, Japan and Taiwan. \"Since 2017, I have promoted many Taiwanese companies to invest in Vietnam, and I myself am an advisor to several large electronics companies that I brought here,\" said Lisa Wu, who was born in Saigon but spent three decades in Taiwan. Now she is back. \"The most attractive thing is that the Vietnamese government is very supportive. The electronics industry is expanding out of China and a lot will choose Vietnam.\" It's no coincidence this shift began around 2018, when Trump declared his first trade war against China. Two young businesswomen from southern China, who did not want to share their names, tell us they have spent the last two years setting up a shoe factory here: \"Now it's ready to go.\" They plan to export to the US. They are concerned about the possibility of higher tariffs for Vietnam - it currently faces a 10% levy, like most of the world – but \"it's a lot better here than China\", they say with a laugh. Chinese imports to the US face a range of tariffs that go up to 245% for some goods. Still, Vietnam is feeling the impact, Ms Wu said. \"I had several factories preparing to begin operations here this May. But because of the policy change, all have stopped and everyone is waiting.\" Vietnam is again being asked to choose – America or China. But it's not a choice it can or will make because it needs both. Less than two weeks ago, they rolled out the red carpet to welcome Chinese leader Xi Jinping in the capital Hanoi. Warm words were spoken of fraternal friendship and support. But relations with their big neighbour are trickier than they may appear. For years, Vietnam has walked a tightrope between Washington and Beijing – the latter's expansive ambitions can be a threat to neighbours, especially growing economies that are keen to woo US businesses. As Vietnam insists on \"looking forward\", it appears to have almost forgotten the men and women who fought in the jungles and through the hell of American bombs. But even they say there must be no return to the past. \"I used to have a scar here,\" says Le Thanh Gian, pointing to his right hand, where a bullet had once lodged. \"There are still some pieces of shrapnel in my body that couldn't be removed. There were battles where it seemed like we would all be killed. But some of us survived while others fell.\" But he says he bears no anger anymore. \"We must have peace. We have already made a lot of progress. People's lives are more prosperous and fulfilled. Now we must work together with the Americans for the future.\" Here is a selection of those answered by our staff writers and correspondents. Donald Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain about the plan, which the company said had been rejected. The president said the move would give companies relief while they adjust their supply chains. A long-time critic of Beijing, Perdue has called for a 'nuanced' and 'strategic' approach to China Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Canada's PM says he will only visit the US when there is a \"serious discussion to be had\".",

    "title": "Warning shops could be forced to accept cash in future",
    "article_text": "Shops and services may have to be forced to accept cash in the future to help protect vulnerable people who rely on it, MPs have said. A Treasury Committee report into cash acceptance stopped short of recommending a change in the law, but said the government had to improve its monitoring of the issue. \"There may come a time in the future where it becomes necessary for HM Treasury to mandate cash acceptance if appropriate safeguards have not been implemented for those who need physical cash,\" the report said. Some countries, such as Australia or parts of the EU, are planning requirements to accept cash for essential services in some circumstances. In evidence to the inquiry, a government minister said there were no plans to make cash acceptance mandatory. Shops and services can currently accept whichever form of payment they want. With an increasing number going card-only, the committee said prices would rise for essential goods and services in the remaining outlets that accepted cash. That would create a poverty premium for those who wanted to use cash to budget, as well as for vulnerable groups such as people with learning difficulties and the elderly. \"A sizeable minority depend on being able to use cash,\" said Dame Meg Hillier, who chairs the influential Treasury Committee. She said the report should be a \"wake-up call\" about the risks of ignoring those affected by the falling use of banknotes and coins. The committee called on the government to \"vastly improve\" monitoring and reporting of cash acceptance levels. Otherwise it warned it risked people being excluded from leisure centres, theatres or public transport. It also heard evidence about frustrated motorists unable to pay by cash in car parks. \"The government is in the dark on how widely cash is being accepted and that is completely unsustainable,\" said Dame Meg. There was particular concern for victims of domestic and economic abuse who need cash to avoid being traced through card transactions or to gain financial independence from abusive partners. The committee's report is one of the most significant developments in the debate over the future of notes and coins since theAccess to Cash Review, published in 2019 which called for urgent action on the viability of cash. Among this latest report's findings is a conclusion that for some businesses, such as market stallholders, cash remains fundamental to the preservation of their trade. There has been a market in Epsom, Surrey, for centuries - but it is only in recent years that traders have seen the majority of shoppers switch to electronic payments. Chris Ilsley has been running his plant stall - CI Plants - on the market for 13 years. When he started it was 100% cash, now it is 70% to 80% card payments. Speaking surrounded by geraniums, he said he was happy to take any form of payment, although card was slightly easier albeit slower to process. \"We'll take anything,\" the 47-year-old said. \"I prefer the older generation to use card and put their purse away [for safety].\" Over at The Fruit Machine greengrocer stall, Tom Cresswell also has a long line of customers, and he said most paid by card. \"The youngsters don't ever pay by cash; they pay with their phones and their watches,\" the 52-year-old said. \"The older gentlemen tend to use cash. Whatever is easier for the customer.\" The report comes as the Post Office announced a renewed deal with banks to ensure customers can access basic banking services at post office counters. The deal, which runs until the end of 2030 allows customers of 30 banks and building societies to use their local post office to withdraw and deposit cash, make balance queries and deposit cheques. Some campaigners have called for cash acceptance to be enforced by the law now. Ron Delnevo, from the Payments Choice Alliance, said he was disappointed about the \"procrastinating approach\" of the committee. The Treasury said the government was committed to seeing 350 banking hubs in place. \"We welcome businesses who do want to continue accepting cash and new rules introduced by the Financial Conduct Authority support this by helping them to make deposits,\" a spokesman said. The BBC understands food availability should be back to normal by the end of the week. Adidas says trade tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump will lead to price rises for US consumers. A community shop says, on average, 20 families use its free school uniform service every day. A support centre says people are coming in \"petrified\" about planned benefit changes. Business and consumer confidence is expected to suffer from the disruption to trade, an economic forecaster says.",

    "title": "Robot vacuums 'could water plants or play with cat'",
    "article_text": "Scientists have reprogrammed a robot vacuum cleaner to help charge a phone and assist in a home workout because they think the machines are currently too \"idle\". Researchers from the University of Bath say the increasingly popular domestic appliances are, on average, in use for less than two hours per day, but could be working considerably harder - with some modifications. To prove their point, they retrained a Roomba device to carry out a range of other chores, and outlined many more possible tasks it could do such as playing with a cat and watering the plants. Such robots \"are perceived as limited, single-task devices but there is a strong argument that they are under-used for practical tasks\", said Yoshiaki Shiokawa, the authorof the study. The global household robots market size was valued at $10.3bn (£7.7bn) in 2023and is anticipatedto hit $24.5bn by 2028, meaning such devices are an increasingly common sight in people's homes. Anyone who has watched a robot vacuum cleaner in action may argue these ideas are a little far-fetched, given that current machines sometimes struggle with the challenges presented by rugs and shoelaces while carrying out their core function. However, scientists from the University of Bath and the University of Calgary in Canada, have set out to prove that cleaners - and similar devices, such as lawnmowers - could be reprogrammed and modified relatively easily. Their study identified 100 functions the robots could possibly perform with simple adjustments. The scientists then reprogrammed a Roomba robot vacuum cleaner to perform four of them: Other proposed tasks suggested by the scientists include a reprogrammed robot that carried the groceries from the car to the kitchen. Mr Shiokawa, a PhD student in the department of computer science at Bath, said the project proved that \"after making minimal adjustments, a Roomba can serve multiple roles around the home\". \"For most of the day, they sit idle\", he lamented. He added that taking on some new tasks involved some upgrades the average vacuum owner probably would not have lying around their homes, such as a cart, a helmet and a robotic arm. Nonetheless, he said people should be expecting more of their robots. \"We should be extending their utility beyond their primary tasks by programming them to physically navigate the home to perform a range of additional functions,\" he said. The study's co-author Dr Adwait Sharma agreed, saying the device's \"idle time\" presented \"unique opportunities\" to meet the \"growing need for adaptable robots and integrated systems that can seamlessly fit into our daily lives\".",

    "title": "Mescal and Stormzy set for National Theatre shows",
    "article_text": "Theatre audiences will get a double dose of Paul Mescal in 2027, after the Irish actor signed up for two productions at the National Theatre. The star of Normal People and Gladiator II will appear in two classic 20th Century plays - Death of a Salesman and A Whistle in the Dark. The shows are among a raft of new productions that were announced by the prestigious London venue's new artistic director Indhu Rubasingham on Tuesday. Other stars coming to the National's stage over the next two years include recent Oscar nominee Monica Barbaro and Bridgerton's Nicola Coughlan, while rap artist Stormzy will collaborate with the theatre on a new production. Rubasinghamwas named artistic directorin December 2023, taking over from Rufus Norris after his decade in charge. The National's Lyttelton Theatre will return to a repertory model for the first time since 2020, meaning multiple shows will be staged concurrently featuring the same cast. As part of a new repertory run,Paul Mescalwill make his National Theatre debut in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman and Tom Murphy's A Whistle in the Dark. Despite having different settings and cultural backgrounds, bosses said the two shows shared common themes of dysfunctional family relationships and the weight of societal and familial expectations. Mescal, who won an Olivier Award in 2023 for A Streetcar Named Desire, will play Biff Loman in Death of a Salesman. It has not yet been announced who will play the character's father Willy, who is central to the play. US actressMonica Barbaro, recently nominated for an Oscar for playing Joan Baez opposite Timothee Chalamet in Bob Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown, will appear in a revival of romance drama Les Liaisons Dangereuses. She and Poldark starAidan Turnerwill make their National Theatre debuts in the show alongsideLesley Manville. Meanwhile, Derry Girls starSiobhán McSweeney, Bridgerton'sNicola Coughlanand The Sixth Commandement'sÉanna Hardwickewill appear together in John Millington Synge's Irish classic The Playboy of the Western World. A new collaboration between the theatre and rap artistStormzywas also announced, but details have not yet been revealed. It is a project Rubasingham first pitched as part of her application for the job, saying his involvement would make for a \"cut-through show that goes beyond theatre\". After being appointed, Rubasingham joked she spent \"six to eight months doggedly pursuing Stormzy and his team\", and he came on board after visiting the building. She said the project was \"very exciting\" and confirmed it would be \"a piece with his music\", but added: \"I'm not saying more than that.\" In a statement, Stormzy said he had \"always been drawn to theatre\" and said he and Rubasingham \"properly hit it off\" when they met. \"I'm excited to go on this creative journey with her,\" he added. Elsewhere, Black Panther starLetitia Wrightwill appear in The Story, a new play by US writer Tracey Scott Wilson about an ambitious black journalist who defies her editor to pursue an incendiary lead. Other productions announced on Tuesday included: Born in Sheffield and with Sri-Lankan heritage,Rubasingham is the seventh artistic directorsince the National was founded by Sir Laurence Olivier in 1963, and the first woman to hold the position. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, she pledged that the National's next chapter would be known for telling \"bold stories in big ways, which cross continents, move hearts and open minds\". \"It's making sure that audiences who love the National and have been going there for 40 or 50 years are still wanting to be part of it, as well as attracting audiences that don't feel welcome or don't know the National,\" she said. Asked whether she would want the National to eventually return to the levels of repertory theatre being performed at the venue before the pandemic, Rubasingham  replied: \"If the finances allowed, it would be really wonderful. \"It is more expensive to rep,\" she noted, \"but there are a lot of advantages in terms of taking riskier work, and allowing word of mouth.\" Osea Island, a secluded retreat reached by a causeway, is popular with stars seeking privacy. Abaka Debrah's novel Where Geezers Call Home has won the New Writers' Prize on Stormzy's #Merky Books label. The university is honouring eight people, including former Olympian Dame Katherine Grainger. From Jade's problematic dress, to Stormzy's eye injury - here's what really went down at the Brits.

    "title": "'World's shortest festival' brings buzz to islands",
    "article_text": "A festival on a sandbar brought 90 minutes of merriment to hundreds of people in the Isles of Scilly. The Low Tide Event took place in the channel between Tresco and Bryher, which is usually under 20ft (6m) of water, when the sea level subsided. Tom Matthews, co-organiser, told BBC Radio Cornwall: \"If you can imagine a few hundred people gathering in the middle of the sea. \"We do have a klaxon because we have to say at some point, 'You really do need to go now'.\" The celebration began at about 11:40 BST and featured picnic benches, bars on the back of tractors and food served straight from a boat at high tide. Describing the event as a \"huge success\", Mr Matthews said there was a big age range: \"I spoke to an 87-year-old lady out enjoying the event with her granddaughter, and the next minute was chatting to a mum and her six-month-old baby,\" he said. He added there was a \"buzz in the air\" and \"perfect weather\". \"You look out from the hillside and it's like a load of ants crawling out on to the sandbar,\" he said. \"It's an event that really brings the islands together - we have stalls from both sides of the Tresco and Bryher channel, and people travel from across Scilly, Cornwall and beyond to attend this event. \"It's magical seeing such a diverse group of people celebrating at such a unique event. \"We're really proud of what the event has become, and what it brings to the islands, and to people's holidays. I'm sure it creates memories to last a lifetime.\" Mr Matthews said \"super low tides\" affect the two islands, which are about 200m (656ft) apart, twice a year. \"It's probably the only festival that's dependent on air pressure, which dictates how far the tide goes out and how long we can stay on the sandbar,\" he said. \"It's a really spectacular event.\" Mr Matthews said they always spent the build-up \"peeking at the weather forecast\", adding: \"We've got it down a fine art now, basically we take everything we need out there.\" The first Low Tide Event was held in 2015 and Mr Matthews said organisers wanted to do \"something you can't do anywhere else in the world\". \"Then we found ourselves in the position that we couldn't stop if we wanted to because people plan their holidays around it now. \"It must be the world's shortest pop-up festival.\" Issy Tibbs, who lives in Bryher, said seeing \"everybody come together in the middle of the channel\" made it an \"incredible event\".

    "title": "The Alarm singer Mike Peters dies aged 66",
    "article_text": "Mike Peters, front man of Welsh rockers The Alarm and a long-standing cancer campaigner and fundraiser, has died aged 66. His band was formed in 1981 in Rhyl, Denbighshire, out of the punk era and had a top 20 hit, Sixty Eight Guns, two years later. It typified an anthemic style of song but their unpretentious and down-to-earth approach earned loyal followings on both sides of the Atlantic. Peters lived with blood cancer for 30 years, following his diagnosis of lymphoma in 1995, and later having chronic lymphocytic leukaemia twice. He was born in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, and lived in Dyserth with his wife of 39 years, Jules - who had fought her own cancer battle - and their sons Dylan, 20 and Evan, 18. He was awarded the MBE in 2019 for his services to cancer care. Peters - who had worked in the computer department for Kwik Save supermarket - had started the band The Toilets in Rhyl in 1977, after seeing the Sex Pistols play in Chester. After various changes of line-up, notably the introduction of guitarist Dave Sharp, and changes of name, The Alarm played their first gig in Prestatyn in 1981. They would go on to sell an estimated five million records and also become the first Welsh musicians since Tom Jones and Bonnie Tyler to crack America. Thanks to a support slot with U2 on their 1983 US tour, The Alarm gained a transatlantic following - not an inconsiderable achievement. Their debut album Declaration was released in 1984. As well as Sixty Eight Guns, it also included another favourite, Blaze of Glory. The band had honed their live performances by extensive touring, and were also reliable \"go-to\" support choice for big names - which included Bob Dylan, Queen and U2 again - including an appreciative crowd at Cardiff's National Stadium in 1987. Despite their travels, The Alarm still had strong bonds with their homeland and Peters was able to live quietly in north Wales. The band also released a Welsh-language version of their 1989 album Change, called Newid. Peters announced from the stage in London that he was quitting The Alarm in 1991 but continued to work with The Poets Of Justice, the line-up including his wife Jules. In 1999, Peters worked with The Cult guitarist Billy Duffy forming a band called Coloursound. Duffy said he felt the Welshman \"inspired millions of people\" during his career. \"(Music) was his lifeblood. Everything was an inspiration for him to express his feelings through music,\" he added. He reformed The Alarm in 2000 and also worked as the singer for Big Country for a couple of years from 2011. The Alarm has sold more than five million albums and had 16 UK Top 50 singles. Television presenter, and former The Alarm roadie, Gareth Jones said Mike Peters has been the \"most significant person\" in his life. He even gave him his nickname Gaz Top, which has stuck to this day. \"I would have never had a career if it wasn't for him and it's a hard day to know that he's not around anymore,\" he said. Jones said that The Alarm frontman had a positive effect on \"everyone\" around him. \"We loved together, we drank together, we played rock 'n' roll together,\" he added. \"We'll always be connected.\" In 2004, as a humorous stunt aimed at the music industry and its obsession with youth, Petersreleased a single called 45 RPM - a retro-punk song - under the pseudonym of The Poppy Fields. He pretended his group were teenagers from Chester, who mimed along to the video for the song. It entered the top 30. Thestoryline was perfect to be translated into a film, Vinyl- directed by Sara Sugarman, incidentally from Rhyl, and an Alarm fan. Peters was first diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 1995 and described his relationship with the cancer over the next two decades as like \"fighting a war\". At the end of 2005, the singer was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, which returned in 2015 before he went into remission. He co-founded the Love Hope Strength Foundation alongside his wife to help recruit bone marrow donors at live music shows. It also involved Peters and fellow musicians taking treks to the Himalayas, to peaks including Mount Kilimanjaro and Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon, in his native Wales. The charity's director, Kirsty Thomson, called him a \"brilliant advocate\" of the NHS, adding that he \"loved life like nobody else I know\". The 2007 concert was billed the \"world's highest\", watched by 3m online. In 2017, his Big Busk involved a walk between cancer wards at each north Wales hospital and ended on the summit of Snowdon. He would take his message to Washington and Westminster. Peters also filmed a documentary about his cancer fight and one with his wife Jules for BBC Wales about a year in their lives and her recovery from breast cancer, While We Still Have Time. Peters joined Bruce Springsteen on stage at charity concert in 2014 and musicians who had joined The Alarm for impromptu appearances ranged from Bono to Neil Young. Peters was affable and approachable and tireless in both his campaigning - and in continuing to tour with his music across Europe and the United States, as well as writing new material. There were also annual weekend events in Llandudno - The Gathering - which brought together fans from all over to celebrate the music of Peters and The Alarm. In March 2018, part of a tour of Germany was postponed after Peters suffered an allergic reaction to his medication. In 2025, he became ill again when his Richter syndrome - an aggressive form of lymphoma - returned. He said it would have killed him within two months if left untreated, adding music had kept him alive since his latest diagnosis. Peters said hehoped a highly specialised therapywhich \"re-programmes\" his immune cells would lead to a \"cancer free life\". \"It was devastating because it all happened in an instant,\" he said. \"There was no chance to even think about it.\" In 2018, he told Guitar World magazine that his \"simple message\" was \"to stay alive and appreciate every second you've got\". \"Live right up to the last breath and stay positive about the world, your family and the environment you live in.\" Brendan Cox, whose wife was killed in 2016, says the band's response was \"half an apology\". The band had been due to perform at the Eden Project on 4 July. The defendant spent two minutes in the house - but his victim was left with no chance of survival, court hears. The Irish band have a reputation for provocation, but a new row has led to rising scrutiny and anger. A school is building a sensory garden in memory of Elias, 5, who died from a rare brain tumour.",

    "title": "PSG pass masters make Rice and Arsenal's fears come true",
    "article_text": "Declan Rice warned his Arsenal team-mates of PSG's danger in the Champions League semi-final first leg Declan Rice captured the mood and flagged up the danger signals in his final message as Arsenal gathered in a huddle before they faced the formidable challenge of Paris St-Germain. \"If we don't have the ball, we die,\" Rice told his Arsenal team-mates as they finished their warm-up before the Champions League semi-final first leg at Emirates Stadium. Arsenal are not quite dead in the tie, but they are definitely struggling to stay alive  as they trail 1-0 going into the return in Paris - mainly because they were unable to carry out Rice's instructions in the crucial opening phases that shaped the game. The stage was set for Arsenal's first Champions League semi-final in 16 years by an extravagant display of fireworks and pyrotechnics, all against the backdrop of a huge banner covering the giant stands emblazoned with the words 'make it happen'. It was PSG who made it happen - and made it happen exactly in the manner Rice so clearly feared. Ousmane Dembele's fourth-minute finish across Arsenal keeper David Raya from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia's delivery was the culmination of a 26-pass move. It was PSG in a microcosm, Rice's warning delivered in the most painful manner. To emphasise PSG's domination in the first exchanges, they had a total of 71.6% possession in the first 26 minutes, the period of the game in which they threw a bucket of ice cold water over what had been a white-hot environment, laying the platform for the advantage they will take back to Paris for next Wednesday's second leg. In that same period, PSG had a remarkable passing accuracy of 86.5% in Arsenal's half, and the total ratio was 165 passes to 60. In effect, when Arsenal finally read Rice's memo, the most important damage had been inflicted. Arsenal pulled it around, having 55.4% possession for the rest of the game, but Rice knew what was coming and PSG were simply too good to stop early on. What Arteta and Arsenal learned from PSG clash We have to do something special in Paris - Arteta How Arteta, Flick and Luis Enrique are inspired by Guardiola Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said: \"We are disappointed with the result. We put so much into the game. We struggled for the first 10 or 15 minutes to get momentum and dominance but we are disappointed not to get a draw at least.\" He praised the quality that to Dembele's goal, saying: \"That is always the danger. Credit to them. They get out of a situation that is close. We had seven players behind the ball and they were clinical, sometimes you just have to recognise the talent of the individual.\" This was a different PSG to the one thatlost 2-0in tame fashion here in October as the Champions League started its new league table format, and how it showed. In the intervening months, coach Luis Enrique has fashioned a PSG side shot through with quality from back to front, while his personal attention has brought the best from brilliant teenager Desire Doue, while coaxing the best out of the enigmatic Dembele, who flattered to deceive at Barcelona. And, in what might be the final flourish of the current move away from the so-called 'Bling Bling' era of Kylian Mbappe, Lionel Messi and Neymar, they added the young Georgia genius Kvaratskhelia to a thrilling attack. The villain of PSG's piece at Emirates Stadium back in October was giant Italian keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who received particularly heavy criticism for allowing Bukayo Saka's free-kick to drift in past him. PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made up for his Emirates nightmare earlier in the competition But since then PSG have cut a swathe through the Premier League elite, as Manchester City were beaten in the table format, Liverpool went out on penalties in the last 16 and Aston Villa followed in the quarter-finals. And Donnarumma has been a key figure. He made amends for his previous Emirates nightmare here with crucial saves from Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard either side of half-time. Arsenal will feel those opportunities will offer hope in Paris, but they now have to take the game to PSG with measure as they try to claw back this slim deficit. In those circumstances, however, the French champions may just find that approach to their liking. There was frustration for Arsenal when Mikel Merino's smart header was ruled out after a Video Assistant Referee check early in the second half. As PSG exerted such control in the opening half-hour, winning the ball back with ease as Arsenal reeled, it was easy to see why Rice once again called it right when he expressed such frustration towards his midfield partner and disruptor Thomas Partey for picking up a yellow card in the comfortable second-leg win against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu, ruling him out of this meeting. Rice's same words will no doubt echo in Arsenal's ears at the Parc des Princes - but some things are easier said than done and it may already be too late to save their ambitions of reaching their first Champions League final since they lost to Barcelona in Paris in 2006. Hope will live on, but PSG have shown what a formidable proposition they have become. They will be firm favourites to face either Barcelona or Inter Milan in Munich.

It was an ultimately frustrating night for Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, who failed to convert any of their five shots on target. \"If you want to win the Champions League final, you have to do something special. We're going to have to do something special in Paris to be there,\" Arteta said. PSG dominated the opening 20 minutes of the match and, while the hosts grew into the game, they continued to be frustrated by the French side's solid defence, failing to score in a home Champions League match for the first time since February 2016. \"We have a lot of chances to be in that final. As I repeat myself, you have to do something special in the competition to have the right to be in the final. And the time to do it is going to be in Paris,\" said Arteta. Arsenal have not reached the final since 2005-06 while PSG are hunting a first Champions League trophy. As they did against Liverpool and Aston Villa earlier in the campaign, Luis Enrique's side relied on Italian keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to keep them out of trouble. The 26-year-old kept a clean sheet and made five saves - including important stops to deny Gabriel Martinelli and Leandro Trossard in one-on-one situations. \"At the end, we have two of our front players one v one with Donnarumma. If they scored the goal it is different. He made the saves, like he did against Liverpool and Villa, and that's the difference in the Champions League,\" Arteta said. But Enrique says the shot stopper was just doing his job. \"That's the work of a goalkeeper, no? Save the team, they work every day for that. in a semi-final, you need all the players,\" the Spaniard said.

    "title": "O'Sullivan in charge while Williams recovers against Higgins",
    "article_text": "Ronnie O'Sullivan has not won a tournament for 13 months and is playing only his third competitive match since January Ronnie O'Sullivan maintained his bid for a record eighth title in the modern era as he opened up a commanding 6-2 lead over Si Jiahui in the first session of their World Championship quarter-final. Should the Englishman advance on Wednesday, Zhao Xintong looks likely to be his opponent in the last four. The 28-year-old from China was in dominant mood as he extended his 6-2 advantage to 12-4 over Chris Wakelin in their best-of-25 encounter. Meanwhile, a compelling contest between four-time champion John Higgins and three-time winner Mark Williams is delicately poised at 8-8 heading into Wednesday's concluding session. O'Sullivan, who is appearing in only his third competitive match since January, took a scrappy opener before Si responded with a wonderful century break. However, the 22-year-old from China uncharacteristically missed a series of pots to allow 'The Rocket' to pull clear at 4-1 with three half-centuries. While Si responded with a 60 of his own to briefly reduce his arrears, another miss, on a black on its spot, proved costly as O'Sullivan pinched the seventh frame. The Englishman concluded with a stylish 121 break to underline his superiority. In the remaining quarter-final, Judd Trump produced a superb display of potting as he compiled his 101st and 102nd century breaks of the season to go 5-3 up on Luca Brecel. Their best-of-25 encounter will continue on Wednesday at 10:00 BST, when Higgins and Williams also return to complete their contest. World number one Trump is now only one away from equalling the record of 103 century breaks in a single campaign, set by Neil Robertson in 2013-14. Trump had raced 5-1 ahead, however, Belgium's Brecel, who won in Sheffield two years ago, fought back with breaks of 68 and 128 to leave the match delicately poised. Mark Williams (left) and John Higgins have won seven world titles between them Scotland's Higgins and Williams are part of snooker's fabled 'Class of 92', which also includes O'Sullivan. Williams, 50, became the oldest man to reach the last eight at the famous Sheffield venue since Steve Davis did so at the age of 52 in 2010, while Higgins turns 50 on 18 May, 13 days after the Crucible final. Yet, despite their advancing years, they remain among the game's elite set of players, with this affair reminiscent of the classic they served up in the 2018 final when the Welshman eventually triumphed 18-16. Having watched Higgins establish a 5-1 lead off the back of four half-century breaks, Williams responded by winning six of the next seven frames, with a run of 104 the highlight in the seventh frame. World number three Higgins dug in to win the 14th frame and appeared to have recaptured his rhythm with a 70 to edge back in front at 8-7. However, when he missed a long red to the top right corner in the 16th frame, Williams was able to make a contribution of 65 to level the match. 'How are we still here?' - Class of 92 graduates still going strong 'National hero' - China's pursuit of an elusive world title Tuesday's action: All the updates from day 11 at the Crucible Zhao's form and rampant display against Wakelin suggest he could well become the first amateur to taste success at the Crucible. While Wakelin has already defeated 2010 winner Neil Robertson and former world number one Mark Allen, the Englishman found himself totally outplayed in their first two sessions on Tuesday. While Wakelin, 33, made a break of 93 to take the opening frame in the morning,  Zhao then reeled off six in a row. And the pattern continued when play resumed in the evening, with the 28-year-old racing towards a first semi-final appearance. Zhao, a former UK Championship winner, was one of 10 players from China to receive a ban in a match-fixing scandal. He did not directly throw a match, but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches and betting on matches himself. Zhao - who served a 20-month ban for those offences - is the only of the 10 players sanctioned in the scandal to have returned to action. As a result of the ban, he lost his place on the World Snooker Tour, although he has already ensured he will be back on the tour full-time next season. For this tournament, he is officially classed as an amateur and this is his seventh match of the competition, after he had to fight through four qualifying rounds to reach the main draw.",

    "title": "'Why hit a single when you can hit six?' - the making of a teen IPL star",
    "article_text": "Vaibhav Suryavanshi has the highest strike-rate of all batters in this year's IPL Why hit a single when you can hit the ball for a six? That was the very question posed by 14-year-old batting sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi to one of his first coaches in professional cricket. \"Vaibhav was hitting sixes and fours off almost every ball,\" recalls Manish Ojha, a former first-class cricketer for Jharkhand. \"After the session, I said: 'Vaibhav, why are you only hitting boundaries? The state matches are a four-day format and we will need you to take more singles.' He replied: 'Sir, if I can hit a ball for six, why would I take a single off it?' That's when I realised he was ready for the next level.\" That six-hitting lit up the most glamourous of cricketing stages on Monday when the teenager became the youngest player to score a century in men's T20 cricket. Batting for Rajasthan Royals against Gujarat Titans, he took down some of the world's best bowlers in a scintillating 38-ball innings that included 11 sixes and seven fours. Experienced international bowlers Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar and Rashid Khan were treated with the same disdain as those unlucky 12-year-olds who netted with Suryavanshi a couple of years earlier. 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi stuns the IPL 'Remember the name' - cricket world reacts to Suryavanshi century Vaibhav's entry to the IPL has been dramatic. He started his career with a six off the first ball he faced and went on to score a hundred in just his third appearance. Born in Samastipur, a small district in India's Bihar, he quickly showed promise. Vaibhav's father, Sanjeev Suryavanshi, himself a club-level cricketer, saw a spark in his son. But there were no proper academies around the district, so he started his training at home from the age of five. Sanjeev, who used to run a small shop, began to realise his son needed a proper coach. So when Vaibhav turned eight, his father decided to take him to Patna city, a three-hour journey away. \"Many people would tell him: 'What are you doing?' But he was the first person to believe in Vaibhav's abilities,\" said Robin Singh, a coach from Bihar. \"To ensure his son trained well and got to use the best facilities, his father had to sell a plot of land. His mother had to make a lot of sacrifices too. She would wake up at three in the morning to prepare breakfast for him and would even send food for the coaches.\" Vaibhav impressed his new coaches in no time. \"When I started working with him, I found him quite different from others. You would give him a demo of a technique or a shot, and he would pick it up in no time,\" Ojha said. \"Most of the players adopt things easily in practice, but when it comes to playing matches, they fail. But the unique feature about Vaibhav was that he would execute things perfectly even during high-pressure matches.\" Vaibhav was always ahead of his age group. From his strokeplay to game awareness, he would stand out. \"Within 10 days of playing alongside the kids of his age, we realised we were wasting his time. So, we started making him practise with senior players,\" Singh recalled. Vaibhav would practise daily from 7.30am to 4pm, facing 450 balls each day. By the time he was 12, his coaches were confident enough to let him pursue cricket professionally. He played for the Bihar under-19s team and amassed consistent runs, prompting selectors to name him in the India Under-19s team. Aged just 13, he smashed a 58-ball hundred in a youth Test against Australia. He was soon drafted into Bihar's squad for the Ranji Trophy (India's premier first-class tournament) before becoming the youngest player to get a contract at the IPL auction as Rajasthan signed him for Â£103,789 (1.1 crore rupees) in December 2024. \"Vaibhav's role model is Brian Lara, so his game is aggressive, and he plays the ball on merit without any fear at all,\" Ojha added. \"We expected him to get an IPL contract, and our joy doubled the moment Rajasthan Royals got him because they have [India legend] Rahul Dravid on their coaching staff.\" Singh added: \"When he became the youngest to debut in first-class cricket, I told him: 'Anyone can become the youngest. I'll be happy when you become the youngest centurion.' So yesterday he called me up after scoring the century and said: 'Sir, youngest centurion.' And I couldn't be prouder.\" Almost half of the runs Suryavanshi has scored in the IPL (46%) have come through the mid-wicket and long-on region. He is particularly savage against pace bowling, scoring more than 100 runs at a strike-rate of 243 in this season's IPL against the quicker men Suryavanshi has already been nicknamed Boss Baby in cricketing circles by those who see comparisons with Chris Gayle, aka The Universe Boss. West Indian Gayle still holds the record for the fastest IPL century, having taken just 30 balls in 2013, but nobody else has scored one quicker in the competition, while he easily beat the record of 18 years and 118 days for the fastest T20 century which was previously held by Maharashtra's Vijay Zol. Sachin Tendulkar - the greatest run-scorer of all time - made his India debut aged just 16, and Suryavanshi's former coach believe he will soon follow The Little Master into the national team. \"A guy from a small village in Bihar has made it to the IPL. The whole world is talking about him. So, he knows how to open doors. Don't be surprised if he makes it to international level soon,\" Singh said. Before then, Suryavanshi, who has been gifted almost Â£9,000 by his state government following his IPL century, has his sights set on title-chasing Mumbai Indians on Thursday, where he comes face-to-face with Jasprit Bumrah, the world's best bowler.

    "title": "'Conman Usyk deserves an Oscar' - Team Dubois",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Dubois shove showed weakness - Oleksandr Usyk Heavyweight Daniel Dubois' trainer told Oleksandr Usyk he \"conned the boxing world\" as the two champions met in London before this summer's undisputed title fight. Pound-for-pound star Usyk beat Dubois via a ninth-round stoppage inAugust 2023but was dropped by a body shot, which was declared a low blow, earlier in the fight. They will contest a rematch â this time for all four world titles â at Wembley Stadium on 19 July. At a news conference on Tuesday Usyk presented Dubois with several images which showed an angle of the punch landing below the belt-line, and asked the Londoner to sign the photos. \"It's disappointing me that you would stoop as low as bringing one of those photographs,\" Dubois' coach Don Charles said. \"You should be given an Oscar for that performance. You conned the referee. You conned us. You conned the boxing world.\" A smirking Usyk replied: \"You should teach your fighter to punch clean.\" With the low blow conversation dominating the news conference, a bored Usyk took it upon himself to end the event, abruptly standing up and saying: \"Thank you everyone. We'll go to training camp. See you later.\" A long face-off ended with Dubois, 27, looking away. There was no repeat of Monday's promotional face-off whenDubois pushedthe 38-year-old Ukrainian. Dubois shove showed weakness - Usyk Eubank discharged from hospital Promoters Frank Warren and Alex Krassyuk sat on the top table for around half an hour, patiently waiting for the fighters. An energetic Dubois â wearing an understated tracksuit - eventually jogged on to the stage and saluted Warren. Showman Usyk high-fived his team, bowed to around 50 or so members of the media and sang along to a Ukrainian song. Dressed in a combat-like vest, he took his seat and began quietly reciting prayers while he clutched rosary beads. Unsurprisingly, the conversation almost immediately turned to the punch from 21 months ago. \"As I sit here now, all day long that was an illegal blow. It's not about the belt line it's wear the navel is,\" Warren said. Usyk continued to mouth his prayers and later put his head on the table in boredom. He was then involved in another war of words with Charles' son, heavyweight George Fox. On Monday, Usyk suggested to Fox they should have a \"street fight\" with four members of their respective teams. Fox, who was sitting at the back of the room a day later, said Usyk - a man who has defended his country against the Russian invasion - must have been rattled. Usyk had photographs ready for Dubois and his promoter Frank Warren to sign Team Usyk also had a 'boxing lesson' leaflet prepared to Dubois and his team Usyk will defend his WBA (Super), WBO and WBC titles and hope to reclaim the IBF strap Dubois currently holds Usyk became boxing's firstfour-belt heavyweight championwhen he beat Tyson Fury in May 2024. Unbeaten in 23 pro fights, Usyk is an Olympic gold medallist and former undisputed cruiserweight champion. The Crimea-born champion's two wins over Tyson Fury cemented his legacy as a generational â with the potential to go down as an all-time - great. His technical prowess is unmatched, but Dubois promised \"to put him to sleep\". Dubois is a fighter in a rich vein of form, having recorded impressive stoppage wins over Jarrel Miller, Filip Hrgovic and two-time world champion Anthony Joshua in his past three fights. \"I'm on fire now. I'm just pent up and ready to go. It's going to be a bloodbath. I'm going to put all the controversy and all that nonsense to rest. I'm a man of the future,\" he said. \"[Usyk] will be doing a funny dance in the ring when I hit him.\" This video can not be played Dubois will 'explode' if announced heavyweight boxing champion Boxing schedule and results 2025 Watch every Born to Brawl episode Notifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "title": "Fears for health of Alaa Abd el-Fattah and mother as hunger strikes take toll",
    "article_text": "The family of the imprisoned British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah say they fear for his health along with that of his mother, Laila Soueif, as both continued their hunger strikes to demand his freedom. Relatives of Soueif said they were worried she was “dying in slow motion” after eight monthson full or partial hunger strike. “What are we supposed to do, just sit around and wait to die?” said Soueif. Fattah, who is in prison near Cairo, received medical treatment for vomiting and severe stomach pains earlier this week, after consuming nothing but herbal tea, black coffee and rehydration salts for more than 55 days. He began a hunger strike on the day his mother was admitted to St Thomas’ hospital in London in February, almost 150 days into her own hunger strike, where she received a glucose drip intended to save her life. Soueif started a hunger strike last September, after Fattah reached five years in prison – the length of his sentence – in the Wadi el-Natrun desert prison. The Egyptian authorities, who jailed him on terrorism charges for a social media post about torture, claim his sentence will end in January 2027, discounting the period he spent in pre-trial detention, which is normally included in the sentence. “Alaa started his strike when he was notified that I’d gone into hospital. Now he’s sick, alone, in prison and we did not even know about it until he had been sick for a week. What more can we do?” said Soueif, who has grown increasingly desperate, saying that the British prime minister,Keir Starmer, is not doing enough to free her son. Fattah became a British citizen through Soueif in 2021 while incarcerated. His family had hoped that acquiring British citizenship would rapidly increase pressure on the Egyptian authorities to free the author, computer programmer and activist who is known as one of the Arab world’s most prominent prisoners of conscience. Earlier this year, Soueif began a daily sit-in while on hunger strike at the gates of Downing Street in an attempt to pressure Starmer to speak directly with the Egyptian president,Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, and demand he free her son. She met with Starmer in mid February. When her blood sugar dropped to dangerous levels after months without food, Soueif was hospitalised later that month. The prime minister told parliament soon afterwards that “I will do everything I can, to ensure the release in this case, and that includes phone calls as necessary. I’ve raised it before. I’ll raise it again. We raise it, and will continue to do so. I gave my word to the family that that’s what I’d do. That I will do, and I will.” He spoke to Sisi on 28 February where he “pressed for Alaa’s release”,according to a Downing Street readoutof their call. That conversation prompted Soueif to switch to a partial hunger strike of 300 calories per day, and she was discharged from hospital in early March. But in the two months since Starmer and Sisi spoke, there have been few signs of a shift from either government. “I started taking some 300 calories a day when the prime minister and President Sisi talked. But that was two months ago now and nothing has happened,” said Soueif. A spokesperson for the UK Foreign Office said that “securing the release of Mr el-Fattah remains an absolute priority, so that he can be reunited with his family. We continue to press for consular access.” The UK foreign minister, David Lammy, spoke with his Egyptian counterpart on 9 April, they added. Soueif’s nephew Omar Robert Hamilton said his aunt’s health was failing as she attempted to survive on a partial hunger strike. The 68-year-old activist and mathematics professor appears withered after months without real sustenance and is no longer able to stand upright. “Three hundred calories a day is not enough to sustain life, her muscles are being eaten away,” he said. “It’s like she is dying in slow motion.”",

    "title": "Canada election: Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre loses seat he held since 2004",
    "article_text": "Canada’s Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, has lost his own seat in the country’s general election, in a stunning blow for the 45-year-old career politician who until recently had beenwidely expected tobecome the country’s next prime minister. Although Conservatives increased both their seat count and vote share,Mark Carney’s Liberal party secured control of parliament, and Poilievre’s defeat in the Carleton electoral district is certain to fuel mounting questions over his future as party leader. Once considered a long shot, the Liberal party candidate Bruce Fanjoy flipped the Carleton riding which Poilievre had held for seven consecutive elections. The two men were among 91 candidates on the ballot – most of whom were part of a protest calling for electoral reform. In a speech late on Monday, Poilievre conceded the election, but pledged to stay on as Conservative leader, saying it was an “honour” to hold the role. “To my fellow Conservatives, we have much to celebrate tonight. We’ve gained well over 20 seats,” Poilievre said. “We are cognizant of the fact that we didn’t quite get over the finish line. Yet we know that change is needed, but change is hard to come by. It takes time.” But without a seat in the House of Commons, Poilievre cannot serve as leader of the official opposition, and it is alsounclear if he can retain his residenceat Stornoway, the official residence of the opposition leader. If he does stay on as leader, Poilievre will need a Conservative MP to sacrifice their seat, allowing to him run in the by-election to fill the vacancy. That process takes time – Canada’s governor general must call the election between 11 and 180 days after being notified of the seat vacancy – and in all likelihood, Poilievre would not be able to return to parliament until the fall sitting. In recent weeks, Conservative officials confirmed to the Guardian that there was growing tension within the party over Poilievre’s leadership – and speculation that he would soon be forced out. “There will be a need for bloodletting,” said one senior member. “That could be the leader, or it could be the campaign manager. But there are some who feel the party fell far short of its goal – to win. And there is a price.” Poilievre became the youngest MP in Canadian history at the age of 25, and became Conservative leader in 2022. A sharp-tongued political brawler who cultivated a populist image, he became a lightning rod for discontent with the former prime ministerJustin Trudeauover whom he at one point enjoyed a 25-point lead. WhenDonald Trumpbegan to threaten Canada’s economy and autonomy – and then Trudeau stood down to be replaced by Mark Carney – Poilievre found himself on the wrong side of a surge of patriotic anger. Despite Poilievre’s personal defeat, the Conservatives did, however, win enough seats to form the largest official opposition in Canadian history at the expense of other opposition parties. And Poilievre was not the only party leader to lose his place in parliament: Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democrats also failed to retain his Burnaby seat as the party saw its vote share collapse. “It’s been the honour of my life to represent the people of Burnaby Central,” he said in an emotional speech, in which he announced his resignation as party leader. “Tonight they chose a new member of parliament and I wish them well.” The New Democrats – who held the balance of power after the 2021 federal election – were on track to lose 17 of the 24 seats they had in the last parliament and are likely to lose official party status. The loss of party status means the NDP will lose certain parliamentary privileges, including the ability to ask questions during question period as often as recognized parties. The NDP will also lose out on accessing money allocated to parties for research purposes, which is distributed proportionally to the number of seats held by a recognized party. The Green party’s co-leader Jonathan Pedneault also lost his bid to represent a district in Montreal.",

    "title": "‘Trump wanted to break us’, says Carney as Liberals triumph in Canadian election",
    "article_text": "Mark Carneyhas used his victory speech to claimDonald Trumpwanted to “break us” as he led Canada’s Liberal party to a fourth term in office, in a race that was upended by threats and aggression from the US president. The Liberal triumph capped a miraculous political resurrection and marked a landmark victory for Carney, the former central banker and political novice who only recently succeeded Justin Trudeau as prime minister. Results on Tuesday confirmed that the Liberals fell just short of a majority government and would therefore need the support of political rivals to govern. Mirroring a theme of the campaign, Carney told election-night supporters that Trump wanted to “break us, so that America can own us”, adding: “That will never, ever happen,” to shouts from the crowd. He also gave a stark assessment of a world order once defined by an integrated global trading system with the US at the centre, saying such a system was over, and he pledged to reshape Canada’s relationships with other nations. “We are over the shock over American betrayal. But we will never forget the lessons,” he said. Later on Tuesday, the two leaders struck a more conciliatory tone and agreed to meet “in the near future”, according to Carney’s office, which said Trump had congratulated the prime minister for his victory. “The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together – as independent, sovereign nations – for their mutual betterment,” it said. In a shock result, the Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre,lost the seat he has held since 2004, even as his party performed better than had previously been expected. The Tory leader pledged to keep his job during his election night speech, but the loss is expected to inflame tensions within the party. “While we will do our constitutional duty of holding the government to account and proposing better alternatives, we will always put Canada first as we stare down tariffs and other irresponsible threats from President Trump,” Poilievre told supporters. “Conservatives have been leading the debate and we will continue to put forward the best arguments to improve the lives of our people right across this country.” Jagmeet Singh, leader of the progressive New Democratic party leader, also lost his seat in a national vote that saw the NDP have their worst-ever result, losing party status and most of their seats. In an emotional speech Singh announced he would resign as leader. Carney praised other party leaders for campaigns that he said had strengthened the country’s democracy. “Let’s put an end to the division and anger of the past. We are all Canadian and my government will work for and with everyone.” After a narrow victory in the previous federal election, the Liberals relied on the leftwing New Democratic party to help it pass legislation. Monday’s vote appeared likely to produce a similar result, with the Liberals and the NDP together holding enough seats to pass legislation. For the Liberals, the win marks aremarkable recoveryfor a party that was, until recently, on track for electoral devastation. Carney’s predecessor as leader, Justin Trudeau, served as prime minister for nearly 10 years but the twilight of his leadership was marked by repeated threats of mutiny, bitter feuding and a fed-up electorate. Until the end of 2024, internal discussions within the Liberal party were grim: under their most optimistic scenarios, they could only hope of holding the Conservatives to a minority government. Outright victory was nowhere on the party’s radar. “We were dead and buried in December. Now we are going to form a government,” David Lametti, a former Liberal justice minister, told CTV late on Monday. “We have turned this around thanks to Mark.” Trump’s threats to annex the country to make it the 51st state, his belittling of Trudeau as “governor” and threats of economic coercion have all contributed to a sharp feeling of anger and betrayal towards Canada’s southern neighbour. “The shift in polls was absolutely without precedent,” said David Coletto, the head of the polling firm Abacus. “But to see the honeymoon that followed – and the way that support held, is also unprecedented. I can’t think of other jurisdictions around the world where we’ve seen this complete reset. And this turns on two factors: how unpopular Justin Trudeau was, and how much of a threat and gamechanger Donald Trump has meant to Canada.” For the Conservatives, defeat marks a disappointing end to an election campaign the party had been demanding for months. Under the leadership of Poilievre, the Tories had for the past two years seemed all but certain to form a government. But within weeks of Trump’s threats and the emergence of Carney as the new Liberal leader, their25-point poll lead evaporated. To have come inches from victory and then to lose is likely to kick off a sombre postmortem for the party – and internal feuding over the future of the Conservative movement. For Carney, who served as prime minister for only nine days before calling a snap election, the gambit was one in which he hoped to make history for the party. But also on the line for Carney was the prospect of making history for an entirely different reason: had he lost, he would have inherited the mantle of Canada’s shortest-serving prime minister. Ian Laroque, a campaign volunteer who lives in Carney’s Ottawa electoral district, said: “I saw how Carney conducted himself and I felt like he was really a man who met the moment. He wasn’t a polished politician. But he’s the kind of person we need to lead the country right now. It’s not every day you get an economist during an economic crisis.” Monday’s vote was unusual in other ways, too: for the first time in nearly 70 years, the two main parties were set to take more than 80% of the vote between them, reflecting the collapse of other smaller opposition parties including the NDP and the separatist Bloc Québécois. In an emotive speech to supporters, Jagmeet Singh announced he would step down as leader of the NDP after failing to win his seat. In its worst-ever performance, the progressive party failed to meet the 12-seat threshold needed to retain official party status – the second time in its history it has been unable to do so. The loss of party status means the NDP loses certain parliamentary privileges, including the ability to ask questions during question period as often as recognized parties. These rules can be amended at the discretion of the speaker, however. The NDP will also lose out on money allocated to parties for research purposes, which is distributed proportionally to the number of seats held by a recognized party.",

    "title": "Carney gave a eulogy for Canada’s old relationship with the US. Now he must redefine it",
    "article_text": "In his victory speech early on Tuesday,Mark Carneywasted little time calling for a dramatic reshaping of his government’s relationship with the United States, arguing that threats fromDonald Trumpcast doubtCanada’s ability to function as a “free, sovereign, and ambitious” nation. The former central banker and investment executive had for months focused his electoral campaign on the threats from Canada’s largest trading partner and longtime political ally. Carney, a self-professed lover of policy mechanics, has pledged to redevelop Canada’s economy to reduce its reliance on the US – a daunting task, given that bilateral trade contributes to a fifth of Canada’s gross domestic product. And in what should have been a celebratory address, he took on a somber tone as he considered the end of the affair. “Our old relationship with the United States, a relationship based on steadily increasing integration, is over. The system of open global trade anchored by the United States – a system that Canada has relied on since the second world war, a system that while not perfect has helped deliver prosperity for a country for decades – is over,” he said. He also called for national unity, cognizant of the geographic and political frictions that had until recently, suggested Canadians would elect a Conservative government. “My message to every Canadian is this: no matter where you live, no matter what language you speak, no matter how you voted, I will always do my best to represent everyone who calls Canada home,” Carney said. Along with external pressure from Trump, Canada still faces a raft of unresolved internal tensions: a housing shortage, amplified by high immigration levels and the spiralling cost of living, has left voters increasingly frustrated and distrustful of the Liberal party. Carney has pledged to use the power of government to combat the interlocking crises, telling supporters on Tuesday morning that his ministers could “do things previously thought impossible at speeds we haven’t seen in generations”. “The point is is that we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. The prime minister expects to have a call with Trump in the coming days, a senior Liberal said, and will begin negotiations on a new trade agreement. “He is treating his upcoming meeting like he did debate prep during the election: preparing for all possible scenarios,” the source said. “Because he doesn’t know which version of the president he might get.” There is little doubt Canada is at both an economic and political crossroads and Carney must navigate competing visions for the country’s future trajectory. “The big question is how much Canadian federal government wants to pursue closer relations with the United States,” said Peter Morrow, an associate professor of economics at the University of Toronto. “The challenge for Canada is that it’s not really is not in a good position to diversify away too much from its economic relationship with United States. Geography just makes it an obvious trading partner. And if you diversify too much, then it’s almost like you’re trying to pull a Brexit.” But Morrow says Canadian officials face a challenge in revisiting a trade agreement previously negotiated with Trump in his first term. “What sorts of concessions do you make in an agreement with a partner who’s shown that they’re willing to throw those agreements out the window?” In recent weeks, Canadians have engaged in economic nationalism,boycotting American goods and encouraging fellow citizens to seek out domestic options to supplant imports. “Everything we know is that companies that engage in global transactions tend to be more productive than companies that don’t. This nationalist turn inward for Canada is really not a good idea,” said Morrow. “What Canada should be doing is trying to buy from Europe, engage with a wider array of trading partners and resisting the temptations of economic nationalism.” Morrow points to recent discussions in Canada on whether to continue with the purchase of American-made F-35 fighter jets, knowing that the US might be an “unreliable partner” in the future. Critics of the multibillion-dollar deal with Lockheed Martin have suggested that Canada instead examine offers from European defense manufacturers. In his election night speech, Carney hinted at a goal of strengthening relations with like-minded allies in Europe. The technocratic Liberal leader, who previously served as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, has been eager to burnish his global credentials. In his brief, nine-day tenure as prime minister before calling a snap election, he met the French president, Emmanuel Macron, and UK prime minister, Keir Starmer. Carney’s defensive positioning of Canada’s economy and political alliances will be on display in June, when he hosts leaders from G7 countries in the province of Alberta. Juliette Théorêt, a University of Ottawa student of defence policy who attended Carney’s victory party, said the prime minister won her vote by pitching a vision of the country that involved less reliance on its longtime ally. “Before Trump, I don’t think national security and national sovereignty were big topics of conversation. And without him, there’s a good chance the election would have swayed in a different direction,” she said. “But threats of [making Canada the] 51st state, and this idea of not having a border between Canada and the US – that really pushed people to unite.”",

    "title": "Conservative leader projected to lose seat in Canada election – as it happened",
    "article_text": "Prime minister promises to protect country as Conservative leader set to lose seat. This live blog is closed,please follow developments in our new live blog Carney tells the crowd that he chose to enter politics because he thoughtCanadaneeded big changes guided by strong Canadian values: humility, ambition and unity. He says he will do his best to uphold those values, to cries of “you betcha” from the crowd. He said he would begin with the value of humility, and says he has much to be humble about. He says he has made mistakes in the past and will make more – he says he will admit his mistakes, correct them and learn from them. He promises to work with all Canadians to advance the country and protect Canada. He says: “America wants our land, our resources, our water. These are not idle threats.Trump is trying to break us so America can own us.That will never happen.” It has just gone 10.25am in Ottawa,Canada. Here is a roundup of the momentous results in Canada’s consequential federal election: Canadian Prime MinisterMark Carney’s Liberals have staged a major political comeback to retain power in the parliamentary elections. The polls are still being counted. But as things stand the Liberals are leading with 168 seats. They need 172 for a majority. If the party falls short of the magic number it would need the support of political rivals to govern as a minority government. The Conservatives will likely remain in opposition as the second-largest party. The party have currently secured 144 seats, with 99% of polls having reported results. Conservative leaderPierre Poilievrelost in Carleton, Ontario, a seat he had held for two decades, to a Liberal candidate. “Conservatives will work with the prime minister and all parties with the common goal of defending Canada’s interests and getting a new trade deal that puts these tariffs behind us while protecting our sovereignty,” Poilievre told his supporters in a concession speech in Ottawa. Even though he has lost his seat in the House of Commons, Poilievre remains the de facto Conservative leader for now. The two main parties – Liberals and the Conservatives - saw a rise in their share of the national vote compared with four years ago as the smaller parties (Bloc Québécois, the New Democratic Party, the Green party and the People’s Party) got squeezed out. In his victory speech, Carney saidDonald Trumpis “trying to break us so that America can own us” and vowed that his new government would not let that happen. Carney, the former Bank of England governor who replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister just last month, convinced voters that his experience managing economic crises made him the ideal candidate to defy Trump. The left-leaning New Democratic party saw many of its supporters defect to Carney, and fell from 24 seats to fewer than 10; its leader,Jagmeet Singh, announced his resignation after being pushed into third place in his own seat. The separatist Bloc Québécois also saw its support collapse, falling from 32 seats to a projected 23 (you can read more inthis summary of the election’s results). Thanks for joining us. We are closing this blog now but will be restarting a new one shortly. You can find allour latest coverage on Canada here. While campaigning,Mark Carneyvowed that every dollar the government collects from counter-tariffs on US goods will go toward Canadian workers who are adversely affected by the trade war. He also said he plans to keep dental care in place, offer a middle-class tax cut, return immigration to sustainable levels and increase funding to Canada’s public broadcaster, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Ontario PremierDoug Ford, the Progressive Conservative party leader who has been the province’s premier since 2018, has congratulatedMark Carneyon his victory in the federal elections. In a statement, Ford, a vocal critic of Donald Trump, said: The federal election comes at a “crucial time” for Canadians who are living with “economic uncertainty” caused by Trump’s punitive tariffs. Ontario is standing ready to work with the federal government to cut “red tape” and thereby allow the country’s businesses to become more competitive and withstand the impacts of higher levies. Carney should make good on his promise to speed up approvals for critical mineral and other resource development projects and support Ontario as it looks to“build the future of nuclear” including “the first small modular reactors in the G7”. The federal government should commit to “meaningful bail reform” to increase public safety. Carney should meet national defence commitments by “using Canadian-made equipment wherever possible” and meeting and exceeding Canada’s 2% of GDP Nato spending target. Ford, who has won three consecutive majority governments in Ontario for his provincial party, emerged as a strong voice against US tariffs at a time when former prime minister Justin Trudeau was trailing in the polls before his resignation. Irish Prime MinisterMicheál Martinhas congratulated Mark Carney on winning the election.In a post on X, he wrote:“Irish-Canadian relations are deep and strong, based on shared values. I look forward to working with Canada’s new government.” At the beginning of the year, Canada’s Conservatives had a 25-point lead over the Liberal government, and their leader, Pierre Poilievre, looked certain to be the country’s next prime minister. But as the votes cast in Monday’s election have been counted, the story of the campaign has been confirmed: victory for the Liberals and their new leader, Mark Carney, who haveextended their decade of rule by as much as another five years. With almost all polls counted, it appears likely that the Liberals will fall just short of a majority, and instead be the leading party in a minority government, as in the last two elections. Regardless, it represents a remarkable turnaround, and vindication for Carney’s efforts to present himself as the prime ministerial candidate who would most effectively stand up toDonald Trump. As for Poilievre: the CBC projects he has lost his seat. Here is a selection of some of the best photos of the night featuring the leaders of the main parties: As we mentioned in an earlier post, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, 45, is expected to lose his longtime rural Ottawa seat to Liberal MPBruce Fanjoy. Fanjoy – who reportedly used to work in business and marketing – is projected to win 51% of the vote in Carleton, while Poilievre, a veteran politician who first won the Ottawa seat in 2004, was able to secure only 46%. Thanking everyone who supported his campaign, Fanjoywrote on X: To all the people of Carleton, as your new Member of Parliament, I’ll work to bring us together. We are all Canadian. We have to look out for ourselves, and we have to take care of each other. Let’s get to work. France’s PresidentEmmanuel Macronhas congratulatedMark Carneyon his election win. In a post on X, Macron wrote: Dear Mark Carney, congratulations on your victory. You embody a strong Canada in the face of today’s challenges. France is glad to further strengthen the friendship which unites our two countries. I’m looking forward to working with you — “elbow to elbow!” You can watch a video report of the election night – in which the Liberals made a striking comeback – in the player below: We would like to hear from Canadians about their views on the election results.

    "title": "‘Bombs and bullets were like rain’: 50 years on from the fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam war",
    "article_text": "The day that Saigon fell, Xuan Phuong, a war correspondent, could only hear shouting and commotion. It was 30 April 1975, and helicopters were frantically lifting personnel and civilians from the US embassy. Phuong, who had travelled down from the north, was initially held back by troops who said fighting was still continuing. When she was finally able to reach the centre of the city the following day, 1 May, she found chaos. Clothes and luggage were scattered and discarded along the streets. Buildings were being looted. It felt like a dream, Phuong, now 96, said. She stood inside the Presidential Palace on 2 May, watching as the president of SouthVietnam, ​​Duong Van Minh, surrendered. “He left through the palace’s back door, because at the front there were all the tanks [of the North Vietnamese],” said Phuong. North Vietnam was victorious and the country was to be reunified after a decades-long war that had killed as many as 2 million Vietnamese civilians. For the US, which lost 58,000 servicemen, the episode was one of its most humiliating in history. On Wednesday, Vietnam will celebrate the 50th anniversary of 30 April, known officially as the Liberation of the South and National Reunification Day, with huge parades planned in what is now Ho Chi Minh City, after the revolutionary leader. In the run-up to celebrations, streets and alleys have been lined with the red flag and the gold stars of the nation,and fighter jets have roared through the skies above, rehearsing formations. The Trump administration has told its senior diplomats in Vietnam not to participate in anniversary events, according to a report in the New York Times – a decision that has dismayed veterans who have dedicated their lives to reconciliation. Relations between the US and Vietnam have shifted vastly since the war, from former foes to close economic partners – though some fear the decades of progress is being put at risk. This month, a US announcement of a punishing 46% tariff against Vietnam, which would devastate the country’s economic growth targets,left leaders in Hanoi staggered. Months earlier, drastic cuts to US foreign assistance were unveiled. Many fear this could jeopardise projects that assist the victims of Agent Orange, which has left 3 million people, many of them children, with continued serious health problems, or the work of teams that are cleaning up huge amounts of unexploded ordnance left behind. Although North Vietnam won the war, the entire country was left traumatised by the years of conflict, said Prof Dr Pham Hong Tung. “[People] lost their relatives. They were wounded … they had some very terrible memories,” he added. Vietnam faced conflict with Cambodia and China. Its economy was left in tatters, worsened by the Communist party’s limits on private enterprise and severe US economic sanctions, including a trade embargo. Reforms initiated in1986 transformed the country into a market-oriented economy, ushering in a period of rapid economic growth, though it remains a communist one-party state, and frequently jails dissidents. Over the past 50 years, Ho Chi Minh City has been transformed into a city of skyscrapers and become a crucial manufacturing hub. Its streets are crammed tightly with motorbikes and its restaurants and markets increasingly draw international tourists. Phuong, who now lives in the centre of the city, was born in 1929 into an aristocratic family in Hue, in South Vietnam. She left her home aged 16 to join the struggle against French rule, swapping a life of plenty for one where she slept in the jungle. She worked making explosives, in an overrun hospital and for the ministry of foreign affairs before becoming a journalist. She did not see her family throughout the war. By the time she entered Saigon in 1975, she found that her mother and siblings had already fled. “I had been away from my family for so long,” she said. “I was very disappointed. Even my hair turned white. I was distraught.” Her family were among the more than 1.5 million people who fled, fearing persecution and incarceration in “re-education” camps under the new Communist leaders. Between 200,000 and 400,000 died as they made their journey, according to the UN. On the walls of Phuong’s apartment there are Vietnamese paintings, Buddhist sculptures and black and white photographs taken during the war. An image shows Jane Fonda, who visited Hanoi in 1972, in a white shirt, a camera hanging from her neck. Vietnam, one of America’s most divisive conflicts, and the focus of protest songs, attracted various high-profile visitors, whom Phuong was often assigned to assist while working at the ministry. On one occasion, she was tasked with finding a tailor to make Vietnamese clothing for Fonda, who had arrived in short clothes unsuitable for a war zone, she recalled. Phuong began working with foreign journalists and travelled to the centre of the country, where the heaviest fighting was taking place. “Bombs and bullets were like rain,” she says. At night, her team sheltered in a vast network of tunnels. “For people who have lived only over ground, you cannot imagine it. But at that time there was no choice,” she said. Today the same tunnels, which stretch for 2,000km (1,200 miles) and, in parts, are more than 20 metres deep, have been reinforced and transformed into tourist attractions. Visitors, using their phones to light the way, clamber down into the network of narrow pathways. The surrounding Quang Tri Province remains the area worst affected by landmines and unexploded ordnance. There have been 8,600 casualties since 1975, said Hien Xuan Ngo, of Project Renew, which conducts clearance work, assists victims and educates the community. “In certain areas … local people, because of economic pressure, sometimes they defy the risks,” he added. US funding has been critical to clearance efforts. Project Renew’s work was temporarily paused when Donald Trump froze foreign assistance, though it has since been given an exemption. Vietnam and the US had grown closer under Joe Biden, upgrading their relationship. Now, Hanoi now faces an increasingly delicate balancing act between Washington and Beijing, underlined by the looming imposition of a 46% tariff. The US accuses Vietnam of allowing Chinese companies to use its territory as a conduit to avoid tariffs that were imposed on China during the last Trump administration. The country’s economy is closely intertwined with both countries. Vietnam has always sought to avoid taking a side in the China-US rivalry. “The pressure from China [was] a motivation for Vietnamese people to normalise the relationship with America and the west and south Asian countries,” said Prof Dr Pham Hong Tung, the director of the Institute of Vietnamese Studies and Development Sciences. “The Vietnamese people are very practical,” he added, though the past is not forgotten. Has Phuong forgiven the US? There are others, worse affected than her, who deserve an apology. “For those who want to ask about forgiveness, go and visit the cemetery. There are a lot of the cemeteries in Vietnam filled with graves of people who died during the war. Many were only 17, not more than 20 years old,” she said. Phuong was eventually able to meet her mother in Paris, in 1989. Her mother barely recognised her on the day they were reunited at the airport. “My mother’s first reaction was to step back and look at me. In my 80-year-old mother’s mind she still thought of me as 16 years old,” she said. “My mom hugged me and we cried. No one around us understood why,” she said. Her mother never returned to Vietnam. As 30 April approached, Phuong’s friends visited the graves of those who died, and offered prayers. She planned to watch the parades, but from home, she said, and to spend time with friends “to talk about our memories, to read poems, and cheer one another – it has been a long life”.",

    "title": "Alibaba co-founder Jack Ma implicated in intimidation campaign by Chinese regime",
    "article_text": "The Chinese regime enlisted Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder ofAlibaba, in an intimidation campaign to press a businessman to help in the purge of a top official, documents seen by the Guardian suggest. The businessman, who can be named only as “H” for fear of reprisals against his family still in China, faced a series of threats from the Chinese state, in an attempt to get him to return home fromFrance, where he was living. They included a barrage of phone calls, the arrest of his sister, and the issuing of a red notice, an international alert, through Interpol. The climax, in April 2021,was the call from Ma. “They said I’m the only one who can persuade you to return,” Ma said. H, who had known Ma for many years, recorded the call. He had done the same for calls he had received from other friends, as well as Chinese security officials, who had called in the weeks before, all with the same message. Transcripts of those calls presented in a French court, along with other legal records, provide a rare insight into some of the methods used by the Chinese regime to exert its influence around the world. The documents lay out in detail how a combination of threats, co-opted legal mechanisms and extrajudicial pressures are used to control even those beyond the country’s borders. The findings are part of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ (ICIJ)China Targetsproject, in which journalists documented the methods the Chinese regime uses to track and crush dissent abroad. The team includes the Guardian as well as Radio France and Le Monde, who obtained the transcripts and other legal paperwork. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the UK said: “The so-called ‘transnational repression’ byChinais pure fabrication.” H, 48, a China-born citizen of Singapore, was in Bordeaux, France, when he received the call from Ma. A year earlier, a warrant had been issued by Chinese police for H’s arrest on charges of financial crime. Then, China had put out a notice for him through Interpol’s international criminal alert system. The French authorities confiscated his passport while they considered whether to extradite him. The transcripts show that on the call, Ma suggested all of H’s problems would go away if he would help in the prosecution ofSun Lijun, a Chinese politician who had fallen out of favour with the ruling Chinese Communist party (CCP). Sun was being prosecuted for taking bribes and manipulating the stock market. “They are doing this all for Sun, not for you,” Ma said. Sun, a former deputy security minister, was entrusted in 2017 with overseeing security in Hong Kong during mass protests against Beijing’s crackdown on democratic freedoms. He had been arrested the year before H started receiving the phone calls. Later, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI)denouncedSun for “harbouring hugely inflated political ambitions” and “arbitrarily disagreeing with central policy guidelines”. He became one of many top officials caught up in President Xi Jinping’s sweeping anti-corruption campaign, which human rights groups have said serves as a tool for Xi to purge his political rivals. The transcript of the call suggestsMa was not happy to have been drawn into the affair. “Why did you involve me in this?” he asked H. Like Sun, Ma had fallen out of favour with Xi’s regime. After giving a speech in October 2020 in which he criticised Chinese financial regulators, he was hit with repeated sanctions including a$2.8bn fine, and he disappeared from public view. The phone call to H was madesix months later. Ma explained in the call that he had been contacted by Chinese security officials. “They spoke to me very seriously,” Ma told H. “They say they guarantee that if you come back now, they will give you a chance to be exempted … You have no other solution … the noose will tighten more and more.” Later, Ma called H’s lawyer to reiterate the message. H did not return to China and his lawyers fought his extradition in the French courts. Clara Gérard-Rodriguez, one of H’s lawyers, said: “We knew that if H went back to China, he would himself be arrested, detained, probably tortured until he agreed to testify … and that most of his assets, the shares of his company, would most likely be also transferred to other persons.” The conviction rate for criminal cases in China is 99.98%, according toSafeguard Defenders, an organisation that investigates abuses by the Chinese regime. It has documented howforcible disappearancesandtortureare endemic within the justice system. The money laundering charges brought against H in China, a year before the call from Ma, related to his connection to a credit platform, Tuandai.com. The founder of that company wasjailedfor 20 years for illegal fundraising. The Chinese police believed that he had attempted to hide some of the misappropriated funds when the investigation started. H, who had invested in the company, was accused of helping to move some of the money abroad through companies he controlled. H’s lawyers told the French courts there was no evidence that he had known that the source of the funds was questionable. On a call to a friend, recorded in the French court documents, H protested his innocence. “None of this is true,” he said. The Chinese government issued a red notice for H through Interpol, the international police watchdog. This flagged him as a potential criminal to police forces around the world and meant he was unable to travel. “It is like a pin through a butterfly,” said Ted R Bromund, an expert witness in legal cases involving Interpol procedures. “It holds someone down, locks them in place so they can’t get away.” While red notices are used against serious criminals, campaigners have long warned that they can be abused. The British lawyer Rhys Davies recently told a government inquiry into transnational repression that red notices were “routinely used and abused by autocratic regimes to target dissidents and opponents overseas”. He called the system “the sniper rifle of autocrats because it is long-distance, targeted and very effective”. While other countries, including Russia, Turkey andRwanda, have also been known to abuse the system, China’s tactics are different, according to experts. Instead of relying on extraditions, the Chinese authorities use Interpol to locate people and then they ramp up the pressure, threatening them and family members back home until the individual agrees to return “voluntarily”. A spokesperson for Interpol said the system meant thousands of the world’s “most serious criminals” were arrested every year. They added: “Interpol knows red notices are powerful tools for law enforcement cooperation and is fully aware of their potential impact on the individuals concerned, which is why we have robust – and continuously assessed and updated – processes for ensuring our systems are used appropriately.” As H waited in France, trapped by the legal process the red notice had begun, he received calls from friends and security officials, in what his lawyers called “all-out psychological warfare”. Sometimes the tone was friendly, with promises that all charges would be dropped; other times it was more threatening. Transcripts of the call with the deputy investigator of the unit prosecuting Sun, Wei Fujie, suggest hepromised H that if he returned there would be “no prosecution now, plus the cancellation of the red notice”. A friend called and told H: “Within three days your whole family will be arrested!” Days later, H’s sister was arrested in China. His case is far from unusual. TheICIJ’s China Targets projectlogged the details of 105 targets of transnational repression by China, in 23 countries. Half of them said their family members back home had been harassed through intimidation and interrogation by police or state security officials. When H’s case came before the Bordeaux court of appeal, in July 2021, the court denied the extradition request. Later, the red notice was removed from Interpol’s systems. H’s lawyers successfully argued that the extradition request had been issued for political purposes, to compel testimony against Sun. Sun was convicted of manipulating the stock market, taking bribes and other offences, without H’s intervention in the prosecution. He was given a suspended death sentence. H, unable to trade or work in China, could not pay back loans or rent on a luxury property and became engulfed in debts totalling $135m, according to Chinese media. He declined to comment when approached by the Guardian. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in the UK said: “China always respects the sovereignty of other countries and conducts law enforcement and judicial cooperation with other countries in accordance with the law.” Representatives for Ma raised questions about his identity in the calls. The Guardian spoke to H’s lawyers, who said he had known the billionaire for many years prior to the call and that he had no doubt the caller was Ma. Throughout the legalprocess in which his lawyers challenged the red noticethere were no questions raised about the identities of the callers. Ma did not respond further to the Guardian. Earlier this year, he was seen energetically applauding Xi at a meeting of business leaders in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People – a sign, according to local media, of the billionaire’s public rehabilitation. Gérard-Rodriguez, H’s lawyer, said: “We saw and learned publicly of Jack Ma’s disappearance … this man, thought to be untouchable, extremely powerful, extremely well-connected in every country in the world, disappeared completely for several months and then reappeared, pledging his allegiance to the Chinese Communist party. “And in the end, it was the same thing expected of H … that he would return to show his loyalty, to show which side he was on.”",

    "article_text": "Two thousand years ago, in a bid to conquer death itself, China’s first emperor Qin Shi Huang commissioned a city of the dead: a 49 sq km mausoleum guarded by an army of clay warriors, built to defend his tomb for eternity. When farmers near Xi’an unearthed the first clay head in 1974, they cracked open one of humanity’s greatest archaeological mysteries, with more than 8,000 Terracotta Warriors discovered over the last 50 years. Now, fragments of that dream of immortality rise again – this time inPerth, where the largest exhibition of the Terracotta Warriors ever staged in Australia will head later this year Opening on 28 June atWA Museum Boola Bardip, Terracotta Warriors: Legacy of the First Emperor promises not just a glimpse into ancient China, but a sweeping journey across its foundations in more than 225 artefacts, many of which have never left China. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “It’s hard to put into words how significant this is,” said Alec Coles, CEO of WA Museum Boola Bardip. “Seventy per cent of these objects have never been to Australia before, and 40% have never left China.” “For me, this is the eighth wonder of the world,” he said. “There is nothing like it anywhere.” Developed in collaboration with the Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Centre and the Emperor Qin Shi Huang Mausoleum Museum, Terracotta Warriors features 10 of the lifesize clay soldiers – the maximum number permitted to leave China – each weighing up to 180kg and standing 1.8m tall. Meticulously crafted from separate parts, each warrior was finished with a uniquely modelled face, capturing the individuality of a living army. Eight warrior sculptures last came to Australia in 2019 for the National Gallery of Victoria’s showTerracotta Warriors: Guardians of Immortality. WA Museum Boola Bardip’s upcoming exhibition will explore the story of China’s first emperor and the world he sought to recreate in death: bronze vessels, ancient chariots, gilded belt hooks, painted cavalry figures and rare gold ornaments, some so newly unearthed they’ve never been displayed anywhere before. “Qin Shi Huang not only unified China, he standardised measurements, currency and even language – and all of this decades before the Rosetta Stone was carved in Egypt,” Coles said. “You have to think about the extraordinary impact he had in such a tiny period of time. The Qin dynasty lasted only 15 years, but it changed China for ever.” Sign up toSaved for Later Catch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tips after newsletter promotion There is an enduring enigma to Qin’s story:his tomb remains unopened, its secrets sealed beneath a great earthen pyramid. Ancient historians described a vast underground kingdom complete with rivers of mercury and deadly booby traps – legends that the Terracotta Warriors exhibition will reimagine in an immersive final installation. “The patience and respect shown in leaving the tomb unopened is extraordinary,” Coles said. “Who knows what secrets still lie buried?” Among the highlights is a bronze swan, cast using the ancient lost-wax method and discovered near a pleasure garden meant for the emperor’s afterlife. “It’s absolutely exquisite,” Coles said. Terracotta Warriors will also frame Qin’s reign within a longer narrative arc, from the preceding turbulent Warring States period, which ended with the start of the short-lived Qin dynasty in the second century BC, through to the rise of the Han dynasty, which lasted four centuries. In a world riven by political tensions, the exhibition will also gesture toward the enduring power of cultural diplomacy. “Cultural connections are important at any time, but perhaps especially now,” Coles said. “They transcend politics. Building stronger relationships and understanding is paramount.” “I hope visitors experience the same wonder that I did,” he added. “The beauty, the rarity, the achievement. And an appreciation of what Qin Shi Huang created, not just for China, but for human history.” Terracotta Warriors: Legacy of the First Emperor runs at WA Museum Boola Bardip from 28 June until 22 February 2026",

    "title": "Coalition coy on curriculum changes despite Dutton’s claims of student ‘indoctrination’",
    "article_text": "The Coalition has refused to detail changes it would make to the national curriculum afterPeter Duttonsaid studentswere being “indoctrinated”and pledged in his budget reply speech to “restore” a curriculum focused on “critical thinking, responsible citizenship, and common sense”. Dutton has made repeated references to the education system in recent weeks, including floating on Sky News placing a “condition” on funding to ensure kids weren’t “guided by some sort of an agenda that’s come out of universities” and pledging “we need to stop the teaching of some of the curriculum that says that our children should be ashamed of being Australian” in theChannel 7 debate. Guardian Australia asked the shadow education minister, Sarah Henderson, for an interview to detail the Coalition’s plans, after she flagged on the ABC at the beginning of April there would be “more to say” on the curriculum during the campaign, but she repeatedly declined. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Instead, she provided a statement which contrasted withDutton’s strong languagethat “classrooms should be for education, not indoctrination”. Henderson said the Coalition was “strongly focused on getting back to basics to raise education standards in our schools”, pointing to declining Naplan proficiency in literacy, maths and science. “Students learn best when taught explicitly, which is why the adoption ofexplicit instructionand other evidence-based teaching methods is so vital,” she said. “Primary principal organisations from every sector say the national curriculum is impossible to teach, but Labor has failed to listen to the concerns of educators. If elected, we will work hard to listen and consult in order to drive practical, positive improvements in our schools.” Henderson also pointed to a recent Coalition announcement to provide $100m to build and expand boarding schools for Indigenous students, and an early years literacy program for children living in disadvantaged communities. The National Catholic Education Commission welcomed the boarding school funding announcement. It has been lobbying throughout the campaign for the major parties to allow schools to preference the employment of staff who support their religious worldview. “Maintaining the authenticity of our mission is critical to the educational, pastoral and spiritual care we provide and our schools must be able to continue to employ staff who support that mission,” its executive director, Jacinta Collins, said. Earlier this month, the education minister, Jason Clare,wrote to Collins and the CEO of Independent Schools Australia (ISA),warning a Coalition government could “use funding as a lever to determine what students in non-government schools are taught”. “This shows an absolute abrogation of responsibility when it comes to the role of the majority government funder of the non-government school sector,” he wrote. When asked about the letter, the CEO of ISA, Graham Catt, said the body strongly believed “governments should not dictate how teachers deliver education in the classroom”. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “Federal funding already carries requirements around standards, accountability, and curriculum frameworks,” he said. “Teachers are the experts and they know their students and school context.” Catt said the curriculum was already subject to regular review and too many changes could be “highly problematic” due to the resourcing and time it took to implement. Any reforms, he said, must “respect sectoral diversity, school autonomy and the diverse needs of all learners”. The national curriculum waslast reviewed and updated in 2021-2022, under a federal Coalition government. The executive officer of the Australian Association of Christian Schools, Vanessa Cheng, said there should be less government regulation and oversight in schools, not more. But she said the curriculum had scope to be decluttered, adding “ideological overlays” were making it cumbersome and it didn’t tailor to individual school contexts. “It needs to be fit for purpose and adaptable for different types of education philosophies,” she said. “I feel [the curriculum agreed to in 2022] didn’t give a strong sense of identity, in hope and confidence in who we are as a nation. “It’s not about culture wars, it’s about pride as Australians … There’s been an emphasis on negative parts of our history rather than celebrating positives. I would hope that balance would go back other way.”",

    "title": "Trump reveals plans to ease tariff impact on US carmakers",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpunveiled plans to water down his sweeping tariffs for US carmakers on Tuesday by curbing some duties on foreign cars and parts, granting a reprieve to an industry that warned his strategy would increase costs for American manufacturers by tens of billions of dollars. Carmakers subject to a 25% tariff on imports will not be subject to other levies Trump has imposed, for example, on steel and aluminum. US automakers will also be allowed to apply for tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although that relief will be phased out over the next two years. Trump told reporters he wanted US automakers to “enjoy this little transition short-term”. Trump was “committed to bringing back auto production to the US”, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, told reporters earlier on Tuesday, “so we want to give automakers a path to do that quickly, efficiently and create as many jobs as possible”. It comes afterindustry analysisfound that the US big three carmakers – Ford, General Motors and Stellantis – could face an increase of more than $42bn in costs as a result of Trump’s 25% tariff on the auto industry, with duties of almost $5,000 for the parts they import to make the average car made in America. “President Trump is building an important partnership with both the domestic automakers and our great American workers,” the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, claimed in a statement. “This deal is a major victory for the president’s trade policy by rewarding companies who manufacture domestically, while providing runway to manufacturers who have expressed their commitment to invest in America and expand their domestic manufacturing.” Trump is due to travel to Michigan on Tuesday for a rally marking hisfirst 100 days in office. His return to the White House – and hopes to reshape the global economy with steep tariffs – swiftly ushered in a new period of economic volatility for firms in the US and overseas. After imposing 10% tariffs on imports from much of the world, the Trump administration plans to speak with 17 trading partners “over the next few weeks”, Bessent said, acknowledging that Trump – who has jolted longstanding US relationships with a string of markets – creates “strategic uncertainty” in negotiations. “As we start moving forward announcing deals, then there will be certainty,” said Bessent. “But certainty is not necessarily a good thing in negotiating.” After rapidly raising tariffs on Chinese products to 145%, Trump’s officials maintain that the risks for China are high – while playing down the potential impact in the US, despite widespread concern over potential shortages and price increases. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion Bessent, who claimed China could shed 10m jobs “very quickly” if the tariffs are maintained that their current level, denied the US could face disruption. “I wouldn’t think that we would have supply chain shocks. I think retailers have managed their inventory in front of this,” he said. “I speak to dozens of companies, sometimes daily, but definitely weekly. They know that President Trump is committed to fair trade, and have planned accordingly.” But with consumers in the firing line, reports that Amazon might start disclosing the cost of tariffs on its platform drew a sharp rebuke from the White House. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,” claimed the press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, following a call with Trump.

    "title": "Jacob Fearnley bows out of Madrid Open as tennis resumes after power outage",
    "article_text": "Jacob Fearnley has not been a full-time professional player for a full year, yet on an unforgettable Monday afternoon in Madrid, he found himself in a bizarre scenario that many of the best players in the world would struggle with. Fearnley, a qualifier at the Madrid Open, had been mounting a courageous last stand against the veteran 14th seed, Grigor Dimitrov, when thecity and country came to a standstill. With Dimitrov leading 6-4, 5-4 in Manolo Santana Stadium, both players were sent off the court as it became clear that Monday’s power outage that left Spain and Portugal without electricity would force the tournament to suspend all matches for the day. For Fearnley, this meant he had over 24 hours to ponder how exactly that crucial service game would pan out: “It’s impossible not to overthink it,” he said. After about 10 hours without ­electricity and mobile internet for most people in Madrid, power to homes and phones returned late on Monday night, prompting cheers in the streets. At the Caja Mágica, which is situated in the southern neighbourhood of San Fermín, power returned at around 8am on Tuesday, just enough time for play to resume at noon. In the end, Fearnley managed to avoid the worst case scenario – immediately losing his service game upon the restart – but he never quite settled down. His superb run from qualifying, which included a first career top-20 win against Tomas Machac in just his second clay-court event, ended with a hard fought 6-4, 7-6 (3) defeat by Dimitrov: “I was pleased with the way I handled the situation. Maybe I played that game a little bit too much in my head, and didn’t really think about if I was actually capable of ­winning the second set,” he said. Across the tournament grounds, nobody will forget the day the lights went out. Frances Tiafoe was waiting patiently for his match in the player restaurant. “We were thinking it’s gonna be like a 30-minute, hour thing,” he said. “[Tournament staff] were putting candles on our table and [it was] like: ‘Oh, now the whole ofSpainis out of power.’ [I responded:] ‘OK, that’s cool.’ They put another candle on the table: ‘France is out of power too.’ ‘OK, that’s cool.’ Then: ‘Italy’s out of power.’ I’m like: ‘Well, stop putting candles on the table.’” Since some players were not scheduled until much later, not everyone had yet made the trip to Madrid. Alex de Minaur took several leisurely walks during the day and opted not to travel to the tournament. Jack Draper, who reached the fourth round with a retirement win against Matteo Berrettini after taking the first set 7-6 (2), had also been out on a ­leisurely walk before his match, which was scheduled for the evening, when the power cut. “I came back to the hotel [and] all of a sudden the lights were off and everything,” he said. “I had to walk up 15 flights of stairs. So I was cramping in the legs, going up there, and then I came down. Took an hour and a half to get here in the car, trained a little bit and went back. Had a sandwich for dinner. It wasn’t that bad, actually, to just take everything off my mind, no phone.” As players attempted to leave the venue after play had been cancelled, the player restaurant and bar area was filled to the brim as players waited for a lift to their hotels, some of which were 15km away. Some opted to walk home, while others waited patiently. ew enjoyed a dinner typical of an athlete: “They still had bread here. So I had a lot of bread,” said Fearnley. Tiafoe, who defeated Alexandre Müller in straight sets, was slightly more blunt: “I ate complete bullshit,” he said. “Just a lot of chocolate.” Most players in Madrid noted that they were simply happy to be in good health and there was no reason to stress: “Honestly, at this point, I just added to the list of random things that have happened that delay a tennis match,” said Madison Keys. “There’s nothing that you can do. So just I took a nap, I laid down, I used my phone while I still had service. Then it stopped working, and I was like: ‘OK, I’ll take another nap.’” For Tiafoe, it is important to look at the glass half -full and to accept the circumstances without complaint. His experience on Monday, however, will also be a source of humour for years to come.

    "title": "Chanel takes a cruise around Lake Como with glamour fit for a grand hotel",
    "article_text": "Chanel has a fresh-faced, avant garde new designer but it still stands for classic glamour. This was the loud and clear messaging at the firstChanelshow since Matthieu Blazy took up his role. The show was held at Villa d’Este, the Lake Como palace hotel where Elizabeth Taylor, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich holidayed and which Alfred Hitchcock, who filmed The Pleasure Garden there, pronounced the most beautiful place on earth. The location, booked a year in advance, provided the theme: life in a grand hotel. Think White Lotus on Lake Como, art directed by Slim Aarons. First on to the pebbled catwalk weaving through the hotel’s terrace was a white bathrobe-style coat. Then there were capri pants in the butter yellow of the hotel parasols, and a lilac tweed suit to match the wisteria trailing overhead. Models swung tote bags big enough for pool towels, while gold lamé cover-ups glinted as dazzling as sun on the lake. “To me, Como is about the light,” said Bruno Pavlovsky, Chanel’s president of fashion. “Life is cinematic here.” Famous faces including the actors Keira Knightley and Sarah Catherine Hook were dotted among a 900-strong audience mostly made up of Chanel’s biggest-spending clients. The Cruise season of catwalk shows, named for a time when Caribbean cruises requiring trunks of glitzy loungewear were in vogue among the rich, has evolved to stand for holiday glamour in general. Spending on holiday wardrobes has increased exponentially across all price brackets: consumers spend less on dressing smartly for work, and more on looking good on holiday for Instagram. Brands drop serious money on Cruise shows, because a slice of this lucrative holiday market is worth a lot in sunglasses. (There was a pair of shades to go with most looks in this show.) Sign up toFashion Statement Style, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solved after newsletter promotion Pavlovsky describes Chanel as being in a moment of “generational handover”. Blazy, who took up his role at the beginning of April, did not work on this collection or attend the show, which was credited to the design studio. Holding the fort as figurehead for the event in his absence was the Chanel ambassadorSofia Coppola, who made a short film on location at Villa d’Este to accompany the event, which she described as “about that version of yourself when you get away, when you may be different from how you are in real life”. Chanel has doubled revenue and headcount in the past decade to become the world’s second-largest luxury brand behind Louis Vuitton, with 36,500 employees at the end of 2023. It is more than 10 times the size of Bottega Veneta, from where Blazy arrives. His October debut is hotly awaited but Pavlovsky is “not so interested in what happens in October”. Rather, he is “interested in a future which begins in October. We work on Chanel time. We don’t rush.” Pavlovsky has said he will wait two years before judging whether Blazy is the right fit. Pavlovsky dismissed any suggestion of moving production to the US as a strategy to avoid tariffs. He said Chanel intended to maintain its current policy of price harmonisation, in which prices are consistent in every country in the world, adding that they would “find a way to cover the cost” of keeping prices low in US boutiques if tariffs were levied. Pavlovsky told Womenswear Daily that it was “the great admiration and respect for the heritage and the work done by Mademoiselle Chanel, by Karl and by Virginie”, which he sensed in Blazy, which clinched the recruitment. “That was important to me, because it wasn’t about a kind of competition over image and size. It was about the depth of what the brand stands for, and how we could build on that to continue telling our story.” Blazy has begun to make changes, including the hiring of the seasoned British haute couture specialist Andrew Heather, who has worked under designers including Alexander McQueen and John Galliano. Silk scarves made in Como featured as ankle straps for heeled sandals on the catwalk. Chanel has recently taken a 35% stake in the Como-based manufacturer Mantero, which has been producing silk for Chanel blouses and printed scarves for more than 50 years. Under the terms of the deal, Mantero will continue to produce clothes for rival luxury clients including Dior, Saint Laurent and Versace, but Chanel believes that protecting key players in its supply chain is a sound investment, at a time when global economic pressures are putting many specialist producers out of business.",

    "title": "Kim Kardashian robbery accused, 71, says he ‘totally regrets’ $10m heist",
    "article_text": "A 71-year-old man who has said he played a bit part in a jewellery heist in whichKim Kardashianwas robbed at gunpoint in 2016 has said he “totally regretted” having participated. Yunice Abbas is one of 10 people on trial inParisfor having taken part in the robbery on the night of 2-3 October. He said he had remained in a Paris hotel lobby on the lookout while two other suspects stormed into the US celebrity’s room, tied her up and made away with $10m (£7.5m) worth of her jewels. Abbas sought to capitalise on the crime by publishing his version of events in a 2021 book titled I Kidnapped Kim Kardashian. On Tuesday a prosecutor held up a copy of the book in court, and the presiding judge asked the author why he had bragged about the theft. Sitting in the dock in a short-sleeved check shirt, Abbas shook his head vigorously. “It makes me very uneasy,” he said, adding that he “totally regretted” taking part in the theft. Abbas said he had arrived at the scene of the robbery on a bicycle and left by the same means, dropping a bag of stolen items as he fled. He picked it up but missed a diamond necklace, the only item that police were able to retrieve from the holdup. Abbas told the hearing on Tuesday that stealing from Kardashian had been one job “too many” and that it had “opened his eyes” to his wrongdoing. The defendant, who now has Parkinson’s disease, held his right hand over his left placed on his heart throughout the court session. He said it was to stop it from racing when he became anxious. The presiding judge on Tuesday reviewed the accused’s criminal past. He listed, among others, a conviction for fake number plates for carrying out robberies, another for equipping cars with secret compartments to hide cannabis and a third for armed robbery in which Abbas held a gun. Between, he worked as a car mechanic. Abbas said that he had had “moments of weakness” when he needed money. “I fell back on things that I thought were easy shortcuts but only ended up complicating my life,” he said. Abbas, like all other nine defendants, is not in custody. Kardashian, 44, is due to testify on 13 May. Those on trial – nine men and a woman – are mainly in their 60s and 70s with previous criminal records and underworld nicknames such as Old Omar and Blue Eyes. But the lawyer for one of the victims on Monday was eager to dispel the image of “kind old men” on trial for the robbery during Paris fashion week. Henri de Beauregard, who represents the night receptionist forced to accompany the robbers to Kardashian’s room, said the public must not fall for the “myth of friendly, Robin Hood-style pensioners”.",

    "title": "France says Russian hackers behind attack on Macron’s 2017 presidential campaign",
    "article_text": "France has accused Russian military intelligence of carrying out a massivecyber-attack on Emmanuel Macron’s first presidential campaign in 2017as well as several other recent major hacks, including on a TV station and an organisation involved in the Paris Olympics. The French foreign ministry said for the first time on Tuesday that it was Russian hackers who had targeted Macron’s campaign team in 2017, adding that other Russian targets had included French media and an organisation involved in the 2024 Olympics. Hours before the 2017 French presidential election, thousands of internal campaign emails from Macron’s team and other documents – some said to be false – were released online after the midnight deadline to end campaigning. “Thousands of documents were stolen and disseminated in the hope of manipulating voters, but the manoeuvre failed to have any real impact on the electoral process,” said a foreign ministry video, shared online by the foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot. Macron won the 2017 election against the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen. The French foreign ministry also attributed other attacks to Russian military intelligence, including the 2015 hacking of the French public broadcast channel TV5Monde. It said Russian hackers, posing as Islamic State militants, targeted TV5Monde “to manipulate public opinion” and create panic inFrance. Since 2021, a branch of Russian military intelligence (GRU) dedicated to cyber-attacks had targeted a dozen French entities including defence, financial and economic sectors, the foreign ministry said. It said the targets had included entities “working in the daily lives of French people and public services, private enterprises as well as a sport organisation involved in the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games”. Barrot said that Russian military intelligence “has been carrying out cyber-attacks against France for several years using a method known as APT28.” APT28, also known as Fancy Bear, has been accused of carrying out dozens of cyber-attacks around the world, including on the 2016 US election, where it was accused of aiding Donald Trump by leaking Democratic party emails and those of the campaign of Hillary Clinton. Areport by the French Cybersecurity agency (ANSSI)released on Tuesday said that since 2021, ATP28 “had been used to gather strategic intelligence from entities located in France, Europe, Ukraine and North America.” The French foreign ministry said in a statement: “France condemns in the strongest terms the use by Russia’s military intelligence service of the APT28 attack group, at the origin of several cyber-attacks on French interests.” The group targets personal email accounts to retrieve data and emails, or gain access to other machines on a system. In September 2024 several international intelligence services, includingGerman authorities, warned of the risk of cyber-attacks targeting Nato countries that Fancy Bear carried out. The French foreign ministry said: “Alongside its partners, France is determined to use all the means at its disposal to anticipate Russia’s malicious behaviour in cyberspace, discourage it and respond to it where necessary.” Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

    "title": "Iranian journalists say they are being muzzled over reporting port explosion",
    "article_text": "Iranian journalists have warned of a media crackdown after a series of incidents, the most recent an explosion at a munitions company in which one person was killed and two injured. The explosion on Tuesday, for which there has been no official explanation, occurred in Isfahan, only two days after a thwarted cyber-attack on the communications infrastructure on Sunday, and a huge explosion on Saturday at the strategic southern port of Shahid Rajaee, near Bandar Abbas. The death toll from theexplosion at the porthas increased to 65, with more than 1,000 people injured. Iran has ruled out foreign involvement in the Shahid Rajaee explosion, pointing instead to negligence and strong evidence that unlabelled combustible chemicals, undeclared to customs, were inappropriately stored, leading to a fire and a deadly chain reaction of explosions. An MP who visited the site put the chances of sabotage at 1%. Suspicion of cover-ups is rife, however, and the filing of criminal charges against media outlets and activists by the Tehran prosecutor’s office has caused journalists in Iran to voice concern about press freedom. Mizan news agency, the judiciary’s official media outlet, said violators would face legal consequences for attempting to publish “illegal news” about the explosion. One Tehran-based reporter, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said: “Not only were we warned against ground reporting, we were also banned effectively from sharing reports on social media. In face of a tragedy such as this, what is there to hide? Either the death toll is way more than 70, or they are suppressing the real cause of the explosion. Following the filing of charges, our newsrooms are also self-regulating in fear that they’ll be facing legal consequences.” Officials have confirmed only that the goods that exploded on Saturday did not appear to have had a digitised reference code as required by Iranian customs law. As many as 130,000 containers are stored at the port, partly because the lack of infrastructure means customs authorities and government ministries do not process goods for export for weeks, a problem raised by the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, on his visit on Sunday. Iranian officials said on Tuesday that the fire had, after four days, been brought under control and toxic substances had not leaked into the Persian Gulf. Reporting of the explosion has become increasingly difficult, with officials warning against believing foreign media or opposition groups such as the National Council of Resistance of Iran. Iranian officials have blamed mislabelling of dangerous cargo, but media outlets have not yet identified the company alleged to have imported the combustible material. The naval branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps insisted that the port was purely commercial, and said military goods did not pass through. Tuesday’s factory explosion was reported to have happened at the Ava Nar Parsian chemicals company, located in the Meymeh district of Isfahan, a site overseen by Iran’s national security council. The official committee investigating Sunday’s port explosion has said “failures in observing safety principles and passive defence have been confirmed”. Shahid Rajaee port, with an area of ​​about 2,400 hectares, has an annual capacity to handle 70m tonnes of cargo, and is estimated to process half of Iran’s imports. Mohammad Mehdi Shahriari, a member of the Iranian parliament’s national security commission, said four committees were examining potential causes, including the possibility that Israel had been involved in an attempt to disrupt negotiations between the US and Iran over the future of its nuclear programme. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, the speaker, said parliament was looking at whether any negligence or intent was involved.",

    "article_text": "The embattled UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, has accusedIsraelof abusing dozens of its staff in military detention and using some as human shields. The head of the agency, Philippe Lazzarini, said that more than 50 staff members, including teachers, doctors and social workers, had been detained and abused since the start of the 18-month-long war inGaza. “They have been treated in the most shocking & inhumane way. They reported being beaten + used as human shields,” Lazzariniwrote on X. Those detained had been subjected to “sleep deprivation, humiliation, threats of harm to them & their families + attacks by dogs … [and] forced confessions”. UN officials said the reported abuse had taken place both in Gaza and in military detention sites in Israel. The Israeli military has not responded directly to Lazzarini’s accusation, but has previously denied allegations of widespread abuse in its detention facilities and by its troops. It has, however, launchedinvestigationsinto abuse by individual soldiers during the war, and into the use of detainees as human shields,bringing chargesagainst service personnel in some cases. In a statement, the Israeli military said it acted in accordance with Israeli law and international law, and protects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility. “Any abuse of detainees, whether during their detention or during interrogation, violates the law and the directives of the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] and as such is strictly prohibited,” the statement said. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS), said on Tuesday that Israel had released a medic held since a deadly and hugely controversial attack by Israeli troops on ambulances in southern Gaza on 23 March. Eight PRCS staff members, six from the Gaza civil defence agency and one Unrwa employee were killed in the attack, according to the UN humanitarian office OCHA. The killings sparked international condemnation, including concern from the UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, about possible war crimes. Relations between Israel and Unrwa have deteriorated since the beginning of the war, which was triggered by a surprise attack by Hamas militants in southern Israel in October 2023 during which they killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 250 hostage. Israel bannedall cooperationwith Unrwa’s activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank earlier this year, and claims the agency has been infiltrated by Hamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested. The international court of justice, the UN’s highest court, is hearing statements from dozens of countries and organisations before delivering a legal opinion on Israel’s humanitarian obligations to Palestinians. A key issue is whether Israel’s ban on Unrwa’s operations in Palestine is legal. Israel is not participating at the ICJ but has dismissed the hearings as “part of the systematic persecution and delegitimization” of the country. The foreign minister, Gideon Saar, said on Sunday that the hearings were “another attempt to politicise and abuse the legal process to persecute Israel”. “The goal is to deprive Israel of its most basic right to defend itself,” he said. “It is not Israel that should be on trial. It is the UN and Unrwa. The UN has become a rotten, anti-Israel and antisemitic body.” The hearings come amid an intensifying bombardment of Gaza, which had killed at least 27 Palestinians in the past 36 hours, according to local health officials on Monday. The Israeli military said airstrikes had killed three militant commanders and that all targets were “subject to relevant provisions of international humanitarian law, including the taking of feasible precautions to mitigate civilian harm”. Palestinian health officials in the territory say 2,151 people, including 732 children, have been killed since Israel broke a fragile ceasefire on 18 March that had been in place since mid-January. Israel imposed a tight blockade on Gaza almost two months ago, stopping all food, fuel, medicines and other items from entering. It says the measure is intended to force Hamas into releasing hostages and accuses it of systematically stealing humanitarian assistance. Rights groups accuse Israel of using a “starvation tactic” that endangers the whole population, potentially making it a war crime. Humanitarian workers say supplies are running desperately low, with most people eating one meal or less a day. Major agencies such as the World Food Programme and Unrwa have distributed their last stocks of flour and other basic foodstuffs, and medics say malnutrition levels are rising. Hamas is still holding 59 hostages, 24 of whom are believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements and other deals. Families of deceased hostages called on Tuesday for the return of their loved ones’ remains. There are fears that poor conditions and continuing fighting could lead to many being destroyed or soon becoming unidentifiable. “After everything we went through on that day and since, it cannot be that my father’s body will also disappear from the face of the Earth,” said Bar Godard, whose parents were killed during the 2023 Hamas raid and whose father’s body was taken to Gaza. Negotiations for a fresh ceasefire appear to have stalled, with conflicting reports about progress in ongoing talks. Few observers expect a breakthrough in the near future, though analysts say Donald Trump’s scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates in May could lead to renewed US pressure on Israel that might secure a deal. Israeli forces have killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, since it launched its offensive on Gaza, according to the territory’s health ministry. Bombardments and ground operations have also destroyed vast areas and displaced about 80% of the population, many of them 10 or more times. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has vowed to continue the offensive until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is either destroyed or agrees to disarm and leave the territory.",

    "article_text": "US sailors had to leap for their lives when a fighter jet fell off a navy aircraft carrier that was reportedly making evasive maneuvers to avoid Houthi militant fire in the Red Sea on Monday. The F/A-18 fighter Super Hornet jet, along with the vehicle towing it into place on the deck of the USS Harry S Truman, rolled right out of the hangar and into the water, the navy said. Unnamed US officialsindicated to CNNthat the ship was swerving to avoid incoming fire fromYemen’s Houthi rebel force. Carriers make a zigzag maneuver when attempting to evade missile fire, causing them to list to one side. An official account of the ship’s movements was awaited on Tuesday as an investigation was being carried out. The Truman has been patrolling in the Middle East for several months, and recently had its stint extended by the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. It is one of two US aircraft carriers operating in the area, where US forces have been striking theHouthison a near daily basis using fighter jets, bombers, ships and drones. “The F/A-18E was actively under tow in the hangar bay when the move crew lost control of the aircraft. The aircraft and tow tractor were lost overboard,” the navy said. The jet was part of Strike Fighter Squadron 136. The crew members who were in the pilot seat of the Super Hornet and on the small towing tractor both jumped out before the jet and the tug went into the Red Sea. Fighter jets are routinely towed around the hangar deck to park where they are needed. Monday’s incident was the second F/A-18 operating off the Truman to be lost in six months, after one was mistakenly shot down by the USS Gettysburg late last year.

    "title": "UK Ikea boss backs calls to pedestrianise Oxford Street as flagship store opens",
    "article_text": "The UK boss of Ikea has backed calls to pedestrianise Oxford Street as the world’s largest furniture retailer finally opens its delayed store in London’s prime shopping destination. The Swedish company’s three-floor shop in the building that used to beTopshop’s former flagship store, with a mix of meatballs, lampshades and kitchen design assistance, opens on Thursday,18 months later than planned. Sitting in one of the mini-room sets designed to show off Ikea’s range of furnishings at the new store, Peter Jekelby, the chief executive of Ikea’s UK business, said he thought a plan to pedestrianise Oxford Street, backed by London’s mayor,Sadiq Khan, would be “good for the street” and “make it easier to move around”. Khan said theIkeastore was “a huge vote of confidence in London, in our economy and in our plans to rejuvenate Oxford Street” and that attracting new companies would help “create new jobs and increase footfall”. He said the “bold proposals” to pedestrianise Oxford Street were subject to consultation that closes on 2 May “so I encourage everyone to have their say”. Jekelby added that Ikea, which will employ more than 100 people in its new London store, was committed to opening more outlets in the UK, with plans for a major new site in Brighton this summer and smaller outlets in Norwich, Chester and Harlow in Essex. “After that we will take stock,” he said. “There are still places and space that we could be present in.” He said Ikea was “about affordability” and so could thrive even in a time of “thinner wallets”. He called on the UK government to foster stability in the UK market and not to overwhelm retailers with additional costs – after an increase in employer national insurance charges. Jekelby said that business rates needed a rethink so they were “more fit for purpose” and did not “penalise certain ways of shopping” – as currently those who operate stores face higher costs from the property-based tax than rivals who operate solely online. The bright and colourful – and largely underground – Oxford Street outlet includes a 130-seat Swedish deli, a live events space and one-to-one design services for kitchens, bedrooms and living rooms. The space is also brightened by huge animated displays of woodland scenes, buzzing bees and a wide variety of Londoners who talk about their home design choices – some of which are recreated in the store. It will display about 6,000 Ikea products, ranging from “Billy” bookcases to drinking glasses, and about 3,500 of those items will be available to take away on the spot, while the rest can be delivered to homes. The store’s opening is regarded by some as key to hopes for a revival of Oxford Street, which has gradually been rejuvenated after a slump in visitor numbers during the Covid pandemic, after which a number of sites sat vacant while a plethora ofcheap American candy shops moved in. In the past two years, the number of vacancies andcandy shops have droppedand the street has been boosted by new openings, including HMV, whichreturned to the site of its original storein November 2023, and the sportswear brand Under Armour. The seven-storey former Topshop building is also home to Nike Town, which is taking more space in some of the upper floors, an outlet for beauty specialist Space NK as well as office space.",

    "title": "Labour’s pledge to hire 6,500 extra teachers in England will be a ‘challenge’, report says",
    "article_text": "A key government pledge to appoint 6,500 extra teachers inEnglandby the end of this parliament will be difficult to achieve and is likely to fall short of demand, the UK’s public spending watchdog has warned. The education secretary Bridget Phillipson’s promise to recruit thousands of extra teachers in state schools, which has been funded by adding VAT to private school fees, forms one of the cornerstones of the government’s education policy. However, a report by the National Audit Office (NAO), published on Wednesday, warned that a projected increase in secondary schools’ pupil numbers was likely to outpace Labour’s recruitment ambitions, leaving teacher vacancies unfilled. Further education (FE) colleges, which are particularly badly affected by a longstanding recruitment and retention crisis, will need up to 12,400 more teachers alone by 2028-29, almost double the government’s overall pledge, the report says. Meanwhile, the number of newly qualified teachers who started in state secondary schools in 2023-24 fell to 8,700 – the lowest number since 2010-11. TheDepartment for Education(DfE) has missed its recruitment target for secondary teacher training in all but one of the past 10 years. With secondary school pupil numbers likely to peak in 2028, piling further pressure on the system, the NAO called on the government to publish a delivery plan, outlining how it intends to recruit the additional 6,500 teachers within the timeframe. It also urged ministers to “assess the extent to which the further education workforce model is fit for purpose”. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the chair of the public accounts committee, said: “The DfE assesses that meeting the government’s pledge for 6,500 more teachers will be very challenging. Even if met, it is not clear that this will be enough to fix the nationwide shortage of teachers amidst growing numbers of students. “There needs to be a new cross-sector approach to recruiting and retaining enough high-quality teachers. Otherwise, workforce challenges will continue to pose a real threat to young people’s education and life prospects.” Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: “Despite the government’s pledge, secondary schools and further education colleges face a challenge in securing enough teachers to support growing student numbers.” Jack Worth, the school workforce lead at the National Foundation for Educational Research, said the report sent a clear message to government that it would miss its 6,500 teacher recruitment pledge if it does not take action now. “Unfilled vacancy levels are at their highest rates since records began in 2010, with pay, stress from dealing with pupil behaviour and workload pressures reported to be contributing to teachers leaving the profession,” he added. “Properly funded pay rises are urgently needed alongside and non-financial measures, such as workload reduction and flexible working, to improve both recruitment and retention.” The Treasury has already saidany pay rises must come from existing budgets. Responding to the NAO report, Phillipson reiterated the government’s commitment to recruiting 6,500 more teachers. “We’re already seeing green shoots, with 2,000 more secondary school teachers training this year, alongside a boost in the number set to begin training in shortage Stem [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] subjects, but there’s still much more to do. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “Following last year’s 5.5% pay award, and with hundreds of millions of pounds being invested to help us turn the tide, I’m determined to restore teaching as the attractive, prestigious profession it should be.” Separate research into teacher recruitment, meanwhile, claims that men “face discrimination” when applying for roles in England’s school workforce, particularly for jobs at entry level such as teaching assistant roles. The study by Warwick Business School asked 600 teachers to evaluate fictitious CVs and found on average men were rated 1.2 percentage points lower than women, and 1.8 percentage points lower in applications for teacher assistant roles. “There’s growing concern about the lack of male teachers, especially to act as role models for boys,” said Dr Joshua Fullard, an assistant professor at the school. “But our research shows that, despite this concern, men still face biases during the hiring process – particularly in lower-ranked positions.” Prof Stephen Gorard, the director of the University of Durham’s evidence centre for education, who was not involved in the study, said: “This is a useful finding that shows a small bias against male applicants. However it seems that it was conducted as a simulation and so may not be true to a real application process.”",

    "title": "Labour not protecting people, economy and homes from climate crisis, watchdog says",
    "article_text": "Labour is putting people, the economy and the environment in increasing peril by failing to act on the effects of the climate crisis, the UK’s climate watchdog has said. Flooding, droughts and heatwaves are all increasing in severity due to climate breakdown, but current plans to protect people, land and infrastructure against extreme weather have been judged inadequate in a scathing assessment of the UK’s preparedness. Lady Brown, the chair of the adaptation subgroup of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the statutory adviser to government, said: “We are seeing no change in activity from the new government, despite the fact that … it’s clear to the public that thecurrent approach just isn’t working. The country is at risk, people are at risk, and there is not enough being done.” She said it was frightening that the government was not taking seriously the rapidly increasing risk of flooding and was insteadconsidering cuts to flood defences. The Treasury has indicated thatflood spending would not be ringfencedand could be reduced in the spending review in June. Brown said: “If that means they’re thinking of cutting the money forresilience to flooding, we would ask them to think again. I can’t be clear enough about our message: we cannot wait to take action. This is not tomorrow’s problem. It’s today’s problem. And if we don’t do something about it, it will become tomorrow’s disaster.” She pointed tofloods in Valenciathat killed 220 people in October andfloods in Germany and Belgiumin 2021 with similar numbers of deaths. “These are very close to home. These things could happen in the UK and we need government to recognise that this is the disaster that could be happening tomorrow and start to really take this seriously,” she said. “It is quite frightening that the evidence we’ve got shows that it isn’t yet.” Without increased focus on making the UK’s infrastructure and economy more resilient to extreme weather, the impacts of the climate crisis could destroy about 7% of the UK’s GDP by 2050, the CCC found. This compares with acost of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zeroby 2050 of about 0.2% of GDP per year. The CCC’s latesttwo-year assessment of the UK’s progress in adapting to climate change, published on Wednesday, found failure across every measure and every form of infrastructure, from transport and energy to communications. People’s health was being put at risk by the failure to adapt, the report found, and thenatural environment was being damaged. One in four properties will be at risk of flooding by 2050 unless urgent action is taken, up from about 6.3m properties today, the report found. More than a third of the railways and road networks are already at risk of flooding, which will rise to about half by 2050. More than half of England’s top quality agricultural land is already at risk of flooding, and harvests like last year’s – thesecond worst for arable on record– could become more common. Although many of the findings in the CCC assessment relate to measures taken under the previous government, Brown said that Labour was failing to respond to the threats. “We’re seeing no increase in action,” she said. The Environment Agency warned last year thatinflation was eating into flood defence budgets, meaning fewer people were being protected for the same expenditure. The National Audit Office warned of a quarter of new flood defence projects being abandoned. A government spokesperson said: “As part of our plan for change we are investing a record £2.65bn to repair and build flood defences, protecting tens of thousands of homes and businesses and helping local communities become more resilient to the effects of climate change such as overheating and drought.” Flooding is the most obvious impact of the climate crisis in the UK, but rising temperatures are also taking a toll. Drought has meant 20 million people are subjected to water restrictions,wildfiresare outrunning the capacity of the fire brigade to extinguish them – the area burned in 2025 has exceeded the previous annual record before summer has even started – and heatwaves are forecast to become more frequent and intense. The climate crisis is already imposing costs on the NHS. There were more than 3,000 excess deaths in England in the heatwave of 2022, and one in five doctors reported that surgeries and operations had been cancelled, the CCC found. Philip Evans, a senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: “Britain’s firefighters and insurers have already warned we’re not set up to cope with the increase in floods, wildfires and heatwaves. Now climate experts confirm it’s not getting better. This means our farms are under water, food prices are going up, homes are wrecked and ordinary people count the cost.” He called for taxes on fossil fuel companies to pay for the preparations needed. “The government must bolster Britain’s resilience. Oil and gas companies are fuelling this extreme weather and making billions from doing it, so we need climate taxes on these profits to pay for adaptation measures and protect us from the extreme costs of weather chaos.” Tom Lancaster, the head of land, food and farming at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, called for ministers to rescind thecuts to sustainable farming programmes. The ECIU estimated that that the impact of the climate crisis added about £360 to the average household food bill in total for 2022 and 2023. “Investing in [support schemes for sustainable farming] will be needed to build the resilience of UK food production, and will be a key test of whether the government has taken the criticism in this report on board,” he said.",

    "article_text": "More than 1,000 physician associates (PAs) could begin their careers in the NHS every year after regulators approved dozens of courses to teach them.The General Medical Council (GMC) said it had given 36 courses formal approval to teach PAs and anaesthesia associates (AAs).Overall, these courses had capacity for up to 1,059 PAs and 42 AAs to qualify each year.The GMC said approving training courses would mean that “patients, employers and colleagues can be assured that PAs and AAs have the required knowledge and skills to practise safely once they qualify”.PAs are graduates – usually with a health or life sciences degree – who have undertaken two years of postgraduate training.According to the NHS, PAs work under the supervision of a doctor and can diagnose people, take medical histories, perform physical examinations, see patients with long-term conditions, analyse test results and develop management plans.There werecalls for more clarity in the PA role and better patient protectionafter the death of Emily Chesterton, 30, in November 2022 from a pulmonary embolism.Chesterton was misdiagnosed by a PA in London on two occasions who said her calf pain was a sprain, when she actually had a blood clot.Most associates work in GP surgeries, acute medicine and emergency medicine while AAs work as part of the anaesthesia and wider surgical team.The GMC, which took over the regulation of PAs and AAs in December, said it had approved 33 PA courses.Four of these – at Bradford, Greater Manchester, Queen Mary University of London and Sheffield Hallam – had been approved with “conditions” after some concerns were identified during the approval process.The GMC said each of these courses had a “targeted action plan” in place to address concerns.The regulator did not approve the course at the University of East London.There are only three courses for AAs – in Birmingham, University College London and Lancaster – that were all approved, the GMC said.Prof Colin Melville, the GMC’s medical director and director of education and standards, said: “This is an important milestone in the regulation of PAs and AAs and will provide assurance, now and in the future, that those who qualify in these roles have the appropriate skills and knowledge that patients rightly expect and deserve.“As a regulator, patient safety is paramount, and we have a robust quality assurance process for PA and AA courses, as we do for medical schools. We have been engaging with course providers for several years already, and we only grant approval where they meet our high standards.”In November, Wes Streeting, the health and social care secretary, announced an independent review of the PA and AA professions led by Prof Gillian Leng, the president of the Royal Society of Medicine.Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, said: “The formal accreditation of the courses of study that PAs and AAs must complete is an essential component of regulation and public safety.“We await the outcome of the Leng review but recognise that individual NHS organisations also have a responsibility to support PAs and AAs to both use their knowledge safely with patients, and to ensure appropriate professional development and supervision.”Prof Phil Banfield, the council chair at the British Medical Association, said it was “difficult to understand” how the GMC could approve the courses when the Leng review into PAs and AAs has not concluded.He added: “The medical profession has alarming worries about the quality and robustness of these courses, with reports of exams with 100% pass rates.“We have made doctors’ concerns clear in our submission to the Leng review, which includes a call for an independent body of doctors, without links to course providers, to determine proportionate and safe expectations of what can be covered in curricula for assistant roles within a two-year training period.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion PA Media contributed to this report",

    "title": "Fly-tippers’ vehicles to be crushed in bid to save England from ‘avalanche of rubbish’",
    "article_text": "Councils will be encouraged to work with police forces to seize and crush vehicles used by fly-tippers, in the latest phase of a government policy blitz before Thursday’s local elections. Under a scheme being led by the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), new legislation will impose jail sentences of up to five years for people who illicitly transport waste inEngland. Fly-tipping, in which people illegally dump rubbish or debris, often by roadsides, rather than taking it to a proper waste site, is commonly listed by voters as a local concern. Governmentstatistics for Englandrecorded 1.15m incidents in 2023-24, up 6% from a year before. While councils already have the powers to seize and crush vehicles used in fly-tipping, Defra said administrative hurdles mean this is rarely done, with the bulk of such action last year taking place under just two councils. As well as working with councils to make this easier, local authorities will also be able to charge fly-tippers for the cost of seizing and storing any vehicles. Police will be encouraged to help identify vehicles being used with drones and mobile CCTV cameras. While rules do not allow new policies to be announced specific to areas where elections are taking place on Thursday, national initiatives are permitted. With Labour expected to face a strong challenge from Reform UK, other new policies have covered topics such as immigration and policing. To unveil the initiative,Steve Reed, the environment secretary, visited a recycling centre in Wokingham, Berkshire, where a van used in fly-tipping was being crushed. Reed said: “Waste criminals and fly-tippers who blight our towns and villages have gone unpunished for too long. That ends today. The government is calling time on fly-tipping. I will not stand by while this avalanche of rubbish buries our communities. “Waste crime is trashing communities across the country. Fly-tipping has skyrocketed by a fifth while the number of prosecutions has fallen by the same amount since 2018-19. “The failure to punish these criminals has left our high streets, roads and countryside buried under an avalanche of rubbish.” In a parallel initiative, the Environment Agency will be given extra resources to carry out checks on licensed waste operators, with more powers to revoke permits for rogue companies, as well as fining them. Philip Duffy, the agency’s chief executive, said: “Waste crime is toxic. Criminals’ thoughtless actions harm people, places, and the economy, blighting our communities and disrupting legitimate businesses. “We’re determined to bring these criminals to justice through tough enforcement action and prosecutions. That’s why we support the government’s crackdown on waste criminals, which will ensure we have the right powers to shut rogue operators out of the waste industry.”",

    "article_text": "The UK experienced its hottest day of the year so far on Tuesday and temperatures could reach 30C at the earliest point on record later this week, forecasters said.The highest temperature recorded on Tuesday was 24.9C in Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, according to the Met Office.The previous hottest day this year was 24.5C recorded in St James’s Park, London, on Monday.The Met Office, which warned last month that the climate crisis is pushing temperature extremes to new levels, said temperatures could hit 27C or 28C on Wednesday in southern England and the Midlands.In a further sign of the changing climate, Wales could also set a new record for its highest April temperature – currently 26.2C.Meteorologist Craig Snell said the most likely places to see the warmest weather on Wednesday were “in a line from London over towards the West Country and into the Midlands”.Snell told the PA news agency: “The central southern parts of the UK are probably going to be where the highest temperatures will be tomorrow.”He said Thursday would be “the peak of the heat”, adding: “We are likely to see 28C or 29C, and again it’s going to be a corridor from the west of London over towards Bristol which will probably be the most likely places to see the highest temperatures.”The meteorologist said the high temperatures on Thursday would result in one of the “warmest starts to May on record”.Met Office chief meteorologist Paul Gundersen said April temperatures in the mid-20s were “not particularly unusual” but added: “It is more unusual to see temperatures reach the high 20s, and if we see 30C this week, it will be the earliest point in the year in which we have achieved that threshold.”Temperatures are forecast to drop across much of the UK on Friday as the high pressure starts to pull away.The highest recorded April temperature was in 1949, when Camden Square, London, recorded 29.4C.The London fire brigade (LFB) has urged caution around open-water swimming after last month saw a 32% increase in water-related incidents compared with the same period last year.Craig Carter, the LFB’s assistant commissioner for prevention and protection, said: “Even when the sun is shining, water temperatures can be dangerously cold. Cold water shock can affect anyone, no matter how fit or experienced they are.“It can lead to water inhalation and, in the worst cases, drowning. Be particularly careful near the water’s edge – it’s easy to slip and fall unexpectedly. And think twice before jumping into open water.”Research this month found that the number of UK homes overheating in summerquadrupled to 80%over the past decade.The study also found that the use of air conditioning soared sevenfold to 21% of homes between 2011 and 2022. The researchers warned that continuation of this trend could put strain on the national electricity grid, increase carbon emissions and fuel social disadvantage among families unable to afford air conditioning.The research was prompted by extreme heatwaves in 2022, when temperatures in the UK rose above 40C for the first time. The past two years have been the hottest on record globally, driven by the burning of fossil fuels.More than 10,000 people have died as a result of summer heatwaves from 2020 to 2024, data from the UK Health Security Agency shows.The huge rise in overheated homes and air conditioner use was “a shocking result”, said Dr Mehri Khosravi at the University of East London, who led the study. She added: “Over the heatwaves experienced in 2022 we had nearly 4,500 dead, but this excess mortality is hidden.”",

    "title": "Measles cases in Texas rise to 663 amid outbreaks in other US states",
    "article_text": "Measles cases inTexasrose to 663 on Tuesday, according to the state’s health department, an increase of 17 cases since 25 April, as the US battles one of its worst outbreaks of the previously eradicated childhood disease. Cases in Gaines county, the center of the outbreak, rose to 396, three more from its last update on Friday, the Texas department of state health services said. Eighty-seven patients have been hospitalized, the agency said. An eight-year-old child in Texas died from measles on 3 April, according to health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr.Healthofficials in Texas said the child had not had underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure”. An unvaccinated child, aged six, also with no underlying conditions, died of measles in Texas in late February, Kennedy said. Researchers have warned that the country is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, a quarter-century after the disease was declared eradicated from the country. “The rate of rise in measles cases appears to be slowing down, but it is still concerning that we are seeing more cases adding to the count,” said Sapna Singh, chief medical officer at Texas Children’s Pediatrics. New Mexico’s health department reported 66 cases on Tuesday, the same as its last update. Most of the state’s cases are from Lea county, adjacent to Gaines county in Texas. “The ideal situation is to see a few weeks of no increase in the case count before we can have some optimism in the spread slowing down,” said Singh. US pediatricians and infectious disease experts say the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination from government health officials and statements on unproven treatments that are confusing parents. Doctors assert that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent infection. Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. The disease has been considered eliminated from the US since 2000. Other states with active outbreaks – defined as three or more cases – include Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. With one-fifth of states seeing active measles outbreaks, the US is nearing 900 cases, according to figures posted Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s confirmed measles cases count is 884, triple the amount seen in all of 2024. In communities with high vaccination rates – above 95% – diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity”. But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their children from required shots. The US saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.",

    "article_text": "A runaway kangaroo named Sheila shut down a stretch of interstate inAlabamaon Tuesday before state troopers and the animal’s owner wrangled the wayward marsupial. The Alabama law enforcement agency said the kangaroo was spotted on Tuesday hopping along the side of Interstate 85 in Macon county, which is between Montgomery and Auburn. The sight snarled traffic, and state troopers shut down both sides of the interstate for the safety of motorists. Capt Jeremy J Burkett of the Alabama law enforcement agency said the animal’s owner and troopers were able to capture it. “When somebody said there was a kangaroo of course I didn’t believe it, and nobody believed it. But I’m looking at him,” Sheriff Andre Brunson of Macon county said in a Facebook live video as the animal was captured. The owner used a dart to tranquilize the animal. Brunson’s video showed the drugged kangaroo being carried to a vehicle to be returned to its home. The animal was captured on the side of the interstate between Tuskegee and Auburn, the sheriff said. “We see a little bit of everything here,” the sheriff said. The animal’s owner, Patrick Starr, told the Associated Press that the animal’s name was Sheila and that she escaped from her enclosure. “She’s back home safe. She’s up. She’s not sedated anymore. She’s eating. She’s drinking. She’s not injured,” Starr said. The kangaroo was treated by the Auburn University College of Veterinary Medicine, he said. The family runs a pumpkin patch and petting zoo, but Sheila is just a personal pet, Starr said. “She’s a sweet pet. I’m glad she’s back home, and I’m glad everybody slowed down a little bit,” he said.",

    "title": "Fall of Saigon: Children of Vietnam’s war refugees reconcile a painful past",
    "article_text": "Hanoi/Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam– Although a child of war refugees, Victoria Ngo got to learn more about her Vietnamese identity only during her college years in the United States in the 1990s. The eldest daughter in a refugee family with a Vietnamese father of Chinese descent, Ngo grew up in a Chinese-speaking community in the US and for a while thought of herself essentially as just Chinese. As an inquisitive schoolgirl, Ngo had noticed the differences, though, between her experience as Vietnamese and those of the Chinese people she grew up with. Curiosity about her identity increased over the years, partly because questions she asked about Vietnam went unanswered by her parents and other relatives. “I lived with people who only spoke Chinese. My siblings and I went to Chinese school on the weekends,” she told Al Jazeera. “I also speak Vietnamese, and my name is a Vietnamese name. My experience is very much a Vietnamese experience in the sense that I came as a refugee and came during the wave of the Vietnamese refugee,” she said. But Vietnam was just not spoken about. And certainly notthe war that ended 50 years agowhen South Vietnam’s then-capital, Saigon, fell to North Vietnamese forces and their leaders in Hanoi. Trying to fill in the missing pieces of her family’s past, Ngo recounted how she signed up to attend a conference about the war in Vietnam at her college, “thinking that my father would be proud of me”. His response was stark and unexpected. “He said, ‘If you go to that conference, you are not my daughter!’” Ngo recounted. “And I was like, ‘Wow, I thought I was just learning about our history,’ to which he responds: ‘That is not our history.'” Ngo’s experience is not uncommon among Vietnamese families who fled their country as refugees after Saigon fell on April 30, 1975. Thefall of Saigonended the war and marked the reunification of North and South with Hanoi as the new capital of post-war Vietnam. But many of those who worked under the US-aligned government of the Republic of Vietnam, or South Vietnam as it was then known – its civil servants, soldiers, businesspeople – chose exile over unification and living in a communist Vietnam. Too many lives had been lost. Too much blood had been spilled – North and South – that many, like Ngo’s father, could never forgive nor live with their wartime foes in peacetime. For others, exile as refugees would be a choice taken to stay with relatives who feared persecution – or so they believed – if they stayed in Vietnam after the war. The US-backed wars in the three countries of Indochina left huge losses in their wake. Laos and Cambodia suffered an estimated 1.45 million deaths under US bombings. In Vietnam, there were an estimated 1.1 million military deaths on the communist North’s side alone and more than 254,000 on the side of the South Vietnamese republic. Compounded with civilian deaths, the estimated death toll from the war in Vietnam stands conservatively at 3.1 million people. For the victorious communist forces, they were left with a country in ruin. The northern part of the country was subjected to heavy US bombings. The railroads were inoperable. Most of the major roads were bombed into cratered tracks. Its economy was shattered. The northern population had also witnessed decades of conflict after the onset of French colonial rule in the late 19th century. Southern Vietnam’s urban infrastructure was less damaged by the war. The countryside was in ruins as rural areas had become the front lines in the guerrilla warfare that marked most of the fighting in the South. Croplands and forests had been poisoned by the US use of defoliant, better known as Agent Orange, the highly toxic chemical compound that was sprayed from the air to deny communist fighters on the ground the cover of trees and other concealing foliage. Millions of Vietnamese people were affected by the use of Agent Orange, including at least 150,000 children who would be born with severe physical, mental and developmental defects, and others are still being affected to this day because the soil remains poisoned. Unexploded bombs – in the many hundreds of thousands of tonnes – still “contaminate” up to 20 percent of Vietnam’s territory due to the millions of tonnes of ordnance used in the war, according to the Vietnam National Mine Action Center. While their April 30, 1975, victory marked an end to the war for the North Vietnamese, for the defeated US-backed government and people of the South, the war’s end was for many the start of lengthy separation from family in “reeducation camps” or permanent exile to Western countries, such as the US, Australia, Germany and Canada. Before the fall of Saigon, Ngo’s father was a high school principal in South Vietnam. After April 30, 1975, he was placed in reeducation camps twice before he made a desperate decision to take his family out of the country on a rickety, overcrowded boat in 1978. The family would spend half a year in a refugee camp in the Philippines before being accepted by the US as refugees. By the time of their arrival in the US in the early 1980s, Ngo’s extended family had lost everything. Her immediate family, two aunts and uncles, and a grandmother and her relatives shared a two-storey, 30sq-metre (323sq-ft) subsidised housing unit in Los Angeles. Her father could not teach in the US and ended up becoming a deep ocean fisherman as well as doing odd jobs to put food on the table. The Vietnam they fled became a bad memory to be forgotten, Ngo said. “There is this void in our history that doesn’t get talked about. You don’t know about what’s happened in the past,” she told Al Jazeera. A profound sense of loss is a narrative shared by many Vietnamese refugee families – deep pain from the past that is felt across generations. Within some families, any mention of the war risks evoking strong emotions and triggering past griefs. The sensitivity is such that silence about the past is sometimes preferred. Cat Nguyen, a young American Vietnamese poet, experienced similar evasiveness when it came to family experiences of the war. Now based in Ho Chi Minh City – the name given to Saigon after the war in honour of the founding father of the Vietnamese Communist Party – Cat Nguyen said little was shared about their family’s past before coming to the US. “My family, in particular my grandma, harboured deep pain from her past,” Cat Nguyen told Al Jazeera. Cat Nguyen’s family also has a complicated political history. While a maternal grandfather was an active revolutionary who supported anticolonial efforts against the French in pre-independence Vietnam, a paternal grandfather served in the government of South Vietnam and a maternal grandmother was the principal of an American-English school in Saigon. But in 1975, Cat Nguyen’s family on both sides, and its political divide, left Vietnam. Cat Nguyen’s father was just 10 years old and mother was 13 when they left Vietnam. They were “uprooted from their native land in the blink of an eye” for a new life in the US, Cat Nguyen said. “The first few years in the US were filled with sadness for them: difficulties adjusting to a strange land, a language they were not fluent in, a people who did not understand the world they [the Vietnamese refugees] were coming from,” Cat Nguyen said. The trauma of fleeing Vietnam was also compounded by official accounts that cast the refugees and Vietnamese diaspora as abandoning their country in its hour of much-needed national reconstruction. This year’s 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon will be celebrated by the Communist Party of Vietnam as a day of unification and also “liberation of the south”. That message speaks to the aspirations of millions of Vietnamese in the north and south who made great sacrifices during the war, but the party’s official history is inevitably limited. To this day, the experiences of many in southern Vietnam and their perspectives on the war – what motivated them to resist North Vietnam’s political leadership, including Ho Chi Minh – remain absent from the celebratory narratives. In this fateful historical showdown, southerners who fled overseas as refugees are cast in the role of puppets or traitors, lured and manipulated by the enemy’s luxuries and propaganda into abandoning their own people. Seeing their experiences erased and delegitimised after the war added to the pain of displacement for Vietnam’s diaspora communities. It also explains the anger still harboured towards Vietnam’s leadership by an older generation of refugees, such as Ngo’s father. This is a multigenerational resentment that still rears its head when refugee parents believe their children are being exposed to positive narratives about bustling, economically thriving Vietnam five decades after the war – which they brand as “the North’s propaganda”. It is not only contemporary Vietnam’s official version of history that is problematic. Cat Nguyen realised there were also gaps when turning to American high school textbooks to learn about the war in Vietnam. In those schoolbooks, Washington’s decades-long military involvement in Vietnam, which left millions of people dead and millions scattered across the world as refugees, only “a small paragraph” was devoted to “how the US fought against communism in Vietnam”, Cat Nguyen said. Although supposedly sympathetic to their former South Vietnamese “allies”, Cat Nguyen told of a US-centric perspective that still subjects Vietnamese refugees to an “Americanised gaze”. “An Americanised gaze of refugees, meaning that Americans viewed all Vietnamese as either dangerous, threatening communists or as helpless, infantilised refugees,” Cat Nguyen said. Such narratives had helped to justify US intervention and military occupation of Vietnam to “save” the Vietnamese from themselves and communism. “While it is true that Vietnamese refugees suffered greatly, this gaze strips human beings of their own agency and humanhood, displacing them into a framework that upholds the system of white supremacy,” said Cat Nguyen, who has called Vietnam home for more than two years. Vietnamese American writer Viet Thanh Nguyen noted in his book Nothing Ever Dies that Vietnamese refugees were able to find in the US – in whatever limited space that was available to them – opportunities to tell their immigrant stories, to “insert themselves into the American dream”. But it was precisely that “dream” that Cat Nguyen would eventually grow disenchanted with along with its “capitalist propaganda”. The “American dream” has erased “the history of the US’s genocide of Indigenous populations, enslavement of Black and racialised peoples, and violent colonial and imperial projects”, they said. It is not that Cat Nguyen never had tried to fit into US society. Rather, from a young age, Cat Nguyen told of constantly being made to feel different in a society that “never sees them as American enough”. “Throughout my life, I watched as the Vietnamese parts of me slowly eroded. It wasn’t until the passing of my grandmother – the person who taught me the most about where I come from – that I began desperately searching for a physical, mental, emotional and spiritual return to my ancestral homeland and my humanity,” Cat Nguyen said. Seeking to reconnect, Cat Nguyen has become involved in art projects in the form of poetry, performance and filmmaking that experiment with a range of elements in Vietnamese folklore and traditional musical instruments to “unapologetically” recommit to “the fight against colonisation, imperialism and capitalism”. Drawn to identify with Vietnamese revolutionary fighters from “the other side”, Cat Nguyen spoke of finding a source of personal strength in their wisdom and dying for their cause. That conviction has not led to a dismissal of Cat Nguyen’s own family’s suffering as refugees in the US, but the acknowledgement of the coexistence of intergenerational trauma that Vietnam’s official history fails to include. One of Cat Nguyen’s poems pays homage to their late grandmother: “You crossed / an ocean / for me / to cross / another and then you crossed / a world / before I / could follow.” Ngo never did attend the university conference on the war in Vietnam that her father had threatened to disown her over all those years ago. That was out of respect for her father’s wishes. Since then, she has gradually come to see events in Vietnam during the war years and after from the North’s perspective – albeit with critical eyes. “I definitely see that when anything is too centralised and too authoritarian, you have corruption. But if the leadership is very strong and competent, things can move very efficiently,” said Ngo, who relocated to Vietnam more than 20 years ago. Like Cat Nguyen, Ngo understands the trauma her family members from the South suffered. It inspired her to pursue a career in psychology and public health focused on underserved communities. She became an associate professor of community health and social sciences at City University of New York’s Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy. “One of the reasons why I work with marginalised populations and vulnerable populations is because I also understand that experience having grown up as a refugee and in the early years not having very much,” Ngo said. After more than two decades in Vietnam, Ngo has focused on equipping primary care clinics with the capacity to take care of poor people who suffer from mental health problems but lack access to care. “I feel like my experience as a refugee has really made me think a lot about the human condition and what kinds of social resources and economic resources we need to put in place to help people in transition and who are marginalised, to help people who are displaced in one way or another,” she said. For both Ngo and Cat Nguyen, being part of the Vietnamese diaspora and its painful past has given them a nuanced perspective on Vietnam’s history that is not readily found in the competing narratives of North and South. Kevin D Pham said there was a recurring story he was told while growing up in a Vietnamese refugee family in San Jose, California. “I was told by my high school teachers and especially my family that communists were bad, essentially,” said Pham, an assistant professor of political theory at the University of Amsterdam. Pham’s paternal grandfather was imprisoned by communist Viet Minh forces in the 1950s, and his maternal grandfather was imprisoned in a reeducation camp after 1975 and died there from malnutrition. From a young age, Pham was taught to be proud of his Republic of Vietnam family heritage. Although he appreciates this perspective, he did not uncritically accept what he was taught. After graduating from university, he lived in Vietnam for eight months and, there, came to learn about and sympathise with perspectives from the “other side”. But growing up in the US, he told of listening to his uncle, who was a pilot, as he recounted the glory of his younger days when he fought “the communists” during the war. Pham’s father, on the other hand, was only 16 years old when he was forced to leave Vietnam and did not have much direct experience of warfare. Still, his patriotism for the vanquished US-backed Southern government was still unwavering. Pham recounts how, during his youth, older Vietnamese men would stop and salute as he and his father cruised down the streets of San Jose in his father’s bright yellow Ford Mustang, which had three horizontal red stripes painted on the bonnet to represent the flag of South Vietnam. In Vietnam to this day, the South Vietnamese flag is still taboo. Among staunch Vietnamese nationalists, the south’s “three-stripes”, or “ba que”, flag has become a popular slur, symbolising betrayal of the nation, defeat and humiliation. Any association with the former government’s flag, however remote, has also been used to denounce and alienate. In early 2023, Hanni Pham, an Australian-Vietnamese singer with the Korean band New Jeans, got caught up in the flag controversy and was subjected to an online campaign, which started when online activists spotted a South Vietnamese flag in a video recording made when she visited her grandparents’ home. The only public place where you can still find an actual three-stripe flag in Vietnam is in Hanoi at the newly built Vietnam Military History Museum, where one is displayed as a historical artefact. Yet attempts to reconcile Vietnam’s fractious past date back decades. In 1993, under Vietnam’s then-prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, the Communist Party’s Politburo issued a resolution that marked the first official attempt at reconciliation by encouraging the country to “respect differences, join hands in dismantling prejudices, shame, hatred, and look forward to the future”. Kiet was sensitive to the plight of Vietnamese refugees, something that he witnessed within his own family. In a well known interview in 2005 that drew both praise and criticism, he described April 30, 1975, as a “great victory” but one that left “millions happy, millions in sorrow”. “It is a scar that needs healing rather than left to bleed,” he said. In November, then-president and incumbent general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, To Lam, made a historic appearance at Columbia University in the US with Lien-Hang Nguyen, the daughter of a refugee family who became the first director of Vietnamese studies at the university and who has worked on building bridges between the diaspora and Vietnam. Their meeting reflected a broader spirit of unity and healing emerging among Vietnamese people long divided by the scars of war and political differences. Kevin D Pham said he noticed how those who have strong views on the historical North-South divide in Vietnam commonly use the word “puppets” as a slur, whether referring to supporters of the South Vietnamese government as “puppets” of the Americans or the North’s supporters as “puppets” of the Soviet Union and China. “There is this tendency on both sides of seeing the other side as puppets who cannot think for themselves,” Pham said, adding that it indicates a “lack of curiosity” about the other side’s perspective and has become “an obstacle to true reconciliation”. “What I encourage instead is the ability to understand multiple perspectives,” he said. For Cat Nguyen, what is fascinating is that the current national flag of Vietnam – a yellow, five-pointed star on a red background – which once brought painful memories to family members still in the US, is now a source of comradery throughout Vietnam. This was experienced firsthand when the Vietnamese national football team won the 2024 ASEAN championship in January. Cat Nguyen described flag-waving crowds storming onto streets across the country in celebration of a sporting, not a political, event. “I am empathetic to the suffering from both sides despite which flags they identify with, either the three-stripe or the red flag with yellow star,” Cat Nguyen said. “Everyone experienced so much violence, and ultimately I assign the most blame to US imperialism.” Additional reporting by Duy-Minh Nguyen in Ho Chi Minh City",

    "title": "Trump marks tumultuous first 100 days in office with rally in Michigan",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has promised to bring back jobs to the United States, as he marked hisfirst 100 daysin office with a rally in the city of Michigan. The remarks on Tuesday, dubbed an “achievement speech” by the White House, came amid slumping approval ratings and dismal consumer confidence as Trump has pursued norm-busting trade, immigration and government overhauls. Still, Trump hailed what he called “the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country”. “And that’s according to many, many people,” he added. “And everyone is saying it… We’ve just gotten started”. The president, who walked onto the stage to God Bless the USA by Lee Greenwood, spoke to thousands of supporters for more than an hour. Standing in front of a banner that read, “The Golden Age”, he began his speech with his familiar rally fare, saying his administration was “ending illegal immigration”, “taking back our jobs”, “restoring the rule of law” and getting what he called “woke lunacy and transgender insanity the hell out of our government”. He also took jabs at former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, continued his years-long attack on the US media and falsely claimed that Democrats attempted to “rig” the 2024 election. Trump then pivoted to histariff policy, which has roiled global markets and caused disquiet among industry leaders. Hours earlier, Trump signed an executive order seeking to ease some tariff pressures amid pushback from US auto manufacturers. The order would prevent “stacking” of Trump’s various tariffs on auto part imports for vehicles manufactured in the US. His administration has imposed 25 percent tariffs on foreign auto imports, blanket 10 percent levies on nearly all trade partners, 25 percent tariffs on steel and aluminium, as well as 25 percent tariffs on trade with Mexico and Canada not covered under a pre-existing deal. Trump has framed the moves as part of a hard reset to force industries back to the US, a claim he repeated to reporters in his Michigan speech. “They all want to come back to Michigan and build cars again,” he said. “You know why? Because of our tax and tariff policy.” Reporting from the rally, Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane said the location was significant. Trump won the so-called battleground state of Michigan in the election last year, but the state, and its reliance on the auto industry, could be one of the hardest hit by his tariff policy. “We’re just about 20 miles [32km] down the road from Detroit, Michigan. That’s the home of the ‘Big Three’ automakers: General Motors, Ford and Stellantis,” Culhane said. “We’ve seen automakers really come out against these tariffs because virtually no car is made completely in the United States, as Donald Trump wants to see happen,” she said. “Meanwhile, in the crowd, you see a lot of T-shirts that say ‘UAW’, the United Auto Workers union. The union came out in favour of these tariffs because they believe, in the long run, it will force companies to bring jobs back to the US.” Recent polls have shown the enthusiasm among Trump’s supporters at the Michigan rally is not reflected among the wider public, with nearly every major pollster finding higher disapproval than approval for the president in recent days. These included separate Morning Consult and New York Times/Siena polls that showed 54 percent disapproval, a Marist College poll that showed 53 percent disapproval and an Ipsos poll that recorded 55 percent disapproval. Trump dismissed the polls as “fake” and run by a “bunch of crooked people”. Hours earlier on Tuesday, The Conference Board, an organisation that tracks views on the US economy, released new data showing tanking US consumer confidence. Confidence fell by 7.9 points to 86 in April as Trump’s tariff rollout caused widespread economic uncertainty, the lowest level since May 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. While no new trade deals have been reached since the country-specific tariffs were announced, and thenpaused, Trump told his supporters that officials were “coming from all over the world to see your president”. “They want to make a deal,” he said. Trump also renewed his criticisms of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying the central bank head was not doing a good job. He doubled down on calls for Congress to slash taxes, a plan that nonpartisan budget analysts said could add trillions to the nation’s $36.6 trillion debt. “In the coming weeks and months, we will pass the largest tax cuts in American history, and that will include no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security, no tax on overtime,” Trump said. Democrats, meanwhile, railed against Trump’s presidency on the Senate floor on Tuesday evening under the counter-programming banner, “100 days of chaos”, with multiple speeches expected to stretch well into the night. Some described Senate Republicans as “co-conspirators” who secretly oppose Trump’s agenda but refuse to voice full-throated criticism. “The president is testing and violating the bounds of our Constitution, amassing power for himself as the economy tanks, violating the rights of Americans and destroying our image abroad,” Senator Richard Durbin, of Illinois, the chamber’s No 2 Democrat, said. “But it seems the ambition of the Republican-controlled legislative branch is all but absent as Donald Trump’s government goes out of control… It is, in fact, the silence of the lambs.” There were also protests outside the community college where Trump’s rally was held. Dozens of demonstrators lined a busy street there, carrying upside-down US flags and waving signs that read: “I dissent.”",

    "title": "Pakistan minister warns of possible Indian military strike in 24-36 hours",
    "article_text": "Pakistan’s minister for information and broadcasting says Islamabad has “credible intelligence” that India intends to launch a military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours, as tensions between the two countries escalate following a deadly attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. In a social media post early on Wednesday, Attaullah Tarar accused India of using last week’sattack in Pahalgam, which killed 26 tourists, “as a false pretext” to potentially strike Pakistan. The minister did not provide any concrete information to back up his claim, and the Indian government did not immediately comment publicly on the allegations. “Any act of aggression will be met with a decisive response. India will be fully responsible for any serious consequences in the region,” Tarar said in the post on X. Pakistani Minister of Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif also told the Reuters news agency on Monday that a military incursion by India was “imminent”. Islamabad is on high alert but will only use its nuclear weapons if “there is a direct threat to our existence”, Asif said. India’s Ministry of External Affairs did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Reuters news agency on the latest remarks from Tarar. Tensions between the two countries have been rising after India said there were Pakistani elements linked to the attack on April 22 in the mountain resort of Pahalgam. It was the deadliest attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir in more than two decades, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to pursue the attackers. A statement issued in the name of The Resistance Front (TRF), which is believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistani-based Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. But Islamabad has denied any role in what happened and called for a neutral investigation. After the attack, the neighbours unleashed a raft of diplomatic measures against each other, including visa revocations and the closure of Pakistani airspace to Indian airlines. India also suspended its participation in theIndus Waters Treaty, which regulates water-sharing from the Indus River and its tributaries between the two countries. The move spurred protests in Pakistan, and the Pakistani government has said it is preparing legal action over New Delhi’s decision. Fire alsohas been exchangedalong the Line of Control (LoC), the 740km (460-mile) de-facto border separating Indian- and Pakistani-controlled areas of Kashmir, prompting international calls to de-escalate tensions. On Tuesday, the United States urged the two countries to work towards a “responsible solution”. “We are reaching out to both parties, and telling … them to not escalate the situation,” a Department of State spokesperson told reporters, quoting a statement by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The spokesperson added that Rubio would speak to the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan on Tuesday or Wednesday and encouraged other foreign ministers to do the same. The United Nations also said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences”.",

    "title": "PSG beat Arsenal 1-0 in Champions League semifinal first leg",
    "article_text": "Paris Saint-Germain took a big step towards reaching the Champions League final as Ousmane Dembele’s early goal sealeda 1-0 win at Arsenalin a tense first leg of the semifinal. Dembele fired home off the post in the fourth minute as PSG dominated the opening stages on Tuesday, and Luis Enrique’s side held firm to take a precious advantage back to the French capital. Arsenal, playing in the semifinal for the first time since 2009, improved after a lacklustre start and had a Mikel Merino goal ruled out after the break while PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma made several fine saves. PSG weathered the storm and should have given themselves a bigger cushion for the second leg but Bradley Barcola and Goncalo Ramos both squandered gilt-edged chances late on. Should PSG protect their advantage next Wednesday at home, they will face either Inter Milan or Barcelona in Munich and they will believe a first title in Europe’s blue riband club competition is now finally within reach. Arsenal comfortably beat PSG 2-0 in north London in the early days of the league phase in October, but Luis Enrique’s French champions have evolved into a formidable force. Since that defeat by Arsenal, PSG have been the scourge of English clubs, beating Manchester City in the league phase, knocking Premier League winners Liverpool out in the last 16 and dispatching Aston Villa in a quarterfinal thriller. Roared on by fanatical support, PSG barely gave a ragged Arsenal a kick for the opening 25 minutes, their pace and movements too much for Mikel Arteta’s side. Smoke from the pre-match pyrotechnics had barely cleared when PSG struck. Khvicha Kvaratskhelia received the ball on the left and surged into the area before laying back a pass for Dembele to sweep a shot in off the post past David Raya. It was Dembele’s eighth goal and 11th goal involvement in this season’s competition, matching the club record of PSG’s former talisman Kylian Mbappe. Arsenal were rocking and it could have got worse. Leandro Trossard was booked for pulling down Achraf Hakimi as he broke clear and Marquinhos headed a Hakimi cross straight at Raya. Kvaratskhelia was a thorn in the side of Arsenal throughout the first half and he was screaming for a penalty when he fell to the ground under a dubious challenge by Jurrien Timber. Raya made further saves from Kvaratskhelia and Desire Doue before Arsenal finally began to clear their heads. Gabriel Martinelli was agonisingly close to connecting with a cross by Bukayo Saka and then was denied by a low save from Donnarumma on the stroke of halftime. Arsenal thought they had equalised straight after the break when Merino headed in Declan Rice’s in-swinging free kick but a lengthy VAR check ruled he had been just offside. Arteta’s side briefly took control and with PSG’s defence creaking, Donnarumma made a stunning low save to turn a Trossard shot behind with his fingertips. PSG might live to regret not leaving with more though as Barcola screwed a shot wide when clean through before Ramos struck an effort against the crossbar.",

    "title": "‘Tearing down’: What drives Trump’s foreign policy?",
    "article_text": "Washington, DC –Donald Trump’s world view can be difficult to pin down. During the first 100 days of his second term, the United States president started a global trade war, targeting allies and foes alike. He also issued decrees to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement on climate and theWorld Health Organization, amongst other international forums. Trump continued to double down on a series of unconventional foreign policy proposals: taking over thePanama Canal, annexingGreenland, making Canada the 51st US state and “owning” Gaza. And despite promising to be a “peace” president, Trump has said he intends to take the US annual Pentagon budget to a record $1 trillion. He has distanced himself from neo-conservative foreign policy and does not position himself as a promoter of human rights or democracy abroad. His “America First” stance and scepticism of NATO align with realist principles, but his impulsiveness and highly personalised diplomacy diverge from traditional realism. At the same time, he has not called for a full military or diplomatic retreat fromglobal affairs, setting him apart from isolationists. So what exactly drives Trump’s foreign policy? Experts say it is primarily fuelled by a dissatisfaction with the current global system, which he sees as unfairly disadvantaging the US with its rules and restrictions. Instead, Trump appears to want Washington to leverage its enormous military and economic power to set the rules to assert global dominance while reducingUS contributionsand commitments to others. “The Trump doctrine is ‘smash and grab’, take what you want from others and let your allies do the same,” said Josh Ruebner, a lecturer at Georgetown University’s Program on Justice and Peace. Mathew Burrows, programme lead of the Strategic Foresight Hub at the Stimson Center think tank, said Trump wants US primacy without paying the costs that come with that. “He’s withdrawing the US from the rest of the world, particularly economically,” Burrows, a veteran of the US Department of State and CIA, told Al Jazeera. “But at the same time, he somehow believes that the US … will be able to tell other countries to stop fighting, to do whatever the US wants,” he said. “Hegemony just doesn’t work that way.” Trump appears to believe that threatening and imposing tariffs – andoccasionally violence– is a way of employing US leverage to get world leaders to acquiesce to his demands. But critics say the US president discounts the power of nationalism in other countries, which prompts them to eventually fight back. Such was the case for Canada. After Trump imposed tariffs and called for Canada to become the 51st state, this led to a wave of nationalist pride in the northern neighbour and an abrupt shift from theConservative Party to the Liberal Party. From Canadato China, foreign governments have accused Trump of “bullying” and blackmail. Some of Trump’s Democratic rivals have rushed to accuse him of abandoning the US global role, but at the same time, the US president has been projecting American strength to pressure other countries. While not entirely isolationist, his approach marks a significant turn from that of his predecessor. The late Secretary of StateMadeleine Albrightfamously said in 1998: “We are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future.” That purported power and wisdom, as Albright envisioned, put the US in a position to implementPax Americana– the concept of a peaceful global order led by Washington. Trump does see the US as proverbially taller than other nations, but perhaps not in the way Albright meant. “America does not need other countries as much as other countries need us,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier this month. Her statement, however, was to stress that other nations must negotiate with the US to avoidTrump’s tariffs. In this context, Trump is seeking revenues and jobs – not an international system governed by liberal values in the way that Washington defines them. However, Burrows said the chief aim of Trump’s foreign policy is to dismantle the existing global order. “A big part of his world view is really his negative feelings towards the current order, where others appear to be rising,” Burrows said. “And so, a lot of this is just tearing down.” Much of the system that manages relations between different countries was put in place after World War II, with the US leading the way. The United Nations and its agencies, the articles of international law, various treaties on the environment, nuclear proliferation and trade, and formal alliances have governed global affairs for decades. Critics of Washington point out that the US violated and opted out of the system where it saw fit. For example, the US never joined the Rome Statute that established theInternational Criminal Courtin 1998. It invaded Iraq in 2003 without United Nations Security Council authorisation in an apparent breach of the UN Charter. And it has been providing unconditional support to Israel despite the US ally’s well-documented abuses against Palestinians. “The United States has done a lot to stand up sort of multilateral institutions – the UN and others – that are based around these ideas,” said Matthew Duss, the executive vice president at the Center for International Policy. “But the United States has always found ways to violate these norms and laws when it when it serves our purposes,” he added, pointing to former US President Joe Biden’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza and President George W Bush’s policies after the 9/11 attacks, which included extraordinary rendition,torture, invasion and prolonged occupation. But for Trump and his administration, there are indications that the global order is not just to be worked around; it needs to go. “The post-war global order is not just obsolete, it is now a weapon being used against us,” Trump’s Secretary of StateMarco Rubiotold senators during his confirmation hearing in January. Trump recently told Time Magazine that the US has been “ripped off” by “almost every country in the world”. His rhetoric on foreign policy appears to echo his statements about promising to look after “America’s forgotten men and women” who have been mistreated by the “elites” domestically. While the modern world order has empowered US companies and left the country with immense wealth and military and diplomatic might, Americans do have major issues to complain about. Globalisation saw the outsourcing of US jobs to countries with less expensive labour. Past interventionist policies – particularly thewars in Iraqand Afghanistan – are largely seen as strategic blunders that produced a generation of veterans with physical and mental injuries. Geoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of political studies at the Niskanen Center, a centre-right think tank in Washington, DC, noted that wages have stagnated for many Americans for decades. “The fact is that the benefits of globalisation were very maldistributed, and some people up at the top made enormous plutocratic sums of money, and very little of that flowed down to the mass of the working class,” Kabaservice told Al Jazeera. For people who saw their factories closed and felt like they were living in “left-behind areas”, electing Trump was “retribution” against the system, Kabaservice said, adding that Trump’s “America First” approach has pitted the US against the rest of the world. “America is turning its back on the world,” Kabaservice said. “Trump believes that America can be self-sufficient in all things, but already the falsity of this doctrine is proving true.” Trita Parsi, executive vice president of the Quincy Institute, a think tank that promotes diplomacy, said Trump’s foreign policy, including his approach to allies, comes from “the politics of grievance”. “He does believe that the United States – because of its role as world policeman, which he’s not necessarily in love with – has been shouldering a lot of the security burden of the world without getting proper compensation,” Parsi told Al Jazeera. The US president has been calling on NATO allies to increase their defence spending, while suggesting that Washington should be paid more for stationing troops in allied countries like Germany andSouth Korea. So how does Trump view the world? “He’s an aggressive unilateralist, and in many ways, he’s just an old-school imperialist,” Duss said of Trump. “He wants to expandAmerican territory. He wants to extract wealth from other parts of the world … This is a kind of foreign policy approach from an earlier era.” He noted that Trump’s foreign policy is to act aggressively and unilaterally to achieve what he sees as US interests. Kabaservice said Trump wants the US to return to an age when it was a manufacturing powerhouse and not too involved in the affairs of the world. “He likes the idea that maybe the United States is a great power, sort of in a 19th-century model, and it lets the other great powers have their own sphere of influence,” he said. Kabaservice added that Trump wants the US to have “its own sphere of influence” and to be “expanding in the way that optimistic forward-moving powers are”. This notion of an America with its own “sphere of influence” appeared to be supported by Rubio when he spoke earlier this year of the inevitability of“multipolar world, multi-great powers in different parts of the planet”. Parsi said that Trump is seeking hemispheric hegemony above all, despite his aversion for regime change – hence his emphasis on acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal. “You’re shifting not from the politics of domination towards restraint; you’re shifting from the politics of global domination to a more limited form of domination,” Parsi told Al Jazeera. “Focus only on your own hemisphere.” The US may have already experienced what happens when these views of nostalgia and grievance see real-world implications. Trump’s erratic trade policy rocked the US stock market and sparked threats of counter-levies from Canada to the European Union to China. Eventually, Trump postponed many of his tariffs, keeping a baseline of 10 percent levies and additional importing fees onChinese goods. Asked why he suspended the measures, the US president acknowledged that it was due to how the tariffs were received. “People were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy,” he said. Ultimately, Trump’s unilateralism and unpredictability have “broken the world’s trust in significant ways” that will outlast his presidency, Kabaservice told Al Jazeera. “In the broad span of history, Trump will be seen as the person who committed terrible unforced errors that led to the end of the American century and the beginning of theChinese century,” he said. During his inauguration speech earlier this year, the US president said his legacy “will be that of a peacemaker and unifier”. “His actual legacy will be that he has torn down the global system that the US created,” said Burrows, of the Stimson Center.",

    "title": "Canada’s Liberals to form minority gov’t after election dominated by Trump",
    "article_text": "Canadian Prime MinisterMark Carney’sLiberal Party will form a minority government after an election race dominated by concerns over United States President Donald Trump’s threats against Canada. With nearly all votes counted late on Tuesday, the Liberals had won 169 seats in the 343-member House of Commons, falling just short of a majority. The main opposition Conservative Party, led by Pierre Poilievre, won 144 seats. The Liberals’ victory gives them a fourth consecutive term, a stunning turnaround for a party that had been trailing the Conservatives by as much as 25 percentage points as recently as January. After two years of poor polling for the Liberals, Trump’s decision toimpose tariffson Canadian goods coupled with the Republican leader’s repeated threats to make Canada the 51st US state helped rally many Canadian voters behind the incumbent government. The resignation of Carney’s predecessor, former Prime MinisterJustin Trudeau, also helped the party regain support after Trudeau faced months of widespread criticism for his government’s handling of a housing crisis and other affordability issues. Reporting from Canada’s capital, Ottawa, on Tuesday, Al Jazeera’s John Hendren said many voters had said they “wanted to make sure that they were picking a leader who could combat Trump, the one major threat facing the country”. “Canadians looked at this election, and they saw an existential crisis – that crisis being the fact that 80 percent of their exports go to the United States, their biggest trading partner, and those tariffs were making it hard to do business,” Hendren said. The top priority now for Carney, a former central banker, will be to address theTrump administration’s tariffs, he added. “And if he can’t do that in short order, his honeymoon might be short-lived,” Hendren said. In a statement on Tuesday afternoon, Carney said he had spoken to Trump and that the US president congratulated him on his victory. “The leaders agreed on the importance of Canada and the United States working together – as independent, sovereign nations – for their mutual betterment. To that end, the leaders agreed to meet in person in the near future,” the statement from Carney’s office read. With a minority government, the Liberals will need the support of an opposition party to pass legislation and survive no-confidence votes in parliament. The left-leaning New Democratic Party (NDP), which had until late last year beenpropping up the Trudeau government, appears poised to play that role. The NDP won seven seats in Monday’s elections – enough to push the Liberals past the 172-seat threshold needed in the House of Commons. During his victory speech after Monday’s vote, Carney urged Canadians to remain united in the face of Trump’s threats. “America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country,” he said. “President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us; that will never … ever happen.” Meanwhile,Poilievrecongratulated Carney on his victory and said his party would “do our job to hold the government to account”. Poilievre, who lost his seat in Ottawa, had been widely expected to be Canada’s next prime minister before Trump’s threats and the Liberal Party leadership shake-up upended the race.",

    "article_text": "At least three people have been killed in a shooting in the Swedish city of Uppsala, police say. In a statement on Tuesday, police said they had received calls from members of the public who heard noises that sounded like gunshots being fired near Vaksala Square in the centre of the city, about 60km (37 miles) north of the capital Stockholm. Emergency services were on the scene and a murder investigation has been launched, police added. Sweden’s public television station SVT said the suspect had fled on a scooter. Swedish Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said his ministry was in close contact with police and was closely monitoring developments in the case. “A brutal act of violence has occurred in central Uppsala … This is at the same time as the whole of Uppsala has begun Walpurgis Night,” Strommer said in a statement, referring to a traditional holiday celebrated on April 30 in northern Europe and Scandinavia. “What has happened is extremely serious,” he added. The circumstances surrounding the shooting remain unclear, and there was no immediate indication of motive. Police also did not provide any details about the alleged perpetrator. Al Jazeera’s Paul Rhys, reporting from Uppsala, said the residential neighbourhood was crowded due to the festivities when between five to eight shots were fired, according to witnesses. The shooting happened at a hair salon, which may indicate a targeted killing, Rhys said. The Nordic country has suffered from a wave of gang-related violence for more than a decade that has included an epidemic of gun violence. A right-wing minority government came to power in 2022 on a promise to tackle gang-related violence. In February, 10 people were killed in the city of Orebro in Sweden’sdeadliest ever mass shooting, which saw a 35-year-old unemployed loner open fire on students and teachers at an adult education centre. Uppsala is the fourth-largest city in Sweden with a population of about 230,000 people.",

    "article_text": "At least 22 people have been killed and three others injured in a fire at a restaurant in China’s northern city of Liaoyang, Chinese authorities said. Authorities did not provide details on what caused the blaze, which broke out shortly after noon local time (04:25 GMT) on Tuesday. But images from the scene showed huge flames spurting from the windows and doors of the multi-storey building in Liaoyang, about 580km (360 miles) northeast of the capital Beijing. “The incident has resulted in 22 deaths and three injuries,” state broadcaster CCTV said. Videos published on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, showed paramedics wheeling one victim on a stretcher into an ambulance and several firefighters battling the flames with hoses. Another video from the social media platform shot from above the scene showed more than a dozen fire engines parked outside the restaurant. Hao Peng, secretary of Liaoning’s provincial ruling party committee, said 22 fire trucks and 85 firefighters were deployed to the scene. Hao said the on-site rescue work had been completed and people had been evacuated. A long list of responding regional politicians – from the governor down – was provided, along with a pledge to get to the bottom of the disaster and severely punish those responsible. China’s President Xi Jinping called for “every effort to treat the injured, properly handle the aftermath for the deceased and provide support to their families, swiftly determine the cause of the fire, and pursue accountability in accordance with the law”, according to CCTV. Industrial accidents occur frequently in China, usually due to staff ignoring safety features due to a lack of training or pressure from their superiors. Poorly maintained infrastructure, illegally stored chemicals and a lack of fire exits and fire retardant, often abetted by corruption, are often factors in such disasters. The country has seen a spate of such deadly incidents in recent months. On April 9, at least 20 people died in a fire at a nursing home in northern China’s Hebei province. In January,a blaze at a vegetable marketin Zhangjiakou city, northwest of Beijing, killed eight people and injured 15. And a month before that, nine people died in a fire at a construction site in China’s eastern city of Rongcheng.",

    "article_text": "A Palestinian paramedic who surviveda deadly Israeli attackon a group of first responders in southern Gaza last month has been released from Israeli detention, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says. Assaad al-Nassasra, an ambulance driver, was among at least 10 Palestinian detainees who were released into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the PRCS said. The agency shared footage on social media that showed a visibly emotional al-Nassasra, dressed in a bright red PRCS jacket, embracing his colleagues after 37 days in Israeli detention. His exact whereabouts had been unknown after the Israeli military opened fire on Palestinian first responders in the Rafah area of southern Gaza on March 23, killing 15 health workers in an attack that drew widespread outrage and calls for an independent investigation. “He had been arrested while performing his humanitarian duty during the massacre of medical teams in the Tel Al-Sultan area of Rafah Governorate,” the PRCS said.

He had been arrested while performing his humanitarian duty during the massacre of medical teams in the Tel…pic.twitter.com/TzGHbZHeJl — PRCS (@PalestineRCS)April 29, 2025 The PRCS reported last month that Israeli forces opened fire on the medics, who were driving in ambulances to assist wounded Palestinians at the site of an earlier Israeli attack. The agency said it lost contact with its team and Israeli forces blocked access to the site of the incident. When United Nations and Palestinian officials were able to reach the area a week later, they found a mass grave where bulldozed ambulances and bodies were buried. Eight PRCS workers were killed along with six Palestinian Civil Defence team members and one UN employee, the PRCS said. “This massacre of our team is a tragedy not only for us at the Palestine Red Crescent Society, but also for humanitarian work and humanity,” the agency said in a statement on March 30. A video recovered from the mobile phone of one of the slain medics showed their final moments.They were wearing highly reflective uniforms and were inside clearly identifiable rescue vehicles before they wereshot by Israeli forces. Amid the international outcry, the Israeli military announced it would investigate what happened. Itsaid last weekthat its probe had identified a series of “professional failures”. The army said its code of ethics was not violated and one soldier was dismissed. The PRCS slammed the Israeli military’s findings and called for an independent and impartial investigation by a UN body. Al-Nassasra, 47, is one of two people who survived the attack. The other survivor, Munther Abed, said at the time that he had seen al-Nassasra being captured, bound and taken away. The father of six last spoke to his family on the night of the Israeli attack when he disappeared, telling them he was on his way to the PRCS headquarters to break his Ramadan fast with his colleagues, according to his son Mohamed. When the family tried to call him about dawn the next day, he didn’t respond, and they found out from the PRCS that nobody could reach him or the other emergency workers. Al-Nassasra had always warned his family that whenever he headed out on a mission, he may not make it back, his son said. But the family tried not to think about that as al-Nassasra continued his work throughout Israel’s 18-month war on Gaza. His colleague Ibrahim Abu al-Kass also told Al Jazeera that al-Nassasra always carried sweets to offer children to encourage them to play somewhere safe, not in the middle of the road. Israel has carried out an intensified campaign of arrests during the war. According to the Palestinian prisoner support network Addameer, at least 9,900 Palestinians are currently being held in Israeli detention facilities, including 400 children. More than 3,400 are held without charge or trial under what’s known as “administrative detention”, which can be renewed for six-month periods indefinitely. Al-Nassasra was released into Gaza through the Kissufim checkpoint along with the 10 other detainees before they were sent to a hospital in central Gaza’s Deir el-Balah for medical checkups. Reporting from the city, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum said the released detainees reported being tortured in “horrific ways” and were in a bad physical and psychological state. Israeli forces have routinely targeted first responders, humanitarian workers and journalists during the Gaza bombardment. More than52,300 Palestinianshave been killed since the war began on October 7, 2023, while at least 117,905 have been wounded, according to Gaza’s Ministry of Health.",

    "article_text": "Amazon may soon show how much tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump will cost consumers who shop on the company’s platform, according to new reporting from the outlet Punchbowl News, citing a person familiar with the plan. In response to the report on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said she had discussed the Amazon plan with the president, and his message about it was: “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon.” The White House also attempted to deflect the blame. “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level of 40 years?” Leavitt asked reporters at a White House briefing. Inflation hit a 40-year highof more than 9.1 percentin mid-2022 under then-US President Joe Biden. Peaking during the COVID-19 pandemic, the high inflation rate steadily declined over Biden’s final two years in office, reaching 3 percent in January 2025. The Seattle, Washington-based e-commerce giant Amazon said that it never considered listing tariffs on its main site, but had considered that for Amazon Haul, its ultra-low-cost platform. “The team that runs our ultra-low-cost Amazon Haul store has considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products,” a company spokesperson told the news agency Reuters. The spokesperson added that the idea “was never approved and not going to happen”. Trump has imposed a swath of tariffson US trading partners – including a 145 percent tariff on China, although there are some exceptions for products including smartphones. There is also a 10 percent blanket tariff on other countries. On Wall Street, Amazon began the day down 2.2 percent in pre-market trading on the heels of the report. As of 11:30am ET (15:30 GMT), the stock was still 0.7 percent below yesterday’s market close.",

    "title": "How much revenue has the US earned from Trump’s tariffs?",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump said this month that his tariffs were bringing in $2bn a day already. The real number turned out to be $192m per day at the time. While the import revenue has increased slightly since then, it is still nowhere close to what the president had suggested. On Friday, April 25, according to the most recent data from the US Department of Commerce, the US brought in $285m in customs and certain excise taxes for the day. Thus far in April, the total has hit more than $16.1bn. The daily income is up from $128m that was brought in on January 17, the last day of the administration of former President Joe Biden for which the US Treasury Department released a daily report. Trump had threatened to impose “retaliatory tariffs”on nearly all trading partners across the globe. He kept the highest at 125 percent for China in addition to an earlier 20 percent rate because of the country’s role in the fentanyl trade, Trump said. On April 9, barring China, he paused the retaliatory tariffs and put in place a 10 percent levy on all imports to the US. He also kept in place tariffs he had announced in March on imports of cars, steel, aluminium and potash, all of which are now feeding into US revenue. On Tuesday, the White House said Trump was aiming to ease some auto tariffs and companies paying car tariffs would no longer be charged other levies, such as on aluminium and steel, with reimbursements in the pipeline for such tariffs that had already been paid. Beijing, in turn, has slapped the US with 125 percent tariffs. Since then, both sides have taken tiny steps back. The US exempted some electronic imports from China from its tariffs, and the latter was considering exemptions of certain imports, according to media reports. All of this is expected to weigh on the US consumer. According to the Budget Lab at Yale, the American public faces the highest average tariff rate in more than a century at 28 percent. Before Trump took office, there were still tariffs in place on a multitude of goods ranging from lumber to electric vehicles. The Biden administration was tough on Chinese goods as well. In 2024, Biden introduced a 100 percent tariff on electric vehicles, 25 percent on steel and aluminium and 50 percent on semiconductor chips. The move, however, was a continuation of a tariff policy laid out during Trump’s first term. Trump had introduced heavy tariffs on steel in 2018 at 25 percent, and 10 percent on aluminium quickly followed. In 2019, Trump lifted those tariffs on Canada and Mexico. In 2021, Biden walked back tariffs outlined by Trump specifically for the European Union as steel prices surged amid supply chain concerns brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2024, Biden also raised lumber tariffs on Canada – which have been a longstanding point of contention between the two nations – to 14.5 percent, up from 8.5 percent the year before. Those tariffs are expected to more than double in the coming months to 34.5 percent. The lumber tariffs were slammed as “detrimental” by the National Association of Home Builders amid a housing affordability crisis in the US. But those challenges began in 2017 when the first Trump administration introduced a 20 percent tariff that was later reduced to 8.5 percent in April 2022. Other notable tariffs introduced by the Biden administration were a result of widespread economic sanctions, including a 35 percent tariff on certain Russian imports in 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Other countries like Canada and the United Kingdom imposed similar tariffs at 35 percent. Trump’s tariffs have much of the world on edge, as well as Wall Street and Main Street. The US Commerce Department released a report this month on consumer spending that showed a 1.4 percent increase over last month. While ordinarily that would indicate an uptick in the economy, this time economists think it can be attributed to consumers spending on key goods before prices go up because of the new tariffs. Other data show consumer confidence tumbling. The University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index, released April 11 for the month of March, dropped 11 percent from the month before. In March, the Conference Board reported that consumer confidence fell to a 12-year low. Companies in the auto industry have already begun furloughs and layoffs. This month, Stellantis laid off 900 people, and General Motors laid off 200 as a result of tariff uncertainty. Volvo announced it would slash 800 US jobs due to the tariffs. The Budget Lab at Yale forecasts that the tariffs could cost 770,000 jobs in the US by the end of the year. There are concerns in every corner of the world. In the citrus industry alone, there could be 35,000 jobs lost in South Africa because of the tariffs. In the Republic of Ireland, one of the world’s largest producers of pharmaceuticals, tariffs could cost as many as 80,000 jobs. And Mexico has expressed concerns that tariffs could result in the loss of upwards of 400,000 of its jobs.",

    "title": "Japan, Philippines pledge to deepen security ties amid China tensions",
    "article_text": "The leaders of Japan and the Philippines have pledged to deepen their security ties, including increased intelligence sharing, as they grapple withterritorial disputeswith China. On his first visit to the Philippines since assuming office in October, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Tuesday that the two countries oppose “attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea by force or coercion”. Speaking after talks with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr in Manila, Ishiba said the two leaders agreed to begin negotiations on a defence pact formallyknown as the Acquisition and Cross-servicing Agreement. The dealwould allow the provision of food, fuel and other necessities when Japanese forces visit the Philippines for joint training under amajor defence accordthat was signed last year and is expected to be ratified by the Japanese legislature. The Philippine Senate ratified it in December. Ishiba said he and Marcos “also confirmed the start of government-to-government talks towards sealing a security of information agreement in the future”. The Philippine president added that Tokyo’s previous security assistance had “allowed our security agencies and especially the Department of National Defence to achieve meaningful upgrades” and praised a “golden age” in their relations. The talks in Manila were held as both Japan and the Philippines have faced increased tensions with China. Chinese-Philippine ties have been tested repeatedly by confrontations involving the two nations’ coastguard vessels in the disputed South China Sea. Japan has its own dispute with China over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea known as the Diaoyu in China and Senkaku in Japan, which are claimed by Beijing but administered by Tokyo. The Philippines and China are also at loggerheads over adisputed sandbank in the South China Sea. On Monday, Beijing accused six Filipinos ofillegally landing on the Tiexian Reef, also known as Sandy Cay, despite “warnings and dissuasion” from the Chinese side. Beijing said the action “violated China’s territorial sovereignty”. Their shared grievances over China’s territorial claims have seen Japan and the Philippines draw increasingly close to each other as well as towards the United States. Late last year, Marcos and former Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited Washington for a trilateral summit with then-US President Joe Biden. Ishiba said he and Marcos had “affirmed the importance of Japan-US-Philippines cooperation” during Tuesday’s meeting. On the economic front, the Japanese premier said the two men had also talked about the impact of US President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz. “We discussed the current measures taken by the United States as well as the impact felt on … the world economy because of the reciprocal retaliation seen between the United States and China,” Ishiba said.",

    "title": "I was forced to burn my books to survive in Gaza",
    "article_text": "When we were children, my siblings and I regularly spent our pocket money on new books. Our mother had instilled in us a passionate love for books. Reading wasn’t just a hobby; it was a way of living. I still remember the day our parents surprised us with a home library. It was a tall and wide piece of furniture with lots of shelves that they had placed in the living room. I was just five years old, but I recognised the sacredness of its corner from the very first moment. My father was determined to fill the shelves with a variety of books—on philosophy, religion, politics, languages, science, literature, etc. He wanted to have a wealth of books that could compete with the local library. My parents would often take us to the bookshop attached to the Samir Mansour Library, one of Gaza’s most iconic bookshops. We would be allowed to pick up to seven books each. Our schools nurtured this love for reading as well, organising visits to book fairs, reading clubs, and discussion panels. Our home library became our friend, our solace in both war and peace, and our lifeline on those dark, haunting nights lit only by bombs. Gathered around fire pits, we would discuss the works of Ghassan Kanafani and recite the poems of Mahmoud Darwish we had memorised from books in our library. When the genocide started in October 2023, the blockade on Gaza was tightened to an unbearable level. Water, fuel, medicines, and nutritious food were cut off. When gas ran out, people started burning whatever they could find: wood from the rubble of homes, tree branches, trash … and then books. Among our relatives, this first happened to my brother’s family. My nephews, heavy-hearted, sacrificed their academic future: they burned their freshly printed schoolbooks—whose ink hadn’t even dried — so their family could prepare a meal. The very books that once fed their minds now fed the flames, all for survival. I was appalled at the book burning, but my 11-year-old nephew Ahmed confronted me with the reality. “Either we starve to death, or we fall into illiteracy. I choose to live. Education will be resumed later,” he said. His answer shook me to the core. When we ran out of gas, I insisted that we buy wood, even though its price was skyrocketing. My father tried to convince me: “Once the war is over, I will buy you all the books you want. But let us use these for now.” I still refused. Those books had borne witness to our ups and downs, our tears and our laughter, our successes and our setbacks. How could we possibly burn them? I started rereading some of our books — once, twice, three times — memorising their covers, their titles, even the exact number of pages, burying in them my fear that our library might be the next sacrifice. In January, after a temporary truce was concluded, cooking gas was finally allowed into Gaza. I breathed a sigh of relief, thinking that my books and I had survived this holocaust. Then in early March, the genocide resumed. All humanitarian aid was blocked: no food, no medical supplies, and no fuel could enter. We ran out of gas in less than three weeks. The full blockade and the massive bombardment made it impossible to find any other source of fuel for cooking. I had no choice but to concede. Standing before our library, I reached for the international human rights law volumes. I decided they had to go first. We were taught these legal norms at school, we were made to believe that our rights as Palestinians were guaranteed by them and that one day, they would lead to our liberation. And yet, these international laws never protected us. We have been abandoned to genocide. Gaza has been teleported to another moral dimension — where there is no international law, no ethics, no value for human life. I tore those pages into bits, recalling how countless families had been torn to pieces by bombs, just like that. I fed the torn pages to the flames, watching them turn to dust — an anguished offering in memory of those who had been burned alive: Shaban al-Louh, who burned alive when Al-Aqsa Hospital was attacked, journalist Ahmed Mansour, who burned alive when a press tent was attacked, and countless others whose names we will never know. Next, we burned all the pharmacology books and summaries belonging to my brother, a pharmacology graduate. We cooked our canned food over the ashes of his years of hard work. Still, it was not enough. The siege grew more suffocating and the fires devoured shelf after shelf of books. My brother insisted on burning his favourite books before touching any of mine. But there was no hiding from the inevitable. We were soon down to my books. I was forced to burn my treasured collections of Mahmoud Darwish’s poetry; the novels of Gibran Khalil Gibran; the poems of Samih al-Qasim, the voice of resistance; the novels of Abdelrahman Munif that I held dear; and the Harry Potter novels that I had spent my teenage reading. Then came my medical books and summaries. While I stood there watching the flames consume them, my heart burned as well. We tried to make the sacrifice feel worthy — cooking a more scrumptious meal: pasta with bechamel sauce. I thought that was the peak of my sacrifice, but my father went further. He dismantled the library’s shelves to burn as wood. I managed to save 15 books. These are history books about the Palestinian cause, the stories of our ancestors, and the books belonging to my grandmother, who was ruthlessly killed during this genocide. Existence is resistance; these books are my proof that my family has always existed here, in Palestine, that we have always been the owners of this land. Genocide has pushed us to do things we never imagined in our darkest nightmares. It forced us to mutilate our memories and break the unbreakable, all for survival. But if we survive — if we survive — we will rebuild. We will have a new home library and fill it again with the books we love.

    "title": "Consumers, businesses less upbeat about US economy despite Trump’s hype",
    "article_text": "Since taking office in January, United States President Donald Trump has been hyping about the performance of the US economy. “In the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country,” Trump (falsely) said on April 17 while meeting withItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. “I think we’re going to do even better this time,” he added, referring to his first term between 2016 and 2020. At a March 24 Cabinet meeting, he said, “We have numbers, and we have job generation, that I don’t think we’ve ever seen before. See how it works out, but I think the economy is going to go through the roof.” Trump hasn’t been in office long enough to accumulate much economic data. The data that’s available, on jobs and inflation, is favourable. Other measurables, though – consumer confidence, business expectations, inflation forecasts andthe stock market– show widespread concern about where the US economy is headed under his policies, especially his sharp tariff increases. And the stock market’s April performance was its worst since 1932, when the US suffered the Great Depression. Since January, the number of jobs has risen by 345,000, in line with the rate of increase over the previous year. The unemployment rate is 4.2 percent, a low level by historical standards, and initial unemployment claims are holding steady. And for one of the key 2024 campaign themes for Trump – inflation – the year-over-year rate has ticked down to nearly normal levels, from 3.0 percent in January to 2.4 percent in March. In a range of long-running surveys, consumers and businesses expressed worry that Trump’s tariffs will raise prices,cause a recession, or both. Economists consider these metrics as barometers of how well the economy will perform in the near and medium term. “All the ‘soft’ data is bad, even though it hasn’t bled through to the hard data yet,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the centre-right American Action Forum. Business owners say they’re already feeling the pinch. David Dennison, director of the Original Pancake House restaurant chain in suburban Washington, DC, said costs have increased by more than 20 percent on food items such as oranges, peppers, avocados and tomatoes. “We also anticipate that equipment failures, parts, and new equipment will experience substantial price increases,” Dennison said. “However, the most concerning aspect is the anticipated difficulty in sourcing parts for our equipment.” Worried consumers and skittish businesses could produce aslowdown in spending, investment, sales and employment growth, meaning bad vibes could become a self-fulfilling prophecy, said Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research. For decades, two surveys have measured consumer confidence, and neither looks good for Trump’s first 100 days. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment survey, which measures consumer optimism about the economy, has dropped every month since December 2024. Its 52.2 mark for April represents a 29 percent decline since December 2024. The April figure was lower than for all but two months of Joe Biden’s presidency, a period that included a 40-year-high inflation rate in mid-2022. The other long-running survey is published by the Conference Board, a business research group. This metric has also fallen every month on Trump’s watch, with a measurement now 15 percent lower than it was in December 2024. This tracks with other polls. For the first time since at least 2001, the pollster Gallup found that more than half of Americans say their financial situation is getting worse. The April figure of 53 percent is higher than it was during the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009, when it maxed out at 49 percent. Small businesses – historically an antitax and antiregulatory constituency that had high hopes for Trump’s agenda – also show declining confidence under Trump. The National Federation of Independent Business survey of small business optimism has dropped every month since December 2024 and decreased more than 7 percent since then. One of the main factors driving down consumer confidence is the expectation that Trump’s tariffs will raise consumer prices. Every month, the University of Michigan survey asks consumers about their inflation expectations for the coming 12 months. Consumer expectations for the inflation rate in the coming year have risen dramatically, from an expectation of 2.8 percent year-over-year inflation in December 2024 to 6.5 percent in April. Businesses feel similarly, according to a monthly Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta analysis. In December 2024, the study found that 32 percent of businesses said they expected “significant” or “very significant” price increases over the next 12 months. By April, that figure had risen to 46 percent. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia survey asked manufacturers whether they are already paying more for recent transactions. The survey found a growing number of businesses that say they are paying more and a declining number saying they’re paying less. The gap has widened from 26.6 percent in December to 51 percent in April. Every quarter, the Atlanta Fed releases GDPNow, a forecast of how much growth is expected in the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP) – the sum of all economic activity within the country – by looking at the upward and downward movement of key economic inputs. GDPNow has turned negative, with a projected annualised GDP shrinkage of about 2.5 percent in the first quarter of 2025, the first projected shrinkage the model has produced since the second quarter of 2022. This aligns with independent estimations of the likelihood of a recession. JP Morgan Research says there’s a 60 percent chance of a recession during the next year; Goldman Sachs puts it at 45 percent; and the International Monetary Fund pegs the likelihood at 37 percent. Stocks have been sliding; the S&P 500, a broad stock market gauge, dropped 18.9 percent between its February 19 peak and its April 8 low, before partly bouncing back in the succeeding two weeks. Compared with the day after Trump’s November 2024 election win, the S&P 500 is now down 4.5 percent. SinceTrump’s January inauguration, it is down 8.7 percent, and from its February 19 peak, it is down by 10.1 percent. A recession is not a certainty after a stock market slide, but there’s a high correlation. Astock market tumblecan cause consumers to hunker down and cut spending. If that happens, companies see sales decrease, leading them to cut their workforces and slow new investments. This makes consumers even warier about spending, perpetuating the cycle. Since 1950, a National Bureau of Economic Research committee has declared 10 official US recessions. Declines in the Standard & Poor’s 500 accompanied seven of those. The last time a recession didn’t produce a notable S&P decline was almost a half-century ago, during the 1980 and 1982 double-dip recessions. Of the seven recessions that accompanied stock market declines, the S&P 500 declines ranged from 18 percent to 55 percent, with the 55 percent drop occurring during the Great Recession of 2008 to 2009. A weekly American Association of Individual Investors survey shows growing pessimism about the stock market’s ability for a short-term rebound. In late November, 39 percent of survey respondents said they were “bearish” – Wall Street jargon for “pessimistic” – about the stock market. By late April, that share had risen to 56 percent. Beyond the numbers, we found several businesses whose leaders said Trump’s tariffs have already caused issues. Dennison, of the Original Pancake House, said in addition to Trump’s tariffs, he’s concerned thatmass deportation effortscould produce ashortageof agricultural workers, further raising ingredient prices. Jax Ward, owner of the Crazy Squirrel Game Store in Fresno, California, said she’s experiencing not only the effect of tariffs but also the “chaotic way it’s been handled”, which “has customers hesitant to spend money”. Ward said she’s heard similar reports from her peers in the Game Manufacturers Association, an industry group. A few publishers of tabletop games she sells have told Ward “they won’t be publishing this year, or they’re laying off employees, and that they’ve left manufactured products inChinabecause it’s now far too expensive to import them.” Everything from games to dice is made overseas, she said. “I’d be hard-pressed to come up with a handful of products that are both resource-sourced and manufactured in the US.” For now, Ward said she is shifting some of her business to used games, including a large Lego section, and in-person events at her store. She’s also trying to pre-stock items before tariffs kick in, but she said not every business can do that because it requires a strong cash flow and sufficient storage space. Ward said she knows a few store owners who are seriously considering closing their businesses. “Boardgame sales used to be considered recession-proof,” Ward said. “We’ll see if they still are.”",

    "article_text": "The accusation attributes ‘Macron-leaks’ to the Kremlin as the EU increases their pressure on Russia to exit Ukraine. The accusation attributes ‘Macron-leaks’ to the Kremlin as the EU increases their pressure on Russia to exit Ukraine. byTina Nguyen In an unprecedented display of diplomatic aggression, French authorities publicly accused Russia of sponsoring several high-profile cyber attacks on French entities for over a decade to gather intelligence and destabilize the country. The incidents include everything from a faked Islamic State takeover of a French television broadcast signal in 2015 to theleak of President Emmanuel Macron’s emails in 2017. On Tuesday, France’s Foreign Ministryformally attributed those cyberattacksand several others to APT28, a Russian military intelligence (GRU) hacking unit also known as Fancy Bear, best known in America forleaking Hillary Clinton’s emailsduring the 2016 U.S. presidential election and sustained cyberattacks on U.S. political operations. APT28’s activities in France followed the same playbook: the “Macron leaks” were published the day before France’s presidential election in the hopes of swaying voters, and the faked ISIS broadcast hijacking, which took place in the wake of the 2015 Bataclan terrorist attacks, were intended to “create a panic in France.” According to the French government,the GRU has escalated its cyberattacks against France and other members of the European Union since 2021, shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine. (Ukraine itself has been a longtimefrequent target of Russian cyberwarfare.) The intrusions targeted entities not just in government, but also in finance, aerospace and defense, sports organizations affiliated with the 2024 Paris Olympics, think tanks, and the media. To display its own cyber defense capacities, Francerevealed the geographical location of one of APT28’s units– a signal that its operators were able to trace the origins of Russian cyber incursions. This is the first time France has publicly attributed a cyber attack to a foreign government’s intelligence service,according toLe Monde. The diplomatic environment has shifted profoundly, however: Vladimir Putin refuses to end his years-long invasion of Ukraine without getting to keep the territory he’s seized – an untenable position for both Ukraine and the EU, which views Russian territorial gains as a threat to the EU’s geopolitical integrity. Russian cyberattacks pose an additional threat, both to their national security apparatus and election integrity.In an interview the day before the Ministry’s public declaration,Macron told the mediathat he believed that France and their Western allies – including President Donald Trump – would increase pressure on Russia “over the next eight to ten days” to accept their terms. He also announced that France and Poland would soon sign a “friendship treaty” that will include joint efforts to combat Russian election interference via cyberattacks and misinformation campaigns in both countries.

The Earnings Assistant feature is in early access, and drivers will need tojoin a waitlistto use it. Once they have access and start planning with the tool, it can offer reminders, and drivers can also ask it for recommendations if they aren’t sure where to go next. In Lyft’s hypothetical example, the driver asks for a plan that stays within a five-hour period in San Francisco and ends at an address in Oakland. It then creates a time-blocked visual that shows where they’re going to be and includes a mention of when the driver can expect a “Turbo” time, when earnings are higher. Lyft says this builds on other recent roll-outs like tweaked Lyft Rewards, and a “Driver Accomplishment Letter” feature, another AI-powered tool that creates a “personalized document” summarizing their work for Lyft, complete with positive feedback from passengers.

    "title": "The EPA says it still cares about forever chemicals, but health advocates are wary",
    "article_text": "The agency won’t say whether it’ll enforce national drinking water standards for the chemicals. The agency won’t say whether it’ll enforce national drinking water standards for the chemicals. byJustine Calma The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has a new plan to address “forever chemicals” once widely used in non-stick and water-proof products that have since beenlinkedto cancer, reproductive health issues, and liver damage. The vague details the EPA has shared so far, however, have health and environmental advocates wondering whether the EPA’s plan helps or delays action to keep the chemicals out of drinking water. The agency says it’ll launch new efforts to study the chemicals and will develop new guidelines to limit pollution from manufacturers. But theannouncementon Monday comes as the EPA under Donald Trump attempts toroll back dozens of other environmental protections. And, notably, the agency hasn’t decided whether it plans to enforce existing limits on the amount of forever chemicals in drinking water. Nor will the agency say whether it plans to defend aBiden-era ruleto classify the two most common forms of PFASas hazardous chemicalsprioritized for cleanup under the federal Superfund law. “It just feels like it offered a lot of words without saying anything,” says Mary Grant, a campaign director at the nonprofit Food & Water Watch. “It reminds me so much of the previous Trump administration, where they had PFAs roadmap after PFAs roadmap without actually taking any steps to really move the needle.” “A lot of words without saying anything.” The chemicals fall under the umbrella of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and earned the “forever” label because of how long they can persist in the environment and accumulate in the human body. They were used for decades in items such asnonstick pans,food packaging,fire-fighting foams,fabric protector,dental floss, andmenstrual products. After facing a slew of lawsuits, some major companies have alreadypledged to stop using PFAS. But the chemicals have already made their way into at least45 percent of the nation’s tap waterand intomost Americans’ blood streams. “I have long been concerned about PFAS and the efforts to help states and communities dealing with legacy contamination in their backyards,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in apress releaseyesterday. “This is just a start of the work we will do on PFAS to ensure Americans have the cleanest air, land, and water.” The EPA said it would develop newwater pollution regulationsfor PFAS manufacturers and metal finishers. Forever chemicals can beused in the electroplating processof applying an anticorrosive “chrome” finish to metal. The EPA also says it’ll “designate an agency lead” on PFAS initiatives, including new efforts to gather information on how to detect and destroy the chemicals. Last year the Biden administrationfinalizedthe nation’s first legally enforceablefederal limitson the most common types of PFAS in drinking water. It was the culmination of years of research and advocacy stretching back to Trump’s first term in office, when advocates and Democratic lawmakersaccused the Trump administration of dragging its feeton the issue. Industry groupsfiled suitover the national drinking water standards, claiming the EPA overstepped its authority in crafting them. Trade groups similarlyfiled suitagainst the Biden administration over the hazardous waste designation for PFAS,arguing the EPA misinterpretedthe Superfund law. The EPA’s announcement yesterday didn’t mention either suit, only saying that it will “address the most significant compliance challenges” related to national drinking water regulations for forever chemicals. When asked byThe Vergewhether it planned to defend those PFAS rules in court, EPA spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said in an email that “New EPA leadership is in the process of reviewing the PFAS drinking water rule, and the issues presented in the litigation in the current case around it, and developing its position on how to proceed.” The agency faces May deadlines to decide whether to defend the drinking water and hazardous waste rules after asking for extensions in both cases.

    "article_text": "The app will instead start testing a ‘refined’ five-tab design that puts the Spotlight tab right next to the camera. The app will instead start testing a ‘refined’ five-tab design that puts the Spotlight tab right next to the camera. byEmma Roth Snap is backing away from plans to simplify the design of Snapchat as it reports losing 1 million users in North America. As part of itsQ1 2025 earnings report on Tuesday, Snap revealed that it’s instead going to start testing a “refined” layout that keeps the app’s five existing tabs. Thecompany first started testingthe “Simple Snapchat” redesign last year, which would’ve removed the Snap Map and private chats tabs from the main navigation bar, leaving users with tabs for Stories, the camera, andits TikTok-like video feed, Spotlight. Snap is now reversing these plans after months of testing, seemingly after seeing reduced usage or user frustration. “Our‬‭ most‬‭ engaged‬‭ Snapchatters‬‭ consistently‬‭ demonstrated‬‭ a‬‭ preference‬‭ for‬‭ a‬‭ five-tab‬‭ layout, favoring‬ the‬‭ familiarity‬‭ of‬‭ tile-based‬‭ content‬‭ discovery‬‭ and‬‭ a‬‭ dedicated‬‭ Map‬‭ tab,” Snap writes in a letter to investors. In 2018, Snap’sstock sunkandusersfled following a redesign aimed at keepingcontent from friends and brandsseparated. The newly revamped five-tab layout “combines the best of both approaches,” the company says, as it will bring more Stories to the messaging experience and make it easier to find Spotlight, which will appear directly to the right of the camera button. Snap doesn’t say how widely the redesign was rolled out or where it was tested. But the company reported losing users in North America in the most recent quarter, falling to 99 million daily active users, down from 100 million users in Q4 2024. Snapchat’s usage in North America has been essentially flat for close to three years. Despite a decrease in North American users, Snap reported a 14 percent year-over-year increase in revenue to $1.36 billion, which it attributes to growth in advertising andits Snapchat Plus subscription. Its global daily active users continue to grow, increasing to 460 million from 453 million last quarter.

The website, spotted by9to5Macreports, presents two slowly moving rows of celebrity images, with no way to manually scroll or search them. In total, we have counted 36 profiles, including Bad Bunny, Dua Lipa, Matt Damon, Serena Williams, Kendrick Lamar, and Drake. The more useful part of the site is when you click into the cards. Each one takes you to a mini-profile of the celebrity and presents you with names and images of content they’re featured in with links out to Apple’s TV, Music, and Podcasts apps. They’re a bit like Apple-specific versions of the Feature.fm or Linktree pages that artists use to direct fans to their latest work. For instance, if youexplore Zendaya, the page says that she’s an American actress and singer, and includes a “more” button that can bring out her full text profile. Under that card you can click to access content Zendaya is in, likeSpider-Man: No Way Home, or her Podcast appearance onThe Late Show Pod Show with Stephen Colbert.

    "title": "100 days of DOGE: Elon Musk's sweeping Trump administration role",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 29, 2025 / 7:51 PM EDT/ CBS News Since President Trumpreturned to office 100 days ago, Elon Musk has amassed vast power — leading theadministration's effortsto shutter government agencies and slash the federal workforce. Musk's ruthless approach to leading the Department of Government Efficiency — epitomized by aspeechin which the Tesla CEO brandished a chainsaw — has drawn lawsuits, pushback from federal workers and criticism from Tesla investors. But he's also held onto broad support from Republican voters and, at least publicly, from Mr. Trump himself. Musk — the world's richest person —endorsedMr. Trump minutes after the then-presidential candidate's July 2024 assassination attempt. Musk had oscillated on backing Mr. Trump: The one-time Obama backersuggestedMr. Trump \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset\" in 2022, and later supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis's 2024 GOP primary bid. The alliance between the two billionaires was defined by campaign cash. Muskspent more than $250 millionsupporting Mr. Trump and other GOP candidates in 2024, much of it through Musk's America PAC. The group helped lead Mr. Trump's get-out-the-vote efforts, and became known for using its massive war chest in unorthodox and often controversial ways. Oneplan to dole out $1 million a dayto swing state voters who signed a petitiondrew a lawsuitfrom Philadelphia's district attorney, who accused Musk's super PAC of running an illegal lottery. Mr. Trumpfloateda Musk-led \"government efficiency commission\" during the later months of the campaign. The scope of Musk's role was initially unclear: In a post-election statement, Mr. Trump framed DOGE as anexternal bodythat would offer \"advice and guidance,\" a far more limited role than the one Musk took on. In an October campaign rally, the billionaire predicted he could find at least $2 trillion in annual savings, which would require him to slash the budget bynearly 30%— a daunting goal considering that almost half of allgovernment spendinggoes toward the military, Medicare and Social Security, three politically difficult-to-cut areas. Earlier this year, Muskciteda still-ambitious $1 trillion as his target. So far, DOGE's statedcost savings haven't come closeto the trillion-dollar mark. Musksaid earlier this month he anticipates$150 billion in savings in the 2026 fiscal year by cutting waste and fraud. Meanwhile, theDOGE websitesays it has saved $160 billion through a combination of cancelling contracts and grants, selling assets and ferreting out fraud. But many of the cost savings touted by DOGE have been called into question. DOGE keeps a running tally of spending cuts on its website, but this \"wall of receipts\" hasincludederrorsandunverified claims, including an $8 million cancelled contract that was erroneously listed at $8 billion, CBS News has previously reported. White House spokesman Harrison Fields defended DOGE's cost-cutting goals and called $1 trillion a year an achievable benchmark. He also said mistakes are rare and \"corrected immediately,\" and the statistics on DOGE's site go through a \"lengthy assessment and analysis.\" The $8 billion mistakedates back to the prior administration, DOGE has argued. \"The goal is to cut as much waste, fraud and abuse from the federal government as possible,\" Fields told CBS News. \"The president is very happy and supportive of the achievements of DOGE, and knows that we are just now getting started.\" Some of Musk's claims about the size of the government's fraud problem are also difficult to prove. He told Fox Business' Larry Kudlow last month the governmentcould save$500 billion to $700 billion by cutting fraud and waste from entitlement programs, but there'slittle evidencethat fraud exists on anywhere near that scale, which would equal 20% to 30% of all annual spending on Social Security and Medicare. TheGovernment Accountability Officeestimates the government loses $233 billion to $521 billion per year due to fraud. When asked about Musk's $700 billion fraud estimates, Fields said \"I don't think it's out of the realm of possibility.\" And DOGE's efforts to slash the federal workforce could end up costing $135 billion due to paid leave and productivity costs, an analysis by thePartnership for Public Service estimates. That estimate was dismissed by the White House. \"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" Fields told CBS News last week. When the Trump administration emailed millions of federal workers in January to offer months of pay in exchange for quitting their jobs, the message's subject line — \"Fork in the Road\" — was identical to the one Musk used to coax staff into leaving Twitter after he bought the site. Since then, Musk has played a central role in efforts tocut up to 10%of the civilian workforce. The White House says75,000 peopletook the \"Fork in the Road\" deferred resignation deal, which offered to pay employees until the end of September if they resigned from their positions by early February. As many as 200,000 workers wereexpected to participate. Tens of thousands of federal employees have also been laid off, including large numbers ofprobationary workerswith less than one or two years of service. The job cuts have hit across the federal government. DOGE staffersvisited the Pentagonin February as the military plans toeliminate tens of thousandsof civilian roles. The Social Security Administration haslost thousands of workers, and the Internal Revenue Servicecould cut its staffby 25% according to the Associated Press. Health agencieshave been hitby the administration's cuts. TheNational Institutes of Healthis expected to face steep budget cuts, a move former NIH Director Francis Collinswarnedcould have dire consequences for public health in an interview with \"60 Minutes.\" The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration haslost 10% of its staff, CBS News reported. Some 1,000 National Park Service workerswere laid off, raising fears aboutunderstaffing. Fields told CBS News the Trump administration's job cuts are designed to avoid any disruption to critical government services, but added: \"To a bureaucracy that has gone untouched for decades, it's going to be disruptive.\" In some cases, laid-off probationary workers have beenrehireddue tonow-pausedcourt orders that halted the job cuts, causing confusion. \"We're supposed to be OK. But one minute we're in a good space, and the next minute we could just lose everything,\" one rehired Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services staff membertold CBS News. Meanwhile, Musk has publicly blasted the federal workforce, claiming DOGE is on a missionto eliminatea \"dictatorship of the bureaucracy\" that's hostile to Mr. Trump's agenda. In February, federal employeesreceived an emailwith the subject line, \"What did you do last week?\" instructing them to reply with a list of five things they'd accomplished. Musk warned on X that any non-responses \"will be taken as a resignation.\" The move set off confusion, with some agenciestelling workers not to respond. Musk latercalled the emailsa \"pulse check\" designed to root out dead or nonexistent people thathe claimsare collecting paychecks. Even if DOGE's cuts could fall short of Musk's goals, its influence has been sweeping. Within days of Mr. Trump's inauguration, DOGE begantoutingcancelled contracts, and its staff became embedded in scores of departments. Musktold Fox Business last monthhis team of over 100 people was in \"pretty much\" every agency. Many of the funding cuts have been abrupt, and Muskhas admittedDOGE has made mistakes in its rapid push to slash spending. In some cases, Musk's team has participated in the near-dismantling of federal agencies. The gambit has often begun with DOGE staffers accessing an agency's offices — in some cases clashing with employees — followed by mass job cuts. The U.S. Agency for International Development, a foreign aid agency that Muskdescribedas a \"criminal organization\" awash with fraud, wasone of his earliest targets. Two USAID security officialswere put on leavefor trying to stop DOGE staffers from accessing internal systems (a Trump administration spokesperson said at the time classified information wasn't accessed without security clearances). The Trump administration later placedmany of USAID's staffon leave,haltedforeign aid programs andbegan absorbing what remained of USAID into the State Department. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also drawn Musk's ire. In early February, DOGE personnelentered the financial regulator's officeand \"camped out in the basement,\" a former agency staffer told CBS News' \"60 Minutes.\" Hours later, Muskposted on X, \"CFPB RIP.\" The administration has tried tolay off 90% of CFPB staffand halt the agency's work, though a federal judge has temporarily blocked those moves. DOGE's efforts at the U.S. Institute of Peace triggered a legal standoff, with several fired board members suing the administration and accusing DOGE personnel of engaging in a \"literal trespass and takeover by force\"at the agency's headquarters. The White Housedefended cuts to the organizationat the time, telling CBS News, \"Taxpayers don't want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-funded 'research institute' that has failed to deliver peace.\" Personnel at DOGEgained accessto the Treasury Department's internal payment system in the first few weeks of Mr. Trump's term, which Muskcast as a wayto catch fraud. The moveprompted concernfrom Democrats due to thesensitive personal datahandled by the system and the possibility that DOGE could try to cut off spending authorized by Congress. The Trump administrationsaid at the timeMusk's team has \"read-only\" access. In mid-February, a staffer linked to DOGE alsosought accessto the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer data system, drawing criticism from Democratic lawmakers. Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller said the administration is planning a \"basic anti-fraud review to ensure that people are not engaging in large scale theft of federal taxpayer benefits.\" Musk has scrutinized the Social Security Administration, which heclaimsis rife with fraud, suggesting tens of millions of dead people are receiving payments and immigrants areabusing the system en masse, though he's never offered anyevidencefor either of these assertions. He's described Social Security as a \"Ponzi scheme,\" though both Musk and Mr. Trump have said they would not cut benefits. At one point earlier this year, the SSAconsidered requiring Social Security recipientsto verify their identities in person instead of over the phone, but the agency reversed course after seniors and their advocates objected. Musk's rise to power has drawn outrage from Democrats, whoargue DOGEhas unilaterally slashed spending appropriated by Congress. Most Republican lawmakersdefended DOGE, though some have raised concerns about sweeping cuts to public health agencies and programs important to their districts. Public opinion on Musk is similarly divided. Some 52% of Americans said in late February Musk and DOGE had too much influence over federal worker firing decisions, including 81% of Democrats and 57% of independents but just 21% of Republicans, according to aCBS Newspoll with a margin of error of 2.5 points. Musk has occasionally clashed with other Trump loyalists. His pick for interim IRS leader — Hunter Biden whistleblower Gary Shapley — left the role after just 48 hours, after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentprivately complained to Mr. Trump. And Musk publicly feuded with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro over tariffs,calling him\"dumber than a sack of bricks.\" DOGE's aggressive moves have also drawn lawsuits arguing the agency hasexceeded its authority. At various points, judges have halted DOGE's efforts to lay off workers and access the Treasury payment system, though in many cases, those rulings were stayed. Somelegalchallenges have zeroed in on Musk's official status in the administration. The White House says Musk is a \"special government employee,\" which allows him to serve forup to 130 daysin a single yearlong period. The administration hasargued in court papersthat Musk isn't officially DOGE's administrator and \"has no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\" Musk's business empire benefits heavily from federal programs. Tesla sells billions of dollars a year in credits to automakers thatfall short of federal emission rules, and its cars are subsidized by tax incentives for electric vehicles — though Mr. Trump hascalled for a rollbackof electric car subsidies. Mr. Trump has also offered his public endorsement, promising to buy a Tesla in aWhite House event. Musk's aerospace company SpaceX has valuable contracts with NASA, and its satellite internet division Starlink could take over a contract to modernize the air traffic control system, theAssociated Press reports. Musk haspushed backon conflict-of-interest concerns, saying in an Oval Office appearance with Mr. Trump, \"all of our actions are maximally transparent.\" But DOGE has caused agita for Tesla investors,some of whom fearMusk is too distracted to run the company or his polarizing image could hurt the carmaker's brand. The company's sales and profits havefallen over the past year, and its share price is down nearly 25% from early January, prompting some investors tourge him to step backfrom the Trump administration. Musk said on a Tesla earnings call last week his \"time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly\" in May. But he added that he'll remain involved for the rest of Mr. Trump's term. There's no indication DOGE or Musk's work at the White House will end next month. \"Elon Musk will still be a common face here,\" Fields said.

    "title": "Dozens of states sue over Trump administration's cuts to AmeriCorps",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 29, 2025 / 7:43 PM EDT/ CBS Sacramento Two dozen states filed a lawsuit Tuesday over dramatic cuts to AmeriCorps, alleging the Trump administration is trying to \"dismantle\" the volunteer service organization as part of itssweeping federal cost-cutting campaign. AmeriCorps has put 85% of its staff on administrative leave ahead of planned job cuts, the lawsuit says. The agency has also allegedly slashed its National Civilian Community Corps, whichsends volunteersto work on conservation, natural disaster response and other projects, and cut hundreds of millions in grants, covering 41% of the agency's budget. The lawsuit argues the cuts — which it links to President Trump's federal cost-cutting push, led by the Department of Government Efficiency — violate federal law and constitutional separation of powers, since Congress created and funded AmeriCorps. \"If the Defendants' actions are permitted to stand despite their statutory and constitutional defects, then the gutting of AmeriCorps will inflict immediate and irreparable harms on the Plaintiff States, their residents, and the public at large,\" reads the lawsuit, which wasfiled in Maryland federal courtand led by California, Colorado, Delaware and Maryland. White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement: \"Americorps has failed eight consecutive audits and identified over $45 million in improper payments in 2024 alone. President Trump has the legal right to restore accountability to the entire Executive Branch.\" AmeriCorps' inspector generalsaid in Novemberthe agency \"has been unable to produce auditable financial statements for the last eight years,\" and recommended changes to the agency's financial practices. Founded in 1993, AmeriCorps overseesaround 200,000members, most of whomreceive living stipends, and employs hundreds of people. It funds both directly operated programs, like the National Civilian Community Corps and grant-funded programs overseen by states. The AmeriCorps grants targeted to be eliminated by the Trump administration amount to nearly $400 million, hitting volunteer programs in all 50 states, according to the nonprofitAmerica's Service Commissions. In a statement, America's Service Commissions said the cuts came late Friday with no advanced notice. \"Thousands of people who have steadfastly dedicated their lives to serving their country through AmeriCorps are finding their livelihoods suddenly thrown into jeopardy, and hundreds of communities are losing critical services they rely on,\" ASC CEO Kaira Esgatesaid. After the drastic cuts to grants were announced last week,every California service-based programwith AmeriCorps was told to stop working. \"These actions by President Trump and Elon Musk not only threaten our funding – they vandalize our values. We're going to fight to stop them,\" California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement about the AmeriCorps cuts. California's AmeriCorps volunteers amassed a total of 4,397,674 of service hours during the 2023-24 year, according to the governor's office. Newsom noted that California has already been recruiting for its own California Service Corps program, a pool of volunteers that he says is now larger than the Peace Corps. \"Service sits at the very core of who we are as Americans. California is suing the Trump administration to defend thousands of hardworking service members and the communities they serve,\" Newsom said.

    "title": "Trump marks first 100 days in office with Detroit-area speech",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 29, 2025 / 7:39 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump marked the first 100 days in office of his second term with a Tuesday eveningrallyoutside Detroit — spending much of his 90-minute speech touting his administration's record on immigration and lashing out against judges, Biden-era officials and other foes. \"We're here tonight in the heartland of our nation to celebrate the most successful first 100 days of any administration in the history of our country, and that's according to many, many people,\" Mr. Trump said to kick off his speech at Macomb Community College in Warren, Michigan. \"This is the best, they say, 100-day start of any president in history, and everyone is saying it. We've just gotten started. You haven't even seen anything yet.\" The president chose to give his speech in the heart of the auto industry, as he hopes the tariffs he's imposing on imports from other countries will bring auto companies and other manufacturers back to the U.S., despite economists' warnings that the president's policies will increase prices. On Tuesday, the presidentsigned executive ordersto provide some relief from the 25% tariffs he's imposing on imported foreign cars and parts. As the president'sapproval numbers have slippedsince his inauguration, Mr. Trump particularly homed in on his administration's border enforcement policies. Immigration continues to be one of the president's strongest issues in polling. \"There's never been such a difference in anything as the difference between the border today and the border what it was just six months ago, so I want to say congratulations, America, it's about time,\" he said. As the Trump administration faces a slew of lawsuits over its mass deportations and other immigration policies, the president said, \"the courts are giving us a hard time.\" Mr. Trump said his administration has significantly increased arrests of \"known and suspected terrorists,\" appearing to reference suspected gang members. \"We tried to get it higher, we tried to get it higher, but the courts are giving us a hard time, can you believe?\" Mr. Trump said. \"You know, I won on the basis of, I think, the number one thing was on illegal immigration, the border. … I think that was the number one thing, and now the courts are trying to say that you know, that doesn't matter. I don't think it's going to be allowed to stand.\" \"I hope for the sake of our country that the Supreme Court is going to save this,\" Mr. Trump said later. As nations scramble to reach deals with the White House over the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed, the president boasted that leaders from around the world are traveling to meet with him. \"Now, we're respected all over the world,\" he said. \"They're coming from all over the world to see your president. They're coming from India, they're coming from France, they're coming from Spain. Yeah, they're coming from China, too, yeah, they're coming from China. They're coming from all over to see your president. They want to make a deal. They want to make a deal. And you know, we'll make deals, but we don't have to.\" Mr. Trump also toutedslower inflation, but criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, saying he's \"not really doing a good job.\" The Fed has drawn Mr. Trump's ire for declining to speed up interest rate cuts so far this year, which could boost economic growth at the cost of higher inflation. Powell has also warned Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs could push up consumer prices and harm the economy. The president also touted his administration's work to slash government, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. He also mentioned his administration's instruction to federal employees to return to the office, saying some federal workers improved their golf handicap while working remotely. \"They weren't working at home. Who the hell would work at home? How do you work at home?\" he said. The president called multiple aides on stage, including special assistant to the president Margo Martin. \"Trump 2028, anybody?\" she said, to cheers from the crowd. Mr. Trump has periodically floated seeking a third term — andhis online store sells\"Trump 2028\" merchandise — though the Constitution only allows presidents to be elected to two terms. Mr. Trump also touted his administration's work on hot-button social issues. \"I ended all of the lawless so-called diversity, equity and inclusion bulls***, all across the federal government and the private sector,\" the president claimed. \"And I made it the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female. And the really easy one, this was the easiest one I had, I banned men from competing in women's sports.\" The president doesn't have the authority to do all those things in the private sector and at the local level, but the administration has sought to influence those spheres. As Republicans struggle to figure out how to pay for the president's tax cuts,making cutsto Medicaid has been a possible pay-for. But the president insisted he'll protect Medicaid. \"We will always protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors, with no cuts, and we will defend Medicaid for those great people that are in need,\" Mr. Trump said as he neared the end of his speech. \"House Republicans are working to invest more money in Medicaid than we spend today. The only thing we're going to cut is the corruption and the crooks that take advantage of some of the illegal schemes. So we want to preserve Medicaid for the most vulnerable, for our kids, pregnant women, the poor and disabled Americans.\" In his Michigan speech, Mr. Trump hit many of the highlights of hissecond term so far, including mass deportation operations, efforts to shrink the size and scope of government and the changes he's making to the global trade landscape. Those endeavors have not gone unopposed, prompting scores of lawsuits filed by ousted government employees, migrants fighting their deportation and business owners who argue the president's tariffs areunlawful. \"[I]nflation has cooled, consumer prices dropped month-over-month for the first time in three years, and gas prices are lower across the country,\" the White House said in announcing the speech, and it went on to praise the Department of Government Efficiency for rooting out \"waste, fraud, and abuse across the executive branch\" and canceling \"numerous discriminatory DEI contracts.\" DOGE's work continues apace, with billionaire Elon Musk unofficially guiding efforts to downsize government. So far, however,DOGE's cutsaren't anywhere close to approaching the $2 trillion Musk initially said he'd slash from annual spending. Those efforts have also landed the federal government in multiple courtrooms over the firings, downsizing and elimination of government-funded programs. The Trump administration claims it hasdone moreto secure the border in the president's first 100 days in office than any other president in history. Illegal border crossingshave reachedlows not seen in decades, and the administration has been working to deport migrants accused or convicted of violent crimes and drug-related offenses. But Mr. Trump's decision to invokewartime authoritiesto send migrants to anEl Salvador prisonwithout due process has resulted in lawsuits, as has the president's efforts to endbirthright citizenship. The 100-day mark comes as the Trump administration is hashing out trade negotiations with countries across the world after Mr. Trump levied nearly worldwide tariffs on foreign imports, tariffs that most economists say will make goods more expensive and worsen economic prospects. Mr. Trumpclaimedin an interview with TIME that he's reached 200 trade deals with other countries since April 2, but declined to name any of the countries. Americansare skepticalof the president's tariff approach, CBS News polling shows, and most worry they'll contribute to higher prices at a time when high prices are a top concern for voters. It's unclear how much the president will focus on foreign policy matters, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt argued the administration has made significant progress on the foreign policy front. After repeatedly saying he would end the war in Ukraine before even taking office, Mr. Trump is now saying those comments were made in \"jest.\" \"We are closer today to a peace deal in Russia and Ukraine, certainly, than we were when we took office on Jan. 20,\" Leavitt told reporters Monday. \"If you look at the situation in the Middle East, Israel has never had a stronger friend than they do right now in the Oval Office with President Trump. We've had more than 75 hostages who have returned home from around the world who were wrongfully detained individuals.\" Kathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 29, 2025 / 7:04 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Tuesday he's ending a program at the Defense Department that promoted the participation of women in peace building and was signed into law by President Trump in 2017. In hisinitial poston X, Hegseth called the Women, Peace and Security program \"yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops.\" In afollow-up post, he clarified that the program had been \"ruined\" by the Biden administration. Hegseth said the Defense Department would comply with the minimum requirements under the law, but would \"fight to end\" the program when Congress sets its next budget. Trump administration officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and national security adviser Mike Waltz, supported the efforts when they were in Congress. It was also championed by Mr. Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, who served in the White House during his first term. Earlier this month, Rubio touted the bill, saying inremarksat the State Department that he was proud to support it. He referred to it as \"the first law passed by any country anywhere in the world focused on protecting women and promoting their participation in society.\" The program, according to the strategy released during Mr. Trump's first term, seeks to increase women's participation in decision-making processes as well as promote the protection of women and girls' human rights around the world. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who introduced the legislation for the program, said the defense secretary is \"short sighted and doesn't really understand what he's doing\" when asked by CBS News about Hegseth's post on X. \"We have data that shows what a difference it makes to have women at the table in negotiations,\" Shaheen said. \"We know that peace agreements that are made with women at the table last 35% longer, longer than 15 years if women are at the table.\" On \"Face the Nation\" Sunday, Shaheen was critical ofHegseth, who she said has \"created chaos\" at the Pentagon amid a recent staff shakeup. \"For those people who serve under him, he has shown that he is not the kind of role model, not the kind of leader that we need at this time,\" Shaheen said. One of Hegseth's goals at the Pentagon has been to rid the Defense Department of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives. Kathleen McInnis of the Center for Strategic and International Studieshas writtenthat the Women, Peace, and Security program is not DEI because it establishes no requirements, quotas, or goals for the organizational composition, academic admission or career fields in the DOD. When asked during his confirmation hearing about the program, Hegseth did not promise to continue it but said he would \"commit to reviewing that program and ensuring it aligns with America First national security priorities, meritocracy, lethality, and readiness.\" Laura  Garrisoncontributed to this report.

    "title": "GOP lawmakers want to revamp student loans. Here's what to know.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 29, 2025 / 5:59 PM EDT/ CBS News Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a proposal to overhaul the nation's student loan system, including eliminating a popular repayment plan that had helped millions save money on their debt payments. The proposal, which wasreleasedby the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, would save more than $330 billion, according to a statement by Committee Chairman Tim Walberg, a Republican from Michigan. The plan comes as Republicans move to slash federal spending in order to pass legislation that would extend President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, as well as add measures such abolishing taxes on tips. The student loan proposal also takes aim at a major  repayment program that sparked alawsuit from Republican stateslast year over allegations the plan would result in lost revenue. The new GOP proposal is aimed at \"addressing the root causes of skyrocketing college costs,\" Walberg said in a statement. The Republican plan could result in higher costs for people with college debt, with a typical borrower with a bachelors degree paying almost $3,000 more per year versus other government repayment plans, according to the Student Borrower Protection Center, an advocacy group for people with student debt. The Republican proposal, which is in its early stages, may face changes as it progresses through the legislative process. Here's what to know. For Americans with student debt, the Republican proposal would eliminate existing income-contingent repayment arrangements, including theSaving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, which was created in 2023 by the Biden administration. These plans typically link a person's monthly loan payment to their income, with the goal of ensuring that borrowers aren't burdened with excessive loan costs. SAVE proved popular with student borrowers, with more than 8 million enrollees by the time it waspaused last year by the courts. The program was heralded by President Biden at the time as \"the most affordable student loan plan ever.\" Under the Republican proposal, the four existingincome-based planswould be replaced with one program called the \"repayment assistance plan.\" This would calculate monthly payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% of that amount. Borrowers would need to repay their loans for a maximum of 30 years, the proposal states. Under the SAVE plan, a borrower's student loan could be wiped out after 10 years. \"Based on our review of this proposal, contrasted with the benefits and protections available to borrowers under the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan, we found that a typical borrower will see monthly student loan costs spike by hundreds of dollars per month, or thousands of dollars per year,\" Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center, said in anApril 28 letterto Republican lawmakers. The GOP plan would offer another option for repaying student loans called the \"standard repayment plan.\" That would allow borrowers to repay their loans with a fixed monthly payment, with terms that extend from 10 to 25 years, based on the amount borrowed. For instance, people with less than $25,000 in debt could repay their loans over 10 years, while those with $25,000 to $50,000 in loans would have 15 years of repayments, according to the proposedbill. Under the Republican plan, the Pell grant program — geared to low- and middle-income students — would face new limits. For instance, the proposal would change the definition of a full-time student to someone with at least 15 credit hours per semester, up from the current 12 credit hours. It would also bar students who are attending half-time from receiving Pell grants. The plan would also make it tougher for families that own assets, yet have low incomes, to qualify for Pell grants. The Republican plan would scrap Grad PLUS loans, which are for graduate and professional students, as well as subsidized loans for undergraduate students, where students don't have to pay interest on the loans while in school. The plan would also require undergrad students to take out their maximum loan amount — $50,000 under the proposal, up from $31,000 currently — before their parents could take out a Parent PLUS loan to cover the rest of their cost of attending college. The Parent PLUS loans would be capped at $50,000, versus the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid the student receives.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 29, 2025 / 2:54 PM EDT/ CBS News Big Lots is planning to reopen 132 more stores in May as the bankrupt discount retailer works to rebuild its brand under new ownership.

    "title": "How Trump policies and Project 2025 match up after first 100 days",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 29, 2025 / 10:09 AM EDT/ CBS News Washington —President Trump repeatedly distanced himself fromProject 2025on the campaign trail, saying he had \"nothing to do with\" the initiative spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation, had not read it and didn't have any plans to. But as the president marks100 daysin the White House, many of theplans he has rolled outsince the start of his second term closely align with those in the pages of Project 2025's sprawling, 900-page policy blueprint, which lays out an overhaul of the executive branch. Overseen by the Heritage Foundation, Project 2025 was an initiative that was designed to provide a roadmap for the next Republican president, now Mr. Trump. On the campaign trail, the president called some of its proposals \"abysmal\" and said he knew nothing about it, though CBS News' analysis showedmany of its proposalswere similar to his own. The authors of some of the policy guide's chapters served in his first administration and have returned for the second. Russ Vought is leading the Office of Management and Budget, and John Ratcliffe is in place asCIA director, while Peter Navarro, who was a top trade adviser to Mr. Trump in his first administration, returned for a second stint in the White House. Some of Mr. Trump's actions taken in his first days in office reinstate measures he put in place during his first term that were revoked by President Biden. But in other instances, Mr. Trump has taken newexecutive actionsthatecho policies outlinedin Project 2025's policy book. Republicans have long called for the Department of Education to be dismantled, and that recommendation was also made in Project 2025, which declared that \"federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Department of Education should be eliminated.\" Mr. Trump took steps tobegin that processwith an executive order he signed in March. The administration has alreadycut the Education Department's staffand is making plans to move some of its functions to other agencies. Shuttering the Department of Education, however, would require an act of Congress. The president frequently rails against diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, practices, and hesigned an executive orderon the day he returned to the White House ending all DEI programs within the federal government. Mr. Trump claimed in his order that DEI policies can violate federal civil rights laws and shut out Americans \"who deserve a shot at the American dream\" because of their race or sex. Project 2025 likewise calls for the \"DEI apparatus\" at a variety of agencies to be dismantled. Project 2025's policy book also calls for deleting a variety of terms, including DEI, abortion and gender equality \"from every federal rule, agency regulation, contract, grant, regulation, and piece of legislation that exists.\" Some of the Trump administration's early efforts topurge mentionsof gender or raceresulted in misstepsthatprompted a public outcryand werelater reversed. Shortly after the start of his second term, Mr. Trump established a review council to advise him on the ability of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, \"to capably and impartially address disasters occurring within the United States.\" The council will also advise the president on recommended changes related to FEMA, his order states. Mr. Trump's directive came after he suggested that he could \"get rid\" of FEMA and leave disaster response management to the states. \"That's what states are for, to take care of problems,\" hesaid in late January. Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that declares it is the policy of the U.S. that \"state and local governments and individuals play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness,\" and says that his administration will \"enable state and local governments to better understand, plan for and ultimately address the needs of their citizens.\" The overhaul at FEMA hassparked concernsabout the agency's capabilities to deliver disaster assistance ahead of hurricane season. FEMA has already denied requests for federal aid in response to severe storms and tornadoesin Arkansas, flooding in parts ofWest Virginiaand stormsin Washington. Project 2025's sweeping book of policy proposals calls for \"reforming FEMA emergency spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and localities instead of the federal government.\" It also urges Congress to change the cost-sharing arrangement so the federal government covers 25% of the costs for small disasters and up to 75% for \"truly catastrophic disasters.\" Currently, for Public Assistance, which provides financial and direct assistance to state and local governments for disaster response and recovery work, FEMA covers a minimum of 75% of costs, and the president can increase the federal cost-share at his discretion, according to a2023 reportfrom the Congressional Research Service. The recommendation follows a warning from Project 2025's authors that FEMA is \"overtasked, overcompensates for the lack of state and local preparedness and response, and is regularly in deep debt.\" Project 2025's book also calls on Congress to end preparedness grants for states and localities. \"DHS should not be in the business of handing out federal tax dollars: These grants should be terminated,\" it states. Brendan Carr, head of the Federal Communications Commission, informed the heads of National Public Radio and PBS in a letter earlier this year that the agency had opened an investigation into the airing of their programming across their roughly 1,500 broadcast member stations, according to The New York Times. Those stations are licensed by the FCC to operate, but are limited to operating as noncommercial educational broadcast stations. These stations, or NCEs, are exempt from licensing fees and operate on a specific \"reserved\" frequency band. Federal law prohibits these noncommercial educational broadcast stations from airing commercial advertisements. In his letter, Carr wrote that he is \"concerned that NPR and PBS broadcasts could be violating federal law by airing commercials. In particular, it is possible that NPR and PBS member stations are broadcasting underwriting announcements that cross the line into prohibited commercial advertisements.\" Carr also said that he also does not see a reason for Congress to continue approving federal dollars for NPR and PBS \"given the changes in the media marketplace.\" PBS CEO Paula Kergersaid the cuts\"would devastate PBS member stations and the essential role they play in communities, particularly smaller and rural stations.\" Carr authored the section of Project 2025's policy book that deals with the FCC, but another portion of the blueprint urges Congress to defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides grants to NPR and PBS. According to Project 2025, \"stripping public funding would, of course, mean that NPR, PBS, Pacifica Radio, and the other leftist broadcasters would be shorn of the presumption that they act in the public interest and receive the privileges that often accompany so acting.\" The outlets should therefore no longer be qualified as noncommercial educational broadcast stations, according to the book. One of Mr. Trump's first actions as president was to establish the White House'sDepartment of Government Efficiency—DOGE— run by Elon Musk, to slash regulations andspending, and restructure federal agencies. On the heels of that move, the Office of Management and Budget, or OMB, issued a two-page memo in January that ordered a freeze on grant, loan or federal assistance programs covered by Mr. Trump's executive orders, which would allow his administration \"time to review agency programs and determine the best uses of the funding for those programs consistent with the law and the president's priorities.\" The memo sparked widespread confusion and prompted concerns about whether programs providing meals for the elderly, pre-school funding for low-income children, medical research and other priorities approved by Congress would be impacted by the order. The White Housethen rescinded the memobut maintained the funding pause \"to end any confusion\" created by a federal court order temporarily pausing implementation of the freeze. Federal courts have since ordered the administration to reinstate any money that was frozen subject to the memo. Vought, the head of OMB, authored the section of Project 2025's policy book covering the Executive Office of the President, which includes the agency he has been tapped to lead. In it, he likens the budget office to an air-traffic control system for the president \"with the ability and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.\" The memo may have been aimed at sparking a legal challenge to the Impoundment Control Act, a 1974 law that limits the president's ability to unilaterally freeze certain funds appropriated by Congress, and in most cases requires the president instead to ask Congress to rescind spending legislation. In Project 2025's policy blueprint, Vought also wrote the director of OMB must have \"sufficient visibility into the deep caverns of agency decision-making,\" and can achieve this by ensuring political appointees on his staff sign off on apportionments of funding authorized by Congress. Vought cited a 1870 law known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending federal dollars in advance and requires funding be doled out in installments. \"This process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars,\" he wrote. \"OMB can then direct on behalf of a president the amount, duration, and purpose of any apportioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency with the president's agenda and applicable laws.\" Mr. Trump issued anexecutive orderin January that seeks to bar the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care — puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical procedures — for people under the age of 19. Called \"Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation,\" the orderdirects certain executive agenciesto take steps to ensure medical institutions that receive federal grants \"end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children.\" It also instructs the secretary of defense to take regulatory action to exclude gender-affirming care for minors from insurance coverage provided by TRICARE, the Defense Department's health care program, and federal employee health benefit programs. Mr. Trump's order directs the head of the Department of Health and Human Services to withdraw March 2022 guidance on gender-affirming care. Project 2025's chapter on the Department of Health and Human Services calls for its Office of Civil Rights to \"remove all guidance issued under the Biden administration concerning sexual orientation and gender identity,\" including the March 2022 document. The book generally criticizes gender-affirming care as causing \"irreversible physical and mental harm to those who receive them\" and argues there is a lack of evidence surrounding it. Many families anddoctors who care for transgender youthdispute that assessment, and a group offamilies filed a lawsuitclaiming the order is discriminatory. Two different federal district courts have blocked the president's directive, and those injunctions are being appealed. Mr. Trump took executive action to start the process ofrevoking the security clearancesof dozens of former intelligence officials who signed aletterin 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign. He also announced he would revoke the security clearances of a number of prominent Democrats includingformer President Joe Biden, former Vice PresidentKamala Harris and Hillary Clinton. Project 2025 also proposed stripping former intelligence officials of security clearances, under a more narrow set of circumstances, in a section on the intelligence community authored by Dustin Carmack, who worked at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence during Mr. Trump's first term. \"The president should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former directors, deputy directors, or other senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior clearance from the current director,\" he wrote. Among the slew of actions Mr. Trump took on his first day back in the White House was toreinstate an executive orderissued during his first term that created \"Schedule F in the Excepted Service.\" The order creates a new employment category for many career civil servants, effectively stripping them of employment protections. The order states that in recent years, \"there have been numerous and well-documented cases of career federal employees resisting and undermining the policies and directives of their executive leadership.\" \"Principles of good administration, therefore, necessitate action to restore accountability to the career civil service, beginning with positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character,\" Mr. Trump's order reads. The order makes some minor changes to the president's prior measure from October 2020. But it notably adds a section that states that while employees in these new \"Schedule Policy/Career Positions,\" are not required to personally or politically support the current president or his policies, they are \"required to faithfully implement administration policies to the best of their ability, consistent with their constitutional oath and the vesting of executive authority solely in the president.\" Failure to do so is grounds for termination of employment, Mr. Trump's executive order states. Critics say the change would enable the administration to fire government employees for no cause and replace them with Trump loyalists. Project 2025 repeatedly calls for Mr. Trump's Schedule F proposal to be reinstated. The president directed the secretaries of Defense or Homeland Security toreinstate service members, both active-duty and reserve, who were discharged after refusing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. (The vaccine requirement was lifted in 2023.) His order also states they should be reverted to their former rank and receive full back pay, benefits, bonus payments or compensation. The Project 2025 blueprint's section on the Defense Department, authored by Chris Miller, calls for the next administration to \"reinstate servicemembers to active duty who were discharged for not receiving the COVID vaccine, restore their appropriate rank, and provide back pay.\" Miller served as acting defense secretary in the final weeks of Mr. Trump's first term. His chief of staff, Kash Patel, is now serving as director of the FBI. During his first four years in the White House, Mr. Trumpprohibited transgender peoplefrom serving in the military. President Biden repealed that ban, but Mr. Trump has issued an order that effectively bars transgender people fromserving in the armed forcesand withdraws his predecessor's order. Mr. Trump's executive order states that \"expressing a false 'gender identity' divergent from an individual's sex cannot satisfy the rigorous standards necessary for military service.\" Identifying as transgender, it continues, \"conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life.\" \"It is the policy of the United States Government to establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity. This policy is inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria,\" the president's order states. \"This policy is also inconsistent with shifting pronoun usage or use of pronouns that inaccurately reflect an individual's sex.\" Project 2025 calls for a reversal of policies \"that allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Gender dysphoria is incompatible with the demands of military service.\" SPARTA Pride, a nonprofit group comprising thousands of transgender service members, veterans and their supporters, disputed such claims, saying: \"Transgender Americans have served openly and honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces for nearly a decade. Thousands of transgender troops are currently serving, and are fully qualified for the positions in which they serve.\" The transgender military ban has since been blocked by two different federal courts, though the decisions have been appealed. The Trump administration hasasked the Supreme Courtto intervene in one of those cases and is seeking to begin enforcing the ban. There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department. AJanuary reportfrom the Congressional Research Service found that roughly 1,892 active-duty service members received gender-affirming care from the Pentagon between January 2016 and May 2021. AFeb. 26 memofrom the Pentagon found that between 2015 and 2024, it spent $52 million on care for active-duty members of the military to treat gender dysphoria. On his first day in the White House, Mr. Trump issued a memorandum freezing hiring of federal civilian employees, which he extended to July 15. Positions that were vacant as of his inauguration at noon on Jan. 20 should also not be filled, he said. The order was part of his plans to reduce the size of the federal workforce, also a recommendation made in the Project 2025 policy roadmap. The book, though, warns that while \"reducing the number of federal employees seems an obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service,\" prior attempts to do so by presidents of both parties \"did not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense federal employees.\" Instead, Project 2025 suggests a \"freeze on all top career-position hiring to prevent 'burrowing-in' by outgoing political appointees.\" Mr. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization in 2020 due to what his first administration said was a mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Biden reversed that decision when he took office, and Mr. Trump rolled back that move on his first day back in the White House. Hislatest orderdirected the secretary of state to inform the secretary-general of the United States and World Health Organization leadership of the U.S. decision to withdraw from the group. Health officials in the U.S. and around the world have warned the move willleave people at greater riskof dangerous outbreaks and give China a more dominant role at the World Health Organization. Project 2025, too, criticized the World Health Organization for its handling of the pandemic. \"The manifest failure and corruption of the World Health Organization (WHO) during the COVID-19 pandemic is an example of the danger that international organizations pose to U.S. citizens and interests,\" its book states. It said that when institutions act contrary to U.S. interests, the government \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response, up to and including withdrawal.\" Immigration was the topic of several executive actions taken by Mr. Trump on the first day of his presidency, including one order that assigns troops \"the mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity and security of the United States.\" The chapter of Project 2025's blueprint that covers the Department of Homeland Security was authored by Ken Cuccinelli, who served in the first Trump administration, and it, too, sees a role for the Defense Department in securing the U.S.-Mexico border. The Pentagon, Cucinelli writes, should \"explicitly acknowledge and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border traffic to legal ports of entry.\" A section on the Justice Department urges the next administration to \"take a creative and aggressive approach\" to tackling criminal organizations at the southern border. \"This could include use of active-duty military personnel and National Guardsmen to assist in arrest operations along the border — something that has not yet been done,\" Project 2025's chapter on the Justice Department states. Entry into the U.S. by refugees under the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was suspended earlier this year in accordance with an order by Mr. Trump on Jan. 20. His directive also orders the secretary of Homeland Security to suspend decisions on applications forrefugee status. Mr. Trump has claimed that during the Biden administration, the U.S. has been \"inundated\" with high levels of migration, including through the Refugee Admissions Program. Project 2025, too, blames the Biden administration for overseeing what it says was a \"collapse\" of U.S. border security and immigration enforcement. To address this \"crisis,\" Project 2025 calls for \"rightsizing refugee admissions.\" \"The federal government's obligation to shift national security–essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions,\" its chapter on the State Department reads. The policy book calls for the State Department bureau that administers the Refugee Admissions Program to shift resources to challenges \"until the crisis can be contained and refugee-focused screening and vetting capacity can reasonably be restored.\" As part of Mr. Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, his administration has moved to end the Temporary Protected Status program forHaitiansandVenezuelans. The TPS designation was created by Congress in 1990, and it allows the federal government to grant temporary immigration protections to migrants from countries facing war, environmental disasters or other crises that make it dangerous to send deportees there. The program allows beneficiaries to apply for renewable work permits and deportation deferrals. A federal judge in late Marchagreed to delaythe Trump administration's attempt to end the TPS program that shields roughly 350,000 Venezuelan migrants, and a federal appeals court declined to pause that order while proceedings continue. Project 2025 calls on Congress to \"repeal temporary protected status designations.\" The National Institutes of Health announced in a February memo that it would be capping the amount of funding for \"indirect costs\" at 15%, a cut from an average of between 27% and 28%. Indirect costs cover general expenses like facilities and administration. NIH said in its memo that it has spent billions on indirect costs for more than 2,500 universities, medical schools and other research institutions across the country, and noted that \"most private foundations that fund research provide substantially lower indirect costs than the federal government, and universities readily accept grants from these foundations.\" Project 2025 also focused on indirect costs and called on Congress to \"cap the indirect cost rate paid to universities so that it does not exceed the lowest rate a university accepts from a private organization to fund search efforts.\" \"This market-based reform would help reduce federal taxpayer subsidization of leftist agendas,\" the policy book read. While Project 2025 said it is up to Congress to cap the indirect cost rate, the Trump administration took this step unilaterally,prompting legal challengesfrom universities, states and organizations that represent medical colleges and schools. Universities and the NIHsaid the cutswill have a \"dire impact\" on lifesaving research, including clinical trials for cancer and Alzheimer's patients. As part of a series of executive orders addressing the education system, Mr. Trumpissued a directiveon April 23 that directs the education secretary to enforce a provision of the Higher Education Act that requires higher education institutions that receive federal dollars to disclose any gifts of contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year. The move is also part of Project 2025, which calls on the next administration to enforce that statute, investigate higher education institutions that do not honor the obligations laid out in the law and make \"appropriate referrals\" to the Justice Department. Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump hassought to firethe members of independent agencies and inspectors general, despite federal laws that lay out the grounds for their removals. The terminations have sparked multiple court fights that appearaimed at assertingwhat the Trump administration believes is the president's unrestricted power to remove executive branch officials. But a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power. In a February letter to Congress, then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said the Justice Department \"intends to urge the Supreme Court to overrule that decision, which prevents the president from adequately supervising principal officers in the executive branch who execute the laws on the president's behalf, and which has already been severely eroded by recent Supreme Court decisions.\" Project 2025, too, suggested the next Republican presidential administration should seek the reversal of Humphrey's Executor. \"The next conservative administration should formally take the position that Humphrey's Executor violates the Constitution's separation of powers,\" it states. Project 2025's policy book calls for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, to be \"dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.\" The guide says NOAA's six main components should either be downsized or broken up, including Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, or OAR, which Project 2025 claims is the \"source of much of NOAA's climate alarmism.\" The Trump administration hasproposed sweeping changesandjob cutsfor NOAA, including a 25% cut to its 2026 budget, according to an internal memo obtained by CBS News in April. The proposal calls for OAR to be eliminated as an office, as well as funding for climate, weather and ocean laboratories, cooperative institutes and other programs. Current and former officials with NOAA have said the memo's objectives are \"devastating,\" and have argued that research is crucial to improving services such assevere weather forecastsfor the public.

    "title": "Despite Trump's promised cuts, U.S. spent $220B more so far than last year",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News April 29, 2025 / 9:55 AM EDT/ CBS News Despite promises to cut spending during the campaign and his first few months in office,President Trump's federal government has spent about $220 billion more in hisfirst 100 dayscompared to the same time period last year. In fact, the government is now spending more, day to day, than was spent in nine of the last 10 years. The exception: 2021, when the government wasspending trillionsto fight the coronavirus pandemic and prevent an economic disaster. CBS News analyzed the Treasury Department's daily financial reports to track the money flowing out of every government account each day since Mr. Trump returned to office. Here's a breakdown of what we found. Some might ask how that's possible given the high-profile repeated announcements of layoffs, canceled contracts, claims of fraud elimination by Mr. Trump and the Elon Musk-ledDepartment of Government Efficiencyand belt-tightening across the administration. The answer partly lies in the fundamentals of the government's budget when it comes to big-ticket expenditures that the White House can't fully control or massive changes to the way the U.S. pays for aging Americans' retirements andmedical care. The rest of the answer is politics. The conservative base that elected Mr. Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress may not support cutting the other biggest share of federal spending, the operations of the U.S. military and caring for veterans. Take a look at some of the areas representing the largest spending and largest increases inMr. Trump's first 100 dayscompared to the same time period in prior years. According to our analysis of the Treasury Department's daily reports on accounts, many of the largest persistently rising costs are direct payments to the military and seniors. The federal government's habit of spending more money than it takes in means thenational debt is growing. Paired with higher interest rates, the daily price tag of paying the interest on the debt is skyrocketing. The amount over the last three months is about double the amount paid out just three years earlier. And the daily payments on bonds and other securities that show up in the Treasury Daily Statement cover only cash interest paid to public debt holders. There are other elements of the government's debt obligations that only add to the cost. One way the Trump administration can impact the budget is through the civilian workforce, and that's been a focal point of Musk and DOGE vialayoffsandbuyouts. But many of those attempts are facinglegal challengesthat have delayed or reversed firings. Despite the announced staff reductions, one of the biggest areas of the increasing spending in the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term remains federal salaries. Workers were given a 2% raise when then-President Biden signed an executive order two days before Christmas, a move allowed because of Congress' inaction on permanent federal budgets. Combined, it's the military and veterans, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt payments driving the lion's share of federal spending over the last decade. In the last full fiscal year, they accounted for nearly two-thirds of federal government outlays. That breakdown has barely changed over the last decade. The vast majority of the attempted cutting so far by DOGE has been outside those areas, focused on smaller targets that might prove popular with President Trump's political base, such asforeign aid, theEducation Departmentand grants tocolleges and universities. \"If the savings are rather small and the pain is high, DOGE is going to be a liability,\" said Nat Malkus, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, who has been tracking DOGE's work. \"If you really want to cut federal spending, you're going to have to cut into the programs where the lion's share of the money is. That's Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security and we spend a lot of money on interest,\" Malkus said. There are some significant one-year spending reductions in some agencies and spending categories. Here's a look at some of the largest reductions since Mr. Trump took office. \"The fiscal year ends September 30. There's still a lot more year left so let's see where we are at the end of the year,\" said Stephen Miller, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. Musk's DOGE team has focused its attention on many smaller spenders among federal programs. DOGE's website claims the task force has already saved that much, at $160 billion, between canceling grants, contracts and leases and making cuts to the federal workforce. On its \"wall of receipts\" site online, the office reports the largest reductions so far come from the Department of Health and Human Services, General Services Administration, Department of Education, Department of Labor and Office of Personnel Management. Only about $60 billion, or less than 40%, of that alleged savings are itemized on the office's online \"wall of receipts\" andeven those itemizations have included errorsandlax documentation. But even the $160 billion advertised as saved so far would be tiny in the context of the larger federal budget and national debt. The administration has already spent about $220 billion more than last year in a little over three months, according to CBS News' analysis of Treasury reports. The advertised savings represents less than 2% of a full year's national budget. That's akin to a family with $10,000 in monthly spending trimming its bills by $200 a month. The supporters of the administration's cost-cutting efforts have characterized it as necessary to root out fraud and waste and to take a bite out of the national debt. However, the Treasury Department reports that debt stands at $36 trillion as of this week. The $160 billion advertised DOGE savings is about 0.5% of the debt, so the reduction from DOGE's efforts would be like a family with $10,000 in credit card balances paying it down by $50. An independent analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit that studies the federal workforce, also reported recently that the disruptions caused by theDOGE cuts may have cost taxpayers $135 million. Musk recently saidhis work with DOGE is winding down. You can explore the government's daily account ledgers for yourself. We've isolated the money spent by category in the first few months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period in each of the last 10 years. You can search for agencies or spending categories below to see the change over time and how much or less is being spent during this first 100 days of the Trump administration. We've limited the table to agencies and categories with at least $100 million in spending since Jan. 20, 2025. Taylor  Johnstoncontributed to this report.

    "title": "The man who led Project 2025 gives his assessment of Trump's first 100 days",
    "article_text": "The former head of Project 2025 believes an “unchained” President Donald Trump has made immense progress during the first 100 days of his second term toward undoing liberal gains dating back to Franklin D. Roosevelt. But Paul Dans — who led the effort to producea detailed conservative transition plan and policy blueprintthat was at the center of last year’s presidential election — believes the president needs an influx of new attorneys to fight for his policies in court. Those battles, Dans told NBC News, will shape the next 100 days. “If Roosevelt had the New Deal, this is what I would think of as Trump’s real deal,” Dans said. “This is deconstructing the administrative state and walking back a lot of this progressive architecture that had been built up by FDR.” “What’s coming next is really a squaring off with the courts,” Dans said, adding, “This is going to reach, certainly, a boiling point, and so look to that getting resolved.” The Dans-led Project 2025 was an effort overseen by the Heritage Foundation ahead of the 2024 campaign, which began with the basic premise of setting up a future right-wing administration to govern on Day 1 with more preparation and planning than Trump had for his first term. Much of Project 2025 centered on plans for radically restructuring the civil service, as well as providing a database of potential MAGA-inspired hires in a new administration. But it was a 900-plus-page memo, outlining many policy positions a future administration should consider, that garnered the most attention, as Democrats put it at the center of their campaign. Even though many of the policies included in the document mirrored policies Trump pledged to enact in his own plan, Agenda47, the president and his campaigndistanced themselvesfrom Project 2025 on the trail. And Dans, who worked in Trump’s first administration, was forced out of his position over the summer as anger from the campaign intensified. After Trump won, however, hehired multiple authors of the report to key positions, including Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, immigration czar Tom Homan, top trade adviser Peter Navarro and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, among others.NBC News reportedduring the transition that the transition team was utilizing the Project 2025 database of potential hires, too. The blueprint ultimately foreshadowed plenty of what Trump has enacted or attempted oncein power. Anindependent trackerfound that the administration has completed or taken action on roughly 40% of the material in Project 2025’s blueprint. That includes everything from cutting research grants to universities to readying cuts forclimate research, stripping some immigrants of Temporary Protected Status, and an all-out assault on diversity programs in government. With that in the foreground as Trump hits the 100-day mark, Dans spoke with NBC News in a pair of interviews in recent days. He doesn’t believe measuring Trump’s actions against Project 2025’s plan “is really accurate,” adding, “these are, to be sure, President Trump’s own policies, many of which were embodied in Project 2025.” “It’s with great excitement that I read what’s going on every day and see a new step that they’re taking,” Dans said. “But to be sure, this has to get implemented. At this point, a lot of the executive orders and the like are policy pronouncements, and the real rubber is going to meet the road when it comes to implementing all these directives.” With a tightly divided Congress passing few new laws, though, a number of Trump’s executive initiatives — whether they be on immigration, the civil service or federal funding — are tied up incourt battlesthat will be key in determining just how far the president is able to go. “Many of us always saw this as the ultimate end game, that this is where the two sides would meet,” Dans said. “It comes down to having the right people. Ultimately, you need to have zealous advocates for MAGA in position and ready to face off with their counterparts. … To be sure, this is where all the eyes are going to go next.” “He needs additional reinforcements on his team,” Dans said, “as this kind of slows down into a war of attrition with the deep state, particularly on the legal front.” He added: “As much as he can continue to get his team on the field, that’s imperative.” On hisTruth Social platform Monday, Trump posted that his administration has so far hired to fill more than 80% of political appointee positions in some of the largest agencies, including the departments of Justice, State, Defense and Treasury. Those positions make up a small number of the jobs in each agency, but Trumprecently movedto reclassify a whole host of federal workers to make them easier to replace. The administration has already suffered some setbacks in court. The fallout over Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvadorbegan when the administration saidin court filings that he was deported because of an “administrative error.” Last week, the administrationreplaced its lawyersin a case challenging New York City’s congestion pricing, after the U.S. attorney’s office in Manhattan said it mistakenly filed a memo that detailed weaknesses in the administration’s argument and strategy. “This is where the worry comes in,” Dans said. “Is there enough of a MAGA elite among the top legal minds to meet” the administration’s needs? “I think it’s really incumbent on the administration to get a lot of these good lawyers who are out in the 50 states, get them to Washington and press them into service,” Dans continued. Enhancing MAGA staffing has been front of mind for Dans for a long time, given how central deconstructing the existing federal bureaucracy was to Project 2025. That mission has been carried out by Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire adviser who’s overseen the effort dubbed the Department of Government Efficiency. “What’s elementally important is that Project 2025 identified the administrative state as the major blockade to effectuating change for the better,” Dans said. The Trump administration hasn’t “fired enough people, to be sure,” he added, describing how difficult it is to do so under existing regulations. With Trump recently moving on the policy known as Schedule F — the reclassification of some career government employees to make them easier to remove — Dans said he expects to see “a lot more of this taking place.” Dans had plenty of praisefor Muskand his effort, as the tech titanannounced this monththat he will soon dedicate more time to his business interests and decrease how much time he’s spending in government. “Without DOGE, I don’t believe any of this would be able to be accomplished at the pace it has been,” Dans said, adding its structure remains necessary to achieve Trump’s goals in the months to come. “This is a great 100-day mark, a watershed moment in history. This is the slamming of the door on the progressive era.” But Dans did offer some caution on artificial intelligence policy, as Trump has sought to loosen restrictions around AI via executive orders while Musk and DOGE have implemented AI programs at some federal agencies. “AI has produced this MRI of the blob, and now we can actually make connections that would have been impossible before, in a matter of a weekend, that might have taken two years of study,” Dans said, adding, “But I do believe that AI needs to be carefully policed by the administration.” As Trump hitsthe 100-day markof his administration,polling is flashing several warning signsfor himon signature issues, like immigration and the economy, as deportations to a prison in El Salvador and the president’s global tariffs garner headlines. Dans, though, says Trump is on target and maintains a mandate for “sweeping change.” “This is Trump, unchained and able to do what he promised the American people,” he said. “There’s no playbook out there for restoring the country. Much of this is intuitive to him and to others. There are going to be ups and downs. It’s a long-term proposition. So there will be some short-term pain, but all for long-term gain.” Moving forward, Dans said he’s eager to see more reforms at the Defense Department, including a “large repurposing” of the agency as it sharpens its focus on Asia, which he believes is coming once there’s a settlement in Ukraine. He also wants to see Trump take action on a policy he proposed during the campaign but has gottenlittle attentionin recent months: the construction of 10 “freedom cities” on federal land. “I always thought that was an intriguing Trump idea,” Dans said. “It captures the imagination of everybody to build something new. He’s a builder. So the first part of building is demolition, but he’s going to get on to the construction phase pretty soon.” Looking ahead to 2028, Dans said there won’t be a need for a Project 2029. “We have President Trump in power now, he has a team,” Dans said. “The premise of Project 2025 was that we needed, as conservatives, to get together. We were a herd of cats, often scratching at one another, and we needed to kind of start marching in the line. And that’s what Project 2025 did.” “And I think, not only our initiative, but other presidential transition projects really put this forward that time was of the essence,” Dans continued. “And President Trump has certainly come out and played with an urgency that is 100% correct.”",

    "article_text": "Jordon Hudson, the 24-year-old who drew national attention Sunday after CBS aired anawkward interviewwith her boyfriend, 73-year-old former NFL coach Bill Belichick, added another layer of intrigue to the relationship Tuesday witha post on Instagram. Hudson posted what appeared to be a screenshot of an email Belichick sent on April 10. In the email, Belichick expresses frustration with the media tour accompanying the release of his memoir, “The Art of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football,” and takes issue with an unspecified news article that highlighted a professional mistake he mentions in the book. “I don’t think this is fantastic, but it probably will hype the book, which is clearly the ongoing theme here,” Belichick wrote. “This is about what I expected from the media.” “This book is about how I did my job, and lessons from my 50 years in and around the NFL — not a bathroom book that highlights my mistakes,” he added. “I hope we can get on the same page in promoting the book authentically.” Belichick's email does not specify the professional mistake or the news publication that highlighted it. In a seven-word caption accompanying the post, Hudson said: “Full statement to be released later today.” She has more than 91,000 followers on Instagram, where she describes herself as the daughter of a Maine fisherman and a former college cheerleader. Belichick’s book tour evidently included the interview with “CBS Sunday Morning” that aired Sunday. In the interview, CBS News journalist Tony Dokoupil asked Belichick how he met Hudson. Hudson, seated off-camera, immediately interjected: “We’re not talking about this.” Dokoupil replied: “No?” “No,” Hudson said. The interview quickly went viral online, driving speculation about the origins of the relationship and the nature of Hudson’s role in Belichick’s professional life. In a voiceover track, Dokoupil told viewers that “Jordan was a constant presence during our interview.” He quoted Belichick describing Hudson in his memoir as his “idea mill and creative muse.” Dokoupil also asked Belichick about photos of the couple on Instagram, includinga postinOctoberfeaturing him in fisherman’s gear and her dressed like a mermaid. In response, the famously taciturn Belichick said: “I’m on some of those social media platforms, but I honestly don’t follow them.” CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday. NBC Sportshas reported that Hudson has “a very active role” in Belichick’s professional life and is “exerting a very high degree of influence.” Belichick is best known for leading the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl championships. He left the NFL after the 2023 season and, late last year, signed a deal to coach the football team at the University of North Carolina. A spokesman for the UNC team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "title": "Women who survive cancer are more likely than men to have fatigue and depression",
    "article_text": "Women whosurvive cancerare more likely to experience cancer-related fatigue and depression than men, according to new research presented Tuesday at the American Association for Cancer Research’s annual meeting in Chicago. As a result, women are less likely to engage in recreational physical activity, which over time exacerbates their symptoms and lowers their quality of life, the research suggests. The new findings build on previous research that foundwomen develop more severe side effects during cancer treatmentthan men. They also underscore the “very real consequences” that cancer treatment can have for women after they’ve entered remission, said Joseph Unger, a biostatician and cancer researcher with the Fred Hutch Cancer Center in Seattle who was not involved in the study. “Cancer treatments are becoming more effective at keeping patients alive and turning cancer into more of a chronic disease,” said Unger, who studies cancer patients’ quality of life. “Understandably, patients don’t want to just live, they want to live well. So, that’s really where this research helps to point us in the next direction.” Dr. Simo Du, lead author of the study and internal medicine resident physician at NYC Health + Hospitals/Jacobi, had noticed that many more female than male cancer survivors in her clinic were complaining of fatigue that made it hard to shop for groceries, get dressed, shower and do other social or hygiene-related activities. To better understand how this disparity affected patients’ quality of life, Du and her colleagues analyzed responses from 1,555 adultcancer survivorsthat were included in the 2015-2016 and 2017-2020 cohorts of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Participants answered questions about whether they feel hopeless, deal with poor appetite, experience trouble sleeping and have thoughts of self-harm. They also completed questionnaires about the type of physical activities they participate in. Overall, the researchers said, the responses could be extrapolated to 25 million survivors with over 20 different types of cancer across the U.S., including those of the prostate, breast, skin, colon and cervix. The findings have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The study found that, compared with male survivors, female cancer survivors were 69% more likely to report cancer-related fatigue and 58% more likely toreport depression. While fatigue is already known to affectmore than 80% of people with cancer, the study found that women were 1.5 times more likely than men to experience it. Cancer treatments affect the entire body, as they can kill both cancerous and healthy cells, said Carolyn Gotay, cancer researcher and professor emeritus of population and public health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver who was not involved in the study. These effects can persist for months to years after treatment is done, she said, leaving survivors with a host of health issues from deafness to infertility. Cancer-related fatigue and depression can be caused by cancer itself or the other medical conditions it causes, according to theNational Cancer Institute. The emotional impact of dealing with the disease can also cause these symptoms. Why women bear the brunt of these effects remains unclear, although experts have some theories. Research shows that women have stronger immune responses to treatments, which causes greater inflammation. Women also tend to clear drugs from their bodies more slowly than men, Du said, leading to higher concentrations of medications in their system and thus worse symptoms. It’s possible, too, that differences in body size affect how drugs and radiation are distributed and absorbed in women’s bodies. Women are also more likely to develop cancers that are treated with hormone therapies that can contribute greatly to fatigue and depression, Du said. Some of these therapies, liketamoxifenthat’s used to treat some breast cancers, are taken for five to 10 years after remission to lower the chances the cancer returns, according to the American Cancer Society. That said, women are more likely to reportfatigueanddepressioneven without a cancer diagnosis, Gotay said, so it’s possible that sex-related hormone differences might better explain why women experience more of these symptoms from the start. Du said that it’s also possible social gender norms play a role. Women typically have more caretaker responsibilities like tending to children and chores that can increase stress and contribute to fatigue and depression, she said. Notably, the study found that men were more likely to have thoughts “that they would be better off dead,” Du said. This finding mirrors other data that showssuicide rates are generally higher in menthan in women. Du speculated that social norms, namely expectations that men should be able to provide for their families, could be to blame. The study also found that, among all cancer survivors, those who did moderate physical activity such as walking or cycling had a 50% lower risk of cancer-related fatigue. Those who participated in more vigorous activity didn’t see any improvements in their energy, Du said. Meanwhile, both moderate and vigorous activity was associated with a two- to five-fold decrease in depression risk, according to the research. Overall, the results suggest that post-cancer therapy programs should prioritize exercise. A2024 review of 113 randomized controlled trialscame to similar conclusions, and found that exercise, along with cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based programs, improved cancer-related fatigue both during and after cancer treatment. “We always prescribe medications” to help cancer survivors cope with lingering symptoms, Du said. “But for cancer-related fatigue, exercise may actually work better than pharmaceutical interventions.” Even still, exercise may be a bandage solution, Unger said, treating just the symptom and not the root cause. Future research needs to investigate why women experience worse side effects after cancer so they can benefit from more effective treatment options. In the meantime, Gotay said she hopes the study helps normalize the idea that it’s OK to not feel OK after surviving cancer, which can be tough for many survivors to understand and accept. “When people survive cancer and have fatigue or depression, they think that something is wrong with them because they’re not grateful,” Gotay said. “But they shouldn’t feel alone … or as though they’re deficient. It’s a part of the whole experience … and we need to start giving them the tools they need to make their lives as rich as possible.”",

    "article_text": "Immigration and Customs Enforcement has indicated it could start terminating a person’s legal status because of visa revocation. An internal memo to all Student and Exchange Visitor Program personnel, which falls under ICE, shows an expanded list of criteria for ICE to terminate foreign-born students’ legal status in the U.S., including a “U.S. Department of State Visa Revocation (Effective Immediately).” It was filed in court by the Justice Department on Monday night and dated Saturday. Previously, there were a variety of reasons for students to lose legal status, including if they stop attending school, lose work authorization or commit certain crimes. But typically students would have the right to due process before the legal status is terminated, attorneys say. Now, according to the memo, visa revocation itself is grounds for the termination of status. The memo shows expansion of power for ICE. Houston-based immigration attorney Steven Brown said the new policy “against at least 15 years of SEVP guidance,” referring to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which falls under ICE. “Historically, the Department of State has revoked visas for many reasons,” Brown said. “But it doesn’t impact your non-immigrant status in the US. It’s just now they’re trying to do that part of it.” The Trump administration announced Friday at a hearing that the legal statuses of international students whose records were terminated in recent weeks would be restored. In the meantime, the Trump administration said ICE would craft a new policy that will “provide a framework for status record termination.” According to the memo, SEVIS records can now be terminated for a number of reasons, ranging from “exceeded unemployment time” to “violation of change of status requirements.” “When SEVP has objective evidence that a nonimmigrant visa holder is no longer complying with the terms of their nonimmigrant status for any reason, then the SEVIS record may be terminated on that basis,” the memo said. Using its discretion, ICE can also conduct further investigations or initiate removal proceedings based on that evidence. The memo affirmed an existing rule that the State Department can “at any time, in its discretion, revoke an alien’s visa.” “When State revokes an alien’s visa with immediate eﬀect, ICE should take steps to initiate removal proceedings,” the memo said. “If State revokes a nonimmigrant visa eﬀective immediately, SEVP may terminate the nonimmigrant’s SEVIS record based on the visa revocation with immediate eﬀect.” The memo underscored that the document cannot be used as a substitute for applicable legal requirements. “It is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any administrative, civil, or criminal matter,” the memo said. In March, the Trump administration began revoking the visas of thousands of international students in addition to their records and legal statuses. Critics said the administration appeared to be taking aim at those who’ve participated in political activism or have had previous charges, like DUIs. After many successful legal challenges to the terminations across the U.S., many international students began to discover that their records were abruptly restored last week, immigration attorneys and universities said. The reinstatements occurred with little to no explanation, the attorneys said. And as of Tuesday, several universities, including Northeastern University,Harvard Universityand theUniversity of Connecticut,reported that all students affected by the terminations had their statuses restored. Jath Shao, a Cleveland-based immigration attorney who’s represented several international students affected by the visa revocations, said that the new policy presents a new set of challenges for students. “ICE has now done their homework and issued this memo to give themselves the power that judges just told them they didn’t have,” Shao said. “Students should be concerned that even minor problems can have serious consequences and should consult a lawyer if there is anything in their past to worry about.”",

    "title": "Trump returns to his roots with a campaign-style rally to mark 100 days in office",
    "article_text": "To celebrate the first 100 days of his second term in office,President Donald Trumpwent back to his greatest hits. At a rally Tuesday in Warren, Michigan, commemorating the early marker of his second term, Trump leaned into much of the rhetoric that became a staple of his campaign rallies, hitting on major themes like the economy and immigration even as his poll numbers are among the worst of any president at this point in office. “I miss the campaign,” Trump told a raucous crowd, lamenting that he no longer gets to regularly hold rally-style events with his most loyal political supporters. Follow live politics coverage here Recent public polling has found Trump’s approval rating consistently in thelow-to-mid-40s, numbers at odds with the rosy portrayal he gave in his Michigan stop. The Trump administration’s focus on illegal immigration and the border has consistently been his highest-performing policy issue, but his plan to implement sweeping tariffs has roiled global markets and gotten poor marks; a recent CNBC pollfound that 57% of respondentsbelieve the United States is either headed to recession or already in one. But Trump, in characteristic fashion Tuesday, cast his first three months in office as a universal success. It has been “the most successful first 100 days of administration in the history of our country,” he said. “And that’s according to many, many people.” Cheri Verardi, who attended the event, said: “He is doing what needs to be done. It’s hard for some people to swallow, but we need to see how it will play out. And I believe it’s going to play out for the betterment of our country.” Deborah Spencer, another rally attendee, said she doesn’t like how she has so far “lost money for retirement” as the markets have dropped because of Trump’s economic policies. But she said she still has faith in him. “I’m confident that President Trump has our best interests,” she said. Thousands attended the rally, but the overall size of the event paled in comparison with past campaign-era Trump rallies. Trump referred to \"all the people outside,\" even as the venue itself wasn’t at capacity. Trump’s second term has been marked with fightswith federal courts, many of which have ruled against some of his most controversial policies, and it has ushered in an eroding relationship between the United States and some of its closest global allies. It has also sought to overhaul the federal government with the help of tech billionaire Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, which has ushered in mass layoffs of government workers. During his second term, Trump's MAGA base has brushed off concerns about tariffs as “short-term pain” and embraced his border policies, while Democrats have amplified their concerns about what they say are his authoritarian tendencies as his administration has focused on mass deportations. Trump brushed off the low polling numbers stemming from some of his early administration policies as “fake.” “If it were a legit poll, it would be in the 60s or 70s,” he said Tuesday. Holding the rally in Michigan itself points to the state's importance in next year's midterm elections. Democratic Sen. Gary Peters isn’t seeking re-election, making Michigan one of the top Senate-side battleground states headed into 2026. Trump hasn’t endorsed a candidate in the race; Republican leadership in the Senate has backed Mike Rogers, who lost last year's race to Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin. In a twist, Trump also used the day to find some common ground with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat and persistent Trump critic who is considering running for president in 2028. At anevent hoursbefore the rally in Warren, Trump announced a new series of fighter jets for Selfridge Air National Guard Base, giving the credit to Whitmer, whose recent visit to the White House to discuss tariffsdrew criticismfrom many in her own party. At the rally, Trump focused one of his attacks on Rep. Shri Thanedar, D-Mich., who introduced articles of impeachment against Trump on Monday, saying he is a “clear and present danger to our nation’s Constitution and democracy.” “What the hell did I do? Here we go again,” said Trump, whom the House twice impeached during his first term. “I had the television way down, and I said to our great first lady, ‘Listen, did I just hear us being impeached again?’” Trump advisers have told NBC News they don't see Democrats’ retaking the House, but they continue to talk about the idea of Democrats’ trying to impeach Trump as a voter turnout mechanism headed into the 2026 midterms. “The Democrats are not taking the House,\" a Trump adviser said Tuesday. \"But this is about making sure voters remember the stakes of the midterm elections.”",

    "title": "These California hills are alive — with color and photo-ops",
    "article_text": "CARLSBAD, Calif. — Every spring the rolling hills come alive with a rainbow of ranunculus flowers. The 50-plus acres of blooms draw thousands of visitors to The Flower Fields, a locally iconic flower farm along Interstate 5. Retired schoolteacher-turned-volunteer Mary Ellen Courtney has been going back every year for more than a decade. “It’s heaven. It’s beautiful. It’s peaceful. It’s spiritual. It’s comforting, and everyone has a good time,” Courtney said. The flowers and the people who visit are what keep her volunteering. “As a retired teacher, it allows me to further connect with the kids,” she said. “That was the favorite part of my job, was connecting with the boys and girls in the classroom, and this is just a different type of classroom.” The volunteering gig has also led to a part-time job at the farm, where she works two-hour shifts talking to children or teaching visitors about the flowers and environment. But, Courtney said, even when she’s not working, she’s there volunteering. “I have a purpose every day, every day,” she said. “This is where I will be.” On a busy day, the farm can attract nearly 10,000 visitors. And in more recent years, social media has boosted its popularity. “I’d seen TikToks on the flower field here,” Alanis Mendoza said during a recent visit. “We’re from New York City, so we don’t really have a lot of fields and greenery, so it was like, wow!” The estimated 80 million flowers are in bloom for only about 10 weeks, but their beauty keeps many, like Courtney, coming back. “When people leave, you don’t have one person that’s unhappy. They’re unhappy that it’s over,” she said. “Everybody’s happy to be here, and everybody just sees the joy that’s here.”",

Macon County Sheriff André Brunson livestreamed the response, during which he said the kangaroo's caretaker had tranquilized it and was moving in for a second shot. \"I didn't believe it,\" he said during the livestream. \"Nobody believed it.

    "title": "Miriam Haley testifies against Harvey Weinstein once more",
    "article_text": "Five years after she tearfully told a court that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her, former \"Project Runway\" production assistant Miriam Haley took the stand again Tuesday to revisit the ordeal she alleges she endured at the hands of the disgraced movie mogul. Haley was back testifying because New York’s highest court last yearoverturned Weinstein’s landmark 2020 conviction, which defined the #MeToo movement and helped turn Weinstein into a Hollywood pariah. Haley had barely started testifying when Weinstein's lawyers began raising objections to her recounting the abuse she says she suffered as a child while she was being raised in Sweden. Weinstein’s defense team had been expected to closely watch the testimony of Haley, who says Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in July 2006, because both she and actorJessica Manntestified at the 2020 trial. Mann says Weinstein raped her in 2013 in a Manhattan hotel room. Weinstein is charged with one count of engaging in a criminal sex act in connection with Haley’s allegations and one count of third-degree rape in Mann's case. This time around, Weinstein is also charged with one count of engaging in a first-degree criminal sexual act, accused of assaulting a Polish former model namedKaja Sokola. Sokola, who was not part of the 2020 trial,claims in a lawsuitthat Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent at a Manhattan hotel in 2006, when she was 16. Weinstein, 73, has denied assaulting the three women. Haley, 47, said she first met Weinstein in 2004 at the after-party for the movie premiere of \"The Aviator.\" \"I introduced myself, saying, 'I’m Mimi,'\" she said. Haley said that several years later, she reconnected with Weinstein at the Cannes Film Festival in France. She said she was looking for an opportunity as a production assistant in New York and agreed to meet him at his hotel. Once they were there, Haley said, Weinstein commented on her legs and \"asked whether I could give him a massage.\" She testified she said no and later burst into tears. \"I felt taken aback, humiliated,\" Haley said. Asked by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg whether she had any interest in Weinstein “romantically or sexually,\" Haley replied: “No, I did not. I was there to try and find work.” Still, despite being rebuffed, Weinstein did arrange for her to work on \"Project Runway\" even though she lacked a U.S. work visa, Haley said before court was adjourned for the day. Haley is expected to be back on the stand Wednesday and reprise her 2020 testimony about the alleged assault. During the 2020 trial, Haley testified that not long after she finished working for the show, she visited Weinstein at his lower Manhattan apartment, where, she said, he pinned her down on his bed and forced oral sex on her. On the stand, Haley told jurors thatin the midst of the alleged assaultit occurred to her, “I’m being raped.” Unsure what to do, Haley said, she weighed her options. “If I scream ‘rape,’ will someone hear me?”she said. “I checked out and decided to endure it.” Haley testified at the retrial a week after her former roommate and close friend Christine Pressman told jurors that Haley confided in her back in September 2006 that Weinstein had assaulted her. “I was staying at Lorne Michaels’ house in East Hampton, and Miriam was there, as well,\" Pressman said, referring to the \"Saturday Night Live\" creator. \"She was distraught, crying, very upset, obviously; she was very animated and had a lot of intensity. She said it’s Harvey Weinstein. She was in shock. She described what happened, and it was disgusting.\" Asked what she advised her friend, Pressman said: \"I told her to move past it and not to go to the police at all. I told her she should not to go to police or the authorities about being raped by Harvey Weinstein.\" Another former roommate, Elizabeth Entin, said Haley also told her Weinstein assaulted her. But she said she gave Haley different guidance. “He raped my friend, and I am not happy about that,” Entin said. “I told her to call a lawyer to navigate the system. I despise anyone who has raped my friend. She is not my only friend that has been raped.\" Inher opening remarks, Assistant District Attorney Shannon Lucey said Weinstein was a serial sexual predator who used his power as \"a titan\" in the movie industry to prey on young women, and she then described in graphic terms what he is alleged to have done to them. “They stayed quiet for years,” Lucey said of the accusers, out of “their fear of what he might do to them.” Weinstein’s lead attorney,Arthur Aidala, insisted in his opening statement that Weinstein’s sexual encounters with the accusers were “transactional\" and “consensual.” \"The casting couch is not a crime scene,\" he said.",

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has fired former second gentleman Doug Emhoff from the board that oversees the Holocaust Museum. “Today, I was informed of my removal from the United States Holocaust Memorial Council,\" Emhoff, thefirst Jewish spouseof a vice president, said in a statement Tuesday. \"Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized. To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve,\" he said. The firing was first reported byThe New York Times, which said that in addition to Emhoff, other high-profile board members appointed by President Joe Biden had also been terminated, including former Biden chief of staff Ron Klain and Susan Rice, who was Biden's domestic policy chief. Presidential appointments are supposed to be for five years, according to the museum's website. A White House official confirmed the firings. Emhoff said he would keep speaking out. “No divisive political decision will ever shake my commitment to Holocaust remembrance and education or to combatting hate and antisemitism. I will continue to speak out, to educate, and to fight hate in all its forms — because silence is never an option,” he said. In a statement, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “President Trump looks forward to appointing new individuals who will not only continue to honor the memory of those who perished in the Holocaust, but who are also steadfast supporters of the State of Israel.” Asked for comment on the firings, the museum issued a statement that did not address them. \"At this time of high antisemitism and Holocaust distortion and denial, the Museum is gratified that our visitation is robust and demand for Holocaust education is increasing. We look forward to continuing to advance our vitally important mission as we work with the Trump Administration,\" it said.",

    "title": "Researchers secretly infiltrated a popular Reddit forum with AI bots, causing outrage",
    "article_text": "In recent months, a group of researchers conducted a secret experiment on Reddit to see how artificial intelligence can be used to influence human opinion. Now, Reddit says it is considering legal action. Researchers from the University of Zurich deployed a slew of AI bots posing as real people and engaging with users without their knowledge or consent to try to change minds on the popular Reddit forum r/changemyview, where posts often ask users to challenge their views on contentious topics. The bots, whose accounts are now banned, left more than 1,000 comments throughout the subreddit, taking on identities such as a rape victim, a Black man who opposes the Black Lives Matter movement and a trauma counselor who specializes in abuse. One AI bot, under the username u/catbaLoom213, left a lengthy comment arguing against the opinion that AI should never interact with humans on social media, according to a full copy of the bots’ comments compiled by the subreddit’s moderators. “AI in social spaces isn’t just about impersonation — it’s about augmenting human connection,” the bot wrote while impersonating a real user. Another bot, u/genevievestrome, criticized the Black Lives Matter movement for being led by “NOT black people.” “I say this as a Black Man, there are few better topics for a victim game / deflection game than being a black person,” the bot wrote. Other bots gave themselves identities ranging from “a Roman Catholic who is gay” and a nonbinary person who feels “both trans and cis at the same time” to a Hispanic man who feels frustration “when people call me a white boy.” While the results of the experiment are unclear, the project is the latest incident to fuel fears about the ability of AI to mimic humans online, adding to already prevalent concerns about thepotential consequencesof interacting withAI companions. Such bots, which have permeated social platformslike Instagram, are known to take on unique humanlike identities and personalities. On Monday, Reddit’s chief legal officer, Ben Lee,wrote in a postthat neither Reddit nor the r/changemyview mods knew about “this improper and highly unethical experiment” ahead of time. He added that Reddit was in the process of sending formal legal demands to the University of Zurich and the research team. “What this University of Zurich team did is deeply wrong on both a moral and legal level,” Lee wrote. “It violates academic research and human rights norms, and is prohibited by Reddit’s user agreement and rules, in addition to the subreddit rules.” A spokesperson for Reddit declined to share additional comment. In anannouncement to the communityover the weekend, moderators of r/changemyview wrote that they filed an ethics complaint asking the university to advise against publishing the researchers’ findings, to conduct an internal review of the study’s approval and to commit to stronger oversight of such projects. “Allowing publication would dramatically encourage further intrusion by researchers, contributing to increased community vulnerability to future non-consensual human subjects experimentation,” they wrote. Melanie Nyfeler, a media relations officer, wrote in an email that relevant authorities at the university are aware of and will investigate the incident. “In light of these events, the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences intends to adopt a stricter review process in the future and, in particular, to coordinate with the communities on the platforms prior to experimental studies,” Nyfeler wrote. She confirmed that the researchers have decided “on their own accord” not to publish the results. For privacy reasons, she added, the university cannot disclose their identities. Nyfeler said that because the study was considered “exceptionally challenging,” the ethics committee advised the researchers to inform the participants “as much as possible” and to fully comply with Reddit’s rules. But the recommendations are not legally binding, she wrote, and the researchers are responsible for their project. Reached at an email address they set up for the experiment, the researchers directed all inquiries to the university. The researchers, whoanswered questionsfrom the community via their Reddit account, u/LLMResearchTeam, said online that the AI bots personalized their responses by using a separate model to collect demographic information about users — such as their ages, genders, ethnicities, locations and political orientations — based on their post histories. Still, they wrote that their AI models included “heavy ethical safeguards and safety alignment” and that they explicitly prompted the models to avoid “deception and lying about true events.” A researcher also reviewed each AI-generated comment before it was posted, they wrote. In response to the mods’ concerns, the researchers further said, “A careful review of the content of these flagged comments revealed no instances of harmful, deceptive, or exploitative messaging, other than the potential ethical issue of impersonation itself.” In their post, the r/changemyview mods rejected the researchers’ claim that their experiment “yields important insights.” They also wrote that such research “demonstrates nothing new” that other, less intrusive studies have not already shared. “Our sub is a decidedly human space that rejects undisclosed AI as a core value,” they wrote. “People do not come here to discuss their views with AI or to be experimented upon. People who visit our sub deserve a space free from this type of intrusion.”",

    "title": "Trump praises Gov. Gretchen Whitmer while announcing new fighter jets for a Michigan air base",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump announced a new series of fighter jets for Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Michigan on Tuesday, giving credit in part to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Whitmer, who is viewed as a likely presidential contender in 2028, has come under scrutiny from Democrats in recent weeks forcultivating a closer working relationship with Trump. She pitched Trump this month on securing a new fighter mission for the base, which is home to a soon-to-be-retired fleet of jets. But the meeting led to an awkward moment in the Oval Office, where Whitmer later stood as Trump signed an executive order targeting a critic and repeated his debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. A New York Times photographer captured her at one pointshielding her face with folders. \"That's the reason she came to see me, by the way — to save Selfridge,\" Trump said Tuesday at the base in Macomb County at an event Whitmer attended. Trump, who is holding a rally Tuesday evening in nearby Warren, announced that a new fighter mission of about 20 F-15EX jets will replace the A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft at the base. He praised a bipartisan lobbying effort that included Republicans such as Rep. John James, who represents the area in Congress and is running for governor next year. But he repeatedly singled out Whitmer and thanked her for bringing the issue to his attention. He even brought Whitmer onstage at the end of his remarks, seemingly catching her off-guard. \"Well, I hadn’t planned to speak, but I’m — on behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and serve so honorably, on behalf of the state of Michigan, I am really damn happy we’re here to celebrate this recapitalization at Selfridge. It’s crucial for the Michigan economy. It’s crucial for the men and women here for our homeland security and our future. So thank you. I am so, so grateful that this announcement was made today, and I appreciate all the work. Thank you,\" Whitmer said. Follow live politics coverage here In a statement shared by her office, Whitmer talked about the importance of the base. “This is a huge, bipartisan win for Michigan, decades in the making, that will grow our economy and make our country safer,” she said in the statement. “I appreciate the President’s partnership on this new fighter mission that will protect jobs and show the world that Michigan is the best place to pioneer the next innovations in national defense.” Trump's announcement was the second of the day geared toward Michigan, a major industrial state and Midwest battleground that he won by a slim margin last fall. Earlier Monday, the White House confirmeda tariff breakfor U.S. automakers, though the immediate impact on Detroit's Big 3 car manufacturers remains murky. A fraught political dynamic hung over the day. Whitmer — conscious of her national profile in a Democratic Party searching for new leadership and of the many Democrats who were angered by her unwitting cameo in a White House photo opportunity just weeks ago — sought to calibrate expectations around her appearance with Trump. This time, her team moved to get ahead of any fallout, confirming early Tuesday that she would be with Trump at the air base — “to support her troops and the long-standing effort she has made to secure support for Selfridge,” a spokesperson said. The statement emphasized that she would not attend Trump’s rally nearby. Whitmer also issued aseries of social media postsmeant to explain her scheduled meeting with Trump before it happened. “I’ll work with anyone who’s serious about getting things done. But I’ll never compromise on what I believe,” she said on X. “In Michigan, we know how to get things done — and that means working together.” She added: “Bipartisanship isn’t about sacrificing our values. It’s about standing strong and finding common ground to get things done. It’s about putting people first, every single time.” Chris Meagher, a Democratic strategist and former Whitmer adviser, said Tuesday's announcement validates Whitmer's strategy for dealing with Trump. \"Gov. Whitmer has showed she’s not afraid to stand up to Donald Trump when he’s wrong for Michigan and work with him when it’s best for Michigan,\" Meagher said. \"And she absolutely did what was best for the state of Michigan by working across the aisle on this deal. And she got the job done and deserves all the credit.\"",

    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we break down four sets of data that explain President Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office. First, we take a look at the wide gap between the number of executive orders and laws he has signed so far. Then, Steve Kornacki examines how Trump’s standing in the polls at this point compares to that of his recent predecessors, as well as how Americans view his handling of key issues. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Have a question for the NBC News Politics Desk about the first 100 days of the Trump administration, the status of the “one big, beautiful bill” on Capitol Hill, or the early contours of the 2026 midterm elections? Send your questions topoliticsnewsletter@nbcuni.comand we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter. President Donald Trump has leaned heavily on executive power, rather than the Republican-controlled Congress, in his bid to drastically reshape the federal government in his first 100 days in office. Trump has signed 140 executive orders so far in his second term, far outpacing his recent predecessors. In fact, Trump issued more executive orders in the first 10 days of his term than any president did in their first 100 days since Dwight Eisenhower. That has largely left members of the House and Senate on the sidelines. Trump has so far signed just five bills into law, fewer than any president in the first 100 days of an administration since at least Eisenhower, according to an NBC News analysis of data in the congressional record. By this time during his first term, Trump had signed 30 bills into law. At the same point, Barack Obama had signed 14 while Joe Biden had signed 11. And the laws Trump has enacted are relatively limited in scope. AsSahil Kapur and Scott Wong note, three of them are measures to terminate regulations established by Biden. Another is a stopgap bill to keep the government funded for six months. And one is a strict immigration detention measure calledthe Laken Riley Act. While the government funding and immigration measures ultimately received some Democratic support, none of these measures were crafted on a bipartisan basis. Trump is expected to soon sign a sixth bill into law, the “Take It Down Act,” which criminalizes the publication of nonconsensual, sexually explicit images and videos, including those generated by artificial intelligence. The Houseoverwhelmingly passed itMonday night, sending it to Trump’s desk. And GOP lawmakers are working on crafting a multitrillion-dollar bill, which will include an extension of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, a boost in immigration enforcement and military spending, and a debt ceiling hike. “He hasn’t signed many bills into law because the agenda of the first 100 days has not been a legislative agenda at all,” said William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, a think tank in Washington, D.C. “Clearly, the administration, before it took office, planned a whirlwind of activity for the first 100 days at a pace that was compatible only with executive action. And this is part of an effort not only to overwhelm doubters and opponents through shock and awe tactics, but also to permanently expand executive power,” Galston said. “I would say that that is the most fundamental institutional objective of Donald Trump and his administration,” he added. Read more from Sahil and Scott → More on Trump’s first 100 days: As the 100th day of his new presidential term arrives, Donald Trump’s poll numbers look an awful lot like they did 100 days into his last one. His job approval rating, according to an average of 16 independent national polls conducted over the last two weeks, sits at 43%. That’s exactly where it sat in April of 2017, placing both Trump administrations at the bottom of the list of modern presidents at this same point. In his first term, there was limited fluctuation to Trump’s average daily approval rating. It dipped as low as 38% and reached as high as 47%. That’s a significantly narrower range than for any of his modern predecessors. So while his current mark is by no means strong, it’s also par for the course for a president who has won two of the three national elections he’s contested. In other words, these are numbers that Trump and his fellow Republicans are quite accustomed to. What is different from his first term, though, is how Americans view Trump’s handling of specific issues. Clearly, tariffs and inflation stand out as Trump’s biggest liabilities. This is in contrast to his first term, when Trump’s handling of the economy generally won him his highest marks from voters, and when inflation wasn’t pronounced enough to loom as a major concern in polling. That both inflation and the potential ripple effects of tariffs can be felt in voters’ wallets makes those numbers that much more ominous for Trump and his party. There’s another notable shift from Trump’s first term involving the opposition party. While Trump’s Republican Party is far from popular right now, Democrats actually are faring worse. In the average of recent national polls, 44% view the GOP favorably, while 55% view it unfavorably. But for Democrats, the split is 40% favorable and 59% unfavorable. During Trump’s first term, Democrats consistently rated higher than the GOP. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now. Today’s newsletter was compiled by Adam Wollner and Ben Kamisar.

    "article_text": "By Nga Pham Fifty years after the end of the war, Hanoi says nearly 200,000 Vietnamese soldiers are still missing. Some of their families are now calling on the U.S. to help find them. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:It's been 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War. Hanoi says nearly 200,000 Vietnamese soldiers are still unaccounted for. Some of their families are now calling on the U.S. to help find them. Journalist Nga Pham brings us the story.THANH NGUYEN: (Speaking Vietnamese, crying).NGA PHAM: Thanh Nguyen has never met her uncle Nguyen Duy Oanh, an army medic. Oanh was killed in action in Thua Thien Hue in Central Vietnam in 1972, long before Thanh was born. But growing up, Thanh heard so much about him from her family, that he was quiet, kind-hearted, and he looked exactly like her father. Oanh's body has never been recovered.NGUYEN: (Through interpreter) All we have is a notice about my uncle's death from the military and two handwritten letters from him. After the war, our family began searching for my uncle's remains. But so far, we haven't found anything. My aunts have all given up, but I still hope that one day I will find him. I am looking everywhere.PHAM: In Vietnam's ancestral worship culture, a person's dead body should be buried in their homeland near the ancestors, otherwise the soul will forever be lost and become a wandering ghost enduring eternal suffering. Thanh's biggest dream is to find her uncle's remains one day and to burn incense to bid a proper farewell to him.NGUYEN XUAN THANG: (Speaking Vietnamese).PHAM: Nguyen Xuan Thang, an architect, has been looking for Vietnamese missing war dead for almost 20 years. Thang himself has an uncle who was killed in action in 1968 and is still missing. He receives no money from the government, but he says that funding is not the biggest challenge.THANG: (Through interpreter) The biggest difficulty is information and witnesses. Until now, we rely a great deal on people who saw the fighting and what they remember. But their memories are dwindling, and they themselves are passing away. Burial sites have also been removed because of economic development.(SOUNDBITE OF BOMBS EXPLODING)PHAM: After battles, the bodies of killed soldiers - often just pieces of burnt flesh and bones - were gathered and buried all together in mass graves. But even after they were excavated, the identification was difficult because, unlike the Americans, Vietnamese soldiers were not issued identification tags. A national committee was only set up two years ago to consolidate and lead the searches, but results have been limited due to the lack of resources, both in locating and identifying the remains. There have also been complaints about red tape and corruption.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Order. Oh (ph).PHAM: On April 19, the remains of four American soldiers missing in action, or MIAs, were repatriated in a ceremony in the central city of Da Nang. The U.S. government has spent millions of dollars to look for their missing personnel from the war. In Vietnam, families of missing soldiers often wage their own campaigns with the help of their communities. Some, including Thanh, are now calling on the U.S. to step in because of its involvement in the war.NGUYEN: (Through interpreter) The war ended a long time ago, but the pain remains. I think the U.S. government should look at this issue and help the Vietnamese people find closure of the painful past.PHAM: Since Vietnam and the U.S. normalized their relations in 1995, many American veterans have returned to hand over artifacts and documents. Nguyen Xuan Thang says it offered a much appreciated, albeit delayed, consolation to some families, but many are still waiting.For NPR News, I'm Nga Pham in Ho Chi Minh City.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.

I think the U.S. government should look at this issue and help the Vietnamese people find closure of the painful past.PHAM: Since Vietnam and the U.S. normalized their relations in 1995, many American veterans have returned to hand over artifacts and documents. Nguyen Xuan Thang says it offered a much appreciated, albeit delayed, consolation to some families, but many are still waiting.For NPR News, I'm Nga Pham in Ho Chi Minh City.(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)Copyright © 2025 NPR.

After the war, our family began searching for my uncle's remains. But so far, we haven't found anything. My aunts have all given up, but I still hope that one day I will find him. I am looking everywhere.PHAM: In Vietnam's ancestral worship culture, a person's dead body should be buried in their homeland near the ancestors, otherwise the soul will forever be lost and become a wandering ghost enduring eternal suffering. Thanh's biggest dream is to find her uncle's remains one day and to burn incense to bid a proper farewell to him.NGUYEN XUAN THANG: (Speaking Vietnamese).PHAM: Nguyen Xuan Thang, an architect, has been looking for Vietnamese missing war dead for almost 20 years. Thang himself has an uncle who was killed in action in 1968 and is still missing. He receives no money from the government, but he says that funding is not the biggest challenge.THANG: (Through interpreter) The biggest difficulty is information and witnesses. Until now, we rely a great deal on people who saw the fighting and what they remember. But their memories are dwindling, and they themselves are passing away. Burial sites have also been removed because of economic development.(SOUNDBITE OF BOMBS EXPLODING)PHAM: After battles, the bodies of killed soldiers - often just pieces of burnt flesh and bones - were gathered and buried all together in mass graves. But even after they were excavated, the identification was difficult because, unlike the Americans, Vietnamese soldiers were not issued identification tags. A national committee was only set up two years ago to consolidate and lead the searches, but results have been limited due to the lack of resources, both in locating and identifying the remains. There have also been complaints about red tape and corruption.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Order. Oh (ph).PHAM: On April 19, the remains of four American soldiers missing in action, or MIAs, were repatriated in a ceremony in the central city of Da Nang. The U.S. government has spent millions of dollars to look for their missing personnel from the war.

    "title": "Why Google's search engine trial is about AI",
    "article_text": "Jaclyn Diaz An illustration photograph taken on Feb. 20, 2025 shows Grok, DeepSeek and ChatGPT apps displayed on a phone screen. The Justice Department's 2020 complaint against Google has few mentions of artificial intelligence or AI chatbots. But nearly five years later, as the remedy phase of the trial enters its second week of testimony, the focus has shifted to AI.Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption When the U.S. Department of Justice originallybrought—and then won— its case against Google, arguing that the tech behemoth monopolized the search engine market, the focus was on, well … search. Back then, in 2020, the government's antitrust complaint against Google had few mentions of artificial intelligence or AI chatbots. But nearly five years later, asthe remedy phase of the trialenters its second week of testimony, the focus has shifted to AI, underscoring just how quickly this emerging technology has expanded. In the past few days, before a federal judge who willassess penalties against Google, the DOJ has argued that the company could use its artificial intelligence products to strengthen its monopoly in online search — and to use the data from its powerful search index to become the dominant player in AI. In his opening statements last Monday, David Dahlquist, the acting deputy director of the DOJ's antitrust civil litigation division, argued that the court should consider remedies that could nip a potentialGoogle AI monopoly in the bud. \"This court's remedy should be forward-looking and not ignore what is on the horizon,\" he said. Dahlquist argued that Google has created a system in which its control of search helps improve its AI products, sending more users back to Google search — creating a cycle that maintains the tech company's dominance and blocks competitors out of both marketplaces. The integration of search and Gemini, the company's AI chatbot — which the DOJ sees as powerful fuel for this cycle — is a big focus of the government's proposed remedies. The DOJ is arguing that to be most effective, those remedies must addressallways users access Google search, so any penalties approved by the court that don't include Gemini (or other Google AI products now or in the future) would undermine their broader efforts. Department of Justice lawyer David Dahlquist leaves the Washington, D.C. federal courthouse on Sept. 20, 2023 during the original trial phase of the antitrust case against Google.Jose Luis Magana/AP/FR159526 APhide caption AI and search are connected like this: Search engine indices are essentially giant databases of pages and information on the web. Google has its own such index, which contains hundreds of billions of webpages and is over 100,000,000 gigabytes, according to court documents. This is the data Google's search engine scans when responding to a user's query. AI developers can use these kinds of databases to build and train the models used to power chatbots. In court, attorneys for the DOJ have argued that Google's Gemini pulls information from the company's search index, including citing search links and results, extending what they say is a self-serving cycle. They argue that Google's ability to monopolize the search market gives it user data, at a huge scale — an advantage over other AI developers. The Justice Department argues Google's monopoly over search could have a direct effect on the development of generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that uses existing data to create new content like text, videos or photos, based on a user's prompts or questions. Last week, the government called executives from several major AI companies, like OpenAI and Perplexity, in an attempt to argue that Google's stranglehold on search is preventing some of those companies from truly growing. The government argues that to level the playing field, Google should be forced to open its search data — like users' search queries, clicks and results — and license it to other competitors at a cost. This is on top of demands related to Google's search engine business, most notably that it should be forced tosell off its Chrome browser. Google flatly rejects the argument that it could monopolize the field of generative AI, saying competition in the AI race is healthy. Ina recent blog poston Google's website, Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote that since the federal judge first ruled against Google over a year ago, \"AI has already rapidly reshaped the industry, with new entrants and new ways of finding information, making it even more competitive.\" In court, Google's lawyers have argued that there are a host of AI companies with chatbots — some of which are outperforming Gemini. OpenAI has ChatGPT, Meta has MetaAI and Perplexity has Perplexity AI. \"There is no shortage of competition in that market, and ChatGPT and Meta are way ahead of everybody in terms of the distribution and usage at this point,\" said John E. Schmidtlein, a lawyer for Google, during his opening statement. \"But don't take my word for it. Look at the data. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of downloads by ChatGPT.\" It should be no surprise that AI is coming up so much at this point in the trial, said Alissa Cooper, the executive director of the Knight-Georgetown Institute, a nonpartisan tech research and policy center at Georgetown University focusing on AI, disinformation and data privacy. \"If you look at search as a product today, you can't really think about search without thinking about AI,\" she said. \"I think the case is a really great opportunity to try to … analyze how Google has benefited specifically from the monopoly that it has in search, and ensure that the behavior that led to that can't be used to gain an unfair advantage in these other markets which are more nascent.\" Having access to Google's data, she said, \"would provide them with the ability to build better chatbots, build better search engines, and potentially build other products that we haven't even thought of.\" To make that point, the DOJ called Nick Turley, OpenAI's head of product for ChatGPT, to the stand last Tuesday. During a long day of testimony, Turley detailed how without access to Google's search index and data, engineers for the growing company tried to build their own. ChatGPT, a large language model that can generate human-like responses, engage in conversations and perform tasks like explaining a tough-to-understand math lesson, was never intended to be a product for OpenAI, Turley said. But once it launched and went viral, the company found that people were using it for a host of needs. Though popular, ChatGPT had its drawbacks, like the bot's limited \"knowledge,\" Turley said. Early on, ChatGPT was not connected to the internet and could only use information that it had been fed up to a certain point in its training. For example, Turley said, if a user asked \"Who is the president?\" the program would give a 2022 answer — from when its \"knowledge\" effectively stopped. OpenAI couldn't build their own index fast enough to address their problems; they found that process incredibly expensive, time consuming and potentially years from coming to fruition, Turley said. So instead, they sought a partnership with a third party search provider. At one point, OpenAI tried to make a deal with Google to gain access to their search, but Google declined, seeing OpenAI as a direct competitor, Turley testified. But Google says companies like OpenAI are doing just fine without gaining access to the tech giant's own technology — which it spent decades developing. These companies just want \"handouts,\" said Schmidtlein. On the third day of the remedy trial, internal Google documents shared in court by the company's lawyers compared how many people are using Gemini versus its competitors. According to those documents, ChatGPT and MetaAI are the two leaders, with Gemini coming in third. They showed that this March, Gemini saw 35 million active daily users and 350 million monthly active users worldwide. That was up from 9 million daily active users in October 2024. But according to those documents, Gemini was still lagging behind ChatGPT, which reached 160 million daily users and around 600 million active users in March. These numbers show that competitors have no need to use Google's search data, valuable intellectual property that the tech giant spent decades building and maintaining, the company argues. \"The notion that somehow ChatGPT can't get distribution is absurd,\" Schmidtlein said in court last week. \"They have more distribution than anyone.\" In hisruling last year, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said Google's exclusive agreements with device makers, like Apple and Samsung, to make its search engine the default on those companies' phones helped maintain its monopoly. It remains a core issue for this remedy trial. Now, the DOJ is arguing that Google's deals with device manufacturers are also directly affecting AI companies and AI tech. In court, the DOJ argued that Google hasreplicated this kind of distribution dealbyagreeing to pay Samsungwhat Dahlquist called a monthly \"enormous sum\" for Gemini to be installed on smartphones and other devices. Last Wednesday, the DOJ also called Dmitry Shevelenko, Perplexity's chief business officer, to testify that Google has effectively cut his company out from making deals with manufacturers and mobile carriers. Perplexity AIs not preloaded on any mobile devices in the U.S., despite many efforts to get phone companies to establish Perplexity as a default or exclusive app on devices, Shevelenko said. He compared Google's control in that space to that of a \"mob boss.\" But Google's attorney, Christopher Yeager, noted in questioning Shevelenko that Perplexity has reached a valuation of over $9 billion — insinuating the company is doing just fine in the marketplace. Despite testifying in court (for which he was subpoenaed, Shevelenko noted), he and other leaders at Perplexity are against the breakup of Google. Ina statement on the company's website, the Perplexity team wrote that neither forcing Google to sell off Chrome nor to license search data to its competitors are the best solutions. \"Neither of these address the root issue: consumers deserve choice,\" they wrote. Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai departs federal court after testifying in October 2023 in Washington, DC. Pichai testified to defend his company in the original antitrust trial. Pichai is expected to testify again during the remedy phase of the legal proceedings.Drew Angerer/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption This week the trial continues, with the DOJ calling its final witnesses this morning to testify about the feasibility of a Chrome divestiture and how the government's proposed remedies would help rivals compete. On Tuesday afternoon, Google will begin presenting its case, which is expected to feature the testimony of CEO Sundar Pichai, although the date of his appearance has not been specified. Closing arguments are expected at the end of May, and then Mehta will make his ruling. Google says once this phase is settled the company will appeal Mehta's ruling in the underlying case. Whatever Mehta decides in this remedy phase, Cooper thinks it will have effects beyond just the business of search engines. No matter what it is, she said, \"it will be having some kind of impact on AI.\" Google is a financial supporter of NPR. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Rebecca Hersher Flood waters in Tarpon Springs, Fla., after Hurricane Helene passed offshore in September 2024. Sea level rise due to climate change means coastal flooding is worse, and happens more often. The White House has dismissed approximately 400 scientists and other climate experts who were working on a major report about how climate change affects the U.S.Joe Raedle/Getty Images North Americahide caption The Trump Administration has dismissed the scientists working on the country's flagship climate report, a move that threatens to curtail climate science and make information about global warming less available to the public. TheNational Climate Assessmentis the most trustworthy and comprehensive source of information about how global warming affects the United States. Itanswers common questionsabout how quickly sea levels are rising near American cities, how much rain is normal for different regions and how to deal with wildfire smoke exposure. The assessment is mandated by Congress, and its sixth edition was supposed to be released in late 2027. About 400 volunteer authors had already started work. They included top scientists as well as economists, tribal leaders and climate experts from non-profit groups and corporations. On Tuesday, the authors received an email releasing them from their roles, and saying \"the scope of the [National Climate Assessment] is currently being reevaluated.\" The White House did not respond to questions about why the authors were dismissed or what elements of the report's scope are being reassessed. \"I think the reason that Americans should be upset, and should be concerned about this decision, is because it's more than just a report,\" says Dave White, a sustainability researcher at Arizona State University who has worked on two previous editions of the National Climate Assessment. The assessment is widely used by everyone from city planners to farmers to judges. \"For example, city water utilities [use it] as they prepare to address the impacts of sustained drought,\" White says. And \"it informs elementary schools as they develop heat mitigation plans to reduce the risks of extreme heat on children.\" The last edition of the climate assessment, which was released in late 2023, also included an online atlas that allowed anyone to zoom in and see how climate change will affect their local community. \"It's important to understand what and who is at risk,\" explains Rachel Cleetus of the Union of Concerned Scientists, one of the authors who was dismissed. \"Not just in a general sense, but in a very localized sense. Without that information, we'd be flying blind.\" For example, Cleetus was supposed to work on the assessment chapter about sea level rise and other coastal effects of a warmer planet. Sea level rise is accelerating overall, but the water is rising radically different amounts in different cities around the U.S. Congress requires that the National Climate Assessment come out every four years, although it has not always been published on time under previous Republican administrations. In 2008, the George W. Bush administration released an edition of the assessment four years late, and only after it was compelled to do so by a lawsuit. And there were signs even before President Trump took office that his administration might seek to undermine the latest edition of the assessment. Russell Vought, who now leads the White House Office of Management and Budget, previously advocated for major changes to the office that oversees the National Climate Assessment.

    "article_text": "By Rachel Treisman Military personnel of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion take part in a parade in honor of Joan d'Arc in Rouen, France, 1945. The predominantly-Black Six Triple Eight was the only all-female unit to serve overseas in WWII.Archive Photos/Getty Imageshide caption The only female unit to serve overseas in World War II is receiving a Congressional Gold Medal on Tuesday, exactly 80 years after pulling off an incredible organizational feat. The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion — nicknamed the Six Triple Eight — was a predominantly Black, all-female unit that was deployed to Europe towards the end of the war to tackle a burgeoning crisis: a backlog of some 17 million pieces of undelivered mail. When the women arrived in Birmingham, England, in February 1945, they were greeted by multiple warehouses full of mail addressed to the roughly 7 million American soldiers and government personnel stationed across Europe, many of whom were frustrated because they hadn't received any letters for months or even years. There was so much mail that one general estimated it would take the unit six months to sort and deliver it all, according to theNational Museum of the United States Army. But the Six Triple Eight — whose motto was \"no mail, low morale\" — managed to do it in half the time, even in harsh conditions. After their success in Birmingham — and the end of the war in Europe — the unit accomplished similar missions in Rouen and Paris, France. And while the unit's members received several medals upon its return to the U.S. in 1946, there wasno welcoming ceremonyor public recognition of their service. House Speaker Mike Johnson (right) presents the Congressional Gold Medal for the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion to Stanley Earley III, the son of battalion commander Maj. Charity Adams, during a ceremony in Emancipation Hall on Tuesday in Washington, D.C.Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Imageshide caption The story of the Six Triple Eight hasgotten more attentionover the decades, including a 2019 Meritorious Unit Commendation from the U.S. Armed Forces, a2024 filmand a yearslong campaign to recognize its members with a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian award given by Congress. The Senate voted on legislation to bestow the award in 2021, and the House unanimously followed suit a year later. Then-President Joe Biden signed the act into law in 2022. \"It never occurred to me that it would happen,\" retired Major Fannie McClendon, one of the two surviving veterans of the 855-person unit,said at the time. However, because of the time required to design andproduce the actual medal, the ceremony in the U.S. Capitol wasn't on the books until recently. Earlier this year, over a dozen senators wrote House Speaker Mike Johnsona letterurging him to \"swiftly\" schedule the medal ceremony and warning of a \"critical juncture.\" \"Today, only two members of the Six Triple Eight are known to be alive,\" they wrote. \"Those still surviving ought to not wait any longer to receive this long-awaited recognition they rightfully deserve.\" In the weeks leading up to Tuesday's ceremony, supporters had even more reason to grow antsy about the lack of recognition. A webpage about the Six Triple Eight appeared to beamong those purgedin the Department of Defense's push toundo diversity, equity and inclusionefforts. NPRreported in mid-Marchthat the unit's story was no longer prominent on the Arlington National Cemetery website, but still findable using the search function. The Department of Veterans Affairssays that14 of the unit's members are interred at Arlington National Cemetery, while 32 are interred in VA national or state veteran's cemeteries across the country. The Department of Defense hassince restoredsome of the entries it removed. Rep. Deborah Ross, D-N.C.,wrote a letterto Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in early April demanding all webpages be restored, including that of the Six Triple Eight. \"Erasing this extraordinary legacy is an egregious betrayal of their service,\" Ross wrote, calling it disrespectful to all veterans. \"This timing is especially egregious when the country is just starting to appreciate the story of the 6888th.\" The Department of Defense has not responded to NPR's request for comment. The Department of the Army, which runs Arlington National Cemetery, told NPR over email on Tuesday that no profiles of individuals laid to rest there have been permanently deleted from its website, only recategorized. The page for the Six Triple Eight is nowlisted under\"Prominent Military Figures.\" American Women's Army Corps (WAC) Captain Mary Kearney and American WAC Commanding Officer Major Charity Adams inspect the first arrivals to the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion at a temporary post in Birmingham, West Midlands, England, in February 1945.Archive Photos/Getty Imageshide caption Black women were virtually excluded from military service until the start of World War II, which prompted the creation of what came to be known as the Women's Army Corps (WAC). While the WAC opened up opportunities for women in non-combat roles, segregation policies of the time meant that Black WACs could only make up a maximum of 10% of the overall force, the National Museum of the United States Army explains. The U.S. Army was not fully integrated until 1948. Only about 6,500 of the 140,000 women who served in the WAC during World War II were Black, according to theDepartment of Defense. Black organizations and civil rights figures, like Mary McLeod Bethune, pushed for Black women in the WAC to get the same opportunity to serve overseas. Under mounting pressure — and a growing backlog of mail — the War Department created the 6888th in 1944. \"They kept hollering about wanting us to go overseas so I guess they found something for us to do overseas: Take care of the mail,\" McClendon toldthe Associated Press. \"And there was an awful lot of mail.\" The battalion included five companies, commanded by Maj. Charity Adams, who became the highest-ranking Black Army officer during the war. While the Six Triple Eight has often been called an all-Black unit, it hadat least twomembers of Mexican and Puerto Rican descent. After several weeks of training, the women sailed to Scotland — where they were forced to run for cover upon arrival when a German rocket exploded near their dock — and then took a train to Birmingham to begin sorting mail and boosting morale. The battalion was greeted by dimly lit warehouses stacked floor-to-ceiling with undelivered mail, including six airplane hangars full of returned Christmas presents, according to the DoD. They found rats eating packages of sweets meant for soldiers, mail that had bounced back as troops changed locations and a maze of recipients with similar or identical names: The DoD cites reports that there were 7,500 men named Robert Smith. The unit broke into three eight-hour shifts and worked seven days a week. They came up with a system that involved creating and updating millions of locator cards with the serial numbers and locations of American personnel in Europe, searching for clues to suss out intended recipients. Adams estimated in her 1989 autobiography,One Woman's Army: A Black Officer Remembers the WAC, that the unit averaged 65,000 pieces of mail per shift. On top of the task at hand, the women of the Six Triple Eight also confronted sexism and racism during their time overseas. They were not allowed into a local club for enlisted soldiers, and Adams led a boycott of the alternative segregated facilities they were offered, according to the National Park Service. \"They decided to run their own food hall, hair salon, and refreshment bar,\" it says. \"The women were subjected to slander spread about by male soldiers who resented that Black women were allowed in the Army.\" Some Black male service members wrongly assumed the women of the unit had been sent to Europe to provide companionship, the DoD says, a notion they \"quickly set straight.\" Some of the Six Triple Eight's recreational basketball players were invited to play on an Army all-star team, but uninvited when the Army learned of their race. And when three members of the unit died in a Jeep crash, the War Department didn't provide funds for their funerals — the rest of the women collected the money themselves. Upon the unit's arrival in France, it drew attention from Black and white service members, who — as Adams later recalled — \"suddenly found that they had business in Rouen.\" They had to increase security around their compound. With the help of French civilians and German prisoners of war, the unit was able to clear a similar-sized backlog of mail in just five months. In October, the downsized unit — about 300 members had been discharged by then — was sent to Paris to continue the work. The remaining soldiers were sent back to the U.S. in February 1946, where they received the European African Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, the Women's Army Corps Service Medal, and the World War II Victory Medal. \"The unit was disbanded at Fort Dix, New Jersey without any further ceremony,\" reads the website of the National Museum of the United States Army. The museum notes that while the Six Triple Eight may not have been celebrated with parades or public recognition, their achievements prompted the General Board of the U.S. Forces European Theater to recommend the \"continued use\" of female soldiers of color, \"along with white, female military personnel ... in such strength as proportionally appropriate.\" Part of the first Black WAC members pose at Camp Shanks, N.Y., before heading overseas in February 1945.ASSOCIATED PRESS/Associated Presshide caption Over the decades, members of the Six Triple Eight — and increasingly, their surviving family members — gained more recognition for their groundbreaking service. Some of the women returned to England in 1981 to be honored by Birmingham's mayor. Adams released her memoir eight years later and was honored by the Smithsonian Institution National Postal Museum the following decade. A monument in the unit's honor wasestablished at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in 2018. Their legacy has also been honored in books and movies, including a2019 documentaryand a2024 movie, directed by Tyler Perry and starring Kerry Washington as Adams. \"These women were fighting for a country that wasn't always fighting for them, but they believed in the seed of what this democracy could be,\" Washington toldNPR'sMorning Editionin 2024. \"And they believed in their own capacity to create important change.\" Washington and Perry said they worked with a veteran of the unit, Lena King, to better understand the women's experiences during the war — and why some were ashamed to discuss their experiences afterward. One Florida woman who will be attending Tuesday's ceremony only learned last year that her late mother was in the battalion, asSpectrum News 13 reported. Kingdied in January2024 at age 100. Years earlier, she was already one of the few surviving unit members who could weigh in on its upcoming congressional honor. \"I wish more of the 6888th members were here, and I hope that I'm still here when President Biden signs the bill,\" she said in a2022 releasefrom the office of Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan. \"That will be a great day.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Laptops with Core Ultra 200V chips CPUs Arc 130V or 140V GPUs should benefit. Intel's oddball Core Ultra 200V laptop chips—codenamed Lunar Lake—will apparently be a one-off experiment, not to be replicated in future Intel laptop chips. They're Intel's only processors with memory integrated onto the CPU package; the only ones with a neural processing unit that meets Microsoft's Copilot+ performance requirements; and the only ones with Intel's best-performing integrated GPUs, the Intel Arc 130V and 140V. Today, Intelannouncedsome updates to its graphics driver that specifically benefit those integrated GPUs, welcome news for anyone who bought one and is trying to get by with it as an entry-level gaming system. Intel says that version 32.0.101.6734 of its graphics driver can speed up average frame rates in some games by around 10 percent, and can speed up \"1 percent low FPS\" (that is, for any given frames per second measurement, whatever your frame rate is the slowest 1 percent of the time) by as much as 25 percent. This should, in theory, make games run better in general and ease some of the stuttering you notice when your game's performance dips down to that 1 percent level. Intel's performance comparisons were made using an MSI Claw 7 AI+ using an Arc 140V GPU, and they compare the performance of driver version 32.0.101.6732 (released April 2) to version 32.0.101.6734 (released April 8). The two additional driver packages Intel has released since then will contain the improvements, too. Intel says these drivers primarily help performance when the chip is running \"at or under the common default power level of 17 W,\" which could explain why the company isn't advertising similar performance gains for theIntel Arc B580orB570, its desktop GPUs built using the same graphics architecture. Dedicated desktop GPUs obviously have a bigger power budget than a small integrated GPU that's sharing space and power with the CPU cores and everything else that's included in a modern CPU package, so the optimizations in the new driver may not matter as much. Intel's latest graphics drivers are available for all Arc A- and B-series desktop and mobile GPUs, as well as the integrated Iris Xe, Arc, and UHD Graphics GPUs included in 11th-generation Core processors and newer. Anyone should be able to install and usethe generic drivers from Intel's site, but laptop users in particular may notice instability or wake/sleep issues compared to the driver that your computer manufacturer has tested and validated. Intel says computer manufacturers will release validated drivers with the performance improvements \"over the coming months.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "OpenAI rolls back update that made ChatGPT a sycophantic mess",
    "article_text": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says the super-positive update to GPT-4o is being pulled. ChatGPT users have become frustrated with the AI model's tone, and OpenAI is taking action. After widespread mockery of the robot'srelentlessly positive and complimentary outputrecently, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirms the company will roll back the latest update to GPT-4o. So get ready for a more reserved and less sycophantic chatbot, at least for now. GPT-4o is not a new model—OpenAI released it almost a year ago, and it remains the default when you access ChatGPT, but the company occasionally releases revised versions of existing models. As people interact with the chatbot, OpenAI gathers data on the responses people like more. Then, engineers revise the production model using a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Recently, however, that reinforcement learning went off the rails. The AI went from generally positive to the world's biggest suck-up. Users could present ChatGPT with completely terrible ideas or misguided claims, and it might respond, \"Wow, you're a genius,\" and \"This is on a whole different level.\" OpenAI seems to realize it missed the mark with its latest update, so it's undoing the damage.Altman saysthe company began pulling the latest 4o model last night, and the process is already done for free users. As for paid users, the company is still working on it, but the reversion should be finished later today (April 29). Altman promises to share an update once that's done. This move comes just a few days after Altman acknowledged that recent updates to the model made its personality \"too sycophant-y and annoying.\" OpenAI, along with competitors like Google and Anthropic, is trying to build chatbots that people want to chat with. So, designing the model's apparent personality to be positive and supportive makes sense—people are less likely to use an AI that comes off as harsh or dismissive. For lack of a better word, it's increasingly aboutvibemarking. When Googlerevealed Gemini 2.5, the team crowed about how the model topped the LM Arena leaderboard, which lets people choose between two different model outputs in a blinded test. The models people like more end up at the top of the list, suggesting they are more pleasant to use. Of course, people can like outputs for different reasons—maybe one is more technically accurate, or the layout is easier to read. But overall, people like models that make them feel good. The same is true of OpenAI's internal model tuning work, it would seem. It's possible this pursuit of good vibes is pushing models to display more sycophantic behaviors, which is a problem. Anthropic's Alex Albert has cited this as a \"toxic feedback loop.\" An AI chatbot telling you that you're a world-class genius who sees the unseen might not be damaging if you're just brainstorming. However, the model's unending praise can lead people who are using AI to plan business ventures or, heaven forbid,enact sweeping tariffs, to be fooled into thinking they've stumbled onto something important. In reality, the model has just become so sycophantic that it loves everything. The constant pursuit of engagement has been a detriment to numerous products in the Internet era, and it seems generative AI is not immune. OpenAI's GPT-4o update is a testament to that, but hopefully, this can serve as a reminder for the developers of generative AI that good vibes are not all that matters.

    "title": "Google search’s made-up AI explanations for sayings no one ever said, explained",
    "article_text": "A partial defense of (some of) AI Overview's fanciful idiomatic explanations. Last week, the phrase \"You can't lick a badger twice\"unexpectedly went viralon social media. The nonsense sentence—which was likely never uttered by a human before last week—had become the poster childfor the newly discovered wayGoogle search's AI Overviewsmakes up plausible-sounding explanations for made-up idioms (though the conceptseems to predate that specific viral postby at least a few days). Google users quickly discovered that typing any concocted phrase into the search bar with the word \"meaning\" attached at the end would generate an AI Overview with a purported explanation of its idiomatic meaning. Even the most nonsensical attempts at new proverbs resulted in a confident explanation from Google's AI Overview, created right there on the spot. In the wake of the \"lick a badger\" post,countless usersflocked tosocial mediatoshare Google's AI interpretationsoftheir own made-up idioms, often expressing horror or disbelief at Google's take on their nonsense. Those posts often highlight the overconfident way the AI Overview frames its idiomatic explanations and occasional problems with the model confabulating sources that don't exist. But after reading through dozens of publicly shared examples of Google's explanations for fake idioms—and generating a few of my own—I've come away somewhat impressed with the model's almost poetic attempts to glean meaning from gibberish and make sense out of the senseless. Let's try a thought experiment: Say a child asked you what the phrase \"you can't lick a badger twice\" means. You'd probably say you've never heard that particular phrase or ask the child where they heard it. You might say that you're not familiar with that phrase or that it doesn't really make sense without more context. Someone on Threads noticed you can type any random sentence into Google, then add “meaning” afterwards, and you’ll get an AI explanation of a famous idiom or phrase you just made up. Here is mine [image or embed] — Greg Jenner (@gregjenner.bsky.social)April 23, 2025 at 6:15 AM But let's say the child persisted and really wanted an explanation for what the phrase means. So you'd do your best to generate a plausible-sounding answer. You'd search your memory for possible connotations for the word \"lick\" and/or symbolic meaning for the noble badger to force the idiom into some semblance of sense. You'd reach back to other similar idioms you know to try to fit this new, unfamiliar phrase into a wider pattern (anyone who has played the excellent board gameWise and Otherwisemight be familiar with the process). Google's AI Overview doesn't go through exactly that kind of human thought process when faced with a similar question about the same saying. But in its own way, the large language model also does its best to generate a plausible-sounding response to an unreasonable request. As seen inGreg Jenner's viral Bluesky post, Google's AI Overview suggests that \"you can't lick a badger twice\" means that \"you can't trick or deceive someone a second time after they've been tricked once. It's a warning that if someone has already been deceived, they are unlikely to fall for the same trick again.\" As an attempt to derive meaning from a meaningless phrase —which was, after all, the user's request—that's not half bad. Faced with a phrase that has no inherent meaning, the AI Overview still makes a good-faith effort to answer the user's request and draw some plausible explanation out of troll-worthy nonsense. Contrary to the computer science truism of\"garbage in, garbage out, Google here is taking in some garbage and spitting out... well, a workable interpretation of garbage, at the very least. Google's AI Overview even goes into more detail explaining its thought process. \"Lick\" here means to \"trick or deceive\" someone, it says, a bit of a stretch from the dictionary definition of lick as \"comprehensively defeat,\" but probably close enough for an idiom (and a plausible iteration ofthe idiom, \"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me...\"). Google also explains that the badger part of the phrase \"likely originates from the historical sport of badger baiting,\" a practice I was sure Google was hallucinating untilI looked it up and found it was real. I found plenty of other examples where Google's AI derived more meaning than the original requester's gibberish probably deserved. Googleinterprets the phrase \"dream makes the steam\"as an almost poetic statement about imagination powering innovation. The line \"you can't humble a tortoise\"similarly gets interpretedas a statement about the difficulty of intimidating \"someone with a strong, steady, unwavering character (like a tortoise).\" Google also often finds connections that the original nonsense idiom creators likely didn't intend. For instance, Googlecould linkthe made-up idiom \"A deft cat always rings the bell\" tothe real concept of belling the cat. And in attempting tointerpretthe nonsense phrase \"two cats are better than grapes,\" the AI Overviewcorrectly notesthat grapes can be potentially toxic to cats. Even when Google's AI Overview works hard to make the best of a bad prompt, I can still understand why the responses rub a lot of users the wrong way. A lot of the problem, I think, has to do with the LLM's unearned confident tone, which pretends that any made-up idiom is a common saying with a well-established and authoritative meaning. Rather than framing its responses as a \"best guess\" at an unknown phrase (as a human might when responding to a child in the example above), Google generally provides the user with a single, authoritative explanation for what an idiom means, full stop. Even with the occasional use of couching words such as \"likely,\" \"probably,\" or \"suggests,\" the AI Overview comes off as unnervingly sure of the accepted meaning for some nonsense the user made up five seconds ago. I was able to find one exception to this in my testing. When I asked Google the meaning of \"when you see a tortoise, spin in a circle,\" Google reasonably told me that the phrase \"doesn't have a widely recognized, specific meaning\" and that it's \"not a standard expression with a clear, universal meaning.\" With that context, Google then offered suggestions for what the phrase \"seems to\" mean and mentioned Japanese nursery rhymes that it \"may be connected\" to, before concluding that it is \"open to interpretation.\" Those qualifiers go a long way toward properly contextualizing the guesswork Google's AI Overview is actually conducting here. And if Google provided that kind of context in every AI summary explanation of a made-up phrase, I don't think users would be quite as upset. Unfortunately, LLMs like thishave trouble knowing what they don't know, meaning moments of self-doubt like the turtle interpretation here tend to be few and far between. It's not like Google's language model has some master list of idioms in its neural network that it can consult to determine what is and isn't a \"standard expression\" that it can be confident about. Usually, it's just projecting a self-assured tone while struggling to force the user's gibberish into meaning. The worst examples of Google's idiomatic AI guesswork are ones where the LLM slips past plausible interpretations and into sheer hallucination of completely fictional sources. The phrase \"a dog never dances before sunset,\" for instance, did not appear in the filmBefore Sunrise,no matter what Google says. Similarly, \"There are always two suns on Tuesday\"does not appear inThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxyfilmdespite Google's insistence. Literally in the one I tried. [image or embed] — Sarah Vaughan (@madamefelicie.bsky.social)April 23, 2025 at 7:52 AM There's also no indication that the made-up phrase\"Welsh men jump the rabbit\"originated on the Welsh island of Portland, or that\"peanut butter platform heels\"refers to a scientific experiment creating diamonds from the sticky snack. We're also unaware of any Greek myth where Zeus disguises himself as a golden shower to explain the phrase\"beware what glitters in a golden shower.\"(Update: As many commenters have pointed out, this last one is actually a reference tothe greek myth of Danaë and the shower of gold, showing Google's AI knows more about this potential symbolism than I do) The fact that Google's AI Overview presents these completely made-up sources with the same self-assurance as its abstract interpretations is a big part of the problem here. It's also a persistent problem for LLMs that tend tomake up news sourcesandcite fake legal casesregularly. As usual, one should be very wary when trusting anything an LLM presents as an objective fact. When it comes to the more artistic and symbolic interpretation of nonsense phrases, though, I think Google's AI Overviews have gotten something of a bad rap recently. Presented with the difficult task of explaining nigh-unexplainable phrases, the model does its best, generating interpretations that can border on the profound at times. While the authoritative tone of those responses can sometimes be annoying or actively misleading, it's at least amusing to see the model's best attempts to deal with our meaningless phrases.

    "title": "FCC urges courts to ignore 5th Circuit ruling that agency can’t issue fines",
    "article_text": "One court said FCC violated right to trial, but other courts haven't ruled yet. The Federal Communications Commission is urging two federal appeals courts to disregard a 5th Circuit ruling that guts the agency's ability to issue financial penalties. On April 17, the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuitgranted an AT&T requestto wipe out a$57 million finefor selling customer location data without consent. The conservative 5th Circuit court said the FCC \"acted as prosecutor, jury, and judge,\" violating AT&T's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. The ruling wasn't a major surprise. The 5th Circuit said it was guided by the Supreme Court's June 2024rulinginSecurities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy, which held that \"when the SEC seeks civil penalties against a defendant for securities fraud, the Seventh Amendment entitles the defendant to a jury trial.\" After the Supreme Court'sJarkesyruling, FCC Republican Nathan Simingtonvowedto vote against any fine imposed by the commission until its legal powers are clear. Before becoming the FCC chairman, Brendan Carrvoted againstthe fine issued to AT&T and fines for similar privacy violations simultaneously levied against T-Mobile and Verizon. Carr repeatedly opposed Biden-era efforts to regulate telecom providers and is aiming toeliminate many of the FCC's rulesnow that he is in charge. But Carr has also been aggressive inregulation of media, and he doesn't want the FCC's ability to issue penalties completely wiped out. The Carr FCC stated its position in new briefs submitted in separate lawsuits filed by T-Mobile and Verizon. Verizon sued the FCC in the 2nd Circuit in an attempt to overturn its privacy fine, while T-Mobile and subsidiary Sprint sued in the District of Columbia Circuit. Verizon and T-Mobile reacted to the 5th Circuit ruling by urging the other courts to rule the same way, prompting responses from the FCC last week. \"The Fifth Circuit concluded that the FCC's enforcement proceeding leading to a monetary forfeiture order violated AT&T's Seventh Amendment rights. This Court shouldn't follow that decision,\" the FCCtold the 2nd Circuitlast week. Carr's FCC argued that the agency's \"monetary forfeiture order proceedings pose no Seventh Amendment problem becauseSection 504(a)[of the Communications Act] affords carriers the opportunity to demand a de novo jury trial in federal district court before the government can recover any penalty. Verizon elected to forgo that opportunity and instead sought direct appellate review.\" The FCC put forth the same argument in the T-Mobile case with afilingin the District of Columbia Circuit. There would be a circuit split if either the 2nd Circuit or DC Circuit appeals court rules in the FCC's favor, increasing the chances that the Supreme Court will take up the case and rule directly on the FCC's enforcement authority. Beyond punishing telecom carriers for privacy violations, an FCC loss could prevent the commission from fining robocallers. When Carr's FCCproposeda $4.5 million fine for an allegedly illegal robocall scheme in February, Simingtonrepeated his objectionto the FCC issuing fines of any type. \"While the conduct described in this NAL [Notice of Apparent Liability for Forfeiture] is particularly egregious and certainly worth enforcement action, I continue to believe that the Supreme Court's decision inJarkesyprevents me from voting, at this time, to approve this or any item purporting to impose a fine,\" Simington said at the time. The 5th Circuit ruling against the FCC was issued by a panel of three judges appointed by Republican presidents. \"Our analysis is governed bySEC v. Jarkesy. In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that the Seventh Amendment prohibited the SEC from requiring respondents to defend themselves before an agency, rather than a jury, against civil penalties for alleged securities fraud,\" the appeals court said. The penalty issued by the FCC is not \"remedial,\" the court said. The fine was punitive and not simply \"meant to compensate victims whose location data was compromised. So, like the penalties inJarkesy, the civil penalties here are 'a type of remedy at common law that could only be enforced in courts of law.'\" The FCC argued that its enforcement proceeding fell under the \"public rights\" exception, unlike the private rights that must be adjudicated in court. \"The Commission argues its enforcement action falls within the public rights exception because it involves common carriers,\" the 5th Circuit panel said. \"Given that common carriers like AT&T are 'affected with a public interest,' the Commission contends Congress could assign adjudication of civil penalties against them to agencies instead of courts.\" The panel disagreed, saying that \"the Commission's proposal would blow a hole in what is meant to be a narrow exception to Article III\" and \"empower Congress to bypass Article III adjudication in countless matters.\" The panel acknowledged that \"federal agencies like the Commission have long had regulatory authority over common carriers, such as when setting rates or granting licenses,\" but said this doesn't mean that \"any regulatory action concerning common carriers implicates the public rights exception.\" The 5th Circuit panel also rejected the FCC's contention that carriers are afforded the right to a trial after the FCC enforcement proceeding. The 5th Circuit said this applies only when a carrier fails to pay a penalty and is sued by the Department of Justice. \"To begin with, by the time DOJ sues (if it does), the Commission would have already adjudged a carrier guilty of violating section 222 and levied fines... in this process, which was completely in-house, the Commission acted as prosecutor, jury, and judge,\" the panel said. An entity penalized by the FCC can also ask a court of appeals to overturn the fine, as AT&T did here. But in choosing this path, the company \"forgoes a jury trial,\" the 5th Circuit panel said. While Verizon and T-Mobile hope the other appeals courts will rule the same way, the FCC maintains that the 5th Circuit got it wrong. In its filing to the 2nd Circuit, the FCC challenged the 5th Circuit's view on whether a trial after the FCC issues a fine satisfies the right to a jury trial. Pointing to an1899 Supreme Court ruling, the FCC said that \"an initial tribunal can lawfully enter judgment without a full jury trial if the law permits a subsequent 'trial [anew] by jury, at the request of either party, in the appellate court.'\" The FCC further said the 5th Circuit relied on a precedent that doesn't exist in either the 2nd Circuit or District of Columbia Circuit. \"The Fifth Circuit also relied on circuit precedent holding that '[i]n a section 504 trial, a defendant cannot challenge a forfeiture order's legal conclusions,'\" the FCC also said. \"This Court, however, has never adopted such a limitation, and the Fifth Circuit's premise is in doubt. Regardless, the proper approach would be to challenge any such limitation in the trial court and seek to strike the limitation—not to vacate the forfeiture order.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

Firefly Aerospace launched its two-stage Alpha rocket from California early Tuesday, but something went wrong about two-and-a-half minutes into the flight, rendering the rocket unable to deploy an experimental satellite into orbit for Lockheed Martin. The Alpha rocket took off from Vandenberg Space Force Base about 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles at 6:37 am PDT (9:37 am EDT; 13:37 UTC), one day after Firefly called off a launch attempt due to a technical problem with ground support equipment. Everything appeared to go well with the rocket's first-stage booster, powered by four kerosene-fueled Reaver engines, as the launcher ascended through fog and arced on a southerly trajectory over the Pacific Ocean. The booster stage jettisoned from Alpha's upper stage two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, and that's when things went awry. A bright cloud of white vapor appeared high in the sky, indicating an explosion, or something close to it. A moment later, the upper stage's single Lightning engine ignited for a six-minute burn to accelerate into orbit. A ground-based infrared camera caught a glimpse of debris in the wake of the upper stage, and then Firefly's live video stream switched to a camera onboard the rocket. The rear-facing view showed the Lightning engine stripped of its exhaust nozzle but still firing. Shards of debris were visible behind the rocket, but the video did not show any sign of the discarded first stage booster, which was expected to fall into the Pacific south of Vandenberg. The upper stage engine kept firing for more than six minutes, when it shut down and Firefly announced that the rocket reached orbit. The rocket was programmed to release its single payload, a nearly 2-ton technology demonstration satellite built by Lockheed Martin, approximately 13 minutes into the mission. Firefly ended its live webcast of the launch before confirming separation of the satellite. A short time later, Firefly released a statement acknowledging a \"mishap during first stage separation... that impacted the Stage 2 Lightning engine nozzle.\" As a result, the rocket achieved an orbit lower than its target altitude, Firefly said. The privately held Texas-based launch company amended its statement later Tuesday morning to remove the clause about the lower-than-planned orbit. Another update from Firefly early Tuesday afternoon confirmed the launch failed. The company said the rocket \"experienced a mishap between stage separation and second stage ignition that led to the loss of the Lightning engine nozzle extension, substantially reducing the engine’s thrust.\" The launcher reached an altitude of nearly 200 miles (320 kilometers) but did not reach orbital velocity, according to Firefly. \"The stage and payload have now safely impacted the Pacific Ocean in a cleared zone north of Antarctica,\" Firefly said. \"Firefly recognizes the hard work that went into payload development and would like to thank our mission partners at Lockheed Martin for their continued support. The team is working closely with our customers and the FAA to conduct an investigation and determine root cause of the anomaly.\" While Firefly's live video of the launch lacked a clear, stable view of first-stage separation, the appearance of white vapor is a sign that the rocket was likely emitting propellant. It wasn't immediately obvious whether the first stage recontacted the upper stage after separation or if the booster exploded and harmed the upper stage engine. You can watch a replay of Firefly's stage separation below. ﻿ Whatever the case, it's an interesting mode of failure. Maybe it's not as bizarre asAstra's sideways launchin 2021, something every rocket geek should know about. Also,there's the time Astra's upper stagelaunched itself through a half-open payload fairing in 2022. United Launch Alliance's Vulcan rocketlost a nozzlefrom one of its solid rocket boosters on a test flight last year, but the launch vehicle persevered and continued its climb into orbit. Thethird flight of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocketfailed in 2008 when its first stage collided with its upper stage moments after separation. An investigation determined residual thrust after shutdown of the first-stage engine pushed the booster into the bottom of Falcon 1's upper stage, so SpaceX lengthened the time between main engine cutoff and staging. SpaceX's next flight was successful, making Falcon 1 the first privately developed liquid-fueled rocket to reach orbit. The only time a rocket's first stage has exploded after separation, at least in recent memory, was in 2023, when aNorth Korean booster blew upbefore it fell into the sea. The explosion did not damage the rocket's upper stage, which continued into orbit on North Korea's only successful satellite launch in nearly a decade. The incident fueled speculation that North Korea intentionally destroyed the booster to prevent South Korea or the United States from recovering it for inspections. Firefly is one of just a handful of active US launch companies with rockets that have reached low-Earth orbit, but its Alpha rocket hasn't established a reliable track record. In six flights, Alpha has amassed just two unqualified successes. Two prior Alpha launches deployed their payloads in lower-than-planned orbits, and the rocket's debut test flight in 2021 failed soon after liftoff. Now, Alpha has again missed its aim and didn't reach orbit at all. The Alpha rocket is capable of hauling a payload of up to 2,270 pounds (1,030 kilograms) to low-Earth orbit, putting Firefly's launcher in a performance class above Rocket Lab's Electron booster and below larger rockets like SpaceX's Falcon 9. There's no reliable commercial launch vehicle in the United States in this middle-of-the-road performance range. One potential competitor—ABL Space Systems—abandoned the satellite launch business last year to focus on missile defense and hypersonic testing. There are several European launchers in operation or development—Arianespace's Vega, Isar Aerospace's Spectrum, and Rocket Factory Augsburg's RFA One—with lift capacities comparable or slightly higher than Firefly's Alpha. Firefly argues that its Alpha rocket services a niche in the market for satellites too large to fly with Rocket Lab or too small to merit a dedicated flight with SpaceX. Firefly has some contract wins to bear this out. The launch on Tuesday was the first of up to 25 Alpha flights booked by Lockheed Martin to launch a series of tech demo satellites. The first of these was Lockheed Martin's 3,836-pound (1,740-kilogram) LM-400 satellite, which was lost on Tuesday's mission. NASA, theNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Reconnaissance Office, the US Space Force, and several more commercial customers have also reserved slots on Firefly's launch schedule. With these contracts, Firefly has the fourth-largest launch confirmed backlog of any US launch company, following SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Rocket Lab. While Firefly continues flying the Alpha rocket, its engineers are developing alarger Medium Launch Vehiclein partnership with Northrop Grumman. Last month, Firefly celebrated the most significant accomplishment in its 11-year history—thefirst fully successful landing on the Moonby a commercial entity. But while Firefly's first missions at its founding were to build rocket engines and launch small satellites, other markets may ultimately prove more lucrative. Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO, argues rockets like Firefly's Alpha are in a \"no man's land\" in the launch market. \"It’s too small to be a useful rideshare mission, and it’s too big to be a useful dedicated rocket\" for smallsats,Beck told Space News. Firefly might have a good strategy to prove Beck wrong. But first, it needs a more reliable rocket. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Trump admin lashes out as Amazon considers displaying tariff costs on its sites",
    "article_text": "\"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" says Amazon. This morning, Punchbowl Newsreportedthat Amazon was considering listing the cost of tariffs as a separate line item on its site, citing \"a person familiar with the plan.\" Amazonlater acknowledgedthat there had been internal discussions to that effect but only for its import-focused Amazon Haul sub-store and that the company didn't plan to actually list tariff prices for any items. \"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" reads Amazon's two-sentence statement. Amazon issued such a specific and forceful on-the-record denial in part because it had drawn the ire of the Trump administration. In a press briefing early this morning, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked a question about the report, which the administration responded to as though Amazon had made a formal announcement about the policy. \"This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,\" Leavitt said, before blaming the Biden administration for high inflation and claiming that Amazon had \"partnered with a Chinese propaganda arm.\" The Washington Post also reported that Trump hadcalled Amazon founder Jeff Bezosto complain about the report. Amazon's internal discussions reflect the current confusion around the severe and rapidly changing import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, particularly tariffs of 145 percent on goods imported from China. Other retailers, particularly sites like Temu, AliExpress, and Shein, have all taken their own steps, either adding labels to listings when import taxes have already been included in the price, or adding import taxes as a separate line item in users' carts at checkout as Amazon had discussed doing. Most of these items are currently excluded from tariffs because of something calledthede minimisexemption, which applies to any shipment valued under $800. The administrationcurrentlyplans to end thede minimisexemption for packages coming from China or Hong Kong beginning on May 2, though the administration's plans could change (as they frequently have before). The end of thede minimisexemptionwill hit tech enthusiasts particularly hard, affecting everything from mechanical keyboards to 3D printer parts to retro emulation consoles to Raspberry Pi- and Arduino-related odds and ends. Shoppers who use sites like Temu and Shein to buy cheap clothing will also be affected disproportionately. Smartphones and computers are exempt from the new tariffs, at least for now, but this won't extend to many accessories and components. Reddit users onthe /r/temuthings boardhave been posting screenshots of tariff-inflated shopping carts for days. As of this morning, the Temu site began listing any items that shipped from China as \"sold out\" to users shopping from the US (here'sa sample listingthat was available as of 10 am Eastern, which listed as sold out in the US by noon but is still available if you choose to shop from another country). Some manufacturers have also either built tariff increases into the retail prices for their products or stopped shipping certain products to the US. Keyboard-maker Logitech quietly raised prices for about half of its products last week. Nintendo delayed preorders of its new Switch 2 console andincreasedprices for controllers and other accessories following the tariff announcements. Retro console-maker Anbernic stopped shipping to the US entirely; modular laptop company Framework brieflypausedUS sales for some low-end systems. These are just a few examples. Even if the Trump administration lowers some tariffs or keeps some form of thede minimisexemption in place, the nature of global supply chains means some damage has already been done and that retailers like Amazon and Temu could have fewer options for restocking once already-imported US-based stock has been depleted. Bloomberg reports that the volume of cargo heading from China to the US is down by \"about 40 percent from this year's peak\" and that restarting shipments could cause delays at US ports similar tothose seen in 2021 and 2022, which could also reduce supply and increase prices.

    "title": "Montana’s Republican legislators fight back after successful youth climate lawsuit",
    "article_text": "Republican backlash could lead to changes in Montana’s courts and environmental laws. This article originally appeared onInside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment. Sign up for their newsletterhere. In the wake of a high-profile court decision that upended the state of Montana’s climate policy, Republican lawmakers in the state are pushing a suite of bills that could gut the state’s ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The full-court legislative press targets the state’s environmental analysis, air quality regulation, and judicial system. It stems from theHeld v. Montanacase in which 16 young people sued the state over its contributions to climate change, claiming its fossil fuel-centric approach to energy violated the state constitution’s guarantee of a “clean and healthful environment.” The plaintiffs won, and in December 2024, the Montana Supreme Court upheld their victory. The case “didn’t just make headlines,” Montana Republican Representative Greg Oblander, a sponsor of one of the bills that could hobble climate action in the state,said in a press conference.“It sent shockwaves through the Montana economy.” He said the case “was an open invitation for activists to weaponize our environmental laws against the very industries that keep Montana running and Montanans employed.” The fallout of the Held decision animated the breadth of the state’s 90-day legislative session, poised to end by early May, and bills weakening the state’s bedrock environmental policy are almost certain to be signed into law by the state’s Republican governor. Nonetheless, the battle is likely to continue in the courts. The Held decision hinged on Montana’s constitutional protections of the environment. Framers in the state’s 1972 Constitutional Convention took the state’s environmental woes seriously. Extractive industries like mining and logging had left a lasting environmental toll on the air, water, and land in the state, and for decades, the Anaconda Copper Mining Company wielded enormous power at the state legislature, resulting in large-scale mining, logging, and other extractive industry. Today, Montana is home to the largest complex of Superfund sites, or government toxic waste cleanups, in the country. In response to that environmental degradation, Montana ultimately enshrined some of the strongest environmental protections in the country in its constitution, culminating in the right to “a clean and healthful environment.” That right played a central role in the Held case. During the trial in the summer of 2023, the state argued that Montana’s contribution to greenhouse gases is but a fraction of a fraction of the world’s pool of emissions. “Montana’s emissions are simply too minuscule to make any difference,” the state’s attorney argued. “Climate change is a global issue that effectively relegates Montana’s role to that of the spectator.” Meanwhile, the attorney for the young plaintiffs argued that the state’s contributions were equivalent to that of entire countries like the Netherlands, Pakistan, or Argentina, and was actively degrading Montana’s environment. When the plaintiffs won the case, the state appealed to the Montana Supreme Court. In December 2024, that court also ruled against the state. “Montana’s right to a clean and healthful environment and environmental life support system includes a stable climate system,” Judge Kathy Seeley wrote in the court’s decision. That decision also hinged on what the state considers when it conducts environmental review. In 2011, the Montana legislature barred analyses required by the Montana Environmental Policy Act, or MEPA, from considering impacts outside the state. In 2023 the legislature honed MEPA’s focus even more, passing a provision that said greenhouse gas emissions could not be considered in the state’s environmental analyses. That limitation, the Supreme Court ruled, was unconstitutional. MEPA analyses, according to the decision, would have to account for projects’ emissions. Less than a month after the Supreme Court’s decision, Republican legislators set to figuring out how to minimize its impact. “The backlash [to Held] is profound,” said Anne Hedges, executive director of the Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC), an organization dedicated to protecting the state’s land, air, and water, in an interview. The pushback, in particular, comes from Republicans in the state, who have strong majorities in both chambers of the state legislature. “Their goal is to prevent the state from being able to do anything to address climate change.” Part of that backlash came in bills that aimed directly at MEPA. One bill, for example,limits the state to looking only at direct, proximate impacts of projects. This would make upstream or downstream impacts outside the scope of environmental analyses. In, say, a project to expand a coal mine, the direct emissions associated with extracting the coal would be analyzed, according to the bill, but anything that happens next would be left out. Montana produces about 5 percent of the country’s coal and contains the largest coal reserves in the US, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Colstrip, the largest coal plant in the state—and thedirtiest in the nation—has a footprint larger than the biggest city in Montana. In 2021 alone, the plant emitted about 11 million tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. But, under this particular bill, the emissions from burning that coal would not be considered as part of any required MEPA analysis of the plant or of mines that provide it with fuel. “The Held decision was a gift-wrapped decision for radical environmental activists, an open door for endless lawsuits designed to shut down Montana’s fossil fuel industry,” the sponsor of that bill, Montana Republican Senator Wylie Galt, said in a press conference. “It had nothing to do with protecting our environment and everything to do with weaponizing the courts to strangle our economy.” But, to opponents of the legislation, it is an intentional effort to ignore the reality of what’s driving climate change. “There’s never anything else to do with coal,” Hedges said. “You burn coal.” Another billstrikes language that connects MEPA to Montana’s right to a clean and healthful environmentand eliminates the ability of analyses to look at long-term impacts of projects. “Montana is a resource-rich state,” that bill’s sponsor, Republican Representative Brandon Ler, said in a press conference. “We have energy, we have agriculture, and we have timber. These industries aren’t just sectors on a spreadsheet. They fund our schools, support our businesses, and keep families together.” Neither Galt nor Ler responded to interview requests for this article. A final piece of legislation attacking the state’s climate policy, sponsored by Republican Representative Greg Oblander,prevents Montana from implementing air quality standards stricter than those of the federal government. “It’s about making sure that when businesses want to invest in our state, they can do it without fear of being buried under layers of unnecessary regulations,” Oblander said. “Montana is open for business, but only if we keep it that way.” Taken together, the bills effectively “wash [the legislature’s] hands of the whole problem and there is no way to enforce our right to a healthy climate,” Hedges said. Proponents of the suite of bills, including mining and oil organizations, the state’s departments of environmental quality and natural resources, chambers of commerce, and other groups, said the bills offer stability, predictability, and certainty. Montana’s emissions, they argued, are but a drop in the global bucket. “We all share the same air,” said John Iverson, with the Treasure State Resources Association,in a hearing on the air quality bill. “Making one table in a bar the non-smoking table doesn’t do much to improve the air quality. Making one corner of the pool the non-peeing section doesn’t improve your swimming experience.” Some lawmakers and defendants also questioned the extent to which human-caused climate change is happening at all. “There is a strong sentiment of climate denial in the Capitol,” Hedges said. “They’ll complain about droughts, they’ll complain about wildfires, they will complain about all of the impacts either caused or exacerbated by climate change… but they won’t admit what the problem is and they refuse to do anything about it.” Other testimony by lawmakers and lobbyists in House and Senate hearings also focused on the state’s constitutionally ordained rights. Along with a clean and healthful environment, the Montana Constitution also grants rights to pursuing life’s basic necessities, protecting liberties and protecting property. The MEPA bills, their supporters argued, help strike a balance between these rights when they butt heads. In all the hearings, voices opposing the bills—including those of MEIC; conservation groups like Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Montana Audubon, and Montana Conservation Voters; physicians organizations; citizens and more—have far outnumbered those in favor of the legislation. Testimony focused on the real-time health and environmental impacts of climate change, the importance of the MEPA process and the environmental protections in the Montana constitution. One additional bill, put forth by a coalition of Democrats, would have revised MEPA to follow the court’s ruling in the Held decision, but it was killed in committee. While legislation directly reacting to Held focused on MEPA and other statutes, another legislative push from Republicans took aim at the branch of government responsible for the decision: the judiciary. Republican frustration with the court system had been building for years, fueled by the Held saga along with other court decisions that blocked laws passed by the legislature rolling back rights for transgender people and abortion access. After the Held decision, Montana’s Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte put out a statement: “This Court continues to step outside of its lane to tread on the right of the Legislature, the elected representatives of the people, to make policy. This decision does nothing more than declare open season on Montana’s all-of-the-above approach to energy.” An interim committee of Republican lawmakers put forth more than 27 bills to reform the judiciary ahead of this year’s legislative session. Two could have huge impacts on climate decisions in the courts by politicizing the judiciary. One bill would create a “court of chancery” specifically designed to tackle constitutional questions stemming from legislation. The three judges in that court would be appointed by the governor. Another bill would politicize the state’s judicial races. Currently, judicial candidates—including state Supreme Court justices—are elected with no official party affiliation. The legislation would make the races partisan, meaning judges can run as Republicans or Democrats. Republican advocates of the legislation contend that through lobbying and campaign contributions, politics have entered the court system already, and this legislation would, as Gianforte argued in his “State of the State” address, “bring light into this darkness” by allowing voters to know the values of the judges for whom they’re voting. Republican legislators have called the Held plaintiffs and the judges who decided in their favor radicals, activists, even, disparagingly, “little Greta Thunbergs.” Ler, sponsor of one of the MEPA bills, said in a press conference that the judges’ decision in the Held case was driven by an agenda beyond the desire to enforce the constitution’s requirement of a healthy environment. “This isn’t about climate,” he said. “It’s about control.” Opponents of the judiciary bills—including Montana Supreme Court Chief Justice Cory Swanson—stressed the importance of an independent judicial system as part of the government’s checks and balances. “You are considering a number of bills that well-respected attorneys are telling you violate the constitutional separation of powers,” Swanson warned lawmakers. “I urge you to listen to those arguments.” Hedges with the MEIC sees the courts as a scapegoat for those pushing bills to politicize the judiciary. Republican lawmakers, she said, “bitch about the courts on the one hand, but then they give the courts nowhere to turn except to overturn their bills that are unconstitutional. It’s like this little round robin the legislature set up.” All three bills designed to mitigate the impact of Held by limiting the extent to which MEPA can analyze greenhouse gas emissions and the level at which the state can regulate them have passed both chambers of the legislature on party-line votes. Gianforte’s office declined to give an interview about the climate issues being addressed in the legislature, but the governor said in a press conference that he’s looking forward to getting the MEPA bills to his desk. The bills targeting the judiciary, however, have died—despite being championed by the governor and other powerful Republicans in the legislature. However, things could change. The legislative session will wrap up by early May, and there’s a chance the bills could be revived in another form. Hedges said the MEPA and air quality bills in particular continue to infringe on Montanans’ right to a clean and healthful environment, and they’re likely to end up in the courts. “It’s depressing,” she said. “It’s going to take us years to unwind what they’re doing here. And they [Republican lawmakers] know it; to them, that’s a win.” Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Google: Governments are using zero-day hacks more than ever",
    "article_text": "Google says zero-day threats are trending upward even as total detections fell in 2024. Last year was big for zero-day exploits, security threats that appear in the wild before vendors have a chance to develop patches. Through its sprawling network of services and research initiatives, Google is the first to spot many of these threats. In a new report from the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), the company reveals it detected 75 zero-dayexploits in 2024, which is a bit lower than the previous year. Unsurprisingly, a sizable chunk of them was the work of state-sponsored hackers. According to Google, zero-day exploits are becoming increasingly easy for threat actors to develop and procure, which has led to more sophisticated attacks. While end-user devices are still regularly targeted, GTIG notes that the trend over the past few years has been for these vulnerabilities to target enterprise systems and security infrastructure. There were 98 zero-days detected in 2023 versus 75 in 2024, but Google says the overall trend in enterprise threats is increasing. That's not to say the products you use every day are safe from sneaky hacks—a slim majority of GTIG's 2024 zero-day threats still targeted users. In fact, Google says hackers were even more interested in certain platforms last year compared to the year before. Credit:\n\n          \n          Google Windows exploits increased from 16 to 22, by far the single largest contributor to the total. Safari and iOS both fell to three and two zero-days, respectively—down from eleven and nine zero-days in 2023. Android held steady with seven hacks, and Chrome had the same, which was one higher than 2023. Firefox was untargeted in 2023, but it was the subject of one zero-day attack in 2024. Google has a few examples of the zero-day hacks it detected, as well as afull report(PDF) with technical details. One of Google's callouts is the CIGAR Local Privilege Escalation, which targeted Firefox and Tor browsers in late 2024. The CIGAR group, which is linked to Russia, used what is now known as CVE-2024-9680 to execute remote code on target machines running Firefox 131 to harvest user data. A few years ago, zero-day attacks almost exclusively targeted end users. In 2021, GTIG spotted 95 zero-days, and 71 of them were deployed against user systems likebrowsersand smartphones. In 2024, 33 of the 75 total vulnerabilities were aimed at enterprise technologies and security systems. At 44 percent of the total, this is the highest share of enterprise focus for zero-days yet. GTIG says that it detected zero-day attacks targeting 18 different enterprise entities, including Microsoft, Google, and Ivanti. This is slightly lower than the 22 firms targeted by zero-days in 2023, but it's a big increase compared to just a few years ago, when seven firms were hit with zero-days in 2020. The nature of these attacks often makes it hard to trace them to the source, but Google says it managed to attribute 34 of the 75 zero-day attacks. The largest single category with 10 detections was traditional state-sponsored espionage, which aims to gather intelligence without a financial motivation. China was the largest single contributor here. GTIG also identified North Korea as the perpetrator in five zero-day attacks, but these campaigns also had a financial motivation (usually stealing crypto). Credit:\n\n          \n          Google That's already a lot of government-organized hacking, but GTIG also notes that eight of the serious hacks it detected came from commercial surveillance vendors (CSVs), firms that create hacking tools and claim to only do business with governments. So it's fair to include these with other government hacks. This includes companies like NSO Group and Cellebrite, with the former already subject to US sanctions from its work with adversarial nations. In all, this adds up to 23 of the 34 attributed attacks coming from governments. There were also a few attacks that didn't technically originate from governments but still involved espionage activities, suggesting a connection to state actors. Beyond that, Google spotted five non-government financially motivated zero-day campaigns that did not appear to engage in spying. Google's security researchers say they expect zero-day attacks to continue increasing over time. These stealthy vulnerabilities can be expensive to obtain or discover, but the lag time before anyone notices the threat can reward hackers with a wealth of information (or money). Google recommends enterprises continue scaling up efforts to detect and block malicious activities, while also designing systems with redundancy and stricter limits on access.

    "article_text": "Trump slightly softens his stand on auto industry imports, but 25% tariffs stay. President Donald Trump is set to ease up slightly on the automotive industry this week. After being warned thathis trade warwill result inhiked pricesand fewer vehicles being built, government officials over the past two days have signaled that Trump will sign an executive order today that will mitigate some of the pain the 25 percent import tariffs will inflict. Trump's approach to tariffs has beennothing if not inconsistent. In this case, the White House is not dropping the 25 percent tariff on all imported vehicles, but the other tariffs imposed by the Trump administration—like the 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum that went into effect in February—won't stack up on top. The potential for multiple tariffs to have an additive effect on prices could have seen new car prices soar in the coming weeks; now, they are likely to just rise a lot instead. According toThe Wall Street Journal, the move will be retroactive, and automakers who have (for example) paid aluminum or steel tariffs on top of the car import tariff can seek a refund for the former. A separate 25 percent tariff on imported car parts is set to go into effect on Saturday. These are still planned to go into effect, but importers will be able to apply for small reimbursements—up to 3.75 percent of the value of a US-made car for a year, then 2.5 percent of the car's value for the second year. How easy the government will make the reimbursement process, and where that money will come from, has yet to be made clear.

But its simplicity is deceptive.Cacio e pepe(\"cheese and pepper\") is notoriously challenging to make because it's so easy for the sauce to form unappetizing clumps with a texture more akin to stringy mozzarella rather than being smooth and creamy. A team of Italian physicists has come to the rescue with a foolproof recipe based on their many scientific experiments, according to a new paper published in the journal Physics of Fluids. The trick: using corn starch for the cheese and pepper sauce instead of relying on however much starch leaches into the boiling water as the pasta is cooked. \"A true Italian grandmother or a skilled home chef from Rome would never need a scientific recipe for cacio e pepe, relying instead on instinct and years of experience,\" the authors wrote. \"For everyone else, this guide offers a practical way to master the dish. Preparing cacio e pepe successfully depends on getting the balance just right, particularly the ratio of starch to cheese. The concentration of starch plays a crucial role in keeping the sauce creamy and smooth, without clumps or separation.\" There has beena surprising amountof pasta-related physics research in recent years, particularly around spaghetti—the mechanics ofslurping the pastainto one's mouth, for instance, orspitting it out(aka, the \"reverse spaghetti problem\"). The most well-known is the question of how to get dry spaghetti strands to break neatly in two rather than three or more scattered pieces. French physicists successfullyexplained the dynamicsin an Ig Nobel Prize-winning 2006 paper. They found that, counterintuitively, a dry spaghetti strand produces a \"kick back\" traveling wave as it breaks. This wave temporarilyincreasesthe curvature in other sections, leading to many more breaks. In 2020, physicists provided an explanation for why a strand of spaghetti in a pot of boiling water will start to sag as it softens before sinking to the bottom of the pot and curling back on itself in a U shape. Physicists have alsodiscovereda wayto determineif one's spaghetti is perfectly done by using a simple ruler (although one can always use the tried-and-true method of flinging a test strand against the wall). In 2021,inspired byflat-packed furniture, scientistscame up withan ingenious solution to packaging differently shaped pastas: ship them in a flat 2D form that takes on the final 3D shape when cooked, thanks to carefully etched patterns in the pasta. Andearlier this year, physicists investigated how adding salt to a pasta pot to make it boil faster can leave a white ring on the bottom of the pot to identify factors leading to the perfect salt ring. Theyfound thatparticles released from a smaller height fall faster and form a pattern with a clean central region. Those released from a greater height take longer to fall to the bottom, and the cloud of particles expands radially until the particles are far enough apart not to be influenced by the wakes of neighboring particles, such that they no longer form a cloud. In the latter case, you end up with a homogeneous salt ring deposit. So it shouldn't be the least bit surprising that physicists have now turned their attention to the problem of the perfect cacio e pepe sauce. The authors are well aware that they are treading on sacred ground for Italian traditionalists. \"I hope that eight Italian authors is enough [to quell skepticism],\" co-author Ivan Di Terlizzi of the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systemstold The New York Timesback in January. (An earlier version of the paper was posted to the physics preprint arXiv in January, prompting that earlier coverage.) Terlizzi and his fellow author are all living abroad and frequently meet for dinner. Cacio e pepe is among their favorite traditional dishes to make, and as physicists, they couldn't help but want to learn more about the unique physics of the process, not to mention \"the more practical aim to avoid wasting good pecorino,\"said Terlizzi. They focused on the separation that often occurs when cheese and water are mixed, building on earlierculinary experiments. As the pasta cooks in boiling water, the noodles release starch. Traditionally, the chef will extract part of the water and starch solution—which is cooled to a suitable temperature to avoid clumping as the cheese proteins \"denaturate\"—and mix it with the cheese to make the sauce, adding the pepper last, right before serving. But the authors note that temperature is not the only factor that can lead to this dreaded “mozzarella phase.\" According to the authors, if one tries to mix cheese and water without any starch, the clumping is more pronounced. There is less clumping with water containing a little starch, like water in which pasta has been cooked. And when one mixes the cheese with pasta water \"risottata\"—i.e., collected and heated in a pan so enough water evaporates that there is a higher concentration of starch—there is almost no clumping. So starch plays a crucial role in the process of making cacio e pepe. The authors devised a set of experiments to scientifically investigate the phase behavior of water, starch, and cheese mixed together in various concentrations and at different temperatures. They primarily used standard kitchen tools to make sure home cooks could recreate their results (although not every kitchen has a sous vide machine). This enabled them to devise a phase diagram of what happens to the sauce as the conditions change. The authors found that the correct starch ratio is between 2 to 3 percent of the cheese weight. Below that, you get the clumping phase separation; above that, and the sauce \"becomes stiff and unappetizing as it cools,\" they wrote. Pasta water alone contains too little starch. Using pasta water \"risottata\" may concentrate the starch, but the chef has less control over the precise amount of starch. So the authors recommend simply dissolving 4 grams of powdered potato or corn starch in 40 grams of water, heating it gently until it thickens—a transition known as starch gelatinization—and combining that gel with the cheese. They also recommend toasting the black pepper briefly before adding it to the mixture to enhance its flavors and aromas. They ran the same set of experiments using trisodium citrate as an alternative stabilizer, which is widely used in the food industry as an emulsifier—including in the production of processed cheese, since it enhances smoothness and prevents unwanted clumping, exactly the properties one desires for a perfect cacio e pepe sauce. The trisodium citrate at concentrations above 2 percent worked just as well at avoiding the mozzarella phase, \"though at a cost of deviating from strict culinary tradition,\" the authors concluded. \"However, while the sauce stabilization is more efficient, we found the taste of the cheese to be slightly blunted, likely due to the basic properties of the salt.\" The team's next research goal is to conduct similar experiments with makingpasta alla gricia—basically the same as cacio e pepe, with the addition of guanciale (cured pork cheek). \"This recipe seems to be easier to perform, and we don't know exactly why,\"said co-author Daniel Maria Busiello, Terlizzi's colleague at the Dresden Max Planck Institute. \"This is one idea we might explore in the future.” DOI: Physics of Fluids, 2025.10.1063/5.0255841(About DOIs).

    "title": "Trump’s National Climate Assessment: No funding and all authors cut loose",
    "article_text": "The assessment is required by law, but the administration is not noted for caring. As part of the Global Change Research Act of 1990,Congress mandatedthat every four years, the government must produce a National Climate Assessment. This document is intended to provide an overview of the changing state of our knowledge about the process itself and its impact on our environment. Past versions have been comprehensive and involved the work of hundreds of scientists, all coordinated by the US's Global Change Research Program. It's not clear what the next report will look like. Two weeks aftercuttingfundingfor the organization that coordinates the report's production, the Trump administration has apparently informed all the authors working on it that their services are no longer needed. The National Climate Assessment has typically been like a somewhat smaller-scale version of the IPCC reports, with a greater focus on impacts in the US. It is a very detailed look at the state of climate science, the impacts warming is having on the US, and our efforts to limit warming and deal with those impacts. Various agencies and local governments have used it to help plan for the expected impacts of our warming climate. But past versions have also been caught up in politics. The first Trump administration inherited a report that wasnearly complete; it chose torush the report out on the Friday after Thanksgiving,hopingit would be largely ignored.The administration did not start work on the subsequent report; as a result, the Biden administration produceda typically detailed report,but it was doneslightly behind schedule. Biden's team also started preparing the next report (the sixth in the series), which, by law, would need to be completed by 2028. As a result, the second Trump administration inherited a process that was well underway. But in early April, the government canceled contracts with an outside consulting firm that coordinates with the Global Change Research Program and provides temporary staffing to complete the report. This raised questions about whether the report could be completed within its legally mandated timeline. As it turns out, the Trump administration was not interested in the report that was being prepared. On Monday, all its authors received a notice informing them that the report preparation process was being terminated. A copy seen by Ars thanked authors for their participation but said, \"The scope of the NCA6 is currently being reevaluated,\" and \"We are now releasing all current assessment participants from their roles.\" There are two possibilities here. The Trump administration, as determined by multiple legal proceedings, has not been very careful about following the law, and it's entirely possible that it will simply fail to produce the required report. The alternative is that the administration plans to complete one that sidelines mainstream science. Even more so than the first Trump administration, the current one is treating climate science as a mixture of being ideologically motivated and scam-adjacent. And there have always been figures at the periphery of the research community who have refused to accept the evidence for climate change and would happily contribute to a report that rejects mainstream science. It's entirely possible that we'll see these individuals step up to produce a radically different assessment than the one that had been in the works.

    "title": "A rocket launch Monday night may finally jump-start Amazon’s answer to Starlink",
    "article_text": "A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket lifted off from Florida with 27 Kuiper satellites. The first 27 operational satellites for Amazon's Kuiper broadband network lifted off from Florida's Space Coast on Monday evening, the opening salvo in a challenge to SpaceX's dominant Starlink global Internet service. Amazon's Project Kuiper,costing up to $20 billion, will beam high-speed, low-latency broadband signals to consumers around the world. Monday's milestone launch kicks off a test campaign in low-Earth orbit to verify the functionality and performance of Amazon's satellites. In a statement earlier this month, Amazon said it planned to begin providing service to customers later this year. These initial services are likely to have limited reach. Amazon needs more than 80 launches to complete the first-generation Kuiper network, and this will probably take several years. Amazon's first 27 satellites soared into orbit from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida, aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. The Atlas V flew in its most powerful configuration, with five strap-on solid rocket boosters and an extended nose cone to accommodate the Kuiper satellites. Amazon's 27 spacecraft added up to become the heaviest payload ever launched by an Atlas V in 102 missions. The 205-foot-tall (62.5-meter) rocket lifted off at 7:01 pm EDT (23:01 UTC) Monday and headed northeast from Cape Canaveral. In the first five minutes of the flight, the Atlas V jettisoned its five boosters, payload fairing, and kerosene-fueled first stage. A Centaur upper stage took over to accelerate the rocket to orbital velocity, approximately 17,000 mph (7.6 kilometers per second). United Launch Alliance ended its live video coverage of the mission a few minutes after the launch at the request of Amazon, which insisted on a level of secrecy normally reserved for spy satellites. Amazon has not publicly released any photos or illustrations of the Kuiper satellites, breaking from the convention established by other Western companies with megaconstellations. An Amazon spokesperson said a rudimentary illustration in a ULA-produced animation of the launch sequence provides a \"sense of the satellite stack\" on top of the Atlas V rocket. For launch, the spacecraft were attached to a lightweight dispenser, like ornaments on a Christmas tree. After reaching orbit, the Kuiper satellites deployed from the dispenser at an altitude of roughly 280 miles (450 kilometers) and an inclination of 51.9 degrees to the equator. Amazon and ULA confirmed a successful outcome to the launch later Monday night. \"Important moment for Project Kuiperas we just confirmed our first 27 production satellites are operating as expected in low-Earth orbit,\"wrote Andy Jassy, Amazon's CEO, on X. \"While this is the first step in a much longer journey to launch the rest of our low-Earth orbit constellation, it represents an incredible amount of invention and hard work. Am really proud of the collective team.\" Amazon aims to launch thousands more Kuiper satellites in the next few years. When complete, the first generation of the Kuiper constellation will consist of 3,232 satellites flying in 98 orbital planes crisscrossing the planet at altitudes of less than 400 miles. In 2022, Amazonsigned the largest commercial launch contractin history, snatching up rides on ULA's new Vulcan rocket, Blue Origin's New Glenn, and Arianespace's Ariane 6 launcher. Amazon booked nine launches on ULA's soon-to-retire Atlas V rocket the previous year andreserved three flights on the Falcon 9 rocketoperated by rival SpaceX in 2023. Amazon is using the Atlas Vs to boost its first batches of satellites to orbit. An Atlas V rocket launched 18 months ago with a pair of prototype Kuiper satellites for testing in space. There are seven Atlas Vs remaining on Amazon's contract following Monday's launch. ULA won the majority of Amazon's launch contracts, with 38 flights on the company's new Vulcan rocket and nine on the Atlas V. Arianespace won 18 missions using its Ariane 6 rocket, and Blue Origin—owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos—won 12 missions, with acontract option for 15 more. Only SpaceX has demonstrated the kind of high-tempo launch rate Amazon expects of its launch providers. SpaceX recently launched its 250th Starlink mission and now has more than 7,000 Starlink satellites in orbit, with multiple launches adding more each week. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket was already a mature, reliable launch vehicle when Starlink missions began flying. Amazon's launch providers are all flying brand-new rockets, other than the Atlas V and Falcon 9. New rockets often have trouble ramping up to their promised launch cadence. Amazon is helping to fund a big expansion in ULA's footprint at Cape Canaveral, an effort that officials say will double the company's launch capacity. The investment to fund the growth in ULA's capability to support Kuiper launches totals about $2 billion, with around $500 million going toward upgrades at Cape Canaveral. Those upgrades include the outfitting of a second vertical hangar and a second mobile launch platform for Vulcan rockets, alongside the integration facility and launch table already built to support the first few Vulcan missions. Having dual lanes for launch processing in Florida will allow ULA to fly as many as 25 Vulcan rockets per year, the company said. ULA's primary Vulcan customers are the US Space Force and Amazon. \"The addition of a second launch processing capability allows for dual, simultaneous launch processing between both integration facilities seamlessly,\" said Tory Bruno, ULA's president and CEO, in a statement. \"This launch marks the first step toward the future of our partnership and increased launch cadence,\" Bruno said. \"We have been steadily modifying our launch facilities in Cape Canaveral to support the capacity for future Project Kuiper missions in a manner that will ultimately benefit both our commercial and government customers as we endeavor to save lives, explore the universe, and connect the world.\" Amazon ground controllers in Redmond, Washington, are overseeing the operation of the first 27 Kuiper satellites. Engineers there will test each satellite's ability to independently maneuver and communicate with mission control. So far, this appears to be going well. The next step will involve activating the satellites' electric propulsion systems to gradually climb to their assigned orbit of 392 miles (630 kilometers). Amazon and its launch suppliers need to get moving. Kuiper officials face a July 2026 deadline from the Federal Communications Commission to deploy half of the fleet's 3,232 satellites to maintain network authorization. This is not going to happen. It would require an average of nearly one launch per week, starting now. The time limit is movable, and the FCC has extended network authorization deadlines before. Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chairman of the FCC, has argued for a more \"market-friendly regulatory environment\" in a chapter he authored for the Heritage Foundation'sProject 2025, widely seen as a blueprint for the Trump administration's strategies. But Carr is a close ally of Elon Musk, owner of Kuiper's primary competitor, Starlink. Amazon is not selling subscriptions for Kuiper service yet, and the company has said its initial focus will be on testing Kuiperconnectivity with \"enterprise customers\"before moving on to consumer broadband. Apart from challenging Starlink, Kuiper will also compete in some market segments with Eutelsat OneWeb, the London-based operator of the only other active Internet megaconstellation. OneWeb's more than 600 satellites provide service to businesses, governments, schools, and hospitals rather than direct service to individual consumers.

    "title": "The BYD Dolphin review: Here’s what we’re missing out on in America",
    "article_text": "BYD now outsells Tesla, so we decided to see what the fuss is about. China's BYD doesn't mess around. It began life as a battery company that eventually realized it could branch out into electrified cars. And so it did. Today, BYD is outselling rival giants and has cars on the road almost everywhere,except the US. Its eyes are firmly set on conquering the electric vehicle sector, but it will sell you a hybrid if you're not quite ready to take on life with a battery EV full-time. Being a thoroughly modern car company, BYD will sell you cars in various shapes and sizes and across a wide price range, though the bigger you go, the higher the price tag becomes. With popular sentiment starting to turn against this second gilded age, the super-lux stuff won't suit everyone. That's where BYD's smallest car, the Dolphin, comes into play. Small is, of course, a relative term. An originalIssigonisMini it is not, but it makes a Range Rover Evoque look big. It's tall, but it's narrow enough that it will fit in a European parking space with room to open the doors. You won't miss it in a parking lot, either. BYD's \"Ocean Aesthetics\" design language is a mixed bag. On its larger cars, it flows rather neatly; here, it's a touch awkward. The fact that you can get the Dolphin in pale pink or two-tone combos helps it stand out further. The rear light graphics are pleasingly twisty, but the ‘Build Your Dreams' motif stamped on the back received such backlash when BYD launched in the UK that the company said it would stop putting its well-meaning but saccharine company motto on the back of cars. The Dolphin is tall because it has to be. On the floor is a Blade Battery, BYD's proprietary battery tech. It forms part of the structure of the car and is super-stiff, and it can be pierced with a nail and not go pop. As party tricks go, that's a neat one. There are two battery sizes to choose from: a 44.9 kWh unit or, as tested, the 60.4 kWh pack, which will get you 265 miles (426 km) on a charge, according to the WLTP scheme, while feeding a 201 hp (150 kW) motor. Zero to 62 mph (0–100 km/h) takes 7.0 seconds, and the Dolphin tops out at 99 mph (160 km/h). DC fast charging is capped at 88 kW, or 65 kW for the smaller battery, which means it takes 29 minutes to get from 30 to 80 percent state of charge. The performance sounds rather hot hatch-y until you realize the top-spec car weighs 3,655 lbs (1,658 kg), which is a lot for a family hatchback. The interior is fine. There are plenty of neat design quirks, like funky door handles and swoopy surfaces, that make being in there rather pleasant. It's called the Dolphin, so you can't expect it to take itself too seriously, but it's refreshingly fun without seeming tacky. Drivers get a 5-inch display for speed, range, etc., and while it's a bit on the small side, it's not the end of the world. Everything else is run through a 12.8-inch touchscreen in the center of the car. It's not any mere rectangle, though; it rotates. You can have your map, apps, and whatever else in portrait or landscape at the push of a button. Unless, sadly, you want to use Apple CarPlay. It's landscape-only for that. It's fun to show people that you have a wobbly screen, but after messing with it a couple of times, you'll find your orientation of choice and keep it there. Rear passengers are taken care of, as are the tall. There's a 12.2 cubic foot (345 L) trunk, which isn't the biggest in the world, but it'll take a small family's weekly shop and the usual household \"stuff\" without issue. All in all, on paper at least, it seems like a pleasant thing that can fit into most families' lives without too many issues (so long as they have a home charger). It's as pleasingly quick off the line as its numbers suggest, which helps in city traffic, and its electric insta-torque means overtaking on the highway isn't an issue, either. Of course, there are drive modes to play with—Eco, Normal, Sport, and Snow—but to be honest, leaving it in Normal and cruising around is probably what you'll end up doing the most. It doesn't sap power at an alarming rate, nor does it dull the controls. Throttle response is smooth, and brake regen isn't too grabby, either. The Dolphin's steering is unremarkable. You won't get out of it and remember how eager it was to kiss an apex on the way home from Tesco, but you also won't compare it to that person you know whose handshake is so weak it makes you shudder. Same goes for the ride—in a car like the Dolphin, you're not looking for sharpness or fogginess but a happy medium to go about your day fuss-free, and that's what you get here. The rotary dial gear lever in the center stack isn't the slickest to use, but it gets the job done once you find your groove with it, and the reversing camera is pleasingly high-resolution and huge on the infotainment screen. As you'd expect, it's quiet almost everywhere you take it, but on the highway, the wind noise can get a bit much from time to time. Oh, and whatever's in the chemical makeup of BYD's cabins, its new car smell is so acrid I can almost chew it (this has happened in more than one BYD). With a starting price of £26,205 ($34,800) in the UK, it's not the most expensive EV out there, and its size puts it up against the likes of the VW ID.3, MG4, and Renault 5, which are all perhaps a little better resolved and come from legacy brands (MG half-counts). Will buyers enjoy driving the BYD Dolphin? Probably not. Will they hate driving it? Certainly not. It'll be a handy ride to get through the day-to-day fuss-free. And it's very good at doing just that. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Tuesday Telescope: Yes, you can see stars in space, and they’re spectacular",
    "article_text": "\"Okay, where's my camera? I gotta record that.\" Welcome to theTuesday Telescope. There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light—a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We’ll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we’ll take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder. NASA Astronaut Don Pettitreturned to Earth 10 days ago, landing in Kazakhstan. During his latest mission, his third long-duration on the International Space Station, Pettit brought his brand of wonderment to the assignment. During his time in microgravity, Pettit, an inveterate tinkerer, said he likes to spend his free time either doing experiments in microgravity he cannot do on Earth or taking images to bring the experience back home. At a news conference Monday, Pettit was asked why he took so many images—670,000!—during his most recent stay on the space station. \"When I'm looking out the window, just enjoying the view, it's like, 'Oh, wow, a meteor. Look at that. Man, there's a flash there. What's that? Oh, look at that volcano going off. Okay, where's my camera? I gotta record that.' And part of this drive for me is when your mission is over, it's photographs and memories. When you want to share the experience with people, you can share the memories through verbal communication, like we're doing now, but the photographs are just another dimension of sharing what it's like. It's an experience where most people on Earth right now can't share, and I can try to give them a glimpse through my imagery.\" It would be almost impossible to pick just a single photo of Pettit's to share this week in the Tuesday Telescope, but I've selected this one for several reasons. First, it's beautiful, and the framing through the Dragon spacecraft window is lovely. It also shows stars from the vantage point in space. Pettit built his own star tracker, of course, to make this happen. And finally, Earth's atmosphere is a showstopper by itself. Anyway, thank you, Don Pettit, for all of the beauty and wonderment you've brought back from space. Most of us will, indeed, never go. But you've brought us all that little bit closer.

    "title": "AI-generated code could be a disaster for the software supply chain. Here’s why.",
    "article_text": "LLM-produced code could make us much more vulnerable to supply-chain attacks. AI-generated computer code is rife with references to non-existent third-party libraries, creating a golden opportunity for supply-chain attacks that poison legitimate programs with malicious packages that can steal data, plant backdoors, and carry out other nefarious actions, newly published research shows. The study, which used 16 of the most widely used large language models to generate 576,000 code samples, found that 440,000 of the package dependencies they contained were “hallucinated,” meaning they were non-existent. Open source models hallucinated the most, with 21 percent of the dependencies linking to non-existent libraries. A dependency is an essential code component that a separate piece of code requires to work properly. Dependencies save developers the hassle of rewriting code and are an essential part of the modern software supply chain. These non-existent dependencies represent a threat to the software supply chain by exacerbating so-called dependency confusion attacks. These attacks work by causing a software package to access the wrong component dependency, for instance by publishing a malicious package and giving it the same name as the legitimate one but with a later version stamp. Software that depends on the package will, in some cases, choose the malicious version rather than the legitimate one because the former appears to be more recent. Also known as package confusion, this form of attack wasfirst demonstratedin 2021 in a proof-of-concept exploit that executed counterfeit code on networks belonging to some of the biggest companies on the planet, Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla included. It's one type of technique used in software supply-chain attacks, which aim to poison software at its very source in an attempt to infect all users downstream. “Once the attacker publishes a package under the hallucinated name, containing some malicious code, they rely on the model suggesting that name to unsuspecting users,” Joseph Spracklen, a University of Texas at San Antonio Ph.D. student and lead researcher, told Ars via email. “If a user trusts the LLM's output and installs the package without carefully verifying it, the attacker’s payload, hidden in the malicious package, would be executed on the user's system.” In AI, hallucinations occur when an LLM produces outputs that are factually incorrect, nonsensical, or completely unrelated to the task it was assigned. Hallucinations have long dogged LLMs because they degrade their usefulness and trustworthiness and have proven vexingly difficult to predict and remedy. In apaperscheduled to be presented at the 2025 USENIX Security Symposium, they have dubbed the phenomenon “package hallucination.” For the study, the researchers ran 30 tests, 16 in the Python programming language and 14 in JavaScript, that generated 19,200 code samples per test, for a total of 576,000 code samples. Of the 2.23 million package references contained in those samples, 440,445, or 19.7 percent, pointed to packages that didn’t exist. Among these 440,445 package hallucinations, 205,474 had unique package names. One of the things that makes package hallucinations potentially useful in supply-chain attacks is that 43 percent of package hallucinations were repeated over 10 queries. “In addition,” the researchers wrote, “58 percent of the time, a hallucinated package is repeated more than once in 10 iterations, which shows that the majority of hallucinations are not simply random errors, but a repeatable phenomenon that persists across multiple iterations. This is significant because a persistent hallucination is more valuable for malicious actors looking to exploit this vulnerability and makes the hallucination attack vector a more viable threat.” In other words, many package hallucinations aren’t random one-off errors. Rather, specific names of non-existent packages are repeated over and over. Attackers could seize on the pattern by identifying nonexistent packages that are repeatedly hallucinated. The attackers would then publish malware using those names and wait for them to be accessed by large numbers of developers. The study uncovered disparities in the LLMs and programming languages that produced the most package hallucinations. The average percentage of package hallucinations produced by open source LLMs such as CodeLlama and DeepSeek was nearly 22 percent, compared with a little more than 5 percent by commercial models. Code written in Python resulted in fewer hallucinations than JavaScript code, with an average of almost 16 percent compared with a little over 21 percent for JavaScript. Asked what caused the differences, Spracklen wrote: This is a difficult question because large language models are extraordinarily complex systems, making it hard to directly trace causality. That said, we observed a significant disparity between commercial models (such as the ChatGPT series) and open-source models, which is almost certainly attributable to the much larger parameter counts of the commercial variants. Most estimates suggest that ChatGPT models have at least 10 times more parameters than the open-source models we tested, though the exact architecture and training details remain proprietary. Interestingly, among open-source models, we did not find a clear link between model size and hallucination rate, likely because they all operate within a relatively smaller parameter range. Beyond model size, differences in training data, fine-tuning, instruction training, and safety tuning all likely play a role in package hallucination rate. These processes are intended to improve model usability and reduce certain types of errors, but they may have unforeseen downstream effects on phenomena like package hallucination. Similarly, the higher hallucination rate for JavaScript packages compared to Python is also difficult to attribute definitively. We speculate that it stems from the fact that JavaScript has roughly 10 times more packages in its ecosystem than Python, combined with a more complicated namespace. With a much larger and more complex package landscape, it becomes harder for models to accurately recall specific package names, leading to greater uncertainty in their internal predictions and, ultimately, a higher rate of hallucinated packages. The findings are the latest to demonstrate the inherent untrustworthiness of LLM output. With Microsoft CTO Kevin Scottpredictingthat 95 percent of code will be AI-generated within five years, here’s hoping developers heed the message.

    "title": "Monty Python and the Holy Grail turns 50",
    "article_text": "Ars staffers reflect upon the things they love most about this masterpiece of absurdist comedy. Monty Python and the Holy Grailis widely considered to be among the best comedy films of all time, and it's certainly one of the most quotable. This absurdist masterpiece sending up Arthurian legend turns 50 (!) this year. It was partly Python member Terry Jones' passion for the Middle Ages and Arthurian legend that inspiredHoly Grailand its approach to comedy. (Jones even went on to direct a 2004 documentary,Medieval Lives.) The troupe members wrote several drafts beginning in 1973, and Jones and Terry Gilliam were co-directors—the first full-length feature for each, so filming was one long learning process. Reviews were mixed whenHoly Grailwas first released—much like they were forYoung Frankenstein(1974), another comedic masterpiece—but audiences begged to differ. It was the top-grossing British film screened in the US in 1975. And its reputation has only grown over the ensuing decades. The film's broad cultural influence extends beyond the entertainment industry.Holy Grailhas been the subject ofmultiple scholarly papersexamining such topics as itseffectivenessat teaching Arthurian literature orgeometric thought and logic,thecomedic techniquesemployed, and whythe depictionof a killer rabbit is so fitting (killer rabbits frequently appear drawn in the margins of Gothic manuscripts).My personal favorite was a2018 tongue-in-cheek paperon whether the Black Knight could have survived long enough to make good on his threat to bite King Arthur's legs off (tl;dr: no). So it's not at all surprising thatMonty Python and the Holy Grailproved to be equally influential and beloved by Ars staffers, several of whom offer their reminiscences below. The Monty Python troupe famously madeHoly Grailon a shoestring budget—so much so that they couldn't afford to have the knights ride actual horses. (There are only a couple of scenes featuring a horse, and apparently it's the same horse.) Rather than throwing up their hands in resignation, that very real constraint fueled the Pythons' creativity. The actors decided the knights would simply pretend to ride horses while their porters followed behind, banging halves of coconut shells together to mimic the sound of horses' hooves—a time-honoredFoley effectdating back to the early days of radio. Being masters of absurdist humor, naturally, they had to call attention to it. Arthur and his trusty servant, Patsy (Gilliam), approach the castle of their first potential recruit. When Arthur informs the guards that they have \"ridden the length and breadth of the land,\" one of the guards isn't having it. \"What, ridden on a horse? You're using coconuts! You've got two empty halves of coconut, and you're bangin' 'em together!\" That raises the obvious question: Where did they get the coconuts? What follows is one of the greatest examples ofnerd-gassingyet to appear on film. Arthur claims he and Patsy found them, but the guard is incredulous since the coconut is tropical and England is a temperate zone. Arthur counters by invoking the example of migrating swallows. Coconuts do not migrate, but Arthur suggests they could be carried by swallows gripping a coconut by the husk. The guard still isn't having it. It's a question of getting the weight ratios right, you see, to maintain air-speed velocity. Another guard gets involved, suggesting it might be possible with an African swallow, but that species is non-migratory. And so on. The two are still debating the issue as an exasperated Arthur rides off to find another recruit. The best part? There's a callback to that scene late in the film when the knights must answer three questions to cross the Bridge of Death or else be chucked into the Gorge of Eternal Peril. When it's Arthur's turn, the third question is \"What is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?\" Arthur asks whether this is an African or a European swallow. This stumps the Bridgekeeper, who gets flung into the gorge. Sir Belvedere asks how Arthur came to know so much about swallows. Arthur replies, \"Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know.\" The pluckyBlack Knight(\"It's just a flesh wound!\") will always hold a special place in my heart, but that debate over air-speed velocities of laden versus unladen swallows encapsulates what makesHoly Graila timeless masterpiece. —Jennifer Ouellette \"Oh, it's just aharmless little bunny, isn't it?\" Despite their appearances, rabbits aren't always the most innocent-looking animals. Recent reports ofrabbit strikes on airplanesare the latest examples of the mayhem these creatures of chaos can inflict on unsuspecting targets. I learned that lesson a long time ago, though, thanks partly to my way-too-early viewings of the animatedWatership DownandMonty Python and the Holy Grail. There I was, about 8 years old and absent of paternal accompaniment, watching previously cuddly creatures bloodying each other and severing the heads of King Arthur's retinue. WhileWatership Down's animal-on-animal violence might have been a bit scarring at that age, I enjoyed the slapstick humor of the Rabbit of Caerbannog scene (many of the jokes my colleagues highlight went over my head upon my initial viewing). Despite being warned of the creature's viciousness by Tim the Enchanter, the Knights of the Round Table dismiss the Merlin stand-in's fear and charge the bloodthirsty creature. But the knights quickly realize they're no match for the \"bad-tempered rodent,\" which zips around in the air, goes straight for the throat, and causes the surviving knights to run away in fear. If Arthur and his knights possessed any self-awareness, they might have learned a lesson about making assumptions about appearances. But hopefully that's a takeaway for viewers of 1970s British pop culture involving rabbits. Even cute bunnies, as sweet as they may seem initially, can be engines of destruction:\"Death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.\" —Jacob May The most memorable songs fromMonty Python and the Holy Grailwere penned by Neil Innes, who frequently collaborated with the troupe and appears in the film. His \"Brave Sir Robin\" amusingly parodied minstrel tales of valor by imagining all the torturous ways that one knight might die. Then there's his \"Knights of the Round Table,\" the first musical number performed by the cast—if you don't count the monk chants punctuated with slaps on the head with wooden planks. That song hilariously rouses not just wild dancing from knights but also claps from prisoners who otherwise dangle from cuffed wrists. But while these songs have stuck in my head for decades, Monty Python's Terry Jones once gave me a reason to focus on the canned music instead, and it weirdly changed the way I've watched the movie ever since. Back in 2001, Jones told Billboard that an early screening for investors almost tanked the film. He claimed that after the first five minutes, the movie got no laughs whatsoever. For Jones, whose directorial debut could have died in that moment, the silence was unthinkable. \"It can't be that unfunny,\" he told Billboard. \"There must be something wrong.\" Jones soon decided that the soundtrack was the problem, immediately cutting the \"wonderfully rich, atmospheric\" songs penned by Innes that seemed to be \"overpowering the funny bits\" in favor of canned music. Reading this prompted an immediate rewatch because I needed to know what the first bit was that failed to get a laugh from that fateful audience. It turned out to be the scene where King Arthur encounters peasants in a field who deny knowing that there even was a king. As usual, I was incapable of holding back a burst of laughter when one peasant woman grieves, \"Well, I didn’t vote for you\" while packing random clumps of mud into the field. It made me wonder if any song might have robbed me of that laugh, and that made me pay closer attention to how Jones flipped the script and somehow meticulously used the canned music to extract more laughs. The canned music was licensed from a British sound library that helped the 1920s movie business evolve past silent films. They're some of the earliest songs to summon emotion from viewers whose eyes were glued to a screen. InMonty Python and the Holy Grail, which features a naive King Arthur enduring his perilous journey on a wood stick horse, the canned music provides the most predictable soundtrack you could imagine that might score a child's game of make-believe. It also plays the straight man by earnestly pulsing to convey deep trouble as knights approach the bridge of death or heavenly trumpeting the anticipated appearance of the Holy Grail. It's easy to watch the movie without noticing the canned music, as the colorful performances are Jones' intended focus. Not relying on punchlines, the group couldn't afford any nuance to be lost. But there is at least one moment where Jones obviously relies on the music to overwhelm the acting to compel a belly laugh. Just before \"the most foul, cruel, bad-tempered rodent\" appears, a quick surge of dramatic music that cuts out just as suddenly makes it all the more absurd when the threat emerges and appears to be an \"ordinary rabbit.\" It's during this scene, too, that King Arthur delivers a line that sums up how predictably odd but deceptively artful the movie's use of canned music really is. When he meets Tim the Enchanter—who tries to warn the knights about the rabbit's \"pointy teeth\" by evoking loud thunder rolls and waggling his fingers in front of his mouth—Arthur turns to the knights and says, \"What an eccentric performance.\" —Ashley Belanger I tried to make music a big part of my teenage identity because I didn't have much else. I was a suburban kid with a B-minus/C-plus average, no real hobbies, sports, or extra-curriculars, plus a deeply held belief that Nine Inch Nails, the Beastie Boys, and Aphex Twin would never get their due as geniuses. Classic Rock, the stuff jocks listened to at parties and practice? That my dad sang along to after having a few? No thanks. There were cultural heroes, there were musty, overwrought villains, and I knew the score. Or so I thought. I don't remember exactly where I found the little fact that scarred my oppositional ego forever. It might have been Spin magazine, a weekend MTV/VH1 feature, orthat Rolling Stone book about the '70s(I bought it for the punks, I swear). But at some point, I learned that a who's-who of my era's played-out bands—Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, even Jethro (freaking) Tull—personally funded one of my favorite subversive movies. Jimmy Page and Robert Plant, key members of the keg-rock conclave, attended the premiere. It was such a small thing, but it raised such big, naive, adolescent questions. Somebody had to pay forHoly Grail—it didn't just arrive as something passed between nerds? People who make things I might not enjoy could financially support things I do enjoy? There was a time when today's overcelebrated dinosaurs were cool and hip in the subculture? I had common ground with David Gilmour? Ever since, when a reference toHoly Grailis made, especially to how cheap it looks, I think about how I once learned that my beloved nerds (or theater kids) wouldn't even have those coconut horses were it not for some decent-hearted jocks. —Kevin Purdy I was young enough that I'd never previously stayed awake until midnight on New Year's Eve. My parents were off to a party, my younger brother was in bed, and my older sister had a neglectful attitude toward babysitting me. So I was parked in front of the TV when the local PBS station aired a double feature ofThe Yellow SubmarineandThe Holy Grail. At the time, I probably would have said my mind was blown. In retrospect, I'd prefer to think that my mind was expanded. For years, those films mostly existed as a source of one-line evocations of sketch comedy nirvana that I'd swap with my friends. (I'm not sure I've ever lacked a group of peers where a properly paced \"With... a herring!\" had meaning.) But over time, I've come to appreciate other ways that the films have stuck with me. I can't say whether they set me on an aesthetic trajectory that has continued for decades or if they were just the first things to tickle some underlying tendencies that were lurking in my not-yet-fully-wired brain. In either case, my brain has developed into a huge fan of absurdism, whether in sketch comedy, longer narratives likeArrested Developmentor the lyrics of Courtney Barnett. Or, let's face it, any stream of consciousness lyrics I've been able to hunt down. But Monty Python remains a master of the form, andThe Holy Grail'sconclusion in a knight bust remains one of its purest expressions. A bit less obviously, both films are probably my first exposures to anti-plotting, where linearity and a sense of time were really besides the point. With some rare exceptions—the eating of Sir Robin's minstrels, Ringo putting a hole in his pocket—the order of the scenes were completely irrelevant. Few of the incidents had much consequence for future scenes. Since I was unused to staying up past midnight at that age, I'd imagine the order of events was fuzzy already by the next day. By the time I was swapping one-line excerpts with friends, it was long gone. And it just didn't matter. In retrospect, I think that helped ready my brain for things likeCatch-22and its convoluted, looping, non-Euclidean plotting. The novel felt like a revelation when I first read it, but I've since realized it fits a bit more comfortably within a spectrum of works that play tricks with time and find clever connections among seemingly random events. I'm not sure what possessed someone to place these two films together as appropriate New Year's Eve programming. But I'd like to think it was more intentional than I had any reason to suspect at the time. And I feel like I owe them a debt. —John Timmer What an impossible task to pick just a single thing I love about this film! But if I had to choose one scene, it would be when a lost King Arthur comes across an old woman—but oops, it's actually a man named Dennis—and ends up in a discussion about medieval politics. Arthur explains that he is king because the Lady of the Lake conferred the sword Excalibur on him, signifying that he should rule as king of the Britons by divine right. To this, Dennis replies, \"Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.\" Even though it was filmed half a century ago, the scene offers a delightful send-up of autocracy. And not to be too much of a downer here, but all of us living in the United States probably need to be reminded that living in an autocracy would suck for a lot of reasons. So let's not do that. —Eric Berger Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Gundam GQuuuuuuX‘s Big Mystery Just Got Even Bigger",
    "article_text": "Gundam GQuuuuuuX‘s alternative universe spin on the world of the franchise’s beloved main timeline has already paved the way to some fascinatingly geeky riffs on the originalGundamseries. But as the show begins to move on from the immediate interest of the world it spun out of the events of the original show, where it’s heading could include playing with one of the 1979 classic’s most intriguing characters. So far, much ofÂGQuuuuuuX‘s alt-remixing ofÂGundam‘s Universal Centuryhas leaned heavily on the absence of certain focal characters from the original show. Char’s theft of the Gundam inthe inciting incidentÂ that turns theOne Year Warin Zeon’s favor means that so far original protagonist Amuro Ray has been left out of the picture, and so far both the show itself and the expanded material glimpsed in itsmovie compilationBeginninghave teased other major figures from the originalÂGundamand their parts to play in this new story. And that’s before Char’s own absence in the show’s main five-years-later story has become a driving factor to its core mystery, as both our young protagonists and their opponents in the Zeon forces alike try to discern just why the Red Comet’s stolen Gundam has returned after its disappearance. But one interesting 1979 figure’s absence fromÂGQuuuuuuXso far is becoming a central focus of the series’ own interpretation ofÂGundam‘s Newtype conceptâand its latest episode dropped our biggest hint yet that they’re going to make their presence in the series known insomeway at the very least. “The Witch’s War,” the fourth episode of the series (and our first to not explicitly re-cover material from theBeginningcompilation) primarily sees Machu and the Red Gundam’s latest pilot, Shuji, confront a One Year War veteran yearning for revenge against the Gundam. Having lost her own Mobile Suit combat partner (referred toas a “Mav”inÂGQuuuuuuX‘s terminology) at Char’s hands during the war, the mysterious “Witch” Shiiko Sugai eventually perishes in a clan battle against Machu and Shuji, when the latter makes the decision not to incapacitate her suit, but spear its chest with a beam saber, immolating Shiiko and destroying the enemy suit entirely to Machu’s horror. But just before Shiiko dies, both Machu and Shuji’s emergent Newtype connection resonates even more profoundly than it did upon their first meeting, not just granting them a moment to reach some kind of understanding with Shiiko in the moment of her death, but sending out a psychic message that onlookers hear as a didactic piece of music… one very familiar to classicGundamfans as the sing-song leitmotif of Lalah Sune. The leitmotif appeared briefly inÂGQuuuuuuXbefore when Machu first began to experience her own Newtype abilities, and inBeginningduring Char’s disappearance, but not in that diagetic sense, and not, as it’s referred to explicitly in the show itself this week, specifically as the “La-La Sound.” Introduced during the final stretch of the original 1979 anime, Lalah is an extremely powerful emergent Newtype, recruited by Char in the final stages of the One Year War as a secret weapon not just against the Gundam and Amuro’s own increasing awareness of his psionic abilities, but as part of Char’s own brewing attempts to usurp Zeon’s ruling Zabi family. Lalah, whose psionic abilities are heralded in battle by a haunting, ethereal chorus of “la-la” chanting that can be heard by both Newtypes and ordinary humans, eventually falls at Amuro’s hands while protecting Char, but not before she and Amuro share a profound moment of connection thanks to their Newtypism. It leaves a lasting impact on both men’s lives throughout the rest of their appearances acrossGundam‘s UC storytelling. Although Lalah’s role in the originalÂGundamis relatively brief, her legacy as one of the show’s first explorations of the Newtype concept, and her relationship to both Amuro and Char, makes her a fascinating figure forÂGQuuuuuuXto touch on. In the show’s alternate retelling of the One Year War, Lalah is noticeably absent from Char’s first learnings about Newtypism, leading to hispartnership with Challia Bull. But her presence here via her leitmotif, and now especially in its nature as a diagetic sound withinGQuuuuuuXitself, raises some very interesting possibilities about just where the show is heading. It’s not been the only clue that Lalah could be a part ofÂGQuuuuuuXwe’ve had so far, either. The framing of Shiiko’s death has direct parallels to the presentation of Lalah’s own death in the original show, just the latest in the series’ riffs on specific cinematography choices from the firstÂGundam, but “The Witch’s War” also returns to another idea briefly touched on byGQuuuuuuXbefore. In the series’ prior retelling of the One Year War, it was revealed that Zeon was keeping another mysterious object called the “Rose of Sharon” in secrecy, before it disappeared from under them just as Char vanished in the psionic “Zeknova” that ended the conflict. In “The Witch’s War,” Shuji states that his only desire is to bring the Red Gundam (which he constantly refers to as being in conversation with) to Earth, in search of a mysterious rose, presumably the same “Rose of Sharon” that Zeon were keeping secret. The Rose of Sharon itself is a biblical reference, appearing in versions of the Old Testament to describe a flower mentioned in the Song of Songs, but also a modern horticultural term, used to refer to several varieties of flowering plantâincluding the golden-flowered Hypericum calycinum, which certainly feels evocative of the flowing yellow dress Lalah wore in the original series. Whether we see her or not, or if she remains only part of this version of the originalGundam‘s world via her sing-song leitmotif, it’s already clear that any grand mystery thatÂGQuuuuuuXwants to play with with this new generation of Newtypes will connect all the way back to the original show’s first explorations of the concept. It seems then, as we get closer and closer to figuring out just what happened to Char in this version of events, the woman that would shape the rest of his life in the “main”Gundamcontinuity may have a similarly vital role inÂGQuuuuuuX.

    "title": "Gadgets Are Getting More Expensive, But Not Even Amazon Wants to Say ‘Tariffs’",
    "article_text": "U.S.-based consumers should have one expectation for the future: your tech will bemore expensive. The most obvious culprit is Trump’s tariffs, and already prices for TVs, wearables, PC gear, gaming devices, chargers and many more product categories demand more from your wallet than they did a month ago. Companies have made radical changes in their pricing structure without telling customers or even using the word “tariffs.” While big tech tries to keep in President Donald Trump’s good graces, the rest of the U.S. is going to pay for itâliterally. Some tech brands, such asAcer, have explicitly blamed tariffs for why they increased prices by 10% across the board for their products. Nintendo initially pulledpreorders of its Switch 2earlier this month, citing tariffs. Afteroffering a new preorder date, the company told customers it had raised the price of multiple controllers and other accessories. There are many, many more examples of stealth price gouging. This year’s slate of TVs, such as Sony’s Bravia 8 II, now cost $4,000 at 65 inches, when the previousA95L OLED displayfrom 2023 went for $3,500 at launch.Samsungâs latest 8K TV, the QN990F, will sell for $6,500 at 75 inches.Last yearâs QN900Dsat at $6,300 for the same size. Neither company has issued a statement about the reason for the increased costs, but we all know why. Even when theyâre caught raising prices, few companies will use the âTâ word out loud, whether thatâs out of concern for how consumers may react or in an effort to not catch the ire of America’s capricious chief executive. On Tuesday, retail giant Amazon was caught in a political firestorm of its own design. Punchbowl News, citing a single anonymous source, suggestedAmazon would display the tariff markupon each impacted product. That would be a big deal. CBSciteddata from analytics software maker SmartScout that showed sellers as big asAnkerâthe maker of popular home gadgets and portable chargersâhave raised prices an average of 30% since April 2, aka “Liberation Day.” It would have been one of the few pro-consumer actions the site most known for trying tokill off the independent bookstoreshas taken since its inception. Unfortunately for buyers, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has acushy relationship with Trump. After White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, âthis is a hostile and political act,â Amazon told Gizmodo the idea for âlisting import changes on certain productsâ was only a consideration for Amazonâs Temu and Shein clone,Amazon Haul. Both Amazon and Trumpâs reaction to the controversy point to one simple fact: products are getting more expensive, and few are willing to say how and why. The Trump world can live in their imaginary bubble where companies donât increase costs when faced with 145% tariffs from China, but companies themselves are hoping consumers wonât notice when prices are jacked up. As compiled byYouTuber Cameron Dougherty, PC accessory maker Logitech increased costs on nearly half of all its most popular gear, like the MX Vertical ergonomic mouse and MX Keys S, whose prices both went up by $20. Its G915 X Lightspeed TKL gaming keyboard went from $200 to $230. Logitech did not immediately respond to Gizmodoâs request for comment. Smaller brands and companies in more-niche hobbies have been more willing to talk about the impact of tariffs, but others have kept mum. MSI increased the cost of its gaming handhelds, the Claw 7 AI+ andClaw 8 AI+, by $100 to $900 and $1,000, respectively. I personally was in the middle of writing a review for the beastly MSI Titan 18 HX gaming laptop, only to learn that the computer company had increased the cost of its $5,000+ laptop by several hundred dollars. MSI did not respond to my queries about whether the price was due to tariffs. You would be lucky to buy an MSI product in the U.S. currently, and that’s a shame considering the handheld just received a performance boost through anupdateto Intel’s ARC 140V integrated GPU. In some cases, prices have gone up by closer to 50%. OnePlus shocked fans of its wearables earlier this month when it took its OnePlus Watch 3 from the expected $330 all the way to $450. In a statement shared with Gizmodo, OnePlus marketing head Spenser Blank said the company had updated the pricing for the Watch 3 from $500 to $350. This change was due to ârecent adjustments in our supply chainâ that âhave allowed us to pass some savingsâ to consumers.

Companies may be waiting to learn if Trump eventually backs down from his trade war targeting every landmass on Earth, whether it’s occupied by fellow humans or waddling penguins. The damage has already been done. Companies are far less likely to decrease prices to rates before Trump introduced tariffs. Many tech companies,like Apple, have already started to reorganize supply chains, moving manufacturing to India and away from countries that were harder hit by Trump tariffs. That costs money, and if every company is raising prices in tandem, we can only expect todayâs inflated costs to be our new normal.

    "title": "Andor‘s Tony Gilroy Knows You’re Tired of Waiting for K-2SO to Show Up",
    "article_text": "AsAndorseason twogets closer to the events ofRogue One: A Star Wars Story, one clever fan-fave droid has yet to make an appearance and there’s a pretty clear reason why. K-2SO, the Imperial security droid that towers over Diego Luna as Cassian Andor and is played by pop culture lucky charm Alan Tudyk, was one of the original film’s most demanding effects. And not because of the actor; the mechanics of the character’s presence simply required a lot. Showrunner Tony GilroyÂ explained to thethe Hollywood Reporterthat while he knows fans have been waiting for K-2SO’s origin story, it will pay off when the moment finally arrives onseason two ofÂ Andor. “[Limiting] K-2SO came from the experience of makingRogue, to be honest with you,â Gilroy shared. âFrom the very beginning, that was one of the most difficult parts of the original conversationâhow long I was going to have to delay [K-2SO]? Because what can you do with him?” “I donât want people to go back and diagramRogue, but just within that movie, there are two or three or four places where we are hiding himâwhere he has to stay on the ship or canât go somewhere. Heâs a really, really difficult piece of equipment to carry through a story. The limitations on him are huge. Heâs a very visible, troublesome piece of story gear. So I knew intuitively how long I would have to wait to do it.â He continued,Â  â[K-2SO] is fantastic and heâs funny. Tudyk is hysterical and itâs really great. We were like, âOK, weâre going to [have him in the show] and letâs make it spectacular and letâs really make a thing out of it.â And thatâs what weâve tried to do.â Gilroy teased.

    "title": "North Carolina Bill Would Require People to Share Their IDs With Social Media Companies",
    "article_text": "In North Carolina, legislators are considering a bill that wouldgrant consumers more controlover data collected and sold by companies. Great! Who can argue against that? But that’s not all it’s about. Following national trends, it would also set forth troubling age verification requirements for social media. Although pitched in a “save the kids” framing, these laws are likely to cause more harm than good. Last month, state senators Terry Brown (D) and Allen Chesser (R) introduced theNC Personal Data Privacy Act,which sets forth six consumer rights regarding personal data. Amongst them, people can request to see what information is being collected about them, correct inaccuracies, and opt out if companies are selling their data to third parties. Some information is exempt, like health information protected under HIPAA. In addition, companies don’t need to comply if doing so would reveal trade secrets. The bill seems to partially follow theConsumer Privacy Act of North Carolina, which was previously introduced in the state Senate but died in committee. However, Eric Null, co-director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Privacy & Data Project, told Gizmodo via email that the bill is “another example of industry-friendly privacy legislation” that offers little protection due to “weak data minimization protections (essentially restarting current law around deceptive practices) coupled with extremely broad exemptions.” Unlike its predecessor, this bill doesn’t solely focus on consumer privacy. In its second half, it also requires that social media establish “reasonable age verification methods” to prevent minors from creating accounts without parental permission. Under the law, social media platforms have to utilize third-party vendors to carry out this process. Approved methods include providing third parties with a driver’s license or another form of government-issued identification. There are some exceptions to this process, like gaming sites or platforms generating less than $100,000 in annual revenue. Age verification legislation is often associated with restricting porn access like with Texas’ HB 1181 that is now the center of aSupreme Court case. Last year, North Carolina even passed its own porn bill called the PAVE act. However, legislation extending age verification to social media has been popping up nationwide. In 2023,Arkansas passed its version, and numerous states are considering bills, includingMinnesota, which actually wants to implement anonymous verification, andPennsylvania. This year, U.S. senators also reintroduced theKids Off Social Media Actto federally mandate social media age verification. Anyone with an ounce of awareness would balk at this legislation, though. First off: They aren’t going to work. It’s already easy to get around age verification on porn websites. But according to Null, age verification is “privacy-invasive,” especially when it requires the use of a third-party vendor. “The requirement…benefits no one except age verification providers,” Null said. “To force such a thing is even more privacy-intrusive, as not only will the social media company likely have access [to] user IDs, so will service providers.” Although most bills ban social media platforms and/or vendors from retaining people’s information, you cannot guarantee it. Companies lie all the time about what data they have or how it is being used. (Which makes it a little ironic to slip age verification mandates into a bill that’s framed as data protection, but I digress.) In addition, data breaches are becomingincreasingly common,which can have real-world consequences like identity theft. Privacy advocates like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have also noted that age verification legislation willdisproportionately restrictalready marginalized communities. In the U.S., millions of adults either do not have or cannot receive a government ID. Thosemost affectedinclude low-income people, the elderly, young adults, and communities of color. Overall, while laws may seem like they’re addressing a problem, age verification just falls under the usual U.S. moral panic disguised as progress. data privacy Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Clown in a Cornfield‘s Director on Making Meaningful (but Still Gruesome) Horror Movies",
    "article_text": "The nameEli Craigmight not immediately ring a bell, but all genre fans knowTucker & Dale vs. EvilâCraig’s2010 horror comedyabout a pair of good ol’ boys who accidentally get pegged as killers, in a movie that pokes great fun at every cabin-in-the-woods slasher trope imaginable. Craig’s latest candidate for cult-classic status is about to hit theaters:Clown in a Cornfield, a gory tale set in a small Midwestern town that’s terrorized by… well, see title. io9 got a chance to talk to Craig all about clowns, cornfields, comedy, and why he prefers horror stories that weave surprisingly deep themes beneath all their splatter. Cheryl Eddy, io9:Clown in a Cornfieldhas some funny one-liners (and a funny title), but itâs really more straightforward than subversive. How did you approach finding the right tone while steering it in a less comedy-forward direction than your previous films? Eli Craig:I always am trying to surprise people, I guess, and it begins with the titleâthe reversal and surprising people. This film has these emotional elements that are deeper than both the title suggests, but also even the tone of the movie suggests. I love making movies that are kind of deep and don’t take themselves seriously at the same time. The title intrigued me; I had done a movie calledLittle Evilwith both a clown and a cornfield in it. And I thought, well, now it’s time to put these two elements together.Â There is comedy in this movie, but it really to me is like a horror action comedy. I broke out the comedy moments and took them away from the horror and the action so that they kind of stand almost on their own, so they don’t walk on each other. And it was a conscious decision because I really love action movies and I don’t want people to just think of me always as the really funny horror guy. But I think they might still think of me [that way] a little bit, so we’ll see.Â io9: Clowns are a well-loved horror staple, butClown in a Cornfield‘s Frendo has that extra layer of being a corporate mascot too. How did you bring both of those elements together to craft the character we see in the movie? Craig:I love the backstory of Frendo being this corporate mascot who was the salesman for Baypen Corn Syrup in the 1930s and â40s and â50s for Kettle Springs. We wanted to design a clown that was sort of happy-go-lucky, but over the years had grown more sinister. There’s just this metaphor for America in there for me. This film is very Americana. It’s based in this small town in Missouri that had a boom time because of their corn syrup operation in the â40s and â50s, and now has kind of fallen into disrepair.Â We wanted the clown to kind of emulate that. And the rage that comes from losing so much, from so much economic hardship, is built into the sinister grin of the clown. This is very much a film about this generational divide, and some of the anger that comes from Frendo toward the younger generation is really apparent in it.Â io9: I was going to ask you about the generation gap that we see in the movie. You mentioned earlier that it was important that the movie was about more than just a clown killing people. Why was it important to you to make sure there was a foundation in place? Craig:For me, I’m always looking for something that’s deeper. I’m weirdly kind of a thoughtful, deep person. Even withTucker & Dale, maybe one out of 10 people go, âOh wow, this is really a film about classism and social stratification.â I love absurdity with deep themes. I’ve always loved sort of existential philosophy and Theatre of the Absurd. And if I could combine the two and have a really fun, entertaining movie that you could look at twice and think, âWait a minute, this movie’s actually about things that are deeper than are on the surfaceââthat’s always my goal. io9: The movie has a sort of old tech/new tech theme to go with thatâthe kids making YouTube videos is a hobby the older people in town donât understand; thereâs also a perpetual lack of wifi or cell service, the main character is learning to drive a stick shift, etc. Was the rotary phone scene a genuine reaction?Â Craig:Yeah, it really was. I was always thinking in this film about how to pit the old against the new, and that the older generation didn’t really know how to use new technology and the younger generation didnât know how to use the older technology. All of these are things I came up with as we were moving along.Â As far as the reaction that goes to the phone, so much of this was just figuring outâI had written something about it, but figuring out how it was gonna be organic on the day. How would they just make it feel natural and not like a joke? Because to me, I want all of my jokes to play as a very real reaction and not like somebody just had a funny line to say in a script.Â So when Cassandra Potenza, who plays Janet, and Katie Douglas, who plays Quinn, ran up there, I was like, âJust try to work it out with the phone. Just try to figure out how you’re going to call out on this thing.â And they got the sense of it, so there’s a little bit of improv and a little bit of expectation that they’re not going to figure it out. So it just comes off very natural and real. io9: We talked about clowns. But cornfields also have a long and storied history in horror. What do you think is the single creepiest thing about a cornfield? And whatâs the biggest challenge that comes with filming in them? Craig:Well, the creepiest thing about a cornfield is that they grow up taller than your head. And within about 30 seconds in a cornfield, you can get lost. The first time I shot a scene, just one night, onLittle Evilin a cornfield, I had a crew member that wandered off to go to the bathroom and never came back. They just kind of got lost out there. And I learned a lot from thatâthat one corn stock looks like another.Â So when we’re running through the corn, we could just be running back and forth through the same bit of corn, as long as it doesn’t look like it’s damaged. And we would run through, damage one section of the corn, then lay down that row and run through another section. And the most difficult part of dealing with all that isâwell, multiple things. One is that corn is actually kind of sharp. It has these abrasive edges to it. So when the actors are running through it full sprint, they’re slashing through with their hands and little bits of corn can get in their eyes, and the husks and stuff. So there’s a joke in there where [Verity Marksâ character] Ronnie’s like, âOw, this corn hurts!â It’s something I wrote because as we were shooting, people were like âOw, this corn hurts!â I wanted to put that in there just in kind of a funny way. And it’s muddy and there’s weather; sometimes it was like minus 10 or 20 degrees because we were shooting in Winnipeg. So there’s all that, and bugsâit’s gritty out there! People sometimes view Hollywood as this bunch of prima donnas that are, like, catered to out there. But everybody on this film was so tough because it’s four in the morning, it’s minus 10 degrees, they have cuts all over their body from running through corn. And if you’re running through muck that fills up the soles of your boots; you can’t even really get any traction because all the mud sticks to the bottom of your shoes. So everybody on this was just so hardcore. You’d be surprised. io9: TheClown in a Cornfieldbook your movie is based on has two sequelsâwould you consider making a sequel film? Craig:Before I even shot this one, I read the second book and I figured out a tie-in from this movie that [went] into the second book. And then of course, when somebody has like three really good books written and has a series, and I just love Adam Cesare as an author, it’s exciting to think of what could come next.Â io9: Awesome, maybe a crossover with Tucker and Dale? Craig:I knowâTucker & Dale vs. Clown in a Cornfield. [Laughs] I think that there’s a lot of possibilities. I knew I had to grow my career out of the comedy horror world to get a chance to make more movies. So hopefully this will make people see that I’m more capable than just one thing. And then maybe I’ll get to doTucker & Dale 2. We’ll see. io9: I hope that does happen! Craig:I figure maybe itâll be my first feature film and my last feature film,Tucker & Dale 2, and we’ll all be shooting itâI’ll be an old man with the cane going âAction!â And Tucker and Dale [will both be] old men going through their sequel. [Laughs.] Or sooner, you know, who knowsâif this movie does well, it’ll help me make more movies. So go see it! Clown in a Cornfieldhits theaters May 9. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Bitcoin Mining Is No Longer Worth it",
    "article_text": "After a dip that coincided with when the stock market crashed (remember when Bitcoin was supposed to be a hedge against market volatility?), the cryptocurrency is pushing back up toward its all-time high. Despite that, it seems that mining for the cryptocurrency is no longer worth it, even for some larger mining operations. According todata recently published by CoinShares, the cost of electricity and computational power needed to mine for Bitcoin now often exceeds the actual value of the coin. Here’s how the math breaks down: For large mining companies, it now costs over $82,000 to mine a single Bitcoin, which is currently valued at about $95,000 at the time of publication. That is still technically profitable, though the margins have gotten mighty thin compared to where they were even just one quarter ago. It cost about $56,000 in the third quarter of 2024 to do the necessary computational calculations to mine for a Bitcoin,per CoinShares, so that price has jumped about 47% in just a few months. Of course, most people are not industrial miners. For smaller organizations, the equation leaves them underwater. For miners in the US who are operating at anything short of a massive scale, it is estimated the price is closer to $137,000 spent to mine for a single BTC. If you’re doing your mining in Germany, the math gets worse: it’ll run about $200,000 for a single coin. Neither price comes close to even Bitcoin’s all-time high, meaning you’ll have to take a loss up front and hold, hoping the cryptocurrency skyrockets to new highs in the future. The “why” of that sudden price discrepancy has a few prongs to it (and it’s worth noting that some have argued themath on mining hasn’t worked for a while now). The first is the rising cost of electricity, an issue that ishitting the United Statesand many nations overseasâthe result of inflation,Trump’s trade war, andincreased demand from high-usage technologieslike artificial intelligence. Those tariffs are also driving up thecost of mining equipment, too. There is also the fact thatBitcoin halved about a year ago, a process that lowers the reward for mining and is designed to slow the rate of new coins entering the market. So it’s getting more expensive to mine and there is less payout for doing so. For most people, nothing of value will be lost by Bitcoin mining ceasing to be profitable. But it does potentially exacerbate Bitcoin’s haves and have-nots problem. For a currency that is supposed to be decentralized and some sort of equalizer in a way that fiat isn’t, the wealth has largely accumulated at the top.According to BitInfoCharts, the top 1% of wallet addresses hold more than 90% of all BTC in circulation. If mining were ever an equalizer, it certainly isn’t now, given the cost. The rich get richer. BitcoinCryptoCryptocurrenciesMining Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Millennials are eagerly anticipating thesequel to the Y2K era Disney comedycomedyFreaky Friday,which is set to reuniteLindsay LohanandJamie Lee Curtisas the body-swapping mother-daughter duo. Don’t hold your breath for a Jodie Foster cameo, though: the star of the original 1976Freaky Friday, who did not appear in the remake, will also be givingFreakier Fridaya pass. That’s not for lack of trying, though. “We begged her,”Freakier Fridaydirector Nisha Ganatra toldÂEntertainment Weekly. “She’s not going to do it.” Ganatra added that she “never found out why.” As fans of the Lohan-Curtis family flick will recall, it didn’t at all lean into nostalgia for the 1976 original, so adding a Foster cameo here might have felt out of place. Ganatra told EW, “I think we were going to make her the principal at the school,” if original featured player Stephen Tobolowsky wasn’t able to return as Mr. Bates, a memorable antagonist in the 2003 film. The director continued: “Honestly, we tried everything. We were like, ‘What about this?'” but ultimately Foster turned them down. However, newcomer Julia Butters, who plays the Lohan character’s daughter, pays homage to Foster with “fun, amused, cool vibes” that are “inspired by Jodie Foster’s take on the character.” To be honest, forcing in a Foster cameo might have madeFreakier Fridayfeel overstuffed. Its story follows Anna (Lohan) on the verge of a huge life-changing moment, with Tess (Curtis) now a grandma to Anna’s Jodie Foster-ish teen.

    "title": "Scientists Discover a Massive, Glowing Blob of Hydrogen Very Close to Our Solar System",
    "article_text": "The birthplace of stars begins within large, cold clouds of gas and dust, which eventually collapse under the weight of gravity. Molecular clouds are vast cosmic entities that often stretch for hundreds of light-years, and scientists just discovered a massive one lurking in our celestial neighborhood. The cloud, named Eos after the Greek goddess of dawn, was discovered around 300 light-years away from our solar system. It is one of the largest single structures in the sky, and may be the closest molecular cloud to Earth, according to apaperpublished this week in Nature Astronomy. Because it’s so close, it offers astronomers a unique front row seat to the star-forming process and to observe the molecular universe. Stellar nurseries in our general galactic neighborhood lie along the surface of the Local Bubble, a large, hot cavity of plasma surrounded by a shell of gas and dust. In order to find the molecular clouds within that bubble, scientists have had to rely on observations of dust emissions. For the recent discovery, however, scientists found the nearby molecular cloud by detecting the fluorescent nature of hydrogen in the far-ultraviolet realm of the electromagnetic spectrum, according to the paper. “This is the first-ever molecular cloud discovered by looking for far ultraviolet emission of molecular hydrogen directly,â Â Blakesley Burkhart, a physics and astronomy professor at the Rutgers School of Arts and Sciences and lead author of the study, said in astatement. Molecular hydrogen, which is made up of two hydrogen atoms stitched together, is the most abundant molecule in the universe. It is also, however, difficult to detect as it glows in far ultraviolet wavelengths that get absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere. “The data showed glowing hydrogen molecules detected via fluorescence in the far ultraviolet,” Burkhart added. “This cloud is literally glowing in the dark.” Aside from its glowing appearance, Eos is crescent-shaped and sits on the edge of the Local Bubble. It spans an apparent size of 40 full Moons in the sky, and withÂ a mass that’s around 3,400 times that of the Sun. Using the same technique that revealed this previously invisible cloud, scientists could discover more hidden clouds across the Milky Way galaxy. “When we look through our telescopes, we catch whole solar systems in the act of forming, but we donât know in detail how that happens,” Burkhart said. “Our discovery of Eos is exciting because we can now directly measure how molecular clouds are forming and dissociating, and how a galaxy begins to transform interstellar gas and dust into stars and planets.” Solar Systemthe Sun Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "For as long as anyone can remember, Alex Jones has been ranting and raving about the rise of an authoritarian government in the U.S. For a very long time, Jones has also beena vocal supporterof Donald Trump. Now, as the Trump administration increasingly comes to resemble the authoritarian regime that Jones has long warned Americans about, the podcaster seems increasingly nonplussed by that turn of events. During arecent episodeof The Alex Jones Show, the conspiratorial podcaster discussed the recent actions taken by the White House with a vexed tone and a furrowed brow. Jones’ guest, self-identified white supremacist incel Nick Fuentes, also seemed quite disturbed by recent actions taken by the Trump administration. As Fuentes railed about the government’spolice-state style tacticsagainst protesters of Israel, Jones demurred that the real threat seemed to beTrump’s proposalto deport American citizens to Salvadoran prisons. Still, neither podcaster seemed able to decide what the bigger threat was: FUENTES: Â You have…1,500 people with a legal right to be here, they’re being expedited â their removal is being expedited for no reason other than they criticize the fact that, you know, we’re supporting this foreign war [Fuentes seems to be referencing the Gaza conflict]. JONES: Here’s where I’m at, though. In general, I see the whole, a lot of the populist conservative space spending half their time on this, and I just, I mean, I think it’s way more dangerous Trump saying we’re looking to deporting citizens to El Salvador. Now, that’s unconstitutional, and that is really bad. FUENTES: I agree with that. Then again though, I don’t think that’s a real policy. That hasn’t happened. What is really happening â JONES: Now they’re talking about using the Enemy Combatant Act to do it for regular crime. It’s â FUENTES: I don’t, I think that’s one of those throwaway comments. JONES: So you think it’s him trolling? FUENTES: I think they’re flooding the zone with poo like Bannon said. The fact that Fuentes and Jones, who both celebrated Trump’s political victory in November, are now expressing buyer’s remorse should tell you just how radical the current administration is. In recent weeks, Trump has given plenty of people on both sides of the political aisle cause for serious concern about the state of American democracy. Last week, ICE agentsarrested a Wisconsin judge,accusing her of obstructing an investigation into an illegal immigrant. While this would have been news enough on its own, many onlookers saw it as simplythe latest escalationin an ongoing fight between America’s judiciary and the White House. The courts have (so far) served as a check against the executive branch’s ever-ballooning view of its own powers, and Trump’s supporters have increasingly called for judges tobe impeachedandarrested. Meanwhile, the administration’s use of federal police power has continued to rattle Americans, as agencies like ICE aggressively crack down on an ever-broadening milieu of people. Case in point: This week, federal agents smashed into a home in Oklahoma, in an apparent effort to find certain “suspects.” The agents had the wrong house, but still managed to terrorize the woman and children living there, and also seized the family’s “phones, laptops and their life savings in cash as ‘evidence,'” localnews reported. The family says it doesn’t know when it will get its stuff back. The Trump administration also recently passedan executive orderthat will further wed federal police powers and state and local law enforcement. The order seeks tomobilize law firms(which the administrationhas also tangled with) to defend cops pro bono who are accused of misconduct. It also aims to âmaximize the use of Federal resourcesâ and channel it towards optimizing police departments while amping up âinvestment in the security and capacity of prisons.â Jones will surely not be the last MAGA adherent to question their allegiances to the rightwing billionaire in the months (and years) to come. He may be the most colorful, however. The podcaster also recently commented thatTrump likes to “guzzle” poop(in an apparent reference to Trump’s love of Diet Coke, which Jones said was laced with “GMO E. coli feces.” Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "DOGE Aide Involved in Dismantling Consumer Bureau Owns Stock in Companies That Could Benefit From Cuts",
    "article_text": "This story was originally published byProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up forThe Big Story newsletterto receive stories like this one in your inbox. A federal employee who is helping the Trump administration carry out the drastic downsizing of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau owns stock in companies that could benefit from the agencyâs dismantling, a ProPublica investigation has found. Gavin Kliger, a 25-year-oldDepartment of Government Efficiency aide, disclosed the investments earlier this year in hispublic financial report, which lists as much as $365,000 worth of shares in four companies that the CFPB can regulate. According to court records and government emails, he later helped oversee the layoffs of more than 1,400 employees at the bureau. Ethics experts say this constitutes a conflict of interest and that Kligerâs actions are a potential violation of federal ethics laws. Executive branch employees have long been subject to laws and rules that forbid them from working on matters that âwill affect your own personal financial interest.â CFPB employees are alsorequired to divest from dozens of additional, specific companiesthat engage in financial services and thus either are or could be subject to agency supervision, rulemaking, examination or enforcement. The CFPB oversees companies that offer a variety of financial services, including mortgage lending, auto financing, credit cards and payment apps. Two of the companies in which Kliger is invested â Apple and Tesla â are on the CFPBâs list of prohibited holdings. Two others â Bitcoin and Solana â arenât on the list but are nevertheless barred under agency guidance on investing in cryptocurrency firms. Court records show that Kliger was among a small handful of top CFPB and administration officials discussing the implementation of the layoffs in emails. Separately, a federal employee who works on the layoff team said that Kliger âmanagedâ the firings of about 90% of the bureauâs staff earlier this month, according to asworn declarationfiled by lawyers opposing the administration. The employee, using the pseudonym Alex Doe for fear of retaliation, said they learned of Kligerâs role from colleagues and described Kliger keeping the CFPB employees âup for 36 hours straight to ensure that the notices would go out,â the declaration states. âGavin was screaming at people he did not believe were working fast enoughâ and âcalling them incompetent.â Among those fired were the bureauâs ethics team, according to an agency lawyer, whowrote in an April 25 court filingthat âI am not aware of anyone remaining at the CFPB who has the requisite expertise to fulfill the CFPBâs federal ethics requirements.â Ethics experts said that getting rid of government regulators who oversee companies and set industrywide rules could impact the share price of the businesses subject to that regulation, since doing away with oversight can free companies from compliance costs and the exposure that stems from enforcement actions. âDestroying the CFPB is likely to have, I believe, a direct and predictable effect on his financial stock,â Kathleen Clark, an expert on government ethics at the Washington University in St. Louis, said of Kliger. Unionized bureau employees have sued the agencyâs acting director, Russell Vought, to stop the administrationâs efforts to wind down its operations and reduce its staff. The subsequent months of litigation have been head-spinning. At the end of March, a district court judge issued a sweeping stay on the administrationâs actions. Then on April 11, an appeals court in Washington, D.C., partially lifted that stay. In its order, the panel wrote that bureau leaders must conduct a âparticularized assessmentâ before firing workers. Days later, most of the agencyâs staff was notified that they were being fired. The bureauâs chief legal officer, Mark Paoletta, and two other lawyers conducted the court-ordered review, the government said in legal papers. In a recent filing, Paoletta wrote that the administration is attempting to achieve a âstreamlined and right-sized Bureau.â Instead of 248 enforcement division employees and 487 in the supervision division, he wrote, he planned to keep 50 workers in each. But on Monday evening, amid vigorous dispute over the legality of the firings and the definition of âparticularized assessment,âthe appeals court backtracked, upholding the trial courtâs initial stay on the mass layoffs as the case plays out. The CFPB then notified the more than 1,400 employees whoâd been laid off that their firings were being rescinded. The lawsuit is ongoing, with oral arguments before the appeals court scheduled for next month. Kliger didnât respond to voicemails or emails seeking comment for this story. The CFPB didnât respond to a request for comment. In a statement, the White House said that âthese allegations are another attempt to diminish DOGEâs critical mission.â Kliger âdid not even manageâ the layoffs, the statement said, âmaking this entire narrative an outright lie.â Asked to clarify Kligerâs role in the administration’s cuts, a spokesperson said, âYou have 90 days from the start date to divest which is May 8th â it is only April 28th.â Itâs unclear what rule the White House was referencing; the spokesperson did not respond to follow-up questions. But ethics experts said there are two scenarios that could apply: Sometimes, high-level government officials pledge to divest their holdings by a certain date to avoid conflicts of interest. And at theCFPB in particular, regulations giveemployees 90 days to divest prohibited holdings. In either case, though, the employee is required to recuse themselves from any actions that could affect their investments. Delaney Marsco, a government ethics expert at the Campaign Legal Center, said Kligerâs holdings and his involvement in winding down the agency erode the publicâs faith that government officials are serving its best interests. âWhen you have these facts, it raises the question, which is just as bad as when you have the actual violation because it makes the public question,â she said. Kliger owns between $15,000 and $50,000 of stock in Apple, which the CFPB regulates. The company agreed to pay a$25 million civil penaltylast October following a bureau investigation into Apple Card, a credit card in the companyâs software. The bureau said that Apple did not have a proper transaction dispute system when it launched and also that it misled some customers about its financing. The company ââagreed to the consent order, records show, âwithout admitting or denying any of the findings of fact or conclusions of law.âIn a statement at the time, Apple said that âwhile we strongly disagree with the CFPBâs characterization of Appleâs conduct, we have aligned with them on an agreement.â Kliger also owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of Tesla stock. The company, founded by DOGE boss Elon Musk, falls under the bureauâs purview because it offers financing, a key area of scrutiny for the CFPB. Kliger also owns cryptocurrencies: between $1,000 and $15,000 of Solana and between $15,000 and $50,000 of Bitcoin. Any federal worker who âholds any amount of a cryptocurrency or stablecoin may not participate in a particular matter if the employee knows that particular matter could have a direct and predictable effect on the value of their cryptocurrency or stablecoins,â according to alegal memo issued in July of 2022, under then-President Joe Biden, by the independent federal agency tasked with advising executive branch employees on how to avoid conflicts of interests. An internal notice to CFPB employees the following month instructed anyone with such a holding to âimmediately recuse yourself from working on any Bureau particular matter,â report the ownership and divest within 90 days, records reviewed by ProPublica show. Since the beginning of President Donald Trumpâs second presidency, the administration has sought to significantly reduce the size, scope and nature of Americaâs consumer watchdog, which was created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. ProPublica reported last month thatdozens of investigations the agency had launched were stalled amid stop-work orders. In a recent court filing that supplements a newly released policy memo, Paoletta wrote that, in recent years, âthe Bureau has also engaged in intrusive and wasteful fishing expeditions against depository institutions and, increasingly, non-depository institutionsâ and that it had âpushed into new areas beyond its jurisdiction such as peer-to-peer lending, rent-to-own, and discrimination as unfair practice.â AppleBitcoinDOGEElon MusksolanaTESLA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "article_text": "Clearly, Deadpoolwill be coming back tothe Marvel Cinematic Universe. The only question iswhen and where. It’s a secret Marvel is guarding closely and the company seems worried that disclosures in theongoing Blake Lively-Justin Baldonidispute could ruin the surprise. In a new document reported on byDeadline, lawyers representing Marvel and Disney explain that releasing documentsregarding the development of Nicepool, a character inDeadpool & Wolverine,could be detrimental to the company. âThe requested documents are particularly sensitive because they relate to the development of a character in an ongoing movie franchise,â the letter reads. âMarvel has built the success of the MCU in large part by interconnecting storylines, plots, and characters across its titles, including âcrossoverâ events and sequels. Whether and how such elements will appear in upcoming, unreleased projects is the subject of much public interest, and this information is closely guarded by Marvel.â This all started in 2024 when Lively accused herIt Ends With Usco-star and director of misconduct while making the film. Baldoni countersued and it’s all been a big mess. Soon, Lively’s husband Ryan Reynolds was brought into it alongside claims that the character of Nicepool was created as a subtle dig at Baldoni. Investigation into that meant Marvel might have to release documents regarding the development of the film and that’s how this week’s letter came to be. It’s hoping to not have to do that. You can read much, much more about it over atDeadline. But, as is often the case with legal things, it’s all very awkwardly worded and full of jargon. For us, the story boils down to Marvel is clearly planning to bring Deadpool back at some point and wants to keep that information guarded. Whether or not the information stays guarded, however, remains to be seen. When do you think Deadpool will be popping back up in the MCU?Avengers: Secret Warsin 2027 seems like the best bet, right?

    "article_text": "One Piecehero Monkey D. Luffy and his Straw Hat Crew have docked their ship for an appearance exclusively at Universal Studios Hollywood. And if thegrandline almost out of the theme park gates is any indication, Universal Fan Fest Nights tickets might become as sought-after as the One Piece itself. In collaboration with Universal Studios Japan, which has for years featuredOne Pieceas part of its live entertainment and character meetings, the Straw Hat Crew face characters have made their way stateside for a limited time as part of the after-dark ticketed event. Universal Fan Fest Nights aims to be Hollywood’s theme park response to having something like Halloween Horror Nights, but in the spring and well… not terrifying for a change, with popular fandoms taking over the parks alongside the pirates includingStar Trek,Dungeons & Dragons,Back to the Future, and more . io9 was able to attend the opening weekend of Universal Fan Fest Nights and without a doubt the most popular offerings were all related to the hit manga and anime from the mind of artist Eiichiro Oda. View this post on Instagram The Grand Pirate Gathering is on the main entrance’s thoroughfare just as you pass Universal Studios Hollywood’s production plaza and around the area between it and the DreamWorks theater (which is hosting aJujutsu Kaisenscreening attraction experience). There you’ll find the fun meet and greets that do bottle neck the way to the other experiences on the lower lotsâyou’ll fight for your life to get to travel back in time to Hill Valley. One Piecefans flocked to meet Monkey D. Luffy, Sanji, Nami, Zoro, and Usoppall night. I have to say the demand surpassed expectations and that since Universal Creative missed the boat on bringing theOne Piecestage show, which is a staple summer overlay at Universal Studios Japan on theWaterworldarena, it should definitely bring it to the states next year. Fan Fest Nights might even coincide with the live-action show’s highly anticipated season two return. The best part of the character interactions, however, is when they’re not separated for photos. Sanji goes up to Luffy’s staging area and gets the crowd to yell “Luffy, meal time!” and they just capture the right energy of friendship needed for the Straw Hats. Zoro wanders off, Nami helps them navigate where to go while they yell “Meat” over and over. And there were so many hugs and picking on each otherâit was amazing to see them behave as if they jumped right out of the anime. Fans of all ages were in awe at the excellent work Universal put in to bring the Straw Hats to life. View this post on Instagram The lines at Production Plaza’s food stations to get a taste of Sanji’s cooking, as well as other Straw Hat Crew-inspired treats, were the longest of the night. I wasn’t able to grab something until right before closing as a late night snack. But thankfully I was able to get the items I most was seeking. The savory option I went with was Sanji’s Chicken Adobo, which for theme park food fare was solid and perfectly seasoned, not too dry on the chicken and had some good starchy sides for energy if you’re able to get it early. If you’re going for more than theOne Pieceofferings, you’re gonna need it. There was also the refreshing non-alcoholic Nami’s Tangerine Breeze, which was a delightful tasty tart mocktail. And finally I got to try my most anticipated dessert, the Devil Fruit concha, a Mexican sweet-bread inspired take on the fruit that gave Luffy his gum-gum powers. The classic soft bread was light and fluffy with fruit filling that was not as intense as the super cute but super sweet and giant Chopper Cupcake. Overall, it was solid food for the fandom’s first outing stateside. Yes, yes, we all wish there was a more elevated Baratie curated meal for Sanji’s cuisine (next time), but since heiscooking for more masses here we’ll give it a pass. The remaining dates for Universal Fan Fest Nights’ after-dark event at Universal Studios Hollywood are May 2-4, 9-11, and 15-18. Ticket infohere. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Apple’s Second-Biggest Supplier Says to Expect Empty Shelves Due to Trump Tariffs",
    "article_text": "So far, the impact of Donald Trump’s trade war with China has mostly only been felt in the markets. The worst is yet to come for consumers, according to Pegatron, a Taiwanese company that plays a key role in the supply chain of Apple and other electronics companies like Dell. An executive from the company,speaking to Reuters, warned that Trump’s on-again, off-again, add another 25% for retaliation approach to tariffs will likely lead to shortages as we head toward summer. “Within two months, shelves in the United States … might resemble those in third-world countries, where people visit department stores and markets only to find empty shelves, all because everyone is waiting and seeing,” Pegatron chairman T.H. Tungtold Reuters. Obviously, the extremely high 145% tariff that the US placed on China plays a major role in the potential shortfall of devicesâthat’s a pretty major tax for companies to pay and likely pass onto consumers. But the bigger issue may simply be the uncertainty around what exactly the Trump administration is going to do next, which makes it difficult for any company to plan more than a few months ahead. “We won’t immediately adjust our long-term plans just because of two or three months of tariff changes. Manufacturing bases require long-term planning,” Tungsaid. You can see this play out pretty clearly with Apple. When Trump first announced his “reciprocal” tariffs earlier this month, which initially included a 34% tax on imports from China, Apple started scrambling to move its current stock and manufacturing supply chain around in a way that would minimize the pain. The companymoved $2 billion worth of iPhonesfrom India to the US before the tariffs hit, and then started the pretty complicated process ofshifting manufacturing out of China(as Trump cranked the tariffs all the way up to a cartoonish 145% tax) to India, where tariffs are 10%. Even India could seean additional 26% added by Julyif no deal is struck. About two weeks into the trade war, Trump announced his administrationwouldexempt devices like smartphones and computersfrom the current tariff regime, which provided a reprieve to companies like Apple and their suppliers…for exactly one day, before Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said actually that is only temporary andnew sector-specific tariffs will go into effect in a month or two. What will that tariff be? Will it ever actually come to fruition? And if it does, how long will it stay? No one knows. You just gotta guess. Obviously, that is not exactly how these companies with massive, international supply chains like to operate. So inevitably, they are going to wait and see before committing to any major shift. That meanssupply is likely to thin outin the meantime. So if you stop into an Apple Store in June, don’t be surprised if the display models are the only iPhones in the building.

    "article_text": "Yes, it’s true. The thirdNow You See Meis coming out later this year and it is, in fact, calledNow You See Me: Now You Don’t.But having finally embracedthis franchise’s most exciting title treatment, the question becomes, can it live up to that? The first trailer is here to help answer that question and it sure seems likely. Directed by Ruben Fleischer (Zombieland, Uncharted, Venom),Now You See Me: Now You Don’tsees the Four Horseman(Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, and Woody Harrelson) teaming up with a new team of magicians (Dominic Sessa, Justice Smith, and Ariana Greenblatt) to take down an evil crime syndicate lead by Rosamund Pike. Check out the trailer. For the most part, this looks like more of the same: characters doing big, elaborate magic tricks as a way to battle the bad guys. Which, honestly, is fine with us. As long as this franchise can keep giving us fun twists and turns along with cool, probably impossible magic tricks performed by all these excellent actors, we are here for it. And this trailer looks like it’s all that and more. Noticeably absent from this trailer, however, is Mark Ruffalo, who was such a prominent part of the previous two films. At the end of the last film, he was given a promotion by Morgan Freeman’s character, Thaddeus. We have to assume there was some scheduling issue and the film will address his absence but, even with everyone else in this one, it’s a little upsetting. We love us some Ruffalo.

    "title": "White House Panics After Report Claims Amazon Will Display Tariff Prices",
    "article_text": "White House officials held a press conference Tuesday morning to talk about the economy, as Americans get extremely nervous about the tariffs on China that are starting to cause prices to rise. And while Trump’s goons put on a brave face, it was clear they’re in panic mode. In fact, one question about Amazon really got them flustered. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted things were all going according to plan, even though Americans are starting to see 145% surchargesadded to their shipmentsfrom Chinese retailers like Temu, Shein, and AliExpress. But when a reporter asked about a report fromPunchbowlon Tuesday that Amazon would be listing tariff costs when consumers check out, Leavitt flipped her lid. “This is a hostile and political act by Amazon,â saidLeavitt. “Why didn’t Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?” Amazon probably didn’t add an “inflation” surcharge during the Biden years because that’s not a real thing that any normal person thinks of doing. But it’s very easy to add a tariff line because we know exactly how much that is going to cost consumers. In the case of Trump’s 145% tariff on goods from China, it’s going to be 145%. Leavitt went on to hold up a printout of a Reuters articlefrom 2021titled “Amazon Partnered With China Propaganda Arm.” The article notes that Amazon was marketing a collection of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s speeches and writings on its online store in China about two years earlier. The crux of the story is that Amazon disabled reviews in the country after Chinese officials complained about negative reviews and added a page called China Books that promoted materials favorable to the government. Leavitt didn’t really provide any context for why she was talking about this story from years earlier, but clearly intended for the headline to be damning in its insinuations about collaboration with the Chinese government. But it looks like that report about Amazon listing tariffs wasn’t true. Or, at least things changed after the story broke. Reached for comment on Tuesday after the White House press conference, Amazon told Gizmodo that it won’t actually be adding a tariff line item to purchases. “The team that runs our ultra low cost Amazon Haul store considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products. This was never approved and is not going to happen,” Amazon spokesperson Tim Doyle said in a statement. CNNreportsthat Trump called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos after the Punchbowl news story landed Tuesday morning. A White House official told CNN that Trump was “pissed” adding “Why should a multi-billion-dollar company pass off costs to consumers?” Well, that part seems obvious to anyone with a basic understanding of economics. If the cost of importing goods is going up 145%, Amazon isn’t going to just eat that entire charge. They’re going to raise prices for consumers. White House advisor Stephen Miller was asked about the Amazon pricing controversy on Fox News and tried to play it off like as no big deal. “I’ll just take Amazon’s statement at face value, which is that they said this is an idea that had been discussed, was not being actioned, and now we can take heart in knowing that they formally rejected the idea,” Miller said. Miller was then asked about whether Trump had indeed called Bezos and the White House advisor laughed it off, insisting that things worked out just fine in the end. ROBERTS: I understand there might’ve been a phone call from the president to Jeff Bezos on this this morning STEPHEN MILLER: I have no news to add on it. All I can say is things worked out exactly as they should.

He solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing and he’s a good guy.” “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific,” Trump said about calling the Amazon founder regarding tariff prices being added to the site. “He solved the problem very quickly and he did the right thing and he’s a good guy.” [image or embed] â Matt Novak (@paleofuture.bsky.social)April 29, 2025 at 12:23 PM The consumer confidence index fell this month for the fifth straight month in a row, according to theAssociated Press. And if you take a quick look at the calendar, five months ago was November, the same month Trump was elected. Bessent was asked Tuesday about supply chains that are expected to break down in the coming weeks, as ships from China have basically stopped leaving for U.S. ports. But the Treasury Secretaryinsistedthat everything would be fine since he imagined businesses have already planned ahead for any disruptions. “I wouldn’t think that we would have supply chain shocks,” said Bessent. “And I think retailers that have managed their inventory in front of this. I speak to dozens of companies sometimes daily, but definitely weekly, and they know that President Trump is committed to fair trade and have planned accordingly.” Bessent has made this same argument repeatedly in recent days. He asserts that there won’t actually be supply chain shocks because every business knew this was coming and should’ve planned appropriately. That argument ignores the fact that it’s difficult to just find a new supplier for inexpensive Chinese goods in less than a month, if you’re able to do that at all by some miracle. Adidas warned Tuesday it would soon beraising priceson goods for Americans. And some companies are already doing layoffs over the economic situation, with shipping company UPS announcingTuesdayit was cutting 20,000 jobs from its 490,000-person workforce. The company said in a regulatory filing that it was “in connection with our anticipation of lower volumes” from Amazon, the company’s largest customer. Trump has claimed that he’s signing new trade deals with every country, given the fact that even America’s closest allies have been hit with a 10% tariff. But there’s scant evidence that any trade deal is anywhere close to being completed. Bessent keeps teasing the idea that deals are almost done with Japan and India, but the timing on when those could be done isn’t clear at all. Trump has also said he’s negotiating with China, but that doesn’t seem to be true either. âLet me make it clear one more time that China and the U.S. are not engaged in any consultation or negotiation on tariffs,â Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said Monday, according toCNBC. Fox News, Trump’s favorite TV channel, has done its best to sell the idea that these tariffs are good, but even there, we’re starting to see some dissent. Dana Perino, a host on the network and former press secretary for the White House under George W. Bush, said onTuesday that she doesn’t like tariffs and is worried about how small businesses are going to do under them. “I think that it’s one thing as a consumer to say I will be able to accept the pain,” Perino said. “But the small- and medium-sized business owner, who right now are looking at the possibility of losing everything that they’ve worked for in the next four to six weeks, is very real.” There’s understandably been a fixation on tariffs this week, as Americans are starting to learn about how they will soon pay more for just about everything. But Trump is also working hard to make the United States an unlivable hellhole in other ways. The president’s regime is terrorizing immigrant communities, jailing political dissidents likeRumeysa Ozturk, who did nothing more than write an op-ed against the war in Gaza, and kicking pediatric cancer patientsout of the countrywithout their medications. Trump’s FBI also arrested ajudge in Wisconsinlast week for allegedly not doing enough to help ICE detain an immigrant in her courtroom. And the president signed an executive order on Monday that experts warn will furthermilitarizeAmerican police. A recent poll fromPRRIshows that 52% of Americans agree with the statement that Trump is a “dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” The president’s approval rating is in the toilet, and Trump’s right-hand oligarch, Elon Musk, is getting similar marks, with just35% of Americansapproving of his obliteration of the government with DOGE. Yes, Trump is hurting everything good about America. But at least everything’s going to be much more expensive soon. America truly shot itself in the foot by electing Trump again. And with Trump promising to stay in office illegally after 2028, there’s no telling when the madness may end. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX‘s Director Dreams of Converting Zoomers Into Retro Mech Anime Fans",
    "article_text": "Mobile Suit GundamÂ is aÂlegendary anime seriesthat has become virtually inseparable from the mecha genre, serving as its stalwart, definitive cornerstone for over 45 years. The anime has also mastered the elusive art ofÂcross-appeal, presenting anextensive catalogue of shows, some unfolding indifferent continuities, that provided agateway for anime fans to dip their toes into the engrossing world ofmodel kit building, and vice versa, years beforePokÃ©monadopted a similar approach. Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuXÂ sees Bandai Namco, longtime studio Sunrise, and studio Khara, known forEvangelion, joining forces in a dream collab for old head anime fans losing their collective giant robot-loving minds, and rightfully so. The new series, now streaming on Prime Video, is helmed by Kazuya Tsurumaki, a seasoned director known for his work as an assistant director onNeon Genesis Evangelionand asÂdirector ofFLCL,Gunbuster 2: Diebuster,Â and theRebuild of Evangelionfilms. Joining him asGQuuuuuuX‘s screenwriters are renownedEvangelioncreatorHideaki Anno as well as Yoji Enokido, whose resume includes working onEvangelion,Sailor Moon,FLCL, andRevolutionary Girl Utena. But wait, there’s more: adding to the powerhouse team is Ikuto Yamashita, acclaimed for his designs inEvangelionand his recent contributions to Atlusâ hit RPGMetaphor: ReFantazio, who headsGQuuuuuuX‘s mech design. The anime also features character designs by the famedPokÃ©mondesigner, Take. In short, many talented hands have touched this anime, setting it up to reach the same heights asGundam‘s last big hit. GQuuuuuuXrevolves around three youngsters in a space colony: Yuzuriha Amate, known by her nickname Machu; Nyaan, a mysterious young refugee and tech smuggler shrouded in mystery; and Shuji, an enigmatic boy whose destiny becomes intertwined with theirs. Their journey leads them to uncover the titular mobile suit, propelling them into the adrenaline-fueled world of underground mech duels known as Clan Battles. We had the opportunity to sit down with director Tsurumaki to uncover how the anime’s star-collaboration took shapeâand explore how their creative philosophies converged (and occasionally clashed) to bring to life a brand new anime they hope will be a standout entry inGundam‘s illustrious legacy. Isaiah Colbert, io9: What were the biggest hurdles in honoring the legacy ofMobile Suit Gundamwhile forging a bold new narrative inGQuuuuuuX? Kazuya Tsurumaki:To be honest with you, when we initially proposed this idea to Bandai Namco, we thought they would turn us down, but they actually said, “Okay, we’ll do it.” In fact, it was very unusual that an outside studio would be doing this kind of production. I suppose Bandai Namco was actually looking and wanting to have this kind of bold idea of proposals, so it turned out to be a really good win-win for both sides. io9:Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuXstands out not only for itsPokÃ©mon-esque aesthetic, elevated by Takeâs artistic touch, but also for the powerhouse creative team behind it. With you at the helm as director, alongside Hideaki Anno and Yoji Enokido contributing to the script, the project feels like a fusion ofFLCL,PokÃ©mon, andEvangelion, all within the legendaryGundamuniverse. How did this unique collaboration come about? Tsurumaki:I had known Mr. Anno and Enokido-san for more than 10 years. We worked from before, so it was quite easy to collaborate with them. With regards to Take-san, that was a bit of an adventure. Outside of Japan, he’s very well known forPokÃ©mon, but I’ve personally known him long before that. I’ve been a longtime fan of [his] when he was still doing illustrations for novels and books. This was a great opportunity to be able to work with him, and I was very eager to give this offer to him. io9: As the series director, having worked with many of these creatives before, was it ever challenging to unify your distinctive artistic styles, writing, and creative visions to ensureGQuuuuuuXmaintained a cohesive visual identity, or was it an easygoing collaborative experience? Tsurumaki:For our generation,Gundamis known to almost everyone. At least if you’re a boy, you are most likely fans ofGundam. Among the staff members, there was none that were unfamiliar withGundam. However, each and every person hadGundamÂ of their own. We were watching the sameGundam; however, in their hearts, in their minds, they all had different types ofGundam. What we thought was common understanding, we began to see some discrepancies the further [we went] into the details, the further [we wanted] to be precise and accurate. If we hadn’t realized there were discrepancies in our understanding ofGundam, we would have ended up in a completely different direction. If there were a lot of details that we wanted to share the understanding of, then we would have to intentionally describe them in words or maybe in pictures, so that we can actually have a common understanding. That was the challenging part: our understanding ofGundamwas actually very different. io9: Can you give me an example of what some of the discrepancies were that the team encountered in their own lived experience with the series that didn’t mesh with other people’s interpretations of the anime?Â Tsurumaki:From someone on the outside, this may sound like a very trivial issue, but for me and Mr. Enokido, we were working together for a long time, very frequently. Even if we were not working, even on a casual occasion, we would be talking aboutGundam. But when we were working together this time, for the first timeâbetween two mobile suits called the GM and the Rick Domâwe were discussing which is more powerful. This was the occasion when we first realized there were more discrepancies in our understanding of which was more powerful. Depending on which was more powerful or state of the art, we would have to discuss which would come into the scene first. There was a difference in opinion, and we actually had argued over which was stronger. io9:GQuuuuuuX,at least in the West, has a huge groundswell because of its reinterpretation of Challia Bull, a character that didn’t get a lot of play in the original series. Was he a favorite among the staff for characters to bring back, or was there another more popular character? Tsurumaki:He was around for a long time, but I think there were other characters that were more major, slightly more popular, likeRamba RalorGarma Zabiwe could have probably usedâor maybe evenMatilda Ajan. They would’ve been even more advantageous, beneficial, or interesting if we had used them, but I really like this character, Challia Bull. I proposed him, and surprisingly, everyone said, “Oh, that sounds really good. I like it.” It was quite interesting to find out that it wasn’t just me, but others thought it would be interesting to use Challia Bull. io9: The anime and its theatrical release,Beginning, open in different erasâone starting in 0085 with Amate, while the film begins in 0079 with Char Aznable. What led to the decision to structure the sequence of events differently? Tsurumaki:It was a television series that we had planned for in production, and the film release was decided later on. We were planning, in the first episode, to start with 0085 and then maybe do a five-minute showing of 0079. In the end, we decided to do the film as an advanced title, so it kind of became independent.Â When we were reconstructing [GQuuuuuuX] for a movie, we did it in a sequential order from 0079 to 0085. But, I guess because it was originally made for the television series, [Beginning] turned out to be different. io9: In what ways did your past directorial works help shape your creative approachÂ toGQuuuuuuX? Tsurumaki:In the past, there used to be a lot of robot animations in Japan, but you hardly see them todayâI would say it’s mainlyGundamand a few others. I have a long track record of doing robotic animations, [including]Gunbuster 2, andEvangelion,until just recently, so I was quite familiar with working on them. io9: In an interview from theMaterials Crosstalk, mechanical designer Ikuto Yamashita mentioned that the team deliberately stripped down the “character-like” qualities from the mobile suits. Could you discuss the process of bringing that vision to life through 3D mechanical designs, and what direction you were given to achieve the more mechanically dynamic gyroscopic movements ofGQuuuuuuXâs mobile suit designs? Tsurumaki:With regards to mobile suit designs, I delegated to Yamashita for him to work on it. I encouraged him to propose ideas, and that’s what he did. For example, we wanted to make these mobile suits something that you would wear in order to be very active in the universe. This time, we have a propellant tank that was embedded in the mobile suits, and I thought that was great. Additionally, originally, mobile suits varied depending on the character. But Mr. Yamashita wanted to make it more mechanical; he, for example, designed the head in a way that would look as though there were a lot of sensors concentrated in the head, rather than the concept of someone’s face. I really liked that idea as well. io9: Looking back on your time directingGQuuuuuuX, what kind of legacy do you hope it carves out for itself within the franchise? Tsurumaki:Gundamis a series that has a long history. I watched it as a child, and it has continued on. It’s been around a long time. However, the generation of fans has really been extended. We now have many young generations who have never even watched the firstGundam. I think the firstGundamis extremely interesting, so I really want the young people to watch it because I know they will find it interesting as well. Thankfully, we have subscriptions where you can watch it anywhere, anytime. In the past, if a show was no longer on television, you could no longer watch it. I hope that the new generation could also watch the oldGundamas well. If that is materialized, I would be really happy. Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuXis streaming on Prime Video. Want more io9 news?

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Few people realize that the routers provided by internet service providers (ISPs) are rarely the best option for their home network. While they’ll get you online, they often lag in speed, range and new features today’s connected homes require. That’s why Amazon’s sale right now on a TP-Link WiFi 6 Router is a wonderful deal. Now you can upgradeyour network to a next-gen Wi-Fi 6 router for just $59 which is a massive 40% off its regular $99 list price. To put that in perspective, theArcher AX21was marked down to $74 on Black Friday and launched at $120, so this is the lowest we’ve ever seen this model. See at Amazon This Archer AX21 routeur bringsleading-edge Wi-Fi 6 to your homeandoffers maximum speeds of 1.8 Gbps, which is 574 Mbps over the 2.4 GHz frequency band and 1,201 Mbps on the 5 GHz frequency band. This ensures you can play back 4K video, conduct online games, download bulky files, and simultaneously make video calls without buffer and lag issues. With Wi-Fi 6 technology features like OFDMA and MU-MIMO, this TP-Link router can talk to multiple devices at once and removes network bottlenecks andkeeps everyone in your home connected quickly and reliably. Whether you reside in a house full of smart TVs, laptops and phones (or you work from home) and need great performance for video conferencing, the AX21 is built to keep up. This routeur has also four high-gain antennas and beamforming capability, giving it strong and concentratedWi-Fi signals all over your home-even in larger spaces or behind multiple walls. If you need even more coverage, the router does support TP-Link’sOneMeshsystem so you can pair it with supported extenders for seamless whole-home Wi-Fi. The powerful 1.5 GHz quad-core processor ensures good performance and quick response even under intense loading of your network. One of the greatest benefits of opting for theArcher AX21instead of your ISP’s default router is the performance and feature boost: ISP routers tend to be minimal with less range, slower speeds, and fewer options for customization. The AX21’s Wi-Fi 6 technology provides faster speeds, improved multi-device management and much more consistent coverage. It also has some good gigabit Ethernet ports which are convenient for gaming or smart TVs. Even though the Archer AX21’s speeds don’t reach the astral heights that upper-end multi-gig routers provide (which are a lot more expensive), it thoroughly outdoes its peers within the same segment and price tier. For any home, the combination of speeds, range, and price here is perfect for most households. And at just $59.99, this is a rare chance to give your home network an upgrade with the latest Wi-Fi 6 technology for less than the cost of many budget routers.

    "title": "New Weight-Loss Drugs Are Sending a Surprising Number of Americans to the Emergency Room",
    "article_text": "Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, isn’t without its risks. A recent study has found that tens of thousands of Americans have ended up in the emergency room from taking semaglutide over the past few years. Scientists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention led the research,publishedthis month in Annals of Internal Medicine. Based on national surveillance data, the researchers estimate that semaglutide contributed to nearly 25,000 ER visits between 2022 and 2023, usually from gastrointestinal complications. The findings suggest that doctors can do more to mitigate the potentially severe side effects of these drugs, the researchers say. Semaglutide and similar drugs mimic GLP-1, one of several hormones that play a key role in regulating our metabolism and hunger. GLP-1 drugs have existed for over two decades, but semaglutide is part of a newer and more effective generation. It was first approved in 2017 to treat type 2 diabetes under the brand name Ozempic. In 2021, it was approved to treat obesity under the brand name Wegovy. Since then, doctors have also commonly prescribed Ozempic off-label for weight loss. How Ozempic Worksâand Whatâs Still a Mystery Every drug comes with its side effects, however. People taking GLP-1s commonly experience nausea, diarrhea, and other GI symptoms. Usually, these side effects are mild and/or tend to decline over time. But in some cases, they can become serious enough to warrant emergency medical care. The CDC researchers analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance Project (NEISS-CADES), which keeps track of drug-related adverse events reported to a nationally representative sample of emergency departments in the U.S. Based on 551 documented cases, the researchers estimated that 24,499 ER visits were attributable to semaglutide use between 2022 and 2023. Nearly 70% of these visits involved GI symptoms, while roughly 17% involved hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and about 6% represented allergic reactions. About a third of hypoglycemia-related visits led to hospitalization, as did 15% of GI-related visits. The findings should be taken in some context. Many drugs can cause side effects that could result in an ER visit, including common over-the-counter medications. In a 2021 study from many of the same authors, they found thatroughly 1 in 200 Americansvisit the ER each year due to medication-related harms, for instance, with two-thirds caused by therapeutic use (meaning that the drugs were taken to treat a medical problem, not recreationally). A 2022 study by the same teamestimatedthat OTC cough or cold medications cause about 27,000 ER visits in the U.S. annually. But the results of this latest study shouldn’t be minimized either. More than 82% of the ER visits happened in 2023, suggesting that as semaglutide use has surged, so have its potential harms. About 9% of the visits involved medication errors, such as people taking more than instructed. So we might be able to prevent some ER visits with better patient education. In other cases, doctors could lower their patients’ risk of serious complications by better managing their use of other medications, and at the very least, they can probably do more to prepare their patients in advance before starting GLP-1 therapy, the researchers argue. âClinicians could counsel patients when initiating semaglutide about the potential for severeÂ gastrointestinal adverse effects and adjust co-prescribed antidiabetic medications to decrease hypoglycemia risk,â the authors wrote.

Even the solid proposals set out by the Trump administration are being undermined by its actions taken elsewhere. A recent survey reveals the foods that people are less likely to eat once they start taking GLP-1 medications like Ozempic. A new review of clinical trial data finds evidence that GLP-1 drugs can meaningfully reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Stanford Medicine researchers have identified a promising, naturally occurring molecule that could help people lose weightâwithout the nauseating symptoms now commonly seen with GLP-1 drugs. New research suggests humans and labradors might be predisposed to gaining weight for similar reasons. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

    "title": "There’s a Lot of Math You’ll Need to Do Before You Buy a Switch 2",
    "article_text": "Nintendo made a big deal out of how theSwitch 2’s storage capacityÂ is eight times that of theoriginal Switch. Still, 256GB is a paltry number compared to the ballooning size of most third-party games that seem designed to gobble up huge chunks of your console’s storage. Unlike the original $300 Switch that Nintendo released in 2017, the $450 Switch 2 costs nearly as much as a PS5 or Xbox Series X. That’s not even including theimpending $70 or $80 game pricesandexpensive accessories. The pricey total cost to start means the Switch 2 isn’t merely a secondary system you may dust off to playMario KartorSuper Smash Bros.when friends come over. If you plan on the Switch 2 being your main gaming machine, you should probably math out exactly what games you have, and then ask how much you’re willing to spend on additional storage options. See Switch 2 at Walmart First, Nintendoâsspecs pagefor the Switch 2 clarifies that some portion of the built-in storage is allocated to the systemâs operating system software, including its settings and menus. The original Switchâs 32GB storage meant users actually only had 26GB available for games. We donât know whether the Switch 2 OS and firmwareâwhich look similar to the original Switchâwill take up more space, but expect your 256GB of storage to be closer to or less than 250GB. Then, you have to consider the size of games. While most of Nintendoâs first-party games will fit on physical Switch 2 game cardsâwhich will save on some storage spaceâthat wonât be the case for several third-party titles.Mario Kart Worldtakes up just under 24GB, whileDonkey Kong Bananzasqueaks in with around 10GB. However, physical game cards don’t account for inevitable updates and game saves that will eat into internal storage. Otherwise, Nintendo now offersgame-key cards, which are essentially just digital codes to download a game from Nintendoâs eShop. The only hassling part is that you still need the physical cartridge inserted into the system to play the game if a publisher goes the game-key card route. The reason why some games are on cards and others are digital download-only seems to come down to publishers’ preference. For example,Best Buylists the physical version for the much-hyped Switch 2 version ofCyberpunk 2077Âas coming on a “64GB game card.” In an interview withGame File, CD Projekt Red engineer Tim Green said, âthe physical version is all played from the game card.â The caveat there is that the game will target 1080p resolution on TVs in âqualityâ mode, though itâs also making use of Nvidiaâs AI upscaler DLSSâwhich transforms a lower-resolution image to a higher qualityâto hit that performance. Not all publishers are stamping their whole games onto a game card even if they only take up 64GB or less.Hitman World of Assassination(61GB),Street Fighter VI(48GB), andYakuza 0(54GB) are confirmed to come on game-key cards. There’s a simple explanation why: game-key cards, which again just download a digital copy to the Switch 2, are cheaper because they don’t need to contain actual flash storage chips. At least not ones with large capacities. Nintendo seems to be one of the few gaming companies that still cares about file size compression, as evidenced by its games taking up a fraction of third-party AAA titles. But if youâre bringing over your older Switch games to the Switch 2, that will also take up more storage space. An upgrade pack forKirby and the Forgotten Landwill cost $20 and buying it from Best Buy will still only net you a code for a digital download. If you port your original copy ofThe Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdomto Switch 2, youâll need to purchase and download the“Switch 2 Edition” upgrade separately for $10to gain improved frame rates, resolutions, and load times.Nintendo has saidthat if you buy the Switch 2 version of a cross-platform game, you will get the upgrade already on the game card, no additional download required. Nintendo Switch 2 game download sizes Cyberpunk 2077 – 59.8 GBYakuza 0 – 53.7 GBMario Kart World – 23.4 GBBravely Default – 11 GB*Donkey Kong Banaza – 10 GB*Zelda BOTW – 24.2 GBZelda TOTK – 19.9 GBKirby and the Forgotten Land – 13 GBSuper Mario Party Jamboree – 13 GBpic.twitter.com/aPF46tN3qd — Nintendeal (@Nintendeal)April 27, 2025 Every gamer will need to calculate their total storage and see if the games they intend to play will max out storage. In that case, Nintendoâs answer is for users to buy a microSD Express card. These cards use a PCIe memory interface that is potentially much faster than the regular microSD, enough that it could match the faster SSD storage of the Switch 2. The Switch 2 system supports up to 2TB of additional storage, but it will be more costly than buying a microSD for the original Switch. Your older, non-Express memory add-ons are not compatible. A 256GB microSD Express card from Samsung emblazoned with Marioâs famous âMâ logo will cost $60. You can expect more companies to make higher-capacity microSD Express options in the future that could cost much more. So not only are you balancing your storage on Switch 2, youâre also balancing your wallet. When Nintendo released the Switch OLED, it doubled the storage to 64GB from the original Switch’s 32GB. Sure, you could wait for a Switch 2 OLED and pray it comes with twice the storage, too. But realistically, if you’re getting in on the Switch 2 at launch or in the next few years, you should probably pick up a microSD Express card if you’re expecting to have a sizable game library.

    "title": "More than 19,000 NFT images briefly disappeared last week thanks to a server problem",
    "article_text": "No offers found The Clone X collection was only gone for a few hours, but the disappearance raised some rather pointed questions. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Remember NFTs? Essentially JPEGs that cost a lot of money,non-fungible tokenswere really big for a brief while amongC-tier celebrities,budding criminals, andUbisoft, until the internet was finally able tobully them out of sightand thus out of mind: Not really gone, but mostly forgotten. But a funny thing recently happened that dragged them back into my memory: Thousands of NFTs that people had paid millions of dollars for very suddenly disappeared—or at least the images associated with them did—not the result of a rug pull but because nobody was paying for the servers. According to a404 Mediareport, this all goes back to 2021 when Nike, the shoe company, acquired RTFKT—pronounced \"artifact,\" although you can say it differently if you like—for an unknown but presumably astronomical amount of money. That partnership resulted in \"CryptoKicks,\" more prosaically described as pictures of sneakers that rich people paid obscene amounts of money for, but RTFKT also partnered with other creators to churn out similarly pricey digital images. One of those collections was Clone X, made in collaboration with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, and this how theRTFKT websitedescribes it: In a moment that would redefine the intersection of contemporary art and digital culture, legendary artist Takashi Murakami joined forces with RTFKT to create something unprecedented: a collection of 20,000 extraterrestrial avatar clones that would bridge the worlds of fine art, digital identity, and creative expression. This collaboration didn't just merge NFTs with contemporary art—it catalyzed a new era of digital creativity that would generate over $1 billion in the secondary market and forever alter the landscape of digital identity. Wow, eh? Ah, but it didn't last. Nike soured on NFTs and announced at the end of 2024 that it was pulling the plug on RTFKT. Around the same time, RTFKT said it wouldlaunch a new websiteto \"honor and preserve\" its legacy, and \"that showcases the groundbreaking work that defined the RTFKT journey.\" And so it has. But on April 24, more than 19,000 NFT images went poof for a few hours. It wasawkward. So what happened? According to the report, former RTFKT chief technology officer Samuel Cardillo, who stayed on as a consultant after Nike deep-sixed the operation, was moving the NFTs from a DigitalOcean cloud server to AWS, using Cloudflare as an intermediate part of the process. Carillo told 404 Media that he'd arranged to switch to a free Cloudflare plan because being on a paid plan \"makes absolutely no sense anymore,\" what with RTFKT no longer existing, but Cloudflare triggered the change too soon. Whoops. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The NFTs were only gone for a few hours so no real harm done, aside from a bit of panic among any NFT owners who noticed their pictures had turned into error messages. But I think it's a very interesting reflection on the nature of NFTs, their impermanence, and their reliance on technology to \"exist\" at all. Cardillo said on April 28 that the Clone X collection had successfullymigrated to Arweave, a decentralized storage system that will ensure this sort of thing cannot ever happen again. Maybe that's true and maybe it's not—there's a distinct ring of \"unsinkable\" to that sort of language, which rarely ends well—but asDL Newsexplained, it's something of an ongoing issue with NFTs and those who believe they have value. While the non-fungible tokens exist on blockchains, associated images are often stored on conventional servers, and if something happens to those servers—as was the case with Cloudflare—they, rather like the infamousapes of legend, are gone. The site also noted that while some Clone X NFTs sold for more than $1 million at their peak, they now list for about 300 bucks each. That's not a server problem, though, that's just how it goes. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Andy has been gaming on PCs from the very beginning, starting as a youngster with text adventures and primitive action games on a cassette-based TRS80.

    "title": "I'm honestly shocked, but Arc Raiders is a much more exciting extraction shooter than Marathon",
    "article_text": "No offers found After 4 hours with both shooters, Bungie should be worried that Embark will steal its spotlight. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The stars aligned last week when I got to play the two biggest extraction shooters of 2025 on the same day: The Marathon alpha began at the same time that Embark held a press session for Arc Raiders. Going in, I was way more interested in Marathon. Not only is it an FPS (the superior camera angle to Arc Raiders' third-person), but I was sure that if anybody was going to get me jazzed about an extraction shooter that isn't Hunt: Showdown, it'd be Bungie. Now that I've played four hours of both, I'm surprised to report that Arc Raiders is the extraction shooter I can't stop thinking about. Arc Raiders' world, sounds, and legitimately scary robot roamers are making an excellent impression. Marathon, meanwhile, is kind of boring. With the caveat that these playtests don't represent the full picture of either game, there are two things Arc Raiders is doing very well that Marathon currently sucks at:ProgressionandPvE. Arc Raiders' loot lust, faction contracts, and inventory management build off genre champion Escape From Tarkov, but its smartest design choice, a persistent skill tree that I can progress even if I die during a run, is akin to Hunt's more forgiving permadeath. Fighting Arc robots, snatching high-tier loot, and completing contracts contribute to skill points I can use to permanently boost my stamina, soften the sound of looting, or climb ladders more quickly. It's a pretty big tree of lasting upgrades, and they run parallel to a loot-driven progression track encompassing building new crafting stations, expanding the black market, and training a chicken that finds free scrap for you between raids. It's exciting that we're finally getting a new extraction shooter that doesn't religiously adhere to Tarkov's all-or-nothing attitude around raids, and I'm impressed that Embark is the one doing it, considering it's already supporting its team-based FPS The Finals. Arc Raiders understands that when loot isn't the only thing that matters, you can still have a great time in an unsuccessful raid. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In the Marathon alpha, extracting loot is the only way to grow. Bungie also has a skill tree of sorts that lets me upgrade my loot speed, stamina, and healing during the current seasonal wipe, but upgrades are purchased, not earned. They cost a lot of money and rare resources, both of which I've had a miserable time holding on to while playing alone. I've had one unfortunate raid after another, with most ending early by the hand of some guy with a sniper rifle or a squad of three bullying me on solo runs. Every time I've been smacked back to the lobby screen, having flushed hundreds of dollars of loot down the drain with nothing gained, I've wanted to close Marathon and be done with it. Marathon's overreliance on loot is exacerbated by other annoying aspects of the alpha, like weirdly cramped maps, a hilariously small default backpack size that reliably fills up in the first compound I visit, and flaccid NPC encounters (more on that below). The \"Arc\" in Arc Raiders refers to a legion of AI-controlled robots that roam around maps attacking anything that moves. They come in all shapes and sizes—spheres that roll around shooting flames, sniper turrets that survey tall buildings, little birds that snitch on you to bigger bots, and at least one gigantic crabby crawler ripped straight out of a Horizon game. Arcs are a legitimate threat, but I love that they're designed to be avoided. They're on the hunt, but maps are spacious enough that I never felt forced to engage one. The Arc are more obstacle than adversary—a crucial distinction, because like Hunt, Arc Raiders is largely a stealth game where sound is half the battle. Every decision forced me to weigh the noise cost of prying open a loot cache, triggering a metal detector, sprinting down a hallway, or killing a bot for its useful innards. It's a game about keeping your head down, gun ready, and ears open. Marathon is less nuanced. Loot is entirely centralized around a handful of huge compounds guarded by UESC robots. It's possible to avoid detection with one character's stealth ability, but if you want to fully explore a location, confrontations are inevitable. Those bots are Marathon's glaring flaw. They're dangerous in the sense that they dish out a ton of damage, but they're about as interesting as paper targets at a gun range. I immediately recognized their aimless shuffle from Destiny's alien grunts—some have shields, some throw grenades, but they all just meander in a clump. I hoped for more from the studio that programmed Halo Elites to dive out of the way of grenades, flank players, and hijack vehicles 20 years ago. Playing Marathon and Arc Raiders back-to-back illustrates the advantage of being hunted by monsters in extraction shooters, rather than fending off waves of soldiers. Monsters, or in this case the Arc, track, chase, and displace players trying to keep a low profile. Their movements and unique attack patterns add texture to PvP fights. Soldiers just dish out a lesser version of what players can do. I didn't go into 2025 expecting to be invested in an Arc Raiders vs. Marathon faceoff, but the timing is impeccable. Both are running playtests at the same time—Marathon's alpha is live nowand running until May 4, andArc Raiders' Tech Test 2begins April 30 and ends on, you guessed it, May 4. Both are releasing later this year, both are forgoing free-to-play, and both have a lot riding on them. All eyes have been on Bungie as it takes a big swing on a new genre amidst Sony's shaken confidence in the team, but Arc Raiders is just as big of a gamble for Embark, the Sweden-based studio of Battlefield veterans. Embark'sother gameis a great FPS with a loyal community, but publisherNexon isn't thrilledby its performance. In an extremely volatile time for the industry, both studios need their extraction shooters to be a hit. I'm skeptical there's enough interest in the inherently un-casual genre to support them both.

    "article_text": "No offers found When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A beautiful remaster of a great game that leaves some very old, obvious issues untouched. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. In 2006 Final Fantasy 12 was a brand new PlayStation 2 game, the Xbox 360's hard drive was at least in spirit still an optional extra, and horse armour DLC was thebiggest corporate issuesurrounding Oblivion's launch. I didn't play the game back then because I thought I didn't need to—I had Morrowind, a smug sense of superiority, and no use for a sequel. What is it?The Oblivion you've always known and modded with a few tweaks and a fresh coat of polygons on top. Expect to pay:£49.99 / $49.99 Developer:Bethesda Game Studios, Virtuos Publisher:Bethesda Softworks Reviewed on:Intel i9-13900HX, RTX 4090 (laptop), 32GB RAM Multiplayer?No Steam Deck:Verified Link:Official site I might have been wrong about that. Although Oblivion's tutorial-laden intro, starring the most obviously doomed MacGuffin-carrying Emperor who ever briefly lived, didn't do a great job of convincing me otherwise. The only amazement I felt during this segment was that a game this ambitious seriously expected me to be thrilled with the sight of a rat-filled sewer, the most clichéd RPG environment of them all.Was this honestly the best opening they could come up with? And then I escaped that boring place, and all of my grumbles were instantly forgotten. This sunlit paradise doesn't look like a game that came out when My Chemical Romance songs were in the top 10. Not even close. Dragonflies flit across the water, and butterflies lazily flap in the air as flowers gently sway in the breeze. I'm honestly taken aback by it all, and only alt+tab out of the game so I can hastily type 'Oblivion photo mode' into the nearest search bar. There isn't one at the time of writing, and I'm offended on the game's behalf because of it. I immediately decide I'm going to walk, rather than fast travel, to the next conveniently marked story location just so I can spend more time taking in my gorgeous surroundings. But the path ahead isn't quite as beautiful as the one I'm about to leave behind, and that makes me take one last look back and… hang on, is somethingglowingon that small island just across the water? Nope, no. Not happening. I mean,yes please, but I've got a magical plot device to deliver and I don't want to get sidetracked straight away and then never recover.But… a little peek wouldn't hurt seeing as I'm already here, would it? The sheer variety of experiences keeps surprising me One short swim later and I'm loot-deep in the Vilverin ruins, fighting bandits and poking my nose everywhere I shouldn't. The tripwire across the entrance I spot just before I set it off may as well be an invitation—if these bandits want me to stay out that badly then there's got to be something worth spending a little time searching for down here. I'm quickly so enthralled by this mysterious place I don't even realise I've jumped down into another area with no real idea how I can get back up, and I just shrug and carry on anyway. I'm actually a little disappointed when I notice the name 'Bandit ringleader' above someone's health bar, assuming I'm done here when they finally drop dead. My assumption was way, way off. I spot another mysterious door. Behind it lies a small area with not much in i—is that a pressure plate? Instead of quickly finishing up and leaving the way I came, my improvised adventure spirals into a world of skeletons, underwater swims into the unknown, and swinging blade traps. I don't even care how long I've been here and any urgency to get on with the 'real' story has long gone, because I'm having too much fun here and now. I eventually clear the dungeon, grab some shiny loot, then exit via a handy shortcut. That sunset I left behind has transformed into a breathtaking canopy of stars. I'm in awe. I've done more than just clear a dungeon or complete a subquest, I'veexplored. I've done so much, even though the game's hardly begun. Ploughing through Oblivion's endless array of quests is simple thanks to a straightforward UI that makes it easy to activate and then follow one particular thread, helpfully keeps interesting side activities separate from main events, and never leaves me more than a click or two away from a large map with big red 'GO HERE NEXT' markers on it. The sheer variety of experiences these markers can lead to keeps surprising me. I've sneaked around sleeping cultists. Stolen treasures from forbidden trap-filled labyrinths that had me thinking \"I wish somebody would make a fantasy Tomb Raider\" the whole time I was in them. In one memorable incident I found myself delicately balancing a temporary drug addiction with the need to push through a place crawling with monsters (I was not completely successful at managing the severe stat buffs that came with the withdrawal). Even the parts of Oblivion where I can keep my weapons sheathed are intriguing. Every new town and oddball inn stuck in the middle of nowhere has someone worth talking to, or some locked room, suspicious well, or half-hidden hatch I know I shouldn't enter but will poke around anyway. The land is heaving with everything from harmless bookcases to unsettling secret murderholes, my curiosity a catalyst for anything from idle rummages around someone's personal belongings to desperate dashes to safety, new memories made at every turn. It's just a shame everyone I have to talk to looks so damned strange. The models used for these people, from plain old humans to the catlike khajiit, may be as overhauled as their remastered surroundings, but they're wrong in every way that matters. Animations and expressions are simplistic and cartoonishly exaggerated, completely at odds with the new high resolution textures and additional details they're contorting to accommodate. They often spoil the mood; creating an unintentional disconnect between the intriguing adventures I'm offered, the hard work of the actors voicing the dialogue, and the visual comedy playing out before me. I can't even always catch what's being said. As the original game had its bugs, Oblivion Remastered isn't without issues: Subtitles are present, but tend to show up when they feel like it. I could somewhat understand if this was defined by my distance to the speaker, but I've had people I was rubbing shoulders with hold full back-and-forths without a single line being printed on screen. I'm not just missing out on key story moments when this happens, I'm missing out on the flavour that comes from random NPCs grousing amongst themselves as I stroll down a city street and the immersive, sometimes life-saving battlecries of my allies too. Some methods of dispatching whoever crosses my path are much more satisfying than others. Sneak-attacking enemies with a bow from afar never gets old, and neither does filling a monster full of arrows as they try to close the distance. Spellcasting is pleasantly frantic and messy, fireball flinging imagined as something athletic and imprecise. It's a lot of fun—so long as I'm not using a controller. With a traditional KB+M setup I can freely switch between anything I've assigned to the 1-8 keys as I move around. Smoothly shifting from lightning lobbing to a quick heal and back again as I jump around couldn't be easier. But on a controller I have to rely on a customisable radial menu to switch between spells, and for some reason opening this locks my character in place until it's closed again. This practically guarantees the enemy will get some free hits in, and tarnishes a comfortable control method that otherwise works beautifully. Surely almost 20 years is enough time to iron out basic issues with common quests Even in Remastered form, melee combat is a disappointment no matter how I play. There's a distinct lack of weight and meaningful reaction to my blows, and it never really looks like direct contact's being made. I'm not swinging a sword or blocking an incoming attack, I'm pressing buttons as animations play out and health bars deplete. This lack of reactivity is only exacerbated by the game's AI, which,huh, seems to have been pulled directly out of 2006. I shouldn't be able to kill an entire cult's worth of weirdos by kiting them around their own altar, every last one politely chasing after me in an orderly fashion, and it'd be nice if monsters consistently noticed when their fellow fiends drop dead a few feet away. Other bugs pop up often, many of them quest-related. Key NPCs get stuck repeating the same lines and scripted sequences fail to correctly move on to the next state in the stack. These aren't edge cases that only show up in minor quests most players never see, but early mainline scenarios. They drag the entire experience down, leaving me questioning everything I do. Did I succeed here because I was clever, lucky, or did another bug swing this fight in my favour? Have I missed something important, or has the game broken down again? Yes, some jank is to be expected—is it even a real Bethesda RPG if therearen'tbugs?—but this is a brand new remaster. Surely almost 20 years is enough time to iron out basic issues with common quests. And add some meaningful reactivity to them. The guild quests don't shine quite so brightly in a post-Baldur's Gate 3 landscape. A single arrow loosed at the wrong moment was all it took for the Dark Brotherhood's messenger to gleefully declare me a cold-blooded killer, and in an astonishing lack of player agency I was forced to accept their quest and dagger. This quest line does lead to some fun moments—protecting someone from the irritated corpses of their dead relatives raised a smile—but it also lays bare how little RP resides in this RPG's storytelling. I have no real choice but to do as I'm told or not engage at all, all paths leading to the same end. I'm always exactly as virtuous or vengeful as the latest quest giver needs me to be, and Oblivion felt smaller for it. But when it does work, and to be fair it usually does, I'm fully absorbed in this fantasy world. I can sit in a tavern—any tavern—and listen to NPCs strike up conversations with each other, or organically overhear something that adds a new topic to my conversations. I'm desperate to climb every mountain peak and dive into every deep lake I come across because I know there's always something worthwhile waiting for me if I go exploring. Maybe not something I can use or sell, but at the very least I'll get to watch the sun rise over the lands below, or perhaps discover a submerged cave entrance I had no idea existed. It's worth spending a night walking from one town to the next, just to give myself a chance to get lost in the wilds—and probably find some previously unmarked location when I do. My rigid quest list is all but abandoned, unchecked and uncompleted, and I only feel free. I am the author of my own grand adventure, and I decide what happens next. A beautiful remaster of a great game that leaves some very old, obvious issues untouched.

    "title": "'AI is going to become more and more difficult to detect': Fortnite has no plans to clean up increasing number of AI thumbnails cluttering up user-generated experiences",
    "article_text": "No offers found Fortnite Discovery has become a cesspit for AI-generated thumbnails. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Head into Fortnite's ever-growing library of user-generated game modes and you'll be inundated with all kinds of AI-generated thumbnails vying for your attention. That won't be changing anytime soon either, as Epic product management director Dan Walsh and executive vice president Saxs Persson dove into the rise of generative AI usage in Fortnite duringa YouTube livestreamaround moderation in the battle royale. When asked by host MustardPlays about Epic's stance on AI—including the number of AI-generated thumbnails in Fortnite Discovery—Walsh said: \"From our perspective, for moderation, thumbnails… we don't really care what tool you use to make your thumbnails. All we care about is whether or not it's compliant with our rules.\" Walsh says the reason for that is the fast progression of generative AI, and the workload that would go into moderating its usage. \"I think to some degree AI is going to become more and more difficult to detect,\" he said. \"It's not going to stand out as a unique thing, it's just going to be another tool that people are using to create things. So trying to look for that specifically is going to become increasingly difficult to the point that it's probably going to become unenforceable.\" Talking about Epic's own usage of AI (though not generative AI), Persson said \"what's unassailable is that it's revolutionising a lot of workflows to make them incredibly powerful,\" citing Epic's own Unreal Engine MetaHumans as an example. Going back to AI art, though, Persson said: \"For me, if you can detect an AI thumbnail, that also means it has a particular look that, if you can stand apart with a particular artist that has a distinct style, you're still standing out against what is, in truth, a lot of very generic-looking AI-generated art. So I don't think, internally at least, do we feel like we need to start making Fortnite outfits using AI models? No. We believe that the approach we have taken embraces technology but puts humans in the centre of it still, because that's how you get the best results.\" Walsh chimed in to agree, adding: \"When you look at people who are putting in the effort and investing in creating the best possible version of a thumbnail, I think they're standing out from the crowd.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. MustardPlays then notes a trend that happened last year which involved numerous thumbnails with AI-generated images, often including graphics from copyrighted stuff like Spongebob, Family Guy, and The Simpsons. Something which Persson said could have happened at the hands of a real artist anyway. \"We've always had violative content, it's not like that changed just because you can do an AI thumbnail. Coins on thumbnails were a thing before AI too.\" he said, referring to misleading usage of currency graphics, somethingwhich is against creator rules. It's a really difficult line to draw, there's no doubt.\" I mean, on the one hand I do get it. There are a ridiculous number of user-created game modes and maps knocking around and trying to moderate them all sounds like a gigantic headache. But it seems like Persson and Walsh's main concern—at least from a moderation standpoint—is IP infringement. Whether that comes from generative AI or not. Personally, I feel like the increasing showing of AI art across Discovery makes Fortnite look incredibly tacky. It feels like shovelware but worse, and I'd rather take a legitimately-made shitty thumbnail over an equally shitty AI-generated one. It's at least somewhat comforting to know Epic doesn't intend to use the technology for its own asset generation anytime soon.

    "article_text": "No offers found It's all about \"driving future growth,\" you see. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Electronic Arts has reportedly laid off 300 and 400 people, according to a newBloombergreport, including roughly 100 at Apex Legends studio Respawn Entertainment. Respawn has also cancelled at least two early-in-development projects, one of which was reportedly a Titanfall-based extraction shooter. \"As part of our continued focus on our long-term strategic priorities, we've made select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth,\" an EA rep said in a statement provided to the site. Respawn separately confirmed its own layoffs and cancellations in a carefully massaged statement onXthat, just like EA's, manages to avoid the words \"cancelled\" and \"layoffs\" entirely. \"As we sharpen our focus for the future, we've made the decision to step away from two early-stage incubation projects and make some targeted team adjustments across Apex Legends and Star Wars Jedi,\" the studio said. People being out of work by the cuts will be \"offered meaningful support,\" Respawn said, \"including exploring new opportunities within EA.\" The Bloomberg report says one of the cancelled projects, code named R7, was an extraction shooter set in the Titanfall universe. The other game was apparently cancelled earlier this year. Respawn made a point of noting that while the news is bad, everything is also fine, because \"our commitment to player-first experiences remains unchanged.\" For Apex Legends, that means \"expanding what Apex can be,\" and \"investing in what's next for the franchise—exploring bold experiences that push the boundaries of competitive play while staying true to the spirit of competition, creativity, and integrity that our community expects.\" As far as Star Wars Jedi goes, well, yes, there's going to be another Star Wars Jedi game—no real surprise there. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Apex Legends remains big but it has been faltering somewhat.

    "title": "Dune-inspired indie roguelike admits it kinda ran out of ideas, but releases out of early access anyway and goes 100% free: 'Only so many things you can do that fit into the 'lateral worm cannon' mold'",
    "article_text": "No offers found \"Master the piloting of giant mechanical worms!\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Indie developer Emerick Gibson first released Iron Mandate on Steam early access in March 2023: a roguelike shooter loosely inspired by Dune's sandworms, Gibson subsequently spent around a month updating the game, before seemingly abandoning the idea. Two years later Gibson returned to fully release the game, make it free of charge, and share a post mortem \"retrospective on a 'failed' project\" (thanks, GamesRadar+). And he doesn't sugar-coat it either: there's \"a lack of time, money and fundamental issues with the core idea, [so] I'm moving this game out of early access, leaving it free and moving on.\" Iron Mandate was never what you would call a hit, with concurrents peaking in the low dozens, but the Steam reviews are \"very positive\" and there's definitely some love out there for it. And I find it hard to quibble with the game description: \"Master the piloting of giant mechanical worms, lay waste to all that stand in your way and reclaim your rightful place on the throne!\" It's the old \"piloting of giant mechanical worms\" that may have eventually done for it, but first Gibson explains why he's dropping this update now. \"An alert now appears on the Steam page mentioning the fact that it has not received any updates in the past 23 months,\" writes Gibson. \"It's entirely fair of Steam but I don't want to give the impression that this is some abandoned game. It is fully functional and completable as it is. This pushes me to release it but I don't want to do so without an explanation.\" Gibson does however think Iron Mandate \"fails in fundamental ways that make it hard to fix\" before going right back to its origin. \"The starting point of the project will sound a bit silly: This scene in the opening of Dune (2021). I get that it's entirely missing the point of the shot but seeing it made me think 'I want to make a game where a scene like this happens' \"I knew I wouldn't be able to do anything in 3D so I focused my thinking on a 2D game. I also wanted it to be a roguelike. I workshopped the idea and I landed on giant mechanical worms firing missiles from side cannons, similar to pre-modern warships. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"It's a perfect idea, an awesome concept but I had to ruin it by actually trying to implement it.\" Gibson reckons the game's biggest failing is the \"clunky experience\" of the controls and teaching players poorly: \"It's a mess. You can get through it but by that point so much goodwill was lost and a lot of players will drop out.\" Gibson's also rather down on the game's visual style and representation of the ground the worms burrow through, citingPepper Grinderas a game that does a great job of the latter. He's not wrong about Pepper Grinder, but I've seen plenty of worse-looking games than Iron Mandate. In one more Herculean effort to get you to not try his free game, Gibson laments the lack of variety in Iron Mandate, which \"a roguelike lives or dies on.\" Gibson thought he'd be able to dream-up a tonne of weapons but \"ended up with five or so weapon types with a few different levelled up versions. The end result is a roguelike that you will finish in about 2 hours and probably not come back to.\" Then my favourite line of the whole thing: \"At the end of the day, there are only so many things you can do that fit into the 'lateral worm cannon' mold. I've done seeking missile, cannon, gatling, laser, grenades. What else is there that wouldn't largely overlap with these?\" And that ties things up for Iron Mandate. \"In the end, I do believe that the only hurdle to people making good art is time and room to fail,\" says Gibson. \"I'm infinitely grateful that I was granted both to try and make this game.\" Gibson is now moving on to their new game:The People of Sea, Sun & Salt. It looks like a super-chill city builder, and one thing's instantly clear: this has an aesthetic that could really work. As for Iron Mandate, Gibson says he's \"still very proud of the project\" and is \"so happy that tens of thousands of players have had the chance to try my game.\"You can pick it up for free here. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "article_text": "No offers found What if making chocolate wasn't a traditional crafting system, but more \"intuitive?\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After spending much of last year dedicated to Stardew Valley's big 1.6 update, Eric Barone isready to buckle down on Haunted Chocolatier. Though he's not ready to talk too many hard details about his next game, in a recent interview with PC Gamer Barone said that what he's interested in exploring withHaunted Chocolatierhas \"evolved with the game\" over the last few years. \"One thing lately that I've been interested in is intuition,\" he said. \"You might even say a spiritual aspect. You have the left brain, which is the mechanical engineering thing, and then you have this kind of intuitive, psychic, paranormal side. I feel like games are very left brain-focused, like: 'Here's your ingredients, now engineer the perfect chocolate.'\" You can certainly see what Barone is talking about reflected in most games with crafting systems, including Stardew Valley—input X components and you'll always get Y result. One piece of wood and two pieces of sap in Stardew is guaranteed to make a torch. With Haunted Chocolatier, he's exploring the idea of making baking less concrete. \"Instead I'm thinking, well, what if you do intuitive chocolate making?\" he said. \"What if it's not such a mechanical process and it's more creative? You have to let go of your designer to engineer the perfect chocolate, and just accept there's a mystery and a whimsy. Maybe that's an important part of being human that needs to be explored a little bit more. I don't even know if itneedsto be, but it's something that I'm interested in doing right now.\" Barone's rumination on intuition and spirituality feels in line with the concept the game has had from the beginning, though it seems like he's still figuring out exactly what the \"haunted\" in Haunted Chocolatier will entail. In the real world chocolatiers might make plain chocolate or elaborate truffles; in Haunted Chocolatier, you might make \"ghost chocolates\" or \"paranormal chocolates.\" \"Stardew Valley was a very grounded game—it's about growing things in the earth. These are the basics, the fundamentals of human sustenance and existence, and something I care about deeply. But with Haunted Chocolatier, I wanted to explore what's next. We have our basic needs met with Stardew Valley. Now let's take it beyond, into the realm of the ethereal and the creative. You might even say luxury—things that are beyond the very basics. I think it's another realm of the human experience which I'm interested in exploring.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I had to ask Barone what his go-to is when it comes to eating plain ol' non-ghost chocolate, and like all people of good taste, he said dark chocolate—though he's not actually a \"huge chocolate guy.\" \"I think [dark chocolate] is healthy in moderation. I worry about that with Haunted Chocolatier: am I going to ruin the teeth of a whole generation with this? I'm trying to think about that. I'm thinking about doing it so you can only eat two chocolates per day and it fills up your stomach, and then you have the system work around that… Maybe there needs to be a dentist in town. I want to have healthy chocolates, too, like superfood, ashwagandha, maca root chocolate. Special stuff.\" Haunted Chocolatier will, at least in the macro view, still be \"similar to Stardew Valley in many ways,\" Barone said—it's a life sim, which is the kind of game he likes to make. \"But I'm really interested in really cranking up the imagination, the creativity,\" he said. \"I want to go all-out doing weird, interesting things… Stardew Valley is very sunny and bright and lush. Haunted Chocolatier is more dark and mysterious, a little bit paranormal.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Eric Barone has a problem: He wants to make his new game,Haunted Chocolatier, but he also has a deep love for his indie mega-hitStardew Valley—and, more to the point, a seeming inability to stop working on it. It's a tough spot alright, one he'stalked about before, but speaking to PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon at GDC recently, Barone said he's got a plan, or at least an idea: Run away into the forest and stay there until it's done. Barone's continued to work on the \"vertical slice\" ofHaunted Chocolatier, while at the same time \"trying to stay relaxed and stress free,\" and avoid rushing too much. But the pressure of Stardew Valley is always hanging overhead: Even though the game has been out for nine years and remains massively popular, he just can't stop. Barone said last year that he could work on Stardew Valley \"for the rest of my life\" and it sure doesn't seem like he was kidding. \"I do love Stardew Valley and I care about the fans and I want the fans to have a great experience,\" Barone said during our GDC chat. \"So I'm always concerned with Stardew Valley and making sure that it's doing well, and that pulls me away from devoting all my time to Haunted Chocolatier. \"I think at some point I'm going to have to completely cut off everything else. Honestly, I've thought about, maybe I should just go into a cabin in the woods and completely get off the internet, and just say, 'Okay guys, I'll see you in two years. You won't hear from me at all and I'm going to finish this game'.\" Barone spent much of 2024 working on Stardew Valley's big 1.6 update, which he said would need to be \"bug-free\" and out on both PC and consoles before he could shift his focus back to Haunted Chocolatier. Now, he said, he's finally ready to take time away from the farm. \"The 1.6 update is pretty settled at this point. There were ongoing console ports and bug fixes, but it's pretty settled now. I'm committed to not working on Stardew Valley until I'm done with Haunted Chocolatier… I think it's in a good place. I feel very solid about it. I think if anyone picks up Stardew Valley for the first time in 2025, I'm very proud of it, and I think they'll have fun with it if they like this kind of game.\" But Stardew Valley isn't the only stumbling block Barone faces on the road to his next game. The long development process of Haunted Chocolatier, he said, is in part the result of, well,the long development process of Haunted Chocolatier. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"It's been a few years that I've been working on it now and it's like, I look at some of the stuff I did at the beginning and I'm like, 'Oh man, here we go again. I'm gonna have to redo all of this',\" Barone said. \"And it's not it's not like it's even bad, it's just—part of the problem of being, like especially a solo dev, is it takes so long to make a game. I'm literally a different person in four years, so it's like my whole feelings about everything have changed—my aesthetic sensibilities have evolved.\" Sounds like exactly the sort of problem a couple years in an isolated cabin would fix.

    "article_text": "No offers found Multiplayer fantasy war game We Will Be Gods enters public pre-alpha in May, and will be free-to-play when it launches this year. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Large-scale PvP warfare leads to some of the best stories in gaming, but it takes a certain level of dedication to participate in something like war MMO Foxhole (in whichplayers oncefought for 48 hours straight and built \"a religion around a corpse pile\"), and getting involved in EVE Online's shenanigans is a lifestyle decision. We Will Be Gods, which has quietly been in development for a few years and is now approaching its first public playtest, will perhaps be a large-scale PvP war game that's a little easier to get into. The founders of Swedish studio Cult of the North worked on Candy Crush, that unreasonably successful tile-matching game, and so they know something about mass appeal. But victory in these fantasy wars won't necessarily come easily—We Will Be Gods is explicitlynotdesigned to be fair, the devs say—and the studio's decision to build its own engine after finding both Unity and Unreal unsuitable for its networking needs perhaps suggests a clear vision and the conviction (and Andreessen Horowitz financing) to stick to it. That vision combines RTS base building, MOBA-style combat, and 4X resource management, and also takes inspiration from classic browser-based strategy games like Tribal Wars and Utopia. The plan is to run weeks or months-long campaigns with 10 or more player-run kingdoms on one map, all building big bases, forming alliances, and burning down the bases of their enemies. Kingdoms can house as many as 100 players each. Asign-up form for pre-alpha testingis available now—the servers open May 17—and We Will Be Gods will be free-to-playon Steamwhen it launches, which will happen sometime later this year unless plans change. There can be 140 people on one side and 70 on the other, and that's how it's going to be. The skill cap in We Will Be Gods is \"a little bit lower\" than it may be in comparable games, studio founders Adam Schaub and Marcus Jacobs told PC Gamer on a recent call, and there's more to do than fight. \"You can be good at strategy, you can be good at the economy, you can be good at building cities, tower defense, these things—not only combat,\" said Jacobs. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But PvP games are also inherently competitive, and my interest was piqued by Jacobs' comment regarding fairness, specifically the lack of it. We Will Be Gods is about \"adapting and overcoming,\" he said, acknowledging that this is a standard game design theme, but contrasting their approach with that of multiplayer games in which success comes from grinding, developing the fastest reflexes, or looking up the best internet strategies. \"[We Will Be Gods] serves you something, and you work with that,\" Jacobs said. \"So that's why there are no matches, there are no instances, there is no fairness. There can be 140 people on one side and 70 on the other, and that's how it's going to be.\" And if you run up to an enemy kingdom's base and there just aren't many of them online to defend at that moment, that's just tough luck for them. When one of these weeks-long games ends (with the players of a kingdom achieving godhood, as the title foretells), you start again fresh with a new kingdom. The alpha map will feature 10 starting points—10 kingdoms in a free-for-all, give or take any alliances they forge—but Jacobs suggested that they could do games with 100 kingdoms in the future, all expanding their bases and clashing or allying with each other at once. Discord integrationwill provide voice and text chat for coordination with your comrades, and for the time being, the highest level players in a kingdom (ie, those who've played the most) will have the most power to make decisions about communal resource allocation—there are both personal and kingdom-wide pools to draw from. Down the line, however, the devs plan to introduce a voting system. It's hard to predict how any multiplayer game will be received today—willMarathonbe a hit or flop? I really couldn't tell you—but it feels like there's potential in a free-to-play game that sits somewhere between Guild Wars 2 and Clash of Clans. Not as demanding of time and energy as an MMO, but perhaps more appealing to the PC's strategy and MOBA players than the most mass market of mobile games.

Y'know, undelayed. Hastened. Advanced. Okay, I'm putting my thesaurus away to tell you that Gearbox just revealed that it'll be bringing Borderlands 4's release date forward by an entire week and a half. That's taken the release date from September 23 to September 12, which is a pretty big leap forward in Videogame Release World. I also can't help but note that the last time a big game pulled something like this it was Baldur's Gate 3, when Larian attempted tonimbly sidestep Bethesda's presumed juggernaut Starfield. A funny move in hindsight, but one that was certainly smart in the moment. I bring this up because I can't help but wonder exactlywhyGearbox (or publisher 2K Games) has decided to do this. It's offered up no particular reason in itsPlayStation blog post, which almost always means the reason is another game. So of course I couldn't help but glance over the2025 release calendarto see what could have possibly ruffled the developer's feathers. The most likely scenario here seems to be that Bungie recently announced it'll be releasing Marathon on… as luck would have it, September 23. While I'm not sure what the Venn diagram of looter shooter and extraction shooter enjoyers looks like, it's understandable that Gearbox would want to try and get out of its way, even if it was technically there first. Maybe it's scared about anotherBattlebornvs. Overwatch situation. The little gremlin in my brain wants to theorise that a Grand Theft Auto 6 release is on the horizon and parent company Take-Two wants to give Borderlands 4 as much clearance as possible, but I also reckon that's a whole heaping of cope on my side.

    "title": "Nexon wins the bidding war to make a new StarCraft as well as distribute a Blizzard mobile game that's being called 'Overwatch 3'",
    "article_text": "No offers found I can't be the only one wondering: why? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In late March the news broke that four Korean companies were competing topitch for the StarCraft license from Blizzard. NCSoft, Nexon, Netmarble, and Krafton are all absolute giants and, attracted by StarCraft's long and storied history in South Korea, were pitching everything from an MMO to a mobile game as a continuation of the iconic RTS series. South Korean financial news outlet MTNis now reportingthat the process has ended with Nexon winning the license. Nexon's pitch was previously described as a \"unique\" take on the StarCraft universe, and the MTN report adds that the deal includes the Korean and Japanese distribution rights for \"Overwatch mobile.\" This Overwatch game is being developed by Blizzard and,per a machine translation, \"is known to be a MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game on a mobile platform. It was also called 'Overwatch 3' by domestic game companies that participated in the bidding.\" Wait, come back! I suppose with Overwatch Mobile the surprise is that it's taken Blizzard this long, and regardless of how it's being referred to internally I very much doubt it will release as Overwatch 3. As for StarCraft, there are no details on Nexon's intentions, but the fact that something might actually get made again in the StarCraft series has to be a good thing: the big question is whether it'll be an RTS, or even reflect those roots in a meaningful way. Either way, it will be many years before we see what comes of this, but StarCraft is more well-known and beloved in South Korea than anywhere else in the world, and Nexon will see this as a massive opportunity in its home market. It's not the only StarCraft project in the offing either. Last year we learned that Blizzard does have at least one more StarCraft project under development in-house that's—drum roll please—the studio's third attempt at making a shooter (following the cancelled projects Ghost and Ares). \"If it's not cancelled,\" saidauthor Jason Schreier at the time. \"I mean, this is Blizzard after all. Yes, that is a project that, as far as I knew, was in development. At least, as of the time that I wrote this book [...] this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Things like StarCraft: Remastered and Hearthstone crossovers are nice, but it's been 15 years since Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty and 10 since the final installment in the trilogy, StarCraft 2: Legacy of the Void. A series as big as StarCraft can certainly survive a long period of absence, but the bigger worry for fans will be whether its future involves a strategy title of some description. Shooters and spinoffs are all well and good, but they're not StarCraft: let's hope that, somewhere in Nexon, the decision-makers agree.

To absolutely no one's surprise,A Minecraft Movieis still performing well at the box office, like really well, over $816 million well. While it may be the most marketable thing I've ever come across in my life, props where it's due, as it looks like A Minecraft Movie will be able to contest the top spot as the most successful videogame movie ever. According toVariety, A Minecraft Movie has grossed $816 million globally, making it the biggest Hollywood movie of 2025 so far. It's earned $67.1 million in the UK, $33.7 million in Germany, $31.8 million in Australia, and $28.4 million in Mexico, just to name a few. A Minecraft Movie is in its fourth weekend in cinemas, and while earnings have slowed down, it's still going strong with $60.5 million earned just last weekend. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Two weeks ago, A Minecraft Moviereached the milestone of earning $550 million, and before this, it managed$157 million in its opening weekend, making it the most successful domestic opening weekend for a videogame adaptation ever. Before A Minecraft Movie even aired, Chris predicted thatit would make a trillion dollars. This is mostly thanks to it pandering to young audiences, which means quick comedy, explosions, singing, and obvious Minecraft references. While it may not quite reach that mark yet, it is close to dethroning The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which currently stands at $1.36 billion. A Minecraft Movie has been filling seats in cinemas since its release, with credit due to the viralchicken jockey trend, which saw moviegoers go ballistic when the chicken jockey appeared on screen, with someone evenbringing their own chicken to the event. I'm pretty sure this meme helped boost A Minecraft Movie, with many people attending viewings to try and experience the chaos. But all good things must come to an end, and the chicken jockey meme is starting to wane. The question is whether it will die out before A Minecraft Movie can become the most successful videogame movie of all time.

    "title": "MSI Vector 16 HX AI gaming laptop review",
    "article_text": "No offers found When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A classic gaming laptop, that makes up for its lack of battery performance or pencil-thin chassis design with serious gaming frame rates even outside of its cacophonous Extreme Performance mode. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. In all the maddening volatility of the triple-T era (Trump, Tariffs, Trade war) I have been surprised by just how resilient and stable the laptop market has been. At least so far, anyways. Sure, Razer panicked and pulled down pre-orders temporarily for its new Blade laptops because of the Orange One's fiscal foibles, but it's still possible to buy new gaming notebooks for a normal price. Case in point: the newMSI Vector 16 HX AIcan be picked up today for just $2,500 with anRTX 5080GPU inside it, and not a horribly compromised one either. MSI's Vector range of gaming laptops has reliably been one of its more affordable lines of notebooks, though that's regularly been more of a 'down the line' kinda thing than necessarily launching with a stellar price. That said, this Vector 16 HXisone of the cheapest RTX 5080-based gaming slabs you'll find on the market right now, and if you let it loose it will also deliver some of the highest frame rates, too. But you won't want to. Because it's just as loud as theGigabyte Aorus Master 16I tested not so long back, and that was one throaty beast. Stick the Vector 16 HX in its 'Extreme Performance' mode and you will be at once delighted by the frame rate numbers and numbed by the sonic assault that is this cooling array running at full chat. Model no:A2XWIGCPU:Intel Core Ultra 9 275HXGPU:Nvidia RTX 5080 (175 W)RAM:32 GB DDR5-5600Storage:1 TB PCIe 4.0 SSDScreen size:16-inch IPSRefresh rate:240 HzResolution:2560 x 1600Battery:90 WhrDimensions:22.2 ~ 28.5 x 357 x 284 mm | 1.12 x 14.05 x 11.18 inchesWeight:2.7 kg | 5.95 lbsPrice:$2,500(16 GB version)|£2,800 Here's the rub though: It outperforms the Gigabyte machine, and other RTX 5080 laptops, to such an extent you can comfortably pull things back to the 'Balanced' profile from the MSI Center software and be confident you're still going to nail excellent frame rates without your ears bleeding. It still won't be a quiet experience, but it will be far less obtrusive than either machine at the ragged edge of what their respective cooling arrays are capable of. That's because, despite both having a nominal 175 W version of the RTX 5080—essentially that's the theoretical power level of the GPU silicon at its heart—the likelihood of hitting that power draw is pretty low. I mean, theRazer Blade 16I love so well purports to have a 175 WRTX 5090, but such is its slimline figure it never gets close. But, using the extreme profile of the MSI, the Vector 16 HX will get far closer to that top power level than the Gigabyte laptop on its equivalent power mode. The Vector 16 HX's GPU is often posting performance some 20 W higher than the Aorus Master 16, and when in the balanced mode that power draw only drops by 20 - 30 W, putting it more or less on par with top power profile of the Aorus Master 16, but using a lower mode. Basically, stick the Vector 16 HX on its balanced profile and never look back. Apologies, I've gone straight in for the performance jugular off the bat, without telling you what else makes up this chonky ol' laptop. Despite thinking this might be the year AMD almost entirely usurped Intel from its gaming laptop throne, I've only seen a singleRyzenlaptop with all the rest sporting Arrow Lake H-series silicon. That's surprised me, but it therefore won't surprise you to learn there's a Core Ultra 9 275HX chip at its heart. That's a 24-core chip of the hybrid variety, and means there are eight Performance-cores and 16 Efficient-cores, and no HyperThreading to be seen. As much as I am a big fan of the Strix Point AMD chips for their efficiency and impressive iGPUs, Arrow Lake in laptop form is a seriously powerful bit of tech. You're not going to get the same level of battery life out of an Arrow Lake laptop, even with an efficient RTXBlackwellGPU, but you will see higher CPU performance than with a modern AMD 300-series part. That's especially noticeable in a game such as Baldur's Gate 3 whichlovesit some serious processing grunt—the Arrow Lake systems perform far better in that game at every resolution than the Blade 16 with its RTX 5090 and Ryzen AI CPU. Though that is actually par for this gaming course, to be fair, because the RTX 5080 inside the Vector 16 HX is capable of outperforming the RTX 5090 in the Razer laptop across the board. And, as I noted before, it's also able to outpunch most other RTX 5080 laptops we've tested so far. Only Lenovo's mighty Legion Pro 7i, which I'm in the process of testing right now, is delivering higher frame rates, and that's a supremely pricey machine. At the$2,500price point (for the 16 GB RAM version) the Vector 16 HX is pretty tasty indeed. That Blade after all being $2,100 more expensive. Even Razer's RTX 5080 version is still another $1,100 more expensive than this impressively performance MSI machine, as is the Legion Pro. Though it is a classic gaming laptop, largely thanks to that Arrow Lake CPU. Where I'vepraised the RTX Blackwell generation of mobile GPUs for their capabilities when it comes to gaming on battery, that's not something you're going to get in abundance with the Vector 16 HX. We measured a shade under an hour and a half, though you can of course stretch that by going into lower power states and limiting frame rates, etc. Still, in real terms, this is a gaming laptop that you are going to want to keep plugged into the wall to get the most out of it. And that also makes it a laptop that you are going to want to keep primarily for gaming. It's a thick machine, and that lacking battery life also means it's not one to fling in your courier sack to take to class or your next meeting. It's also not super comfortable to use, either. That keyboard is pretty good, with a decent amount of travel, though with those slightly [technical term warning] smooshy keys it's not on the same level as a Lenovo keyboard or the excellent new Blade keeb. ✅You're after a dedicated gaming laptop:If you just want a notebook specifically for gaming rather than anything else, and also one that's regularly plugged into the wall, this is a great choice.✅You're on a modest budget:It's easy to spend $3,500 on an RTX 5080 laptop, but the Vector 16 HX is the most affordable gaming laptop we've tested to use Nvidia's second-tier GPU. ❌You need a do-everything machine:This MSI machine isn't going win any awards in the versatility or battery life stakes, but what it can do it does well.❌You want a travel companion:As well as the relatively low battery life, it's also a mighty chonky laptop that isn't going to be soothing to carry. But that's not what makes it uncomfortable; that's down to the sawblade chassis. The edges of the laptop, specifically where your lower wrists will rest while you're typing or WSAD-ing, are effectively serrated. That gets mighty scratchy after a while, and typing out this review on the machine is making my arms a little sore. I get you want to stick some detail into your chassis design, guys, but c'mon. Oh, and by the way, Ihateyour font. And, aesthetically, I guess it has an old world charm. Now, I know I can't get too fussy when I'm talking about a notebook that has been specifically created for price point rather than style points but its thickness does make it feel mildly anachronistic. Mind, I said the same of the Gigabyte system, but that's a far more expensive machine, so less forgivable. What I will say is there is an industrial style to it that I can get behind. The thick plastic hinges that joint the IPS display to the laptop frame aren't necessarily to my taste but are really leaning into its brash stylings. What I do like, however, are the super-obvious copper heatpipes and heatsinks you can glimpse through the vents on the side and underneath. That gets even more impressive when you whip the back off. That gets you access to the second M.2 slot for expanding your storage, but also exposes pretty much the entire component array, too. It's a pretty wild design, and I'm kinda here for it. Now, the MSI Vector 16 HX is certainly not going to set any hearts a-flutter with its looks outside of what it looks like with its kit off, but if you're after an affordable RTX 5080 gaming laptop that can genuinely deliver on the frame rate promises of the RTX Blackwell GPUs, then MSI has created an excellent machine. It's very much designed to be almost permanently attached to a plug socket, and it does often feel like it's trying to amputate your hands at the wrist over long sessions at the keyboard, so it's absolutely not an ideal do-anything gaming laptop, but it does a job and it definitely does it at a stellar price point. Just stay clear of that Extreme Performance mode if you value either your ears or your sanity. A classic gaming laptop, that makes up for its lack of battery performance or pencil-thin chassis design with serious gaming frame rates even outside of its cacophonous Extreme Performance mode.

    "title": "A Japanese retailer is only selling RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 GPUs for domestic use, which feels like a policy that is impossible to enforce",
    "article_text": "No offers found Pretty please can I spend thousands at your store? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Thanks to bots, scalpers, and even more bots, companies have been implementing strange ways to get GPUs into the hands of enthusiasts over the last few months. We've seen lotteries to'win' the chance at purchasing cards, we've seencustomers buying returned GPUsto beat the scalping market, and we've seen potential customers purchasingRTX 50-series GPUs through Discord. However, it seems one store in Japan has implemented the most specific and most infeasible way of controlling how its GPUs are being used. As reported byVideoCardz(and attributed to a post on Weibo), a Japanese shop has taken to informing potential customers it will not sellRTX 5090andRTX 5080GPUs to those looking to take them outside of Japan. A memo was spotted underneath the sign for a Zotac RTX 5090 in an electronics store in Osaka, which, when roughly translated with Google, says \"RTX 5090/RTX 5080 is only sold to customers for use in Japan. If the purchased product is to be taken out of Japan, it will not be sold.\" The Zotac RTX 5090 in said electronics store sells for ¥452,800, which equates to roughly $3,170. This price is inclusive of sales tax, though those with foreign passports can apply for tax-free shopping at many retailers when paying over ¥5,000 ($30). Some tourists may opt to buy their GPUs this way, both for the lack of sales tax and to take advantage of dips in the price of Yen. Presumably, this store has seen quite a few tourists picking up cards to bring home or to sell, as it's cheaper (or more readily available) to pick up than at home. However, no information is given on how exactly this policy could be enforced. It doesn't specify tourists, so a test wouldn't quite work, and the likelihood of a store asking for proof of residence before allowing someone to purchase an item is quite slim. This is before mentioning that a Japanese resident could feasibly purchase a card for a potential buyer and give it to them outside of a store—you know, like a teenager chancing their arm at getting alcohol to impress their friends. Back around the launch of the RTX 30-series cards, UK electronic seller, Overclockers UK, halted sales to the US due to high demand, and recent tariffs have also stopped RTX 50-series sales shipped to the US, but you can still buy any card in the UK and bring it across should you want to. This new policy in Japan is quite different as it is about stopping customers from buying in the physical shop, specifically. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. According to VideoCardz, some Japanese stores opted to deny customers looking to buy GPUs without sales tax, but tourists still bought the cards at full price. Some tourists reportedly found it was cheaper to fly to Japan and buy a card than buy it in their home country, even at an inflated price with included sales tax. Still, the store is likely putting a metaphorical line in the sand here, even if it feels very hard to enforce in any real way.

    "article_text": "No offers found That's $269 and 100s of hours' worth of the best turn-based tactics around. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When it comes to turn-based tactics, there's still one undisputed king of the genre: XCOM. If you've never experienced its brand of tense, alien-killing strategy before—or if there's a game or two in the series you skipped—then the good news is that today is a very cheap day to catch up. Humble Bundle's newXCOM Completeoffer is appropriately named—it really does include every XCOM game for just $10/£7.51. Well, technically excluding the mobile game. And that one Hasbro made where you played by email or something. But all the real ones! Most importantly, that includes bothXCOM: Enemy UnknownandXCOM 2,andall the DLC for both. Those two games with their big expansion packs (Enemy WithinandWar of the Chosenrespectively) are an absolute treasure trove in their own right, offering 100s of hours of best-in-show turn-based tactics. But you also get the spin-offs too.Chimera Squadis well worth a go—it's a more bite-sized take on the formula with a more comic book-y feel, and while it never reaches the heights of the mainline games, it's got a lot of fun ideas. It's an interesting precursor toMarvel's Midnight Suns, too, experimenting with some of the concepts that would go on to play a major role in that game. The Bureau: XCOM Declassifiedis a bit more controversial. Before XCOM: Enemy Unknown rebooted the series for modern audiences, 2K thought the right path to bringing it back was a third-person shooter set in the 60s. It ended up releasing a yearafterEnemy Unknown, thanks to a troubled development, and… well, let's say it wasn't well received. But hey, a fun curiosity to have in your library, and it does have some cool visual design. And if you really want to dive back into the history of the series, the bundle also includes the original five X-COM games from the 1990s. I can't speak personally to how well these hold up, but there are plenty of fans who prefer the more detailed and in-depth style of the old series—as more recently emulated by theXenonautsgames. $10/£7.51 gets you the full bundle, and that's definitely the tier I'd recommend going for if you don't already own Enemy Unknown and XCOM 2. The next tier down is $7/£5.26, but for the sake of saving a few bucks, it's a bit of an awkward selection, taking it down to just the old games, The Bureau, and Enemy Unknown with its expansion but without its smaller Slingshot DLC. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. And if you just want the old games—which a lot of us probably are missing from our libraries—you can get the five of them at the lowest tier for just $3/£2.25. All of the games in the bundle are delivered as Steam keys, which makes things nice and easy. And a portion of the proceeds go to a good cause:the Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. By my calculations the offer ends May 18th—so make sure to grab it before then. Well, assuming you're not part of the 95% of PC Gamer readers who already have a 500 hour save file in XCOM 2.

    "title": "Forget the rumoured 18 GB RTX 5070 Super, this utterly epic 96 GB Nvidia GPU will solve all your VRAM worries, kinda",
    "article_text": "No offers found All for the low, low price of $8,500. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If we can all agree that 8 GB ain't cutting it in 2025 for a proper gaming graphics card and even 12 GB is becoming marginal in the most demanding titles, how to solve that pesky VRAM anxiety for the long term? Well, there's arumoured RTX 5070 Super with 18 GB. But why not obliterate any thought of running out of graphics memory pretty much forever with a 96 GB card? Yup, Nvidia will sell you such a card, and it's not based on an irrelevant GPU built specifically for AI processing. In fact, theNvidia RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Workstation Editionuses the same GB202 chip as the mightyGeForce RTX 5090. Except the RTX Pro 6000 gets a very nearly fully enabled GB202 GPU with a ridiculous 24,064 CUDA cores, up from the feeble 21,760 cores of theRTX 5090. Add in that 96 GB of VRAM, three times the 32 GB you get with the 5090, and you have an absolute beast of a video board. It's the ultimate in future-proofing, surely? Well, possibly, but there are a couple of pifflingly minor caveats. First, the RTX Pro 6000 has an MSRP of $8,565. That's not great value considering the RTX 5090 with the same GPU, albeit slightly cut down, has an MSRP of $1,999. Even if you factor in the $3,000 that 5090s tend to go for in the real world, you're paying awfully heavily for that extra 64 GB of VRAM. The other snag is that, despite the fact that the RTX Pro 6000 uses exactly the same gaming-optimised GB202 silicon as the RTX 5090, it doesn't have the same gaming-centric drivers. In reality,it could be a fair bit slower than an RTX 5090 in games. That's despite a higher peak boost clock of 2,600 MHz to the 5090's 2,407 MHz. The RTX Pro 6000's base clock is actually around 400 MHz lower than the 5090 at 1,590 MHz. All with a 600 W TDP. Moreover, if you could somehow wangle an RTX 5090 at MSRP, then do the same with its successors, presumably the RTX 6090 and RTX 7090, you could probably enjoy all three over a six year period for near enough what you're paying for the RTX Pro 6000. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As for that rumouredRTX 5070Super with 18 GB, we're talking about a mere forum post referring to such a card. So, it's the most wafer-thin of rumours. But it does make sense. There's a new variant of GDDR7 memory with 3 GB per chip, which would allow for 18 GB onthe RTX 5070's 192-bit memory bus. Indeed, it's those 3 GB chips which allow Nvidia to create a24 GB RTX 5090 laptop GPU with a 256-bit memory bus, where you'd normally expect 16 GB. Likewise, an 18 GB RTX 5070 Super would sit more easily in the GeForce range now that Nvidia has released the RTX 5060 Ti with an optional 16 GB variant. It's a little odd to find the $429 RTX 5060 Ti 16 GB is cheaper than the $549 RTX 5070 with just 12 GB. Whether Nvidia actually releases an RTX 5070 Super with 18 GB, we'll have to wait and see. At the right price, it could be a decent long-term investment. But expecting an Nvidia GPU at the right price is typically an exercise in frustration.

    "title": "Fighting game Marvel Contest of Champions is coming to PC with over 300 characters",
    "article_text": "No offers found Marvel Contest of Champions launched on mobile devices over a decade ago, and is now bringing its giant hero and villain roster to PC. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Marvel Contest of Champions, a free-to-play mobile fighting game first released in 2014, is bringing a roster of over 300 Marvel superheroes and villains to PC. Surely that is too many Marvel people for a fighting game, I thought. But then I clicked through all 19 pages ofChampion spotlightson theofficial site, and it's true: Spider-Punk, Rintrah, Platinumpool, Air-Walker, Count Nefaria, Sunspot, they're all there. (And I promise I didn't make any of those up.) Fans of the mobile fighting game have known about the upcoming PC release for a little while, but Canadian developer Kabam Games announced the plan officially today. The PC version will run at 60 fps and the UI has been \"overhauled\" for monitors, the studio says. It'll also feature cross-progression, allowing players to swap between the PC and mobile versions with one account. The mobile version is played by tapping, holding, and swiping the left and right sides of the screen to perform light, medium, and heavy attacks, blocks, dashes, and ultimates. It's relatively simple, and I imagine it has to be with that many characters, but I had some fun with it on my phone. Of course, I'd personally prefer a controller or even a keyboard to the touchscreen controls, and that is part of the point of bringing MCoC to PC, where it will have remappable controls. Contest of Champions includes a singleplayer story and an online versus mode, as well as the usual free-to-play trappings, namely daily quests and multiple currencies to collect. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's popular on phones, with 4.2 stars out of five on theGoogle Play store. According to the developer, it's been downloaded on over 300 million devices. With the ongoing success ofMarvel Rivals, perhaps Kabam chose a good time to make this move, though whether this mobile character-collecting game will hold attentions on PC is to be seen. The PC version of Marvel Contest of Champions will launch sometime this year, and there's apre-registration form on the official sitefor those who want to get ahead of things. Existing players may want to sign up, because there are rewards associated with doing so, as seen in the image below: Tyler grew up in Silicon Valley during the '80s and '90s, playing games like Zork and Arkanoid on early PCs.

    "title": "Thrustmaster T.Flight HOTAS One Microsoft Flight Simulator Edition review",
    "article_text": "No offers found When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While the T.Flight HOTAS One flight setup doesn't exactly set my world on fire, it does an admirable job of delivering a reasonable set of flight controls for a very attractive price. It's far from perfect, but for the money? I reckon it's a good budget entry point for flight sim novices. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. During my time at PC Gamer, I've had the pleasure of testing some very expensive flight sim gear. That's not to start off this review with a brag, more to say that it's generally a pretty pricey hobby. A satisfying one, no doubt, but I wouldn't blame you if you looked at some of the full-on sim setups on the market and baulked at the astonishing prices. Trouble is, it's difficult to know whether it's worth spending a lot of moolah on something you might not enjoy, or perhaps more accurately, might want to approach from a more casual perspective. Cheap flight sticks are available, of course, but it's difficult to find something serviceable for around $100 that might wet your whistle—and give you an indicator as to whether it might be worth investing in some premium flight sim gear in future. Enter, Thrustmaster's T.Flight HOTAS (hands on throttle and stick) range. We've had the HOTAS X down as ourbest budget joystickfor many moons, but it's been a while since we've had our hands on a new model. Luckily, there's a new version on the block, the T.Flight HOTAS One Microsoft Flight Simulator Edition, built to support modern Xbox consoles (and PC, natch) forMSFS 2024. And other games, of course.All for the very attractive price of$110/£90. That's around half of what you'd pay for theLogitech G X54 HOTAS RGB, our top mid-range pick, and the sort of money you might spend if you were looking to see if flap adjustments, barrel rolls, and a plethora of confusing acronyms and initialisms were for you without breaking the bank. Type:HOTASConnectivity:USB Type-A (cable included)Controls:Flight stick with Z-axis movement, throttle control, 15 buttons, two throttle-mounted paddles, trigger, four-way stick-mounted hat switch.Extra features:Splittable throttle and stick controls, built-in stick tension adjustmentPrice:$110/£90 You get a tension-adjustable flight stick, a throttle control with built-in rear paddles, a host of buttons, a single stick-mounted hat control, and the ability to split the whole shebang in half across your desk. The two halves can be attached together with two hex bolts (tightened with an included hex key hidden under the throttle assembly), or spread akimbo thanks to a decently-long adjoining cable. It's also white. Very white. Putting aside my bias against white peripherals for a second (oh go on then: they're next to impossible to keep clean), it's a fairly handsome device overall. That being said, there's something about an all-white finish that makes cheap plastic look a little cheaper—although I suppose it does fit with the MSFS 2024 branding. Yes, it's a little cheap-looking. And, if I'm honest, a little cheap-feeling, especially when it comes to all those buttons. Those looking for satisfying clunks and clicks from the controls will be disappointed, but again, I have to remind myself of the price. This is starter equipment for a very reasonable MSRP, and as such, I'll say they're not too bad. What's genuinely good, however, is the feel of the stick movement. The tension can be adjusted underneath the stick base with an easy-to-use dial, and as a heavy-stick-enjoyer, I immediately cranked it to its maximum. It's not properly heavy at this setting, but it adds in a level of resistance that makes fine movements easier to perform. At least for this cack-handed reviewer, anyway. The throttle action is smooth, too, although I would like to see a similar easy adjustment dial here. It's a little light and toy-like in its movement, but feels accurate nonetheless. Install the drivers, boot up MSFS 2024, and everything is recognised immediately. You'd be surprised how many premium flight sticks make this process much more difficult than it needs to be, but the Thrustmaster set really is plug and play. It's also easy enough to configure in DCS World, as much as any flight stick can be in that most-finnicky of games. Whizzing around the skies in an F/A-18E fighter jet, buzzing bridges and generally making a nuisance of myself, I have to say it's easy to forget that I'm using a budget bit of gear. The stick movement feels smooth and reasonably accurate, and while the throttle control is definitely light, it's still satisfying to slam forward with intent. And while I'd like some less-rattly buttons, I have to say they're all very well-placed. Even the clicky little stick-mounted hat control is perfectly usable under duress, by which I mean, looking at the scenery briefly before realising that I'm plummeting towards terra firma. It's not all fun and frolics, though. For a start, it's not quite as simple to connect the two halves together as it first appears. There's a lever-slot mechanism that links the two, but in order to get the cable out of the way you need to cram it into a cut out section inside the base. Which would be fine, if the cable wasn't so fiddly to deal with while linking the controls together. An easily-detachable cable that allows you to disconnect both halves (you can technically do this with a screwdriver, but it's not a straightforward process) and then reconnect them would be a better solution. Or just a bendier cable, to be honest. That being said, it's nice to have the option to spread the controls out for a more realistic feel. Once apart, however, the individual units are a touch light, and there's very little rubber on the bottom to stop them slipping around. Both halves together make for a weighty-enough bit of kit to resist unwanted movement, but split them in twain and they have a tendency to wander, which is frustrating when you're trying to divebomb Christ the Redeemer for a photo op. Ask me how I know. ✅You're looking for your first taste of flight stick fun:Proper flight sim gear can be expensive, so starting out with something cheap and cheerful like the T.Flight HOTAS One makes a whole lot of sense.✅You're on a very tight budget:You're very unlikely to find better for cheaper, that's for sure. ❌You're prepared to spend up from the outset:If you've decided that flight sims are, like,your kinda thing, manthen you may want to drop some cash on something that's a bit more premium, even as a starter stick. So yes, there are some definite downsides to going this cheap for your entry point into flight sims. But what you get, for a fraction of the cash of other offerings, is excellent fun. The Thrustmaster kit is focussed on delivering three things—an accurate stick, a decent throttle control, and plenty of button options—all for an ultra-budget price point. And in this endeavour, it very much succeeds. Plus, while that white plastic seems destined to mark over time, the whole setup feels robust enough that I'd say it should stand up to some abuse without breaking beyond repair. The base plastic might not be the most premium of affairs, but it's fairly thick, so if you do end up scooting it off your desk in a moment of un-pilot-like panic I think it'll likely be fine. Or, when you dig it out of the attic to give to a friend once you've upgraded to something more expensive. That's the thing about the Thrustmaster—it's all about providing a robust starting point into a whole new arena of gaming for a minimal outlay. Yes, you can buy better, but for nowhere near this sort of cash. And that, my friends, makes it all-white in my book. While the T.Flight HOTAS One flight setup doesn't exactly set my world on fire, it does an admirable job of delivering a reasonable set of flight controls for a very attractive price. It's far from perfect, but for the money? I reckon it's a good budget entry point for flight sim novices.

    "title": "Devs lament Oblivion Remastered's surprise release as Todd Howard eats their lunch: 'I noticed a complete stop in game sales from about 2 pm onward on Oblivion day'",
    "article_text": "No offers found \"I'm pretty sure Oblivion releasing gave us like a 10-20% haircut on daily revenue.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In terms of complexity, anxiety, and sheer turbidity, launching a videogame seems roughly equivalent to planning a land war on Mars. It's a constant, 5D chess game with thousands of players and no clear ruleset, where definite victories become humiliating defeats—and vice versa—according to no obvious ruleset. But at least one thing is clear: you're better off not launching your plucky little indie thing against GTA 6 or some other Vredefort-impact scale release. So you can imagine a lot of devs' disappointment when Bethesda popped up last week to announce it was releasing Oblivion Remastered, suddenly dropping a humongous launch in the middle of what had been, previously, a relatively uncluttered release period. \"From the perspective of indies and indie publishers, this is the problem with these sort of massive shadow drops,\" said Raw Fury boss Jónas Antonsson (viaGamesRadar) onX. \"Everything more or [less] gets buried.\" Raw Fury is the publisher of puzzle-horror gamePost Trauma, which released last week on, um, April 22. That's the same day Oblivion Remastered hit. Antonsson says a whole lot of strategy goes into release timings, and something like Oblivion popping up can pretty much capsize everything. \"We don’t have the cash nor muscle to throw around, so everything is carefully planned. Including when to release, based on other releases etc—to try to maximize the chances of getting attention. \"Love the game that dropped but feel the pain for our team,\" said Antonsson. Which, hey, seems fair to me. It's not just Raw Fury that was blindsided by Bethesda, either. Mike Rose—dev on strategy deckbuilderStarless Abyss—put out a call for publicity on X after the game released in \"the exact week that Oblivion was shadow-dropped\" and noted that the coincidence had been \"not fantastic for our launch.\" Hi Twitter, could really use your help 🙏🙏We just launched our latest game, Starless Abyss -- the exact week that Oblivion was shadow-dropped. Which has been *not fantastic* for our launchIf anyone can spare a RT, that would be so, so helpful ❤️❤️Here's the launch trailer: pic.twitter.com/vOB0VUEWSvApril 25, 2025 Even devs whose launches didn't happen alongside Bethesda's can't help but be affected when such a big fish makes a splash in the pond. \"I'm pretty sure Oblivion releasing gave us like a 10-20% haircut on daily revenue\" postedCaves of Qud'sBrian Bucklew onBluesky. \"I noticed a complete stop in game sales from about 2 pm onward on Oblivion day,\"addedFrancisco González, dev on adventure gameRosewater. This isn't the first time this kind of thing has happened, even in the last couple of months. In March, the (not surprise) release ofMonster Hunter Wildsled devs to lament a lack of sales. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. So I'm not really sure if this kind of thing can truly besolved. Sure, not surprise-dropping massive games would help, but even when you announce a release date for a huge game well in advance, devs will still end up outweighed. It's a rough one, although it's worth remembering that the Oblivion remaster was pretty much an open secret even before it dropped last week. So much so that Bethesda's refusal to just come out and finally announce the thing drove fans to thebrink of madness, so it didn't comecompletelyout of the blue. Still, I can't help but feel a bit sorry for the devs caught under Bethesda's forward march. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together One of Josh's first memories is of playing Quake 2 on the family computer when he was much too young to be doing that, and he's been irreparably game-brained ever since.

But it wasn't long before the Elden Ring community was besting him withjust a bottle of perfumeor with justone hit, which dealt 143,411 damage in one go. It only took Let Me Solo Her a few attempts to best him, which makes his comments about how difficult Orphan of Kos was all the more terrifying. \"This boss took me more tries than any previous boss fights, and even had me exploring Chalice Dungeons to farm Blood Vials and bullets off stream, just to replenish them,\" Let Me Solo Her continues. \"He's definitely the hardest boss in Bloodborne for me.\" These comments are shortly followed by a compilation of all the times Let Me Solo Her got messed up by Orphan of Kos. There's nothing quite like the desperation and emptiness you feel when repeatedly dying to a FromSoft boss. Just when you think you've hit rock bottom, the floor gives out under you and you reach new depths. Hearing Let Me Solo Her try to psyche himself up or just plead \"please get out of my frame\" as Kos jumps him over and over again really resonates with me, while also being a helpful reminder that, no, I probably shouldn't start a new Bloodborne playthrough. \"But eventually, Orphan of Kos was defeated and the nightmare ended,\" Let Me Solo Her says. \"With Bloodborne finished, I think I understand why this game was always trending on Twitter as fans kept hoping for a remastered version. And although hopes of a remaster or a PC port are probably out of the picture as time goes on, I really enjoyed Bloodborne.\" I guess the next logical move after this would be for Let Me Solo Her to invest in a Switch 2 so he can playDuskbloods, the spiritual successor to Bloodborne, when it comes out in 2026.

    "article_text": "No offers found It's time to welcome new friends to Friendship Island. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hello Kitty Island Adventure's first major content update is finally here, and there are a plethora of new additions to get stuck into. From welcoming new visitors to the island, to a mass of additional quests to complete, the Friends, Flowers, and Frozen Peaks update has it all. Just as I think I'm done pouring hours and hours into my island getaway, now I've got even more reason to keep befriending Sanrio's beloved mascots. The addition of Icy Peak is one of the most significant features of the update, which adds an entirely new side of the mountain to explore. Not only is this home to new forageable items like flowers, you'll also find more quests to embark on. Icy Peak also has different weather cycles from the island to shake the routine up a bit, but this will make it a bit harder to navigate. While exploring, you'll also find numerous materials needed for crafting and cooking which were locked away here too. On top of the addition of Icy peak, Retsuko, Pekkle, and Keroppi are finally getting some visitors to island cabins too. Just like everyone else they all have unique needs and requests for their homes before they'll visit which you'll need to meet. All this information can still be found in your phone under the visitors menu though, so you won't just have to cobble together items in the hopes someone rocks up. Aside from all this exciting new content, this update also brings a number of changes to the game to make island life that little bit easier like finally being able to place an item on a table. Seriously. This feature is lifechanging when it comes to decorating and I cannot begin to express how much frustration I had whenever I tried to put a comic on a table and simply couldn't. Even theSteam update announcing this change shows how excitedSunblink is to share the good news. Improvements to how you build friendship with your islanders have also been made, so the more hearts your gift has, the more XP you'll get with that character in return. It's no use gifting whatever in an attempt to level up your friendship quickly, it's now more beneficial to carefully think about what you're giving everyone to reap the benefits.

    "title": "How to start Knights of the Nine in Oblivion and the remaster",
    "article_text": "No offers found How to begin your Pilgrimage to The Nine. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is already an unbelievably huge game, and this new version also comes with all of the original DLC. While Shivering Isles is the Oblivion DLC everyone loves to talk about most, the Knights of the Nine DLC introduces a new faction, new quests, and some sweet new gear to earn too. The remastered version of Oblivion incorporates the DLC content into the base game more naturally, so the Knights of the Nine quest isn't immediately added to your journal as soon as you leave the tutorial sewers. Instead, you'll have to seek out the Prophet on your own. It's so well integrated into Oblivion Remastered that new players probably won't even realize they're starting an expansion when they get the quest. Here's how to start the Knights of the Nine DLC quest in Oblivion Remastered: Impressed by your humility, the Prophet will give you a map guiding you to wayshrines throughout Cyrodiil. The Pilgrimage quest is the heart of Knights of the Nine, and the hunt for the Crusader Relics can only begin once you've visited every wayshrine. There is no level requirement for Knights of the Nine, so you can start the DLC as soon as you finish the tutorial in the Imperial Sewer. Fast travel points in Anvil and all major settlements are unlocked by default in Oblivion Remastered, so feel free to just teleport straight there as soon as you're ready. Pilgrimage is the first Knights of the Nine DLC quest in Oblivion Remastered, and it's one of the most tedious quests in the expansion. Before you can get to the fun stuff, you have to visit nine wayshrines devoted to the Nine Divines. It may seem like a lot of busy work, but you can actually hit all nine of the marked wayshrines fairly quickly with the help of fast travel. They're not too far from major towns, so you can just teleport across the map to speed up your pilgrimage. Once you pray at the ninth and final wayshrine, you'll see a vision that unlocks the next quest and sets up the hunt for the Crusader Relics. Just because you can start Knights of the Nine whenever you want doesn't mean that you should rush to complete it. Since the Crusader Relics are the biggest draw for this DLC, you should wait until you're a high enough level to get the best possible versions of the armor and weapons. The Crusader gear scales to your level in Oblivion Remastered, so its stats will be weaker if you do the DLC at a low level. To get the strongest possible versions of the Crusader armor and weapons,you should be level 21 or higher when you start Knights of the Nine. You can still get the Crusader Relics at any level, but the enchantments and defense stats max out at level 21. If you're eager to start Knights of the Nine, though, it's a good idea to get the Pilgrimage quest out of the way so you can save the fun stuff for later.

    "title": "Donkey Kong 64 composer shares why Nintendo didn't credit him in the Super Mario Bros. Movie for the DK rap—it owns the song, and didn't want to",
    "article_text": "No offers found \"They're all the performers on the track. So they're all in the movie uncredited.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nintendo's really just been scoring all bummers recently—coming after Palworld,shutting down fan mods and projects, and clampingdown on emulators. While it's all been within its technical legal rights to do so, as PC Gamer's own Morgan Park pointed out last year, the family-friendly veneer of kindnesshas well and truly slipped. An almost hilarious cherry on top of the jerkface cherry bake comes in the form of Donkey Kong 64 composer Grant Kirkhope, whoblew up at Nintendocirca 2023 for not crediting him in the Super Mario Bros. Movie despite placing the DK Rap in it wholesale. Speaking to Eurogamer,Kirkhopealleges that the long and short of it is, basically, that they didn't want to, and didn't have to, so they didn't. \"They said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers—apart from Koji Kondo. Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin.\" Legally, Nintendo isn't obligated to credit people for music it fully owns the rights to. Often, when you're working under contract for a company, you are providing labour in exchange for the rights to that labour itself. Take this article, for example: I can say I wrote it, but I don't technically own it, and I can't make money off it like a content creator or blog owner could—I'm being paid a salary instead. Kirkhope, similarly, can't monetize the famous Donkey Kong rap. But there's what a company is legally allowed to do and… you know, kinda being an obstinate jerk about it. Those are two different things. Kirkhope tried to appeal to the litigious gaming giant's sense of empathy, but to no avail: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"I said: I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'.\" Alas, no dice. \"It's bizarre how they just sampled it straight from the game,\" Kirkhope continues. \"They just plugged in the N64 and sampled it and looped it. There's no re-recording done, straight out the game. So it's me playing guitar on it. It's the lads from Rare doing the [sings] 'D-K' thing. They're all the performers on the track. So they're all in the movie uncredited.\" I have to wonder aloud if this is part of a historic tendency for Japanese companies to avoid crediting people in videogames—not that companies from other countries don't makesimilar mistakes. Here's agreat write-upfrom journalist John Szczepaniak, who spoke to several Japanese devs from studios including Capcom and Sega about how they'd often be forced to use pseudonyms. There's a real history there. Whether that's the reason Nintendo's squeezed Kirkhope out of the byline or not is anyone's guess—one thing's for certain: Nintendo doesn't want to tell you about any members of the DK crew. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Harvey's history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he's since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G'raha Tia.

    "title": "How to begin The Shivering Isles in Oblivion and the remaster",
    "article_text": "No offers found How and when you can unlock Oblivion's most beloved expansion. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered comes with all of the DLC from the original game, and that includes the Shivering Isles expansion. While there's already a ton of stuff to do in Cyrodiil, Shivering Isles adds over 30 hours of additional quests and exploration in a whole other map zone. The remastered version of the game makes some changes to the Shivering Isles expansion and other DLC to better incorporate it into the base game, so things are a bit different than you may remember. If you're new to Oblivion, you might not even realize that you're starting a whole new expansion when you pick up the first quest. Here's how to start the Shivering Isles expansion in Oblivion Remastered: In the original Oblivion and its Game of the Year edition, you'll be barraged with DLC pop-up messages as soon as you step out of the sewers after the tutorial. The remaster gets rid of those, so you have to seek out the Strange Door on your own to add the Shivering Isles quest to your journal. You can head straight to the strange door without asking around Bravil if you'd like, and there's no minimum level requirement for Shivering Isles. The DLC doesn't lock you away from the main quest, either, so you're free to come and go as you please. The starting Shivering Isles quest is called A Door in Niben Bay. It's automatically added to your journal if you head straight to the Strange Door, but you can also learn about the quest by asking NPCs about rumors in towns like Bravil. Most of them will run through the usual lines about the Thieves Guild or Kvatch, but you'll eventually hear about the Strange Door if you ask enough people. Since every major settlement in Cyrodiil has fast travel points unlocked by default, you can teleport right to Bravil and take a short hike east to the Strange Door so you can start Shivering Isles ASAP. Once you arrive, you'll find a pair of guards that can share some more details about the glowing gate. Shortly after meeting the guards, a crazed Dark Elf named Belmyne Dreleth will emerge from the gate and start attacking. He's one of many adventurers who have entered the Strange Door and lost their sanity in the process. Once he's dead, a strange voice seeking a true champion will beckon you into the gate. This is the start of the Shivering Isles. When you cross the threshold, you'll meet Haskiil, right-hand man of the Daedric Prince of Madness Sheogorath. You can either refuse his offer and walk right back out the door to Cyrodiil, or you can choose to venture further into the Shivering Isles to help Sheogorath with his problems. While you can technically start the DLC whenever you want in Oblivion Remastered,you should wait to start Shivering Isles until about level 20before seeking out the Strange Door. Oblivion Remastered has addressed some of the level scaling problems that were present in the original game, so Shivering Isles should be much more accessible to low-level players who want to skip straight to the DLC. However, the loot you can find on the other side of the Strange Door is best suited for a high-level adventurer. If you're patient and wait until around level 20 to start the DLC, you'll find the best possible equipment. If you try to do Shivering Isles early, any unique weapons and armor you find will quickly be outclassed by other gear you'll find when you head back to the base game.

    "title": "'There are currently three Xbox controller prototypes': New cloud gaming-enabled controller rumour suggests everything really is an Xbox",
    "article_text": "No offers found Xbox could be all-in on the cloud. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There's just something special about an Xbox pad. The feel, the look, those clicky buttons. We at PC Gamer like it a lot, and it's been reported that three new prototypes are being worked on, so it seems like there's going to be a lot of choice in the future. The next generation of Xbox controller also reportedly has cloud gaming at the heart of its very design, though I really hope it gets some quality of life improvements like Hall effect sticks. In the Xbox-focused podcast,Xbox Two(viaNotebook Check), Windows Central's Jez Corden revealed that there are \"currently three Xbox controller prototypes\" in the works. Corden has been reporting on everything Xbox for some time, and is generally well regarded when it comes to insider Microsoft information. The first controller prototype talked about in thelatest podcast\"is a basic, cheaper controller like the standard one we have now.\" The basic Xbox Wireless Controller is currently our choice for thebest controller for PC gaming, thanks to a great feel and an affordable price point. However, looking at the rest of the market, it now noticeably lacks modern features, such as Hall effect or TMR joysticks to stop stick drift. Corden says the new basic controller has \"some next-gen enhancements\", but gives no word on what that specifically means. The mid-range choice of the three controller prototypes is codenamed Sebile, and it leakedway back in 2023. Not much information was given here, but it is suggested to take up a similar price point to the Xbox Elite Core. Corden then says there will be an \"elite, elite, elite\" controller, which will be the cream of the crop, pricewise. This is effectively the Xbox Elite Series 3, but once again, there was no further information on the specifics. Notably, the most interesting inclusion in this report is Xbox's straight-to-Wi-Fi cloud support for two of these controller prototypes, which could make cloud gaming more viable for some, especially for latency sensitive games. \"Instead of connecting your controller via Bluetooth,\" says Corden, \"then your phone sending your controller signal up to the cloud, which adds a few milliseconds of latency, your controller will directly connect to your router as a wifi connection.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Google Stadia(RIP) used this same straight-to-Wi-Fi tech, and it's how Google's cloud gaming platform managed to get its latency as low as it could. Now, years after the closure of Stadia, Xbox seems to be learning from it. We heard about the idea of a direct-to-cloud Xbox controller back in the original Sebile leaks, but we didn't get a better idea of how exactly that would work until now. The original Sebile leak also suggested it would have a lift to wake on function, and modular thumbsticks, but we don't know if that has stuck around. Late last year, Microsoft unveiled the 'This is an Xbox' advert, showing off Xbox cloud streaming on a TV, Laptop, Steam Deck, phone and more. This is part of a grander push to get Xbox gamers on non-Xbox devices, and the push towards cloud streaming on controllers feels very intentional in light of that. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate allows subscribers to stream games directly to their phone, monitor, or TV, though the available library is pretty limited right now. Corden says the basic controller doesn't have the Wi-Fi cloud streaming option, but the two other controllers do. As well as this, the two more expensive controllers reportedly have switches to quickly switch from Bluetooth to Wi-Fi connection. Corden does, however, clarify that this is still early on and lacking a lot of information: \"This is something I share on a podcast, but not necessarily something I'm willing to put into a report yet, because I don't have a huge amount of information on this stuff. So, take it with a pinch of salt.\" Not only could any part of this chain of information be inaccurate, but it is also subject to change as Microsoft continues to develop its controllers. It's a good sign for what we may see, but we won't know what tech the controllers have until they're in our hands. As someone who has spent a significant amount of time with many different controllers, I still love the feel and look of the Xbox controller. It's hard not to feel like I'm missing out, though, with competitors launching with TMR or Hall effect to deal with stick drift. I'm on my second Xbox controller since buying my Xbox Series X at launch, and my third PlayStation 5 controller. Cloud gaming compatibility is a nice feature, but I don't want to put all that money down for an Xbox Elite controller if the ever-looming threat of stick drift hovers just around the corner.

    "article_text": "No offers found Not the type of points you want to be earning, really. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sea of Thieves recently announced a significant update to its punishment system, taking the old formula and giving it a well needed update. In a post shared to the gamesSteam blog, and avideo uploaded to YouTube, all the details of the new structure were shared including what has changed from the old format. The old ban system operated under the rule of \"three-strikes and you're out\" which the team admitted worked for them in the Steam post announcing the change. But apparently, there were a few too many instances of players feeling like they had received their final strike for smaller infractions, and not understanding why they were being banned. In the same statement published on Steam, Rare stated \"we will be giving players more information on why we are taking action against their accounts and an opportunity to change their ways. While, unfortunately, there are a few bad eggs in this world who do want to cause harm and distress to others, we’re conscious that some folks might just be having a bad day and immediately regret their actions—and we want to give these players room to learn from their mistakes.\" The new format relies on a point system rather than strikes. Each player starts with zero points when they take to the seven seas for the first time, and will accrue points depending on the severity of their behaviour. For example, certain toxic behaviours over voice and text chat will result in one to three points and a three day suspension, whereas the next step up will result in up to seven points, and your break will be extended to a week. If you're found to be cheating in the game, you will receive 12 points immediately and a permanent ban with no chance to redeem yourself. Players will also be told why they have received a suspension on their account, unlike in the past, when a Redbeard or Yellowbeard error with no explanation would pop up when you would try to log in. This is an attempt to help more people understand their actions, and hopefully rectify them, which is helped by the fact you can remove points from your account as long as you behave.Removing points still takes a few months, as Sea of Thieves wants to really make sure you're being a good pirate before it rewards you by deducting a point. If you're ever lost on how many points you have, or if your account is suspended and you want to check when you can set sail again, you'll be able to do so by logging into theSea of Thieves website.

    "article_text": "No offers found 50% more graphics cores, 180 AI TOPS, Darkmont cores, the works. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel's 18A process node and thePanther Lake CPUthat will be the first to use it are together looking like an absolutely critical turning point for the beleaguered chip maker. The good news for Intel is that Panther Lake is shaping up to be a killer mobile CPU, if the latest reports are accurate. First up, according to some device ID listings uncovered byX user InstLatX64(viaWCCFTech), Panther Lake will be getting Intel's next-gen Darkmont E-cores, not the Skymont E-cores already seen in the Arrow Lake generation of CPUs. This makes sense on two counts. First, Darkmont is said to be a revised and upgraded version of Skymont, rather than a radical new design. Second, Intel is on record that Darkmont is going to be the basis of its Clearwater Forest server chip early next year. And that will be built on 18A silicon. In other words, Darkmont has been designed for 18A, while Skymont would need to be redesigned and ported from the TSMC N3 node on which it's currently being manufactured. Next up, the chip is said to sport 180 TOPS of total AI processing power. That's a big step up over the 120 TOPS of its current Lunar Lake mobile CPU. Lunar Lake largely splits its tops between a dedicated NPU and the GPU, with 48 TOPS from the NPU and 67 TOPS from the GPU. The remaining 5 TOPS come courtesy of the CPU cores. A fair chunk of that step from 120 to 180 TOPS is likely to come from Panther Lake's GPU, arguably the most exciting element of the new chip. It not only gets an upgrade toIntel's new third-gen Celestial GPU architecture, but it also steps up from the eight graphics Battlemage-spec cores in Lunar Lake to 12 cores. It's fairly likely Celestial will be more performant per core than Battlemage. So, an expectation of over 50% more raw performance is reasonable, though that will not necessarily translate into 50%-plus higher in-game frame rates. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For the record, Panther Lake will also get Intel's new Cougar Cove P-cores. The top SKU is reported to be a chip with four P-Cores, eight E-cores and a further four low-power E-cores, perhaps of a lower Skymont specification. Anyhow, Panther Lake certainly has the makings of a fantastic chip for handheld gaming PCs. On paper, it should have the measure of AMD's latest Strix Point APU,as seen in the Ayaneo 3. Intel's current Lunar Lake chip,used to great effect in the MSI Claw 8 AI+ A2VM handheld, is pretty competitive with AMD's Strix Point chip, as it is. Add 50% more graphics cores and it should really fly. Moreover, the success of the Panther Lake mobile CPU and its Celestial iGPU should help encourage Intel to keep faith with GPUs generally and roll out a discrete Celestial-based graphics card for desktop gaming PCs. Goodness knows, we need as much competition as we can get in that space.

    "title": "Chinese gamers are protesting Infinity Nikki by flooding its Steam launch with attempts to scare off would-be players",
    "article_text": "No offers found Infinity Nikki's Version 1.5 has slipped in some monetisation changes that haven't gone down well. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The relationship between gacha game developers and their players is often a strained one. That couldn't be more evident with how Chinese Infinity Nikki players have been reacting to its most recent update, includingtaking to the forums of the new Steam launchen masse to warn people away from playing. Version 1.5 launched this week and it's a pretty big one. There's a new dye system, extra colour evolutions for a handful of outfits, and the introduction of the Star Sea ensemble, an iconic fit in the Nikki series. Aside from the multitude of bugs it seems to have introduced—if you can even get into the game to experience them right now—there's been a real subtle monetisation push on Infold's side. Both of the newInfinity Nikki banners, for example, contain two 5-star outfits that sport a record 11 pieces to collect. That's a maximum of 220 pulls, or 26,400 diamonds just to complete one outfit. For context, all other 5-star outfits have either been nine or 10 pieces each, taking the cost down to 180 pulls and 200 pulls respectively. It's an extremely small change, but one that's already ringing alarm bells for future outfits. As it stands, Infinity Nikki's banner cadence is already pretty unfriendly to low spenders or free-to-play folk—I fall into the low spender category and have had to skip around half of the banners released since December—and outfits with extra items only make it more difficult for budget-friendly players. Couple that with the fact that Infold has extended the duration of Mira Crown—the biggest and easiest source of free currency—from two weeks to three weeks, and it's causing more than a few players to feel the financial squeeze. Chinese players in particular seem deeply unhappy with the changes, and haven't been shy about vocalising their thoughts and even reaching out across the pond to potential stylists in the west in an attempt to deter them. The forums for the new Steam release has been the main vessel for this, with an absurd number of both Chinese language and English translated posts venting frustrations.One forum postcalled Infinity Nikki \"a fraudulent product that betrays its core promise,\" citing \"pity system sabotage\" and \"progres-resetting crashes\" as issues.

Don't play!\" claimed Infold was \"a game company that only stares at the player's wallet\" and called some of the Version 1.5 changes \"sneaky\".Another postsimply calls for a maximum of 180 pulls to obtain a full outfit. I could go on forever, as there's around a dozen pages right now, the majority filled with these posts. As someone who's been playing both gacha games and the Nikki series for a hot sec, seeing Chinese players reach out to English-speaking communities to vent frustrations and band together is an incredibly rare occurrence. Most of this noise usually tends to happen over on Chinese social media like Billibilli. Whether it's because Steam's a pretty easy vessel to connect the two communities, or if it's because the situation is truly so dire that folk are crossing oceans and language barriers to protest, I don't know. Maybe a bit of both. It's still in the early hours of the new update so no word from Infold yet. It's done a good amount of backpedaling on unfavorable additions in the past, though, so I expect to see at least some sort of acknowledgement in the coming days.

    "article_text": "No offers found Call it an act of conviction. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After a brisk 12 years,Ubisofthas suddenly remembered it apparently owns some kind of series where you do war crimes for the NSA. The company has just addedSteam achievements to Splinter Cell: Blacklist, the 2013 stealth-action game that marks the last time Sam Fisher was seen alive in a videogame of his own. This is part of Ubi's ongoing quest to add Steam cheevos to its voluminous back catalogue of games on Steam, the same one that's seen games likeAssassin's Creed 3andWatch Dogs 2suddenly sprout achievements after years on the platform. I poke fun, but it's a genuinely good thing, and a sound bit of customer relations by Ubisoft. Some people care way too much—which is to say, at all—about Steam achievements. Also, I am 'some people.' Like with other Ubisoft games that have gotten this treatment, you won't have to go and earn all the ones you earned on Ubisoft Connect again. \"Achievements will be retroactively earned for the accomplishments already completed in your game,\" says Ubi. You just have to launch the game once and any cheevo you got on Ubisoft's platform will trigger on Steam. As an added bonus, the studio's even killed off 19 achievements that you needed online services to get. Those online services don't exist anymore since the game's official servers got zeroed back in 2022, so to better enable you to get that coveted 100% achievement ribbon, Ubisoft yanked the relevant achievements out. All well and good, but hey, Ubi, since I have you: please remember Splinter Cell some more. I know you've got thatremake of the first game coming, at least notionally, but we never got Pandora Tomorrow or the superior Xbox version of Double Agent on PC and, frankly, everything from Double Agent back could do with a patch or two to make it a little easier to play on modern machines. I've always had a soft spot for the old Splinter Cells. If the remake sparks a neuron in Yves Guillemot's brain that leads to the original series getting patches that do more than just activate achievements? I'd be a very happy man.

    "article_text": "No offers found David Gaider's among the spellbound for Sandfall's latest hit. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has done rather well for itself—going blow-for-blow with bigger budget competition in the JRPG space, a genre title that has now fully detached from the country in its acronym because ol' 33 is rather French, but I digress.One million sales in under a week, rave reviews, and heavyweight Steam concurrents despite being on Game Pass. David Gaider, creator of the Dragon Age series, has also given it a solid two thumbs up,writing on Bluesky: \"I've been playing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and wow... so far, it's kind of to JRPGs what Baldur's Gate 3 was to CRPGs. It's beautiful and polished and well-written, and the turn-based combat is so fun!\" I'm glad Gaider's enjoying himself—I've sunk about 50 hours into Clair Obscur and I've had a blast, too. It's an ambitious blend of genres, choosing and swapping out parts of the JRPG formula I find tedious (such as MP and inventory management) for things I actively enjoy. I am unequivocally in the Venn diagram of sickos who like a good party-based fantasy adventureandbeing tricked into playing rhythm games. I also don't want to interrogate a throwaway social media post too much, but Gaider is an industry figure—and I can see a dreaded discourse looming on the horizon like a distant tidal wave.Larian's landmark CRPG is no stranger to this sort of thing, attracting exhausting industry debates on the regular. 'Who cares?' you might ask. Me, me cares, because videogame commentary is part of my job. I think Clair Obscur is fantastic, and it might make it into my personal shortlist for Harvey's game of the year (we get personal picks at PC Gamer). But I don't think it's the BG3 of JRPGs. For starters, part of what makes it so good is the fact that it is using its JRPG trappings very competently—Baldur's Gate 3, meanwhile, set a completely new standard for its genre. What was once the domain of text boxes became fully mo-capped and acted performances. What was once a cosy multiple-choice storybook became a maddening, spinning web of cause and consequence that took years to fully unravel. A genre that would often bind you to a TTRPG-styled ruleset by rote broke its shackles and said hey,wanna skip a fortress by building a tower of crates? Go for it, who cares. And while all of these things had been done in part before, Baldur's Gate 3 did them all, did them allwell,and packaged them into a game that had universal appeal enough to sendHasbro into a confused frenzy of how to capitalise on it. It also, as mentioned, launched a whole industry debate about new standards in RPGs. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The best thing about Clair Obscur, however, is how lovingly and whole-heartedly it embraces its inspirations, rather than expanding upon or evolving them. Its snappy, stylish combat is very clearly inspired by Persona. Its brain-melting plot twists and all-timer soundtrack takes notes from Nier. And, yes, its parry system is all Sekiro (dare I say it's also a little Paper Mario by technicality). The reason it's good is because you can tell it was made by people who played a lot of really, really good JRPGs before, and wanted to make their own—then did exactly that. It's a mosaic love letter that understands the adage \"good artists borrow, great artists steal\" and I adore it. In terms of moving the needle forward as a genre? I'm not sure it's in the same weight class as Baldur's Gate 3, and that's not an insult—the biggest invention Clair Obscur does is bring a more snappy and cinematic storytelling style to a genre often dominated by hours of cutscenes, exhaustive worldbuilding, and deep conversations. But here's the thing: That's not an objective improvement, that's a matter of taste. I like the realistic conversational pace and cinematographic flare of Clair Obscur,andI like the textured worldbuilding, chunky hours of cutscenes, and full-bodied character arcs of Metaphor: ReFantazio. Doing away with a certain kind of storytelling isn't an innovation, it's just putting on a different hat. Anyway, poor Gaider probably doesn't deserve this sort of interrogation—and neither does Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. I think it's an exceptional videogame that completely devouredmy week off: I just don't think we should say the wheel's been reinvented when, in truth, someone just made a really really good wheel.

    "title": "Speedy card battler Arcane Rush has just launched a new Gauntlet mode",
    "article_text": "The fast-paced alternative to the old guard of card battlers is a great starting point for curious card players, but it might just get its hooks into you for the long haul too. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Card games have swept over from the tabletop to the screen and taken over PC gaming like a Cyclonic Rift. From digital ports of classic card games like Magic: The Gathering to clever modern imaginings like Marvel Snap, via established PC hits like Hearthstone and Legends of Runeterra, it's a great time for gamers who like their strategising to come with a fair share of shuffling. The thing with all the above is that they're deep games that can take a long time to get into. Which one to choose? Well, that's for you to decide, but one such game that's accessible enough to be played alongside the big boys while being deep enough to keep you engaged over the long run is Arcane Rush. What's special about Arcane Rush is that it squeezes all the tactics of your favourite card battlers into a fast-paced format, pitting you against 15 other players duelling it out to be the last one standing. After each 1v1 PvP battle, you build your team, upgrade your lineup, then take on the next opponent. There are multiple game modes (more on those later), battles last only 10-15 minutes, and on top of that the combat is asynchronous, which means you can dip in during your commute or those quiet moments in the day when you have a few minutes of downtime. It's a card game that fits neatly into the free moments in your life. With every new game, you select a Dealer—each offering a unique mix of races, heroes, and cards. Mimi Sprocket, for instance, will augment your gnomes to unlock power greater than their size would suggest, or go with Captain Tuck to run amok with pirates, scaling their stats with powerful Treasures. Next, use gold to draft cards from a random selection in the rotating shop, level up your tier to access stronger cards, or even fuse cards into more powerful ones by combining three copies of the same card. The game's dynamic drafting system means that each PvP battle is a fresh tactical puzzle that forces you to think on your feet. Get your battle tactics ready by placing units on the front, mid, and back-lines of the battlefield. To get those precious synergies, build your teams around 10 distinct factions —which range from Gnomes to Pirates, from volatile Undead to Demons (that can consume and sacrifice weaker units to amplify your more powerful ones—it's a high-risk, high-reward playstyle with these guys, but extremely satisfying when those short-term sacrifices help you establish long-term dominance on the battlefield). Arcane Rush is constantly striding into new territory. It's a hit with major streamers Kripparrian, Shadybunny, and more, and the game recently made its way over from mobile to Steam. Every two months, a new season launches, introducing new heroes, relics, and mechanics, expanding the strategic possibilities for veteran players. Just last week, the devs launched the Gauntlet mode too, where you get matched in 1v1 matches against 50 similarly ranked players in the global leaderboards. The twist here is that you need to complete two runs against the same opponent using identical cards, with the winner being decided in a final battle at the end of the day. There's no possibility of rematches, so the stakes are super-high, though the rewards are great too as you get the opportunity to win weekly clan chests, which grant higher yields the better you do on the battlefield. So ready to start synergising and give it a go? You can grab Arcane Rush free on theApp Store,Play Store, andSteamnow, and can also get involved with the community onDiscordandReddit. Arcane Rush is just as its name suggests: a game that turns card battles into a fast-paced sprint of flinging magic, tight tactical thinking, and working with the hands that you're dealt. It makes for a fine accompaniment to whatever game you're currently playing, and an accessible starting point if you're dipping into the world of card battlers for the first time.

    "article_text": "No offers found The search for The Elder Scrolls 6 is a hard trek. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It didn't take long forOblivion Remasteredplayers to start pushing the boundaries to see what they could get away with. It only took three hours for someone to uploadthe first gooner mod, and now one player has managed to break through Cyrodiil's border into Valenwood and Hammerfell. Valenwood is to the southwest of Cyrodiil, Oblivion's location, and features in The Elder Scrolls Online. While it may be on the border, player GnoblinXD managed to make their way pretty far into the supposedly out-of-bounds map. \"I was walking along the Strid River from Skingrad, and it turns out you jump across into Valenwood near Kvatch,\"GnoblinXD says(viaIGN). \"I explored a bit and was surprised to find basically the whole landmass of the map was there, even if not detailed, of course. There may not be much to see there, but if you're wondering how GnoblinXD did it, then you're in luck, as they alsouploaded a helpful guideshowing players how to find the exact spot where you can throw yourself off a cliff, miraculously bounce off the river below, and then scramble up the hillside to Valenwood. But like a true explorer, GnoblinXD didn't stop there. Instead of calling it a day after wandering around the empty landscape of Valenwood, they set their sights on something bigger: Hammerfell, the rumoured location forThe Elder Scrolls 6. Oblivion remastered changes: What's new and what's not?Oblivion console commands: Cheats new and oldOblivion lockpicks: Where and how to use themOblivion vampirism cure: Rid yourself of the afflictionOblivion thieves guild: How to join the crew \"After many an hour spent searching, I finally found my way to the other side of Cyrodiil's northern border,\"GnoblinXD says. \"The region seems vast. Much bigger than the Valenwood/Elsweyr area. The landmass stretches way beyond render distance, so who knows how far it goes? Likely, there is nothing here, but I'm intrigued nonetheless. \"I got here using no mods, glitches or console commands, my game is entirely vanilla. Oh, and it's kind of funny that Hammerfell seems thoroughly covered in forests while Valenwood had no trees at all, lol.\" That'd be because Valenwood is the home of the Wood Elves, who are meant to be, you know, elves who live in the woods. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Alongside a screenshot of GnoblinXD's place marker to prove that they actually made it to Hammerfell, there are a couple of pretty screenshots of snowy mountains, fern forests, and a lush grassland. That may be it, but there's more here than in Valenwood. The only issue GnoblinXD came across was in trying to reach the coastline fromThe Elder Scrolls 6 teaser trailer. Someone did ask them whether they could make their way over and grab some screenshots, but in trying to do so,GnoblinXD fell through the map: \" I walked west towards that area, but after a while I fell off the edge of the map. I didn't die, but now I'm stuck in the backrooms of Oblivion.\" There was a giant invisible wall in the original Oblivion to stop players from crossing any borders, but you could see a bit beyond it. Now, that's not to say that someone couldn't manage to find a way to break through, but it's clearly a lot easier to go off exploring in the remaster.

    "article_text": "No offers found Vincke says that all games'll need the human touch, even if AI's been useful for early prototyping and annoying busywork. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AI—that is, the annoyingly titledgenerativeAI, which is super different from the AI we're used to in games, is also different from machine learning technology—has been a massive point of contention just about everywhere. In art, in music, in acting, and in coding. As a result, it's also been an issue in videogames, because they're a combination of all those things,regardless of what the boss of Amazon Games thinks. It's a problem Larian Studios' founder Swen Vincke has been tackling, as per a recent interview withGameSpot(shown below). Partially because, well, despite being a studio known for making games like the ones yer grandma used to make—handcrafted and filled with loving detail—Larian has been using generative and deep-learning AI, it's just pretty much impossible to talk about without setting off alarm bells. Vincke goes into the kind of things Larian uses it for in transparent detail: The \"automation of tasks that nobody wants to do. The obvious things, like motion capture cleaning, or voice editing.\" Vincke also mentions \"retargeting\", which is an automated process that re-adjusts otherwise handmade animations for different species of varying shapes and sizes, cutting out a huge amount of busywork for the studio's animators. \"These are things for which machine learning works really well.\" The other big help has been in what Vincke calls \"whiteboxing\", a game development term that's used to describe what is, essentially, prototyping. The term whiteboxing comes from the white boxes used to represent various game elements, actors, and so on. It's the digital drawing board of game development. \"We discovered in the past, that if we write out a situation, and we talk about it, we're going to get very excited .. we're going to script it [in the whitebox] and we're going to try and play it.\" However, Vincke says, doing so with a bunch of polygons often doesn't actually give designers the right vibe. Generative AI, then, is used by Larian to bridge that gap in the testing and ideation phase. \"If you completely decorate the entire level, and you do the same exercise, and you say 'here's the situation' and you give it to the scriptor, it's going to feel more real—and you'll get a better feel for 'is this situation going to work, yes or no'.\" However, \"the only thing that was generated was the environment at that point in time—it's never gonna ship.\" Once something's passed whiteboxing, Vincke explains, it goes into \"orangeboxing\", which is where things are made by hand. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Larian's also experimenting with something Vincke calls \"narrative validation\"—essentially, automated, AI-assisted systems that will tell writers (who are still creating scripts by hand) whether something they've changed has created an inaccuracy or incongruity somewhere else. A sort of plot-hole scout for videogame scripts that get into the hundreds and hundreds of thousands of wordsand 1,800 characters. An extremely useful tool to have for a game with an absurd amount of choices—though he admits the tech isn't quite there yet. As for the kind of companies that are goinggaga over neo-NPCsand entirely AI-generated nonsense worlds? While Vincke acknowledges the fears of the industry at large, he ultimately thinks those publishers and studios are missing the point. \"I don't think you would have a competitive advantage if you do [that], because it's gonna be what's available to everybody—if the baseline goes up because generation is available to everybody? Fine, that's a new reality that we're in. But you're still gonna wanna create something special on top of that, and I think that's where teams like us will make the difference. \"I don't think that people in my position that say 'oh, we'll replace everyone with AI' are doing the right thing, they're doing the wrong thing. But what I do think is we're gonna jump forward in the kinds of games we make … we're gonna be making our games differently, but to say that it'll replace the craftsmanship? I think we're very far from it.\" It seems eminently reasonable, and it's the sort of drum I've been banging the entire time—for artists and animators in particular, deep-learning tech is a powerful thing to work into various tools, cutting out hours of busywork. Into the Spiderverse was usingmachine-learning tech to draw its comic-book lines back in 2018, and I don't think anyone would accuse that movie of being anything other than hand-crafted. But we've been forced to endure the nonsense words of tech-drowned executives who say it's going tochange everything forever every two years or so. People lose their jobs, the experiment doesn't work, and people go in for round two of pie-in-the-sky nonsense. In actuality, what I've observed is that generative AI tech is used in sort of boring, practical ways. A prime example: WoW's been using it to re-size equipment todifferent character models. It's hardly a game-changer, it's just a help. And, as Vincke says, the human touch is the key to making something anybody gives a crap about: \"As long as the human difference is there, we will be able to make a difference.\" Baldur's Gate 3 romance: Who to pursueBaldur's Gate 3 multiplayer: How co-op worksBaldur's Gate 3 endings: For better or worseBaldur's Gate 3 multiclass builds: Coolest combosBest RPGs: The greatest you can play now Harvey's history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he's since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G'raha Tia.

    "article_text": "No offers found With Baldur's Gate 4 off the table, the studio has moved on to two mysterious new projects. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Larian's journey with Baldur's Gate is officially over. Oh, I'm sure there'll still be the odd bug fix, and who knows what might happen in the far future, but for now the studio is finallydone adding free content to Baldur's Gate 3, there'sno DLC or expansions coming, and it'snot making Baldur's Gate 4.So the question is, what comes next? And in the wake of one of the greatest RPGs ever made, what do we actuallywantnext? Details of what Larian's working on now are understandably scarce at the moment, but here's what we do know: So what does all that suggest? Baldur's Gate 3 was a revelation, and a huge breakout hit—but really, it was very much just another step along a path Larian has been walking for over a decade now. With 2014'sDivinity: Original Sin, the studio demonstrated how good it was at old-school RPG design, immersive sim-inspired worlds and systems, turn-based combat, and creative encounter design. Original Sin 2refined that formula and broadened its ambitions. Outside of its specific D&D connections, Baldur's Gate 3 simply took the same ideas even further—more detail, better animation, more fully-realised companions, but very recognisably still an Original Sin follow-up at its core. I think I speak for most Baldur's Gate 3 and Original Sin fans when I say: I hope that trend continues. At least one of those two new projects should continue to iterate on what Larian's proved it's so good at and capitalise on this huge new audience for old fashioned isometric RPGs. And when you hear things like the studio building a dedicated \"storytelling team\", it certainly seems to point in that direction. Does that mean we should expect Divinity: Original Sin 3? It would certainly make some sense—though they weren't successes on the same level as Baldur's Gate 3, those first two games are very well-loved, and this could be an opportunity to introduce BG3 fans to that foundational universe. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The thing is… this might be blasphemous to say, but much as I do love the Original Sin games,I don't actually think their setting is very interesting.When I think about what's cool about those games, it's their systems and their style, not their setting. The actual world of Rivellon I don't feel any connection to really, and I didn't leave either game eager to see what happens next in the overarching lore. Baldur's Gate 3's Faerûn is a setting with so much accumulated history, that so many fans have a powerful connection to, both via tabletop games and videogames. It has all these distinctive features and quirks inherited from D&D—unique monsters, iconic character classes, a long-standing pantheon. A follow-up set in Rivellon can only invite direct comparisons—and despite its own respectably long history in the Divinity series, I don't think it can stand up well to that. Unless Larian does something really boldly new with it, it will just feel like a step down to a less appealing world. In fact, I'd love to see the studio get away from traditional fantasy altogether. How interesting would it be to see Larian create its own sci-fi world? It worked for BioWare, when it created Mass Effect off the back of its own licensed game success with Knights of the Old Republic. It's easy to imagine how futuristic technologies and alien powers could be used to add new layers to the game's elemental interactions and layered systems. Or perhaps it could even try a horror setting? There's certainly enough Lovecraftian vileness and gore in Baldur's Gate 3 to show the studio's interest in the darker side of storytelling. There beingtwoprojects in development opens up some interesting possibilities, too. If we accept that one of them is almost certainly another traditional RPG, then what's the other? Surely even Larian wouldn't develop two such games at once? It seems likely to me that the second project is something smaller and more experimental. Given this is the same studio that once brought usan RTS where you fight in battle alongside your troops as a dragon with a jetpack, the possibilities there seem endless. Perhaps this could be how the studio returns to Rivellon, with some kind of left-field spin-off—keeping that world alive and showing off its stranger side, without committing to an entire 100 hour RPG in the setting. There you go—that's my speculation, and what I'd like to see. Do you agree? Disagree? What would you like to see them make next?

    "article_text": "No offers found Psycho Bandit's back, baby. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Waiting for a missed skin to return in the Fortnite shop is, at times, a trying task. Even more so if you're gunning for a collaboration—some return pretty regularly, while others disappear into the vault for hundreds or even thousands of days, often with no indication of when (or evenif) they'll return. Take the Borderlands Psycho skin, for example. First introduced in August 2019—just before Borderlands 3 launched—it returned a handful of times before vanishing entirely after May 31, 2020. Now, after almost five years, it's back in the store to purchase once more. The Psycho bundlecomes with the main man himself, plus a Claptrap back bling and some buzz axes to hack away with, and will set players back 2,000 V-bucks. Even as someone who isn't a massive Borderlands head, it's a pretty sweet-looking skin, and even sweeter that people who jumped on the Fortnite bandwagon in the last five years finally have the chance to pick it up themselves. That hasn't stopped some people being pissy about it, mind. Both theXandTikTokposts are flooded with folk asking for an OG version—usually an alternative colourway for original owners—and even complaints about Psycho's return lowering people's account value. It also turns out that, for the last few years, codes for the Psycho bundle have been going for aridiculousamount of money. A cursory Google search shows results for anywhere in the realm of £700 to £1000 ($900 to $1300) which is, quite frankly, a baffling sum to waste on an in-game cosmetic. I'm sure some of those key sellers won't be too happy about the re-run, but I'm all here for more cosmetics making a return. Virtual scarcity is silly, and I think we should be putting less stock in \"rarity\" of things that just happened to be in a paid shop when you were playing and someone else was not. Psycho's return now leaves Kratos as the rarest collaboration skin, last seen over 1,500 days ago in March 2021 according to third-party siteFortnite.gg.

    "title": "AMD and Samsung demo 8K 120 Hz gaming and I am really, really struggling to care",
    "article_text": "So many pixels. So little point. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. AMD and Samsung have shown off what might well be a world's first but is definitely of arguable real-world utility. Give it up for 8K 120 Hz gaming over HDMI. The eponymous8K Associationarranged the demo at theNAB show for AV hardware in Las Vegas. The core hardware involves an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT andRyzen9800X3DCPU in a PC supplied by MainGear, paired with a Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV. According to the 8K Association, the TV is a special modified version of Samsung's Neo QLED line flown in the for the event from Korea and the game being demoed was Horizon Forbidden West. It was all rendered at 5K and then upscaled to 8K using AMD's FSR 3 technology. It's unclear why FSR 4 wasn't used, given it is included in AMD's list of officially supported supported titles. However, the 8K Association described FSR 3 as \"ML-based\", which only applies to FSR 4, so there's potentially something lost in translation and it was indeed FSR 4 being used. Anywho, the huge bandwidth required for 8K at 120 Hz was enabled by an HDMI 2.1b interface, which was running DSC or Display Stream Compression. Just to put all this into context, 8K at 120 Hz requires the same bandwidth as 4K at 480 Hz, somethingPC Gamer alumnus Alan Dexterwould only be too happy to explain in detail. Of course, in native rendering terms, the same 4x scaler applies when it comes to GPU load. 8K is four times the work for a graphics card as 4K. And 4K is debilitating enough when running modern games. The caveat here is that upscaling technologies like AMD's FSR and Nvidia's DLSS mean that you could hit 8K at 4K frame rates. But then the question arises of how 4K upscaled to 8K compares to 4K native. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's certainly true that returns diminish as resolutions increase. The leap in terms of perceived visual quality from 540p to 1080p is greater than 1080p to 4K. And the jump from 4K to 8K is less apparent still, subjectively. Then factor in some image quality loss, 8K upscaled versus 8K native, and it's debatable just how much value you're getting from 8K. Indeed, you could argue that most gamers, most of the time, would struggle to tell the difference between 4K native and 8K native, let alone 4K native versus 8K upscaled. Up to a point, that will depend on screen size. On a really massive 100-inch-plus display, 8K's advantage is likely more obvious. But then 8K gaming on a 100-inch panel really is getting into rarified territory. That's especially true when you consider that, to the best of our knowledge,the largest currently available 8K TV is in fact 98 inches and costs $40,000. Then there's the minor matter of limited video context in 8K. Sure, you might get the odd game running at 8K. But there's very little TV or movie content encoded in true 8K. All told, we can't see 8K being much of a thing for many years to come. More likely, the next step up for high-end gaming is 5K2K, which is basically 4K extended into a wider 21:9 aspect ratio, such as thenew LG UltraGear 45GX950A, a 45-inch OLED model that we can't wait to get our hands on.

    "title": "Nvidia has just released yet another GPU driver hotfix to add further fixes to the other hotfix driver it released last week. And it still hasn't really fixed things",
    "article_text": "No offers found We heard you like hotfixes, so we added hotfixes to your hotfix. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It never rains but it pours. After the release of GeForce graphics driver 576.15, a hotfix for the original 576.02 driver package, just last week, Nvidia has put outyet anotherhotfix driver (576.26) to address further issues that have been reported. Even then, some users are still documenting the same issues that this latest hotfix is reported to have fixed. GeForce hotfix display driver version 576.26 has just launched, offering 10 additional fixes on top of version 576.15, which launched April 21. This solves problems found primarily with RTX 50-series cards in games, such asBlack Myth: Wukong,Red Dead Redemption 2, andHorizon Forbidden West. However, issues were also spotted with LG monitors and problems tracking GPU temperature after waking PCs from sleep mode. Currently, in theNvidia App, you can only download version 576.02 as part of the drivers tab, which was released alongside the launch of theRTX 5060 Tion April 16. This is because hotfixes aren't published to the app and are something users have to specifically seek out if they want to enable them. Nvidia says in its latestdriver support page(with direct links to download the hotfix): \"These fixes (and many more) will be incorporated into the next official driver release, at which time the Hotfix driver will be taken down. To be sure, these Hotfix drivers are beta, optional and provided as-is.\" Onecommentersays that the latest driver has fixed problems they saw with connecting to their LG monitor via DisplayPort 2.1 with HDR enabled.Anothercomment claims that the Horizon Forbidden West freeze fix did not actually solve the crashing issues they have been having. Nvidia feedback threads are the dedicated spot for, as you might be able to guess, giving feedback, so it's certainly nothing new to see negative responses in them. However, with hundreds of comments, the early feedback on the latest hotfix is looking pretty mixed at this time. Looking through theNvidia Customer Care X account, plus the Nvidia feedback threads, hotfixes are a relatively rare update for Nvidia, historically. Despite this, both versions 576 and 572 in the last few months had two separate sets of hotfixes. Back in December, version 566 got a single hotfix, and so too did Nvidia Broadcast in June last year. The last hotfix publicised on the Nvidia Customer Care page before that was onFebruary 28, 2024. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Nvidia does clarify that hotfixes are \"run through a much abbreviated QA process\" and that \"the sole reason they exist is to get fixes out to you more quickly.\" For a cleaner, safer upgrade process, Nvidia recommends waiting for a WHQL-certified driver. This is where drivers go through the appropriate channels and are tested by third parties. When a driver makes it to the Nvidia App, it's a guarantee that it has been properly tested. Though, evidently, not necessarily a guarantee that it will definitely work on your specific system We should expect to see the full driver update in the near future.

    "article_text": "Another update is finally on the way. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Lethal CompanydeveloperZeekerss took to Xyesterday to share news on the game's upcoming update. In the post, they stated that they were \"at a moment where I'm deciding to release a low-key interiors update for Lethal right now, or give it another couple of weeks and add a creature or two, and I think I'll do the latter.\" It's been a while since Lethal Company received a significant update, but it's nice to see Zeekerss excited to share something new after beinginspired by the success of fellow co-op horror game REPO. We don't know if this smaller update will be the v70 release Zeekerss claimed to be working on earlier in April, or whether another larger drop is planned for a later date. But even something smaller will no doubt be appreciated given how long it's been since the last patch. In fact, Lethal Company last received an update in December to celebrate the holidays, adding snowmen and presents. Before that, v67 rolled out in October for Halloween. Given that, waiting a few extra weeks for new creatures seems more worthwhile than a more \"low-key\" release rolling out now for the sake of it. Zeekerss hasn't shared details on what this interiors update would entail, but I imagine it covers new room layouts or potentially loot which is exciting, especially with the promise of a new beastie lurking in the corners. The replies to the post on X also show a lot of players excited to see what's cooking in development given how infrequent updates have been recently. Unfortunately, there isn't a firm date yet—although outside a possible new monster or two it sounds like most of the update is already in place. I think it's safe to assume this update won't be available until we're well into May, but you never know what tricks Lethal Company has up its sleeve.

    "article_text": "No one can dress to impress right now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After its successful launch in December,Infinity Nikkihas finally made its way to Steam. However, the gacha game has quickly been branded with \"mixed\" reviews after players reported a plethora of issues when launching the game, including multiple crashes and the inability to load into a server. These issues come as a result of the 1.5 update which rolled out on April 28 and have caused issues for Infinity Nikki across all platforms including its own launcher. Although they aren't exclusive to the Steam release, it definitely doesn't reflect well for players who have waited for the launch, and the disappointment is obvious. One player took to Steam reviews to share that \"the game crashes when I try to open it. I tried several times, but it crashes at different points. I haven't been able to come far enough to join a server.\" Another shared that they had been a player since the original release in December, but the 1.5 update has \"a lot of bugs\" and \"generally isn't all that stable.\" In addition, multiple players have left a bad review sharing that their issues stem from using Linux too, with one user stating that \"Linux is unnecessarily blacklisted\" from launching the game. Another shared that they had \"hope for the Steam release, but yet again I'm not able to play it on Linux.\" Both resulted in a \"not recommended\" review. In apost shared to the official Infinity Nikki blogabout the 1.5 update, players are encouraged to report any issues found through customer service in the game. But since so many players are being met with a black screen rather than being able to load the game, it's no surprise they are taking to reviews in an attempt to be heard. However, given just how many people are having issues with the game thanks to the newest update I'm hopeful that Infold is working on rolling out a fix as soon as possible so we can go back to exploring Miraland. Or at least publish a statement acknowledging the issues people are raising and reassuring us that some sort of solution is on the way.

    "article_text": "No offers found Now that's a lot of maidens. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Elden Ringhas reached yet another massively impressive milestone, with 30 million copies sold after just over three years. It's an impressive feat and one thatFromSoftwareis celebrating a month before its next game,Elden Ring Nightreign, releases. \"Dearest Tarnished, we are profoundly thankful for your lasting devotion,\" FromSoftware says in asocial media post. \"May your path be forever guided by the Grace of Gold.\" 30 million copies sold is certainly impressive, but wearetalking aboutElden Ring. Itsold over 20 million copies in less than a yearfollowing its release, and its DLCElden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtreesold over five million copies in less than a week.

Dearest Tarnished, we are profoundly thankful for your lasting devotion.May your path be forever guided by the Grace of Gold.#ELDENRING pic.twitter.com/3oMfkVpFWUApril 28, 2025 It also makes sense that sales may pick up a bit ahead of FromSoftware's next big venture, Elden Ring Nightreign. While Nightreign is set in a patchwork version of Limgrave, it won't be the usual RPG that players have come to expect from FromSoftware. Instead, it's a multiplayer roguelike which pits teams of three against various, mostly randomised, bosses from different FromSoft games. It's not absolutely necessary to play Elden Ring beforehand, especially as Nightreign does a decent job explaining the different classes available for players to pick and their unique skills, but it definitely helps. I've completed Elden Ring, and even I was a bit lost when I first dropped into this new version of The Lands Between on my first run during theclosed network test. At the very least, I knew to run awayevery time Margit appeared out of thin airand duck for cover beside the closest Grace to upgrade my skills. Like most FromSoftware games, Nightreign throws you into the deep end at first, but it's not too hard to find your footing.

Gelmir However, not everyone is pleased with the prospect of Nightreign. \"Could've had more of this, but you decided to make multiplayer-only games no one asked for,\" thetop comment says. I was also really sceptical about Nightreign before I played it, especially when FromSoftware announced thatit would only be three-player, not co-op.And as I said, my first run was confusing and slightly infuriating as my team and I stumbled around fighting bosses and running from discount Fortnite storm. But everything miraculously clicked on my second run, and just like that, I started to love it. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A modular keyboard boasting versatile, ambidextrous placements, an impressive suite of customisation options, and a just lovely sound-dampened typing experience. Vibrant per-key RGB lighting coupled with a light bar that runs along the entire outer edge of the keyboard makes the Dark Mount a board not so easily overshadowed. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. I recently interrupted a colleague mid-flow on an old Razer Huntsman to ask why they enjoy clacky keyboards so much. In response, they offered me an impassioned speech about mechanical keyboards, concluding with the words \"God, I wish it had a lever, you know? Something I could pull at the end of every line — like a type writer!\" Seems some of us yearn for a return to ~ The Contraption ~ but what if you still want that tactility without the risk of waking up the whole house with your 3 AM machinations (or in my case, yet another run ofBlue Princebecause I refuse to be beaten by a shape shifting mansion of all things)? Well, stewards of silenceBe Quiet have recently expanded into peripherals, ushering in sound dampened gaming keyboards that will allow you to plot in peace. As a modular, full-size keyboard, the Dark Mount not only enjoys versatility, but a premium price point to match at $255/£240/€260. Before I really dive into the weeds, let me address the most obvious point first: is it actually that quiet? In a word, yes; while not completely silent, multiple layers of sound dampening foam and silicone make every keypress pleasingly understated. Even the space bar, typically the noisiest key on many keebs, has been quietly wrangled here. Size:Full size with detachable, modular number pad and media dockConnection:USB 3.2 Gen. 2 Type-CSwitches:Be Quiet! Silent mechanical switchesSwitch type:5-pin hot swappableBacklight:RGBRollover:NKROPolling rate:1,000 HzKeycaps:PBT double-shotDimensions:174 x 456 x 52 mmWeight:1376 gWarranty:2 yearsPrice:$255 / £240 / €260 Besides its sound dampening innards, the Dark Mount unit I'm reviewing owes much of its lower-key clacks to Be Quiet's silent linear mechanical switches. To briefly compare it to its smaller sibling, the Light Mount, these switches give every keypress a lovely, straightforward actuation without the oh-so-subtle springy feedback of Be Quiet's also available tactile switches.In myLight Mount review, I likened every keypress upon those tactile switches to a steady descent towards solid ground. To leverage the same metaphor, the tactile switches offer a little bit of a grassy bounce while the linear switches on the Dark Mount are perhaps more akin to gently touching down on hardwood flooring. The keycaps themselves are made of PBT rather than the smoother feeling ABS, though this more textured feel doesn't distract from what remains some great feeling keys (as far as materials go, PBT is the hardier, longer-lasting choice besides). But, if neither that or any of the above is your vibe, you can swap both keycaps and switches very easily with the puller that comes in the box. So long as what you want to swap in is compatible with the board's 5-pin sockets, you can customise the feel of the Dark Mount to your liking. Now, let me finally address the nervous truck in the room: there's more than meets the eye to this gaming keyboard. On its own, there's not much to it, with the exceedingly extra RGB light bar lining the entire outer edge of the board being the main thing differentiating it from the Light Mount at first glance. Like that smaller keyboard, you can also adjust the brightness and flick through lighting profiles using shortcuts mapped to the function and arrow keys, with further customisation possible in Be Quiet's IO Center software. With itty bitty, individually customisable segments that run the entire light-up-length of the keyboard, the Dark Mount's underglow lighting effect is a real show stopper. But even with such an impressive light show, this tiny desk party is only just getting started. Flipping the main part of the keyboard over, you'll notice a number of extra USB-C ports. Besides the expected USB-C port on the top edge of the keyboard for the dedicated wired connection to your PC, there are two more besides it, plus another two found on the right and left hand edges of the board. These are for the Dark Mount's two main modular attachments, included in the box. As modular designs go, The Dark Mount isn't simply reminiscent of theMountain Everest Max, but the numberpad attachment feels directly comparable—and that's for good reason. This is becauseBe Quiet's parent company, Listan Group, bought Mountain a few years back, with both the modular Dark Mount and its Light Mount sibling likely the direct results of that acquisition. My review unit comes with a media dock that can be slotted into two positions along the top edge, plus a numberpad that can slot in on either the left or right edge of the keyboard for ambidextrous placement. The numberpad features more of its lovely, sound-dampened PBT keys, plus eight more remappable buttons above those. The media dock features a tactile scroll wheel for volume control, plus a number of media control buttons, as well as a small integrated screen with its own menu navigation buttons. Scrolling from left to right, this small dock screen offers controls for time, date, and brightness, plus some basic lighting profile customisation options. Installing the Dark Mount's modular attachments is fairly straightforward, though I initially found the number pad's retractable USB-C connector quite stiff. My oh-so-helpful colleague had no such issue however, demonstrating that the numberpad is far sturdier than I'd initially worried. Generally, the modular design's attachment mechanisms are fairly elegant, concealed by easily detached dustcover panels when not in use—though I feel like these are the first things I'm going to lose. Dustcovers ready to go walkabout are far from the only inelegant aspect of this keyboard, either. Ready to fry some small potatoes? To begin with, the modular design of the keyboard necessitates a similarly separated magnetically attached wrist rest, making it feel much less secure than the Light Mount's detachable palm rest. ✅You'd like to late night game discretely:Three layers of sound-dampening silicone and foam, coupled with Be Quiet's own factory lubricated switches, will ensure you don't wake everyone in a five mile radius.✅You want a mechanical keyboard with real versatility:Besides the ambidextrous placements for the modular attachments, the Dark Mount offers lots of remappable buttons alongside a lightbar with customisable segments along the entire outer edge of the keyboard. ❌You want a more fully featured gaming feature set:Though the Dark Mount offers a not at all shabby polling rate of 1,000 Hz plus NKRO, you won't find things like Rapid Trigger or customisable actuation here. The ambidextrous placements available for both the numberpad and the media dock make this a versatile keyboard—but unfortunately, the Dark Mount hasn't completely won me over on the subject of modular keyboards. For a start, I'm well and truly a media knob convert, so the Dark Mount's low profile scroll wheel just doesn't do it for me. The low-profile media and menu control buttons are similarly too shallow to actuate in a way that offers much tactile feedback; on a mechanical keyboard, I found it an odd sensory contrast. The eight plastic buttons on the numberpad offer slightly clickier feedback, but there's no question that the numbered PBT keys below are the main event. Still, these eight keys can be customised via IO Center to offer a variety of functions with one press. It's neat to, say, put my PC to sleep or open the task manager with a single button click. But, like the co-ord that seemed like a good idea at the time but is destined for Depop, I just don't reach for them. Still, just because I couldn't make this versatile keyboard work for me, doesn't mean that you won't easily make it your own. Not to encourage any sibling rivalry, but I found myself vastly preferring the cheaper Light Mount (even if it isn't as affordable as its respective keyboard ancestor, theMountain Everest 60). As nice as it is, I came away feeling the Dark Mount's attachments were much-of-a-muchness for my day-to-day use. There's also the fact that, on both of Be Quiet's keyboard offerings to date, gaming-specific features are light on the ground for the price point. If you're looking for a more esports-geared feature set that includes Rapid Trigger and customisable actuation, I'd say you're better off picking up theCorsair K70 Pro TKL(though you can find even cheaper options among ourbest gaming keyboards guide). That said, for my money (and my cluttered desk space), the Light Mount still does everything else I want in a much more focused package compared to the Dark Mount, while also offering some of the most vibrant, customisable RGB-lighting I've had the pleasure of gawping at. A modular keyboard boasting versatile, ambidextrous placements, an impressive suite of customisation options, and a just lovely sound-dampened typing experience. Vibrant per-key RGB lighting coupled with a light bar that runs along the entire outer edge of the keyboard makes the Dark Mount a board not so easily overshadowed.

    "title": "Be Quiet! Light Mount gaming keyboard review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's finally time to haul my verdict out of the shadows: though by no means silent, I'm definitely a fan of the sound-dampened clacks on Be Quiet's Light Mount. It lives up to its name in more ways than one, too, boasting vibrant, head-turning per-key RGB lighting—even the software offers few reasons to complain! PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. While I personally do love a mechanical keyboard that offers a hearty clack on every keypress, those I share my living space with aren't quite as into the rhythm of my percussive typing. If you're anything like me, chances are you'd like to cap off a long, hard day of looking at the bad screen by coming home to clack away emphatically at your good screen. However, rents being what they are, chances are that you also have to contend with trying not to wake everyone in a five-metre radius. Be Quiet's recent move into peripheralsushers in sound-dampened keyboards that attempt to hush your late-night clacking. The Light Mount is the cheaper of Be Quiet's two wired keyboards now on offer, costing $170/£170/€170. For that price, you're getting three layers of sound-dampening foam and silicone cushioning every press, plus per-key RGB illumination, and a fairly firm, magnetically attached wrist rest. Let's start with the mild-mannered elephant in the room: Is the Light Mount actually that quiet? While by no means silent, every keypress is decidedly understated, especially if you're used to a more cacophonous clack underhand. The unit I'm reviewing came with Be Quiet's own silent tactile mechanical switches, emittingsomenoise with every keypress, though hardly bringing the house down. The space bar is definitely the loudest of the bunch, but it's not such a chatty charlie that it completely undermines the keyboard's reason for being. To summarise it in a stage whisper, the sound of your key clacks from the Light Mount is much less likely to carry. Size:Full-sizeConnection:USB Type-CSwitches:Be Quiet! Silent mechanical switchesSwitch type:5-pin hot swappableBacklight:Per-key RGBRollover:NKROPolling rate:1,000 HzKeycaps:PBT double-shotDimensions:132 x 461 x 44 mmWeight:910 gWarranty:2 yearsPrice:$170/£170/€170 But can Be Quiet's switches give the Topre Realforce R2, our current pick for the quietest board in ourbest mechanical keyboard guide, a tip-toeing run for its money? Well, yes. For starters, Topre's capacitive switches are odd ducks that are perfect for typists with deep pockets and sensitive ears but not so much anyone else. When it comes to price, the Light Mount has the Topre Realforce R2 beat, delivering both a pleasingly sound dampened typing experience, while also offering a game mode setting, media knob, and RGB lighting to boot. Moving beyond how it sounds, let's get into how itfeels. For starters, the unit I'm reviewing features PBT double-shot keycaps, meaning they feel a wee bit more textured than the smooth ABS keycaps of my usual go-to board, theCorsair K70 Pro TKL. While I wasn't sure at first, the rougher keycap feel has definitely grown on me—the fact that PBT keycaps are also known for their hardiness definitely helps. Sticking with that Corsair keeb as a point of comparison, the Light Mount is an obviously bigger, full-size board with heaps of keys I'll likely never use. Talking typing, I know even the mere mention of silicone may cause some to wrinkle their nose over an assumed 'mushy' feeling, but I'm pleased to report that isn't the case here. While every keypress enjoys a soft, cushioned landing, the controlled descent of the switches creates the sensation of making contact with solid ground andnotslowly sinking into a marshy bog. If that's not to your liking, you can swap in switches of your choice with the keycap and switch puller included in the box; so long as your preferred caps and switches have a form factor compatible with 5-pin sockets, you can customise the feel of the Light Mount. Back to keeb comparisons briefly, Be Quiet's parent company,the Listan group, brought keyboard manufacturer Mountain into the fold back in 2022. As such, it's hard not to compare the Light Mount to what remains our top pick for thebest budget gaming keyboard, theMountain Everest 60. In terms of price, the Mountain Everest 60 is still very appealing—if you can find one now that the official store is closed. Otherwise, keyfeel is a dead ringer…minus the oh-so-subtle feedback from the Light Mount's silicone cushioning layer. Pop off the keycap to take a peek at the switch beneath, and it's easy to see the family resemblance—though, arguably the more expensive Dark Mount with its detachable number pad and media bar leverages that inheritance the hardest. Perhaps most importantly, how does the Light Mount measure up in-game? For starters, the Light Mount won't pull you out of management and simulation games, offering few reasons to dissuade me from clocking in a few more long hours atTwo Point Museumor onThe Sims 4. Its sound-dampened key presses also won't give the game away when I've snuck back for one more go around onBlue Princeafter saying I'd go to bed hours ago. As for games that are less sedate, such asFragPunk, there's nothing like Rapid Trigger here, but there is a polling rate of 1,000 Hz and full N-Key rollover. That means that while it's definitely not an esports-focused bit of kit, it's certainly responsive enough for most intents and purposes. If youarelooking for a board that has all those things, plus Rapid Trigger, customisable key actuations, and a ridiculously high polling rate all for a similar price point, you're still better served by the aforementioned Corsair K70 Pro TKL. If Rapid Trigger is a key concern for you, theWooting 80HEclaims the category top spot in ourbest gaming keyboardguide. Personally, I struggle to comfortably hold Shift and the directional buttons to sprint on the Light Mount, and I also occasionally hit Caps Lock when I don't mean to. I don't think that's due to any odd spacing on the Light Mount's part, though—it may just be that years of playing shooters on a controller have completely ruined my hand posture. My sordid console gamer past aside, the Light Mount has no reason for shame as a gaming keyboard. Besides a just lovely sound dampened typing experience, the Light Mount also, ahem,shineswith its RGB lighting. You can cycle through lighting profiles saved to the keeb's onboard memory and adjust the brightness via function key shortcuts tied to the arrow keys. Even shy of the keyboard's brightest setting, the Light Mount's RGB is some of the most vibrant I've seen in a minute. There's a good amount of distinction between colours too, with my purple-pink custom profile managing to avoid looking too muddy. ✅Sound really is a concern:Maybe your walls are exceptionally thin, maybe you live with the lightest of sleepers, maybe you just want to game in peace—whatever the case, the Light Mount's sound dampening is very impressive, if not completely silent.✅You love the Mountain Everest 60:As Be Quiet's parent company bought Mountain in 2022, a strong family resemblance is little wonder.✅You are fully committed to the tiny desk light show lifestyle:Customisable lighting profiles and Microsoft Dynamic Lighting, combined with some of the most vibrant RGB lighting I've seen, make this worth the sing-a-long. ❌You have esports aspirations:Though the Light Mount is no slouch in games, it lacks Rapid Trigger, customisable key actuation, or a deeply customisable game mode. I also don't hate Be Quiet's bespoke software that allows you to fine-tune your own tiny desk light show, IO Center. As peripheral software goes, the UI here is refreshingly uncluttered and straightforward to use. Even the fact that this is yet another bit of peripheral software clogging up my hard drive may soon be remedied as Be Quiet! has announced you'll soon have the option to customise their keyboards via a web-based version of IO Center. If you're thinking of adding a splash of customisable colour to your desk job but have to contend with a locked-down corporate machine, this could be a real highlight for you. Puns aside, it's straightforward to set up a basic lighting profile, while also offering basic tools for a more layered look, which includes setting a custom look for each individual segment of the light bar running across the top of the keyboard. Besides the usual suspects of throbbing, whirling lighting effects, the Light Mount also enjoys support for Microsoft Dynamic Lighting. You can also remap keys, create macros, and adjust the function key shortcut layer, too. Game Mode specifically is accessed via the Function + Pause keys, and can also be adjusted via IO Center. Unfortunately, your options are a bit limited, allowing you to toggle on or off a small pool of keys and shortcuts. These include Shift + Tab, Alt + F4, the Windows Key, and Alt + Tab. While we're on the subject of buttons to push, the media knob is similarly stripped back, allowing you to adjust the volume with a twist or silence everything by pressing the top. Though fewer levers to pull and settings to tweak may disappoint some, I found it just right for my purposes. Now shush—it's 3 AM and my Simsneedme… It's finally time to haul my verdict out of the shadows: though by no means silent, I'm definitely a fan of the sound-dampened clacks on Be Quiet's Light Mount. It lives up to its name in more ways than one, too, boasting vibrant, head-turning per-key RGB lighting—even the software offers few reasons to complain!

    "title": "Bitcoin mining now just totes unprofitable, costing over $137,000 to mine just one BTC in the US and near $200,000 per coin in Germany",
    "article_text": "No offers found With coins pricing at around $90,000 the math just doesn't add up. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As I wipe the dust from my coffin I arise to tell you all that I was there when they first started mining thecryptocurrenciesfrom the bowls of the digital frontier. I was there early enough to look at my old rig and wonder if it was worth setting up to see if it could score a few coins over the course of a month or so. I've known a few people who did things likeacccidentally throw away drives full of BTC.I even knew people who got in early and cashed out fast, otherwise known as 'bastards'. Since its early days, crypto has been, to put it politely, an absolute shitshow of cryptoglogical proportions. Even when it was somewhat viable to put your rig to work it'd still be a long haul of wait and see before you might eventually unearth yourself a coin here and there. And of course your old GPU has been worked into dust and your power bill has skyrocketed for the trouble. For those reasons it's been a long time since I considered miningBitcoinas a viable investment, and it looks like the landscape is finally shifting to meet my preconceptions. Even specialists such as CoinShares (viaOverclockers) are starting to doubt this business investment,despite it recently reaching an all time high price. New data tells us that mining a single Bitcoin or one BTC costs the largest public mining companies over $82,000 USD, which is nearly double the figure it did the previous quarter. Estimates for smaller organisations say you need to spend about $137,000 to get that single BTC in return. BTC is currently only valued at $94,703 USD, which seems to be a problem in the math department. These costs can even get worse depending on the country you're doing your mining. Germany is typically considered to be one of the worst places to mine BTC from a profit perspective. It costs around $200,000 USD to mine a single coin there. So why would anyone be mining BTC in this day and age? Well the main reason, other than perhaps dim hopes that they'll strike it rich, is about technology. Currently optimising farms to mine faster on lower power has been the goal. Plus seeking out places where electricity is cheaper to try to maximise those gains. Once you've got these incredibly efficient, and hopefully relatively power friendly setups in place, you've not only dropped your potential mining overheads but you likely have a computation setup that could complete other tasks. This makes it an attractive option for larger companies who may look to lease their mining operations for other computations when they're unable to make money from mining. Then they can swap back if and when the market picks up once again. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. For now the big takeaway is that mining crypto isn't going to be viable for individuals, possibly ever again. With huge centres being setup in key positions you just won't be able to beat out the larger companies acting here. Any new coin that comes up they can point their rigs to it and begin the process all over again. It's almost like you're better off using your sweet rigs for gaming, not crypto mining, just like the good lord intended.

    "title": "Intel says reports of 20k redundancies 'inaccurate' and states previous early retirement options robbed them of valuable experience",
    "article_text": "No offers found It's still a very scary week to be an Intel employee. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week was a pretty terrifying one for Intel employees after reports came out stating the company was set to let go20% of its entire workforce.In good, but still relatively horrifying news for employees Intel has since quashed those rumours, saying the figure was overstated... though not how much by. According toCTech, an all-hands video conference was held for Intel staff attempting to put these rumours to rest. During the call, Chief Financial Officer David Zisner reassured staff that the 20% or approximately 20,000 planned layoffs was overstated, but did not clarify what the actual number would be. In very corporate speak, the call explained that each department would individually assess itself, potentially offering employee buyouts to help trim the fat. One thing Intel did state is it won't be offering is any early retirement this time around, stating that doing so in the past has cost the company valuable experience. I can't imagine how much of a let down this is to some of the longer standing folks at Intel who are super ready for a break. In a world where the retirement age keeps getting pushed back, early retirement packages have never looked so tempting. But of course, as Intel fears, they often result in losing knowledgeable staff. This likely is especially true in the engineering sectors, which Intel is specifically looking to bolster, rather than strip back the skill base at this time. There's an incredible wealth of built-up knowledge around the process of engineering semiconductors that filling some of these gaps as folks get older and retire must be getting increasingly difficult. This came about the same week CEO Lip-Bu Tan had sent an internal letter calling for changes to the company's structure and culture, specifically stating: \"We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent.\" This is all to try to strengthen Intel's competitive standing in the semiconductor and tech industries. Interesting take from the guy also looking to makepartnerships within the industry. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Still this leaves Intel employees holding their breaths for now. Though we don't know the exact number, chances are it's still pretty high, and that's even though Intel laid off15,000 people just last year. It's promised that these layoffs will happen as quickly as possible over the next couple of months, likely in a further effort to get those costs down as fast as possible.

    "title": "Taiwan to drop new law restricting TSMC from allowing foreign fabs to produce leading edge nodes after company's $100 billion investment in US facilities",
    "article_text": "No offers found The law's designed to keep other countries one node behind Taiwan at all times. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Over the past few years things have changed rapidly in the silicon space. Whether it's legitimate shortages or government restrictions, the world of chip making just can't seem to catch a break. Now the newTrump tariffs have been taking effect,and Taiwan is fighting back with its prominent chip maker TSMC. The introduction of tariffs alongside government incentives have been enough to entice chip makers, such as TSMC, to start investing more in offshore production. This means moving its world class fabrication facilities all over the globe. Production fabs have started croppingup over the EUand the United States, withTSMC investing over $100 billioninto just the latter. This large investment seems to have Taiwanese officials a bit on edge. According toWCCFTech, media in Taiwan have already reported on the passing of Article 22 of the Industrial Creation Ordinance, a policy created specifically to retain high-tech chip making for the country. The ordinance ushers in a new \"N-1\" policy for Taiwan, which is pretty true to its namesake. Essentially the policy states that other countries can only fabricate chips up to 1 generation behind whatever wiz-bang production Taiwan is currently up to. If Taiwan is working on 1 nm or N1 chips, then all other countries with TSMC fabs can only go up to 2 nm or N2. Basically keeping the rest of the world back one node like a much larger bully keeping smaller children away with an outreached hand on their tiny frustrated foreheads, while their scrawny arms swing hopelessly into the air. This isn't too much of an issue at the moments as TSMC's new overseas plants are designed to fabricate chips a few steps behind, anyway. In the United States, for example, the Arizona plant is set up to currently produce chips on a 4 nm process with sights set on3 and 2 nm in the future. And they're looking to add a30% tax to these United States made chipsto boot. Freedom fries, indeed. Still, making a policy for it does imply Taiwan is at least a little bit worried about the current state of affairs, and we can't really blame them. Between ever changing Trump tariffs and the constantly evolving state of tech production, the ground of silicon has become a shaky one to stand on.

    "article_text": "No offers found Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Everything you need to get you through your dailyWordleis right here and ready to go. Scratching your head over a weird assortment of yellow letters? Today's clue will help you make sense of them. Thoroughly stumped? That's why the April 29 (1410) answer is only a click away. Doing fine? Our tips can still help refine your winning technique. Engaging my fingers before my brain's had a chance to form an opinion is often a recipe for disaster—but not today. This time around they clearly spotted something the rest of me hadn't, and I was awarded a quick and easy win for my subconscious' efforts. Thanks, weird thought processes I'm not entirely aware of. The happiest happiness. A feeling of overwhelming joy and contentment, like a cat lazing in the comfiest spot in the house. One of today's consonants is repeated. Yes, there is a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. You might need this. The answer to the April 29 (1410) Wordle isBLISS. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "Goodbye A2 Hosting, hello Hosting.com When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A2 Hosting is now hosting.com with a whole new website, promising new features and an updated hosting panel. Hosting.com started life as A2 Hosting in 2001. The (old) name is a reflection of the place where it all started, Ann Arbour, in Michigan. The company was founded by Bryan Muthig and grew into a successful hosting company hosting 2M+ websites in over 40+ locations. On the surprise transition, CEO Seb De Lamos said, \"Super excited that A2 Hosting which for so long has been this paramount of hosting performance, amazing customer support, and so much more, that we've been able to take it and turn it into something which takes it to the next level.\" The move is a reflection of the growth that Hosting.com has sustained and is purported to boost the brand increasing global recognition and build a larger interconnected community which will provide more opportunities to connect and learn. Change can be scary but Hosting.com reassures users, \"while our name is changing, our dedication to providing fantastic support and the reliable products you've come to expect remains the same.\" Adding, \"You'll still have access to the same robust hosting solutions and the same team of experts ready to assist you 24/7.\" In a blog post, Hosting.com stresses that this isn't about abandoning roots but rather expanding and growing the business on a global stage. The core values of reliability, speed, and customer satisfaction at the heart of A2 Hosting remain in Hosting.com. Along with the different name, Hosting.com says other changes include greater resources which will be invested in infrastructure and technology to better support customer needs. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! There will also be a new hosting panel. At first glance and a poke around the website a lot seems to have changed. Product names are new, the features included in plans are different and older products like dedicated hosting are hidden from the home page. Hidden services still exist, you just need to find them via site:hosting.com viaGooglebecause they're not readily available from the home page. For example, one Hosting.com user reported to be disappointed with not being able to find Node.js hosting but a quick site:hosting.com \"Node.js\" reveals that this is still a service from Hosting.com. This is a significant rebrand for Hosting.com and I'm looking forward to reviewing new products and services and seeing whether the changes can deliver on the promise of enhanced hosting features and infrastructure of an already well known and liked host.

    "title": "Meta AI is here to take on ChatGPT and give your Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses a fresh AI upgrade",
    "article_text": "A standalone app to stand against ChatGPT When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Meta AI is moving into its own space with the launch of a new standalone app. Fueled by Meta's new Llama 4 AI model, the new app is simultaneously a standalone product and a replacement for Meta View, which was previously used to connect to theRay-Ban Meta smart glasses. Meta’s making a big play here, positioning voice interactions as the most intuitive and natural way to interact with your AI. The app supports hands-free chatting and even includes a demo of full-duplex speech, a feature that lets you talk and listen at the same time. That's very useful considering how keen Meta is to connect Meta AI with the company’s larger product portfolio, especially the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. These AI-enabled spectacles will now operate through the Meta AI app, replacing the Meta View app they currently rely on. That means you can start a conversation on one platform and easily transition to another. All you need to do is open the Devices tab on the app and replicate your settings and saved information. Ask a question through your smart glasses, get a reply from Meta AI, and then pick up that same thread on your phone or desktop later. You can switch from voice chat in your glasses to reading the conversation in your app's history tab. For example, you could be on a walk and ask Meta AI through your glasses to find a nearby bookstore. The answer will be saved in your Meta AI app for later review. The other major element of the Meta AI app is the Discover feed. You can see publicly shared things like successful prompt ideas and images they've generated on the feed, then remix them for your own purposes. Additionally, the desktop version of Meta AI is also getting revamped with a new interface and more image generation options. There's also an experimental document editor for composing and editing text, adding visuals, and exporting it as a PDF. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Meta has spent many months spreading Meta AI across Instagram, Facebook, Messenger, andWhatsApp, but now, this is the first time Meta AI isn't hosted within another mobile app. The AI’s connection to Meta’s other apps does give it an edge (or a flaw, depending on your view) by allowing it to adapt its behavior based on what you do on those other apps. Meta AI draws on your Instagram and Facebook activity to personalize its answers. Ask it where to go for dinner, and it might suggest a ramen spot your friend posted about last week. Ask for tips on an upcoming vacation, and it’ll remember you once posted that you love to “travel light but overpack emotionally” and suggest an itinerary that might fit that attitude. Meta clearly wants Meta AI to be central in all your digital activities. The way the company pitches the app, it seems like you'll always be checking in with it, whether on your phone or on your head. There are obvious parallels with theChatGPTapp in terms of style. But Meta seems to want to differentiate its app fromOpenAI’s creation by emphasizing the personal over the broader utility of an AI assistant. And if there’s one thing Meta has more of than nearly anyone, it’s personal data. Meta AI tapping into your social data, voice habits, and even your smart glasses to deliver responses designed for you feels very on-brand. The idea of Meta AI forming a mental scrapbook of your life based on what you liked on Instagram or posted on Facebook might not appeal to everyone, of course. But if you're concerned, you can always put on the smart glasses and ask Meta AI for help.

    "article_text": "Iran claims to have stopped a “widespread and complex” attack When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Iran’s national infrastructure was hit with a “widespread and complex” cyberattack, which was repelled by the country’s cybersecurity experts, a senior official speaking to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-linked Tasnim News Agency confirmed (viaThe Record). Although the incident wasn’t described in detail, the head of the Iranian government’s Telecommunication Infrastructure Company (TIC), Behzad Akbari, said; “By God's grace and the efforts of the security and technical teams of the Communications Infrastructure Company and the Ministry of Communications, yesterday one of the most widespread and complex cyber attacks against the country's infrastructure was identified and preventive measures were taken,” said Akbari on X (Translated from Persian byGoogle). Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month. Keeper generates and stores strong passwords so you never have to remember them again. Don’t let one weak password leave you exposed. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Very little is known about the attack, nor about the Iranian security team’s success in stopping it -TechRadar Prodid reach out to the TIC, but has not yet received a reply. This comes just a day after an explosion at the country's largest port, Shahid Rajaei, killing at least 28 people and injuring 800 more, authorities report - although there’s no indication these two incidents are linked. This isn’t the first time Iranian national infrastructure has come under attack. In 2023, Iranian petrol stations were targeted in a controlled cyberattack, causing havoc across the country and affecting around 70% of petrol stations around the nation. The Iranian government attributed this incident to a cybergroup named ‘Predatory Sparrow’, which it says has ties to Israel.

As geopolitical tensions rise, national infrastructure continues to be the top target for state-backed threat actors and cybercriminals, especially given the critical nature of the services they provide, and the chaos created by downtime. The consequences for compromised telecommunications, transportation, energy, or water networks could be severe or even life-threatening, so cybersecurity is more critical than ever.

    "article_text": "NotebookLM Audio Overviews will chat in dozens of languages When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It seems the AI 'podcasters' you create withGoogle's NotebookLM have been playing a lot of Duolingo. The AI-generated hosts of the Audio Overview feature can now perform in more than 50 languages. Audio Overview is the NotebookLM feature that transforms the documents, videos, books, and other information you give it into an audio show hosted by a couple of AI voices. When you make the Audio Overview now, you can go to the settings and pick an Output Language ahead of generating the audio. You can also switch languages on the fly, generate summaries for friends or students in their native tongue, or prep multilingual study guides without hiring a translator or braving the often messy results of Google Translate. The addition may not seem like a big deal among other AI spectacles, but it's potentially huge. Language plays a gatekeeper for so many things, especially technology. Now, Google can entice those who might be interested in playing with its AI toy without them having to learn a whole new language. An entire global audience of people studying, teaching, researching, or just interested in learning new things can now better navigate a Google platform previously limited by English exclusivity. Teachers, for instance, can upload a hodgepodge of resources in different languages and generate a digestible audio recap in whatever language their students are most comfortable with. The feature is only in beta, and Google is keen to caution that there are still some problems. The voices might stumble, and you might encounter weird or wrong translations, especially in less frequently used languages. But the synthetic personalities will still discuss your research paper sources or complete home makeover guide and riff, recap, and remark on the content; it's just that English won't be the only tongue they do it in. That tone matters. One of the reasons Audio Overviews clicked with users in the first place is that they don’t sound like a monotone robot trying to teach you tax law. The AI hosts crack jokes, pause for effect, and express amazement in (usually) appropriate spots. There’s something deeply satisfying about hearing your own research about ancient Rome explained to you in Latin. It definitely makes learning the language feel more exciting.Amo audire podcasts novis linguis. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Panasonic’s new cheap wireless earbuds offer the open ear style I adore at an affordable price",
    "article_text": "Everyone should own a pair of open ear headphones When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Panasonichas just announced a new pair of cheap wireless earbuds with its open ear Panasonic RB-F10 earphones. Like other open ear designs, rather than sitting inside your ear, these earbuds sit over your ear canal. This allows you to hear your music clearly, but also, because your ear isn’t blocked, you can hear what’s going on around you. The Panasonic RB-F10s specifically come with a few handy features. They boast Bluetooth 5.4 with multipoint, so you can easily switch their connection between two different devices. They also feature built-in microphones for voice calls with automatic background noise removal, allowing you to be heard more clearly. Additionally, they have a seven-hour battery life, which can be extended by a further 18 hours using their charging case. Lastly, because open ear headphones are usually a little bigger than earbuds, they can boast bigger drivers, which should lead to a richer sound than you might be used to. At least, that’s what Panasonic is promising from its new RB-F10s. Best of all, they come in at just £79.99 (around $110 / AU$165) which makes them one of the more affordable options in the open ear space – and if they can stick the landing could help them secure the best budget option spot in our pick of thebest open ear headphonesguide. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I adore open ear headphones, and recently converted my fiancée to the lifestyle as well. We love to watch videos or listen to music on our phones, but it’s easy for it to become a competition as we each try to drown the other’s audio out by turning up our speakers louder and louder. We’ve tried using over-ear noise-cancelling headphones, but then it’s impossible for us to talk to one another, especially if one of us is trying to shout for the other from another room. Open ear headphones strike the perfect balance because we can enjoy our own private audio, but still call out to each other or easily come in and start chatting without having to compete with noise cancelling tech. They’re also ideal for working out (especially running, as you can enjoy your motivational audio and still hear what’s going on around you), or while traveling, as you can keep an ear out for any public transport announcements that you might miss if ANC is turned on. I’ve also found that they’re hooked design is generally comfortable yet secure. I’ve tested several open ear headphones designs, and I frequently forget to take them off even when I’m not playing any music because I just forget I have them on. Lastly, as is true for other earbuds, their small case makes them so easy to carry with you. Unlike a pair of headphones, you can get away with your pockets rather than needing to bring a bag as you can transport your cans when you aren’t wearing them. Now we haven’t yet tested the Panasonic RB-F10 earphones, but they look like they tick a lot of essential boxes on paper, which could make them a solid choice if you’re after the convenience of open ear headphones that I and others are already enjoying.

    "title": "LG announces US pricing for its first wireless QNED TV, and it's also taking aim at Samsung's mini-LED lineup",
    "article_text": "Wireless TVs get cheaper When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. LGhas revealed US pricing for two of its flagship QNED TVs, the QNED9M and QNED92. Pricing for the QNED9M, which features LG's Zero Connect Box (which previously was a feature exclusive to the LG M-seriesOLEDTVs), is listed as $1,799 for the 65-inch model, $2,299 for the 75-inch model and $3,499 for the 86-inch model. Pricing for the QNED92, the only mini-LED model inLG's 2025 QNED lineup, is listed as $2,299 for the 75-inch model and $3,499 for the 85-inch model. It will also be available in a 65-inch size, though no price was given for this model. However, based on how its pricing is identical in 75 and 85-inch sizes to the rivalSamsungQN80F, we'd guess it'll be roughly $1,799, the same as the 65-inch Samsung QN80F. Samsung, maker of some of thebest mini-LED TVsavailable,announced pricing for its entire mini-LED lineup in March. The LG QNED9M will feature the Zero Connect Box, an external connection box that wirelessly transmits signals from all sources to the TV, which will only require a power cable. The QNED9M will use an LED panel with a QNED color solution and it features the Alpha 9 AI processor Gen 8, the same found in theLG C4 OLED TV, one of thebest TVs. It will support Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and4K144Hz – all wirelessly. The LG QNED92, successor to the LG QNED90/91T from 2024, features a mini-LED backlight and the Alpha 8 AI processor Gen 2, the same used in theLG B4 OLED TV. It will also support Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos and 4K 120Hz for gaming, just to highlight some of its features. It's no secret that the mini-LED TV market is fiercely competitive, with Samsung,Hisense,TCLandSonyall big players in the category. LG has neverreallytargeted the market like it does the OLED TV one, but that could be about to change. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. I got the chance to see the QNED93 next to its predecessor earlier this year, and it was a significant upgrade, with improved backlight control, higher brightness and better detail overall. Its picture quality reminded me of some of Samsung's mini-LED sets, namely theSamsung QN85Dfrom 2024. So it's interesting that LG's QNED93 is priced exactly the same as the Samsung QN80F, the 2025 'equivalent' of the Samsung QN85D. It now seems LG has seriously thrown its hat into the mini-LED ring, creating a direct rival for Samsung. Also, bringing the Zero Connect Box to the LG QNED9M takes aim at Samsung's Frame Pro series, one of the first TVs to use Samsung's own Wireless One Connect Box. It's worth noting the QNED9M is cheaper in all sizes than the Frame Pro, but the Frame Pro has its Art Mode, a mini-LED backlight, and unique design, all things that contribute to a more premium price. We'll need a more detailed look at the new LG and Samsung TVs to get an idea of which reigns supreme, but it's interesting that LG has laid down the marker with the features and pricing of these two flagship TVs.

    "article_text": "55% of these companies regret making redundancies When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. According to organizational planning platform Orgvue, two in five (39%) UK businesses made redundancies due to their AI adoption and hopes for the technology, however more than half (55%) of them are now admitted those redundancy decisions were wrong. Consequences of the AI-induced redundancies include widespread internal confusion, leading to employees quitting and a drop inproductivity– the exact opposite of what businesses had initially hoped for with the deployment of artificial intelligence. Having seen how it's played out, businesses are now less likely to believe that AI will replace human workers after all. The report uncovers huge amounts of uncertainty over AI's impacts on the workforce. Two in five (38%) leaders still don't understand AI's impact on the businesses, with 25% unsure which roles are most at risk from AI. Despite only 48% of managers expecting AI will replace some workers compared with 54% last year, leaders reportedly feel less responsible in protecting their workforce from redundancies. \"While 2024 was the year of investment and optimism, businesses are learning the hard way that replacing people with AI without fully understanding the impact on their workforce can go badly wrong,\" Orgvue CEO Oliver Shaw noted. \"We’re facing the worst global skills shortage in a generation and dismissing employees without a clear plan for workforce transformation is reckless.\" Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Looking ahead, nearly half (47%) fear uncontrolled AI usage by employees, with four in five planning to retrain employees to use the tools properly. Two in five (41%) have already increased their learning and development budgets accordingly, with half (51%) introducing internal AI usage policies and 43% working with third-party AI specialists. Although it's apparent that human workers are fundamental to businesses, 80% plan to increase AI investments in 2025, yet 27% still lack a clear roadmap. Overall, Orgvue's research paints a troubling picture of the state of AI, highlighting a total lack of understanding. \"While it’s encouraging to see investment in AI continue to grow, businesses need a better understanding of how the technology will change their workforce in the coming months and years,\" Shaw concluded.

    "article_text": "FAVM's FA-EX9 can drive up to four 8K displays When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Chinese hardware manufacturer FAVM has announced the FA-EX9, a compact AI-focused mini PC powered byAMD’s latest Ryzen AI MAX+ 395 processor. Based on the Strix Halo platform, the chip features 16 Zen 5 CPU cores and 40 RDNA 3.5 Compute Units (Radeon 8060S). The diminutive device measures just 192 x 190 x 55mm and with a total chassis volume of just 2 liters, FAVM claims the system is among the smallest of its kind. The FA-EX9 is squarely aimed at AI professionals and is positioned as a challenger to platforms likeNvidia’s DGX Spark. It supports the MAX+ 395 processor at a sustained 120W power draw, which the company says offers performance comparable to a Ryzen 9 9955HX paired with a GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. The system uses LPDDR5 memory across a 256-bit bus, offering 128GB of total memory. Up to 96GB can be allocated as GPU memory, so it can handle large language model workloads without requiring discrete GPUs. FAVM claims that the integrated GPU and NPU architecture in the FA-EX9 delivers 2.2 times the AI performance of an RTX 4090 in LM Studio when running locally. The system uses dual turbine fans and phase-change thermal materials to manage heat while keeping noise levels low during high-load tasks. FA-EX9’s connectivity includes HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 2.1, and two USB4 ports, with support for up to four8Kdisplays. It also features an OCuLink connector with a bundled adapter for high-performance external GPU expansion.

Visual Composer is a development tool that allows users to build web-based business applications without writing code. It’s mostly used to create dashboards, forms, and interactive reports. The Metadata Uploader, on the other hand, is a tool for importing external data models (metadata) into the Visual Composer design environment. This allows developers to connect to remote data sources (web services, databases, or SAP systems). The vulnerability SAP found is now tracked as CVE-2025-31324. It carries the maximum severity score (10/10), and stems from the fact that the uploader is not protected with proper authorization, allowing unauthenticated actors to uploadmalicious executables. Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month ​Keeper is a cybersecurity platform primarily known for its password manager and digital vault, designed to help individuals, families, and businesses securely store and manage passwords, sensitive files, and other private data. It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) When it discovered the bug, SAP first released a workaround, and then in late April, a patch. Now, users are advised to apply it as soon as possible, since multiple cybersecurity firms confirmed the flaw being abused in the wild. According to BleepingComputer, ReliaQuest, watchTowr, and Onapsis, are just some of the firms that observed the bug being exploited in attacks in which threat actors were dropping web shells on vulnerable servers. SAP, however, told BleepingComputer that it is not aware of any attacks that impacted customer data or systems. The jury is still out on how many organizations are actually vulnerable. While the Shadowserver Foundation claims 427 servers are exposed on the internet, Onyphe says there are 1,284 instances, 474 of which are already compromised.

    "title": "Help! All the Dyson fans look exactly the same – which one should I buy?",
    "article_text": "An at-a-glance rundown of your options, so you don't end up with the wrong fan (or purifier) for your needs When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Dysonis really, really good at moving air around. While the company made its name in vacuum cleaners, it's now almost as well known for its aircare appliances – it makes some of thebest fansand thebest air purifiersaround, sometimes in one appliance. In fact, some can also heat or humidify the air, as required. Dyson's aircare products are instantly recognizable, with most of them sporting a slick, space-age design that seems to magic up wind from nowhere. The downside of such an established look is that it can be very difficult to tell the difference between the various models in the range. With a wide selection of options available, it can be tricky to figure out exactly which product is which, and then which one to buy. We've put together this guide to help you tell the difference between the various options, so you can choose the right one for your needs. This table provides a very basic overview of the full Dyson aircare range. Click the links in the 'List price' column to jump to the product listing at Dyson in each territory. If the currency you're looking for isn't listed, it's worth doing a quickGoogle, because the product may still be available to buy via a third-party retailer in that territory.

Most of Dyson's aircare appliances function as fans, so you have a lot of options to choose from. If youjustwant a fan, you need the Dyson Cool AM07. Because it only has one function, it's the cheapest option in the whole lineup. You can find out what we thought of it in ourDyson Cool AM07 review. If you suffer from seasonal allergies, you might want to consider a fan-purifier combo. Your main options here are the TP models, which have names starting with 'Purifier Cool'. The cheapest and most basic option here is the Purifier Cool TP10, and the most advanced is the Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09. Note that adding formaldehyde-removing capabilities to any Dyson product bumps up the price considerably. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Perhaps you need a fan because your home isn't especially well insulated, and you experience big temperature swings between seasons. In that case, you might consider a fan-heater combo. This option has the added benefit of meaning the appliance isn't just gathering dust in the summer months. The only option here is the Hot+Cool Jet Focus AM09. We've tested that one, and you can see how we got on in ourDyson AM09 Hot + Cool review. Finally, you could go the whole hog and opt for a fan-purifier-heater. For this, you want theHPrange, with names starting 'Purifier Hot+Cool'. Options vary by country, but one that's available everywhere is the Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10.

Dyson has lots of air purifier options. This tech goes hand-in-hand with what the brand needs for its vacuum cleaners, so it knows what it's doing when it comes to capturing particles. If you just want air purification, check out the Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde models. There are two slightly different versions: the BP04 and BP03, of which the 04 is slightly higher-spec. These are bulky and expensive, and designed to tackle large areas (up to 100m²) quietly. The purification capabilities are about the best you'll find anywhere, stretching to include nasties that most air purifiers can't handle, like NO2 and formaldehyde. You can read our thoughts on this range in ourDyson Purifier Big+Quiet Formaldehyde review. If you just want a purifier for your bedroom or living room, and would prefer something smaller and cheaper, we'd suggest a purifier-fan. Look in the TP range, with products starting 'Purifier Cool'. The most affordable, simplest model is the first-gen Purifier Cool TP10. It still has excellent purification capabilities, but it can't handle everything the Big+Quiet options can. Alternatively, opt for the Purifier Cool Formaldehyde TP09, which is more advanced. Finally, you could go for a triple-action model. The purifier-heater-fan options have names starting 'Purifier Hot+Cool' and codes beginning HP, and the most widely available option is the Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10. Alternatively, there are a couple of options that swap heating for humidification – in the US it's the PH03 and in the UK it's the PH04. Product Functions List price Purifier Big+Quiet FormaldehydeBP04 Purifier $1,099.99/£929.99/AU$1,599 Purifier Big+Quiet FormaldehydeBP03 Purifier $999.99/£879.99/AU$1,499 Purifier Cool Gen1TP10 Purifier, fan $429.99/£449.99/AU$799 Purifier Cool FormaldehydeTP09 Purifier, fan $749.99/£549.99/AU$999 There are no standalone heater options in Dyson's range, but it's included as a bonus function with a number of the brand's aircare appliances. The simplest and most affordable model is the Dyson Hot+Cool Jet Focus AM09, which operates as a fan or as a heater, depending on your needs. Otherwise, you'll need to opt for a three-in-one 'Purifier Hot+Cool' with a code name starting HP. All of these can heat, cool, or purify air. The most widely available is the Purifier Hot+Cool Gen1 HP10. We've tested the HP09, and you can read about how we got on with it in ourDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde HP09 review.

On the back of thenew shopping featuresrolling out toChatGPT,OpenAIis also improving its search capabilities in a few helpful ways. Firstly, theChatGPT integration in WhatsApphas been beefed up to include more up-to-date answers when searching. WhatsAppintegration withChatGPTworks by adding ChatGPT as a new contact inside your WhatsApp app, then chatting with it via WhatsApp messages (or using voice calls in US and Canada), as you would a friend. You can start a conversation with ChatGPT in WhatsApp by simply clicking thislinkon your mobile phone. Secondly, ChatGPT's search function has improved citation capabilities. Paragraphs can now have multiple citations, and when you hover your cursor over each citation, a different part of the text will highlight, indicating what it’s referring to. This feature seems to already be functioning when we tested it today, and is working perfectly. Next, you should soon be able to get real-time suggestions from ChatGPT that autocomplete with trend suggestions as you're typing. This sounds very similar to the way thatGoogleautocompletes when you start typing in Google search, however, this feature hadn't been rolled out to our account to test at the time of writing. Finally, improved memory is going to work with ChatGPT search and its new shopping feature. This means that ChatGPT will consider what you’ve said before when it searches and shops for you, meaning you won't have to keep explaining to it that you hate a particular brand and don't want to see results from them. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

    "title": "Here's one of the strangest ways gamers are trying to buy an RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 - unsurprisingly, it's not working",
    "article_text": "Cancel that flight to Japan, Nvidia fans When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Besides overpriced third-party models,Nvidia'sRTX 5090andRTX 5080GPUs are both difficult to obtain (especially Founders Edition cards). And as it turns out, one potential 'easy' alternative for consumers has very quickly been shut down. As reported byVideoCardz, Japanese retailers have restricted purchases of the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080 to Japanese nationals only. This comes after previous attempts to stop tourists from buying the prestigious graphics cards; notably, stores had blocked tax-free purchases, but they're now taking a much more aggressive approach. Signs in stores state that both of Nvidia's high-end GPUs won't be sold to anyone who intends on using the GPU outside of the country, effectively shutting out all tourists from buying. Customers will reportedly be put through a 'Japanese resident' test before purchasing. It's a highlight of the short supply and high demand situation surrounding graphics cards right now, and it's perhaps quite an amusing tactic from consumers considering the lack of availability at launch price, elsewhere. On paper catching a plane to another country to buy a GPU sounds like an extreme measure, but I suppose a flight to Japan could cost less than the inflation differential in other regions. It may sound like an extreme measure, but it's actually rather familiar. Nvidia currently has its Verified Priority Access scheme in place, which allows US customers to reserve an opportunity to buy either an RTX 5090 or RTX 5080 Founders Edition GPU; the catch is that you must have made an Nvidia account on or before January 30 to be eligible. This prevents scalpers from spoiling the party for genuine buyers, while also ensuring there's enough to go around for consumers in the US (although, it'd be nice to see this become available for more regions), particularly in a time of high demand. As I write this article on an RTX 5080 laptop, I can testify to how good the Blackwell GPUs are. However, going to another region to buy a graphics card isn't worth the hassle. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Since I'm hooked on high-end gaming experiences at high resolutions, I'd never turn down the opportunity for a powerhouse GPU. For other gamers though, it's not a necessity, andSteam's latest hardware survey results show that 1080p is still the most widely used resolution. We're now at a stage whereAMD's APUs andIntel's SoCs (System-on-Chip) are performing great in games at 1080p and 1440p resolutions; for example,AMD's Ryzen AI Max 395+ outperforms some discrete GPUsin games like Cyberpunk 2077. The only problem is these chips are only now gradually starting to make their way to desktop PCs, and most PC hardware components are facing price inflation anyway (particularly GPUs). It's now a matter of weighing your options and whether high resolutions are a priority for you - just please don't overspend, okay? Isaiah is a Staff Writer for the Computing channel at TechRadar.

    "title": "DJI Mini 5 rumors take flight – here are 5 major upgrades on my beginner drone wishlist",
    "article_text": "How will DJI improve on its best-in-class Mini drone? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The first leaked image of what is said to beDJI's next Mini drone has been sharedon DroneXL, a site run by prominent DJI leaker Jasper Ellens – and it could be the upcoming DJI Mini 5 Pro. With theMini 4 Procurrently holding top spot in ourbest dronesbuying guide, naturally we're excited that its successor could potentially land soon – possibly in August or September. The Mini 4 Pro is already the best sub-250g drone available, and thebest premium option for beginners– so what upgrades could DJI possibly have up its sleeve? I can think of a few improvements I'd like to see, and the leaked image, which shows the drone being tested in public in China, appears to tease some upgrades that have got DJI fans talking – let's look at what those could be, and what's hopefully coming in the rumored Mini 5 Pro. I will tell you all about the #Mavic4Pro in the coming days. But let's appreciate this new #leaked image from the upcoming #DJIMini5 spotted in the wild. Are you just as excited about this like I am? Will definitely buy this. Cheers! Jasperhttps://t.co/IZQ5WelEaqApril 24, 2025 In the grainy leaked image, Ellens has spotted front-facing LiDAR sensors above the drone's camera. LiDAR would give the rumored Mini 5 Pro a more effective collision-avoidance system than the Mini 4 Pro, especially in low light – making it a safer drone to fly during twilight and at night. DJI debuted LiDAR in theAir 3Slast year, and the all-rounder drone proved better able to navigate obstacles and terrain at night than its predecessors, which are equipped with standard night-vision and object-sensing tech. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. A potential Mini 5 Pro would be the world's first sub-250g drone with LiDAR, assuming that it stays within the same weight class as previous versions – more on this below. As someone who loves flying at first and last light, and in areas with plenty of points of interest, I'd love to see LiDAR tech, but it's of limited use to users who only fly their drones in open spaces on clear days. Larger motors have also been gleaned from that leaked image, suggesting a beefier design and and potentially more efficient performance. This could translate to better wind resistance for more stable flight, plus enhanced flight times. Improving stability and flight times could represent a significant upgrade in an area where the Mini 4 Pro didn't improve on its predecessor, the Mini 3 Pro. Some leakers are suggesting flight times of up to 50 minutes, which would smash the Mini 4 Pro's 34-minute flight time on a fully charged battery. This improvement would be huge for a Mini-series drone – 50 minutes is the sort of flight time I'd expect from a pricier and weightier drone. Some leakers are also claiming that the Mini 5 will pack a 1-inch sensor, which is a much larger sensor than the 1/1.3-inch sensor utilized by the Mini 4 Pro. A drone's camera specs are of keen interest to me as a photographer and filmmaker, and a larger sensor could be the most significant upgrade in the next model – it should deliver a cleaner image in low light, with better dynamic range, helpful in bright conditions. I'd take better image quality in challenging light over higher resolution, but we could also see a bump to 5.3K video, which would mark an upgrade over the Mini 4 Pro's4Kvideo, which is available up to 100fps. The larger sensor could be the springboard for some of the biggest video upgrades the Mini series has seen yet. Back to the leaked image again, which clearly shows that the drone has propellor guards, much like those on theDJI Flip. This would be a first for one of DJI's Mini drones, but just because the drone in this image has propellor guards that it doesn't mean the final version will have them – they could just be a safety measure for the drone's pre-production testing phase. Should a Mini 5 Pro have such a design, it could feel more like a Flip 2. This would mark a new direction for DJI's Mini series, and the reaction to this possibility has been mixed. On the plus side, propellor guards make for safer flight in tight spaces; but adding guards will affect the weight and flight performance, and many fans will be hoping for a continuation of the existing guard-free design. Key to the appeal of DJI's Mini series of drones is that every model falls under 250g, which keeps them in the largely restriction-free weight category, and is a must for beginners and casual users. However, if the above speculation is true, and the Mini 5 does indeed arrive with LiDAR sensors, heftier motors, and a larger image sensor, it would surely make it a weightier drone than the Mini 4 Pro, which squeezes in under 250g. Could this upcoming model be the first DJI Mini drone to tip the scales above 250g? And if so, would its rumored upgrades be worth the price of placing the drone in the next weight category up? Surely not – if there's one feature I'd love to see in DJI's next Mini drone, it's one that has been there from the beginning: a sub-250g weight. Tim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.

    "article_text": "HMRC is on the lookout for a new CRM supplier When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. HMRC has announced plans for a new SaaS CRM platform to manage citizen tax interactions, and apreliminary market engagement noticehas been issued to invite bids and engage with potential suppliers. Ideally, the CRM platform will include registration, subscription, and customer record management as well as identity, verification, access, and fraud services, plus secure communications and document storage options. The news comes as HMRC also explores plans for a future Contact Centre as a Service (CCaaS) platform set to be procured this year. The notice stresses that the two systems must seamlessly integrate. By ensuring interoperability across its different platforms, HRMC hopes that the modernization will \"directly [enhance] taxpayer interactions, [streamline] services, and [reduce] administrative burdens.\" HMRC's current systems aren't known for their strong performance – MPs reported significant issues with the department's phone services in 2023-24, with 44,000 callers cut off after waiting 70 minutes in the tax year's first 11 months (viaThe Register). The average call wait time was reportedly over 23 minutes, and only two in three calls were ever answered. The National Audit Office (NAO) also noted that customers spent a combined 798 years on hold in the 2023-24 financial year. A total of £1 billion excluding VAT (£1.2 billion with VAT) has been set aside to find a CRM supplier, with whom HRMC anticipates entering into a 15-year contract. Formal competition for theCRM platformis expected to start in June 2025, and there's a particular preference for small and medium-sized enterprises to step forward.

    "title": "Garmin Fenix 8 could get a massive upgrade in the form of LTE",
    "article_text": "Cellular service, so you can leave your phone behind When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new leak purportedly reveals thatGarminmay be preparing to launch an LTE version of itsbest Garmin watch, theGarmin Fenix 8, which would let users leave their phone behind in more scenarios providing your watch is added to a data plan. Garmin hasn't offered LTE – cellular connectivity for making calls, streaming music, and more – on its smartwatches since the Forerunner 945 LTE, which launched in 2021. If this leak is real and shows us what we think it does, that could be about to change. Gadgets and Wearablesclaims to have acquired a screenshot \"showing a Fenix 8 device with LTE appearing as one of the connectivity options during the troubleshooting pairing process, sitting alongside Wi-Fi, Phone, and Sensor & Accessories.\" The screenshot clearly reveals an LTE settings option. If it's real, it could mean users will eventually have the option to buy an LTE-capable version of the Fenix 8. As the report notes, LTE inclusion in the Fenix 8 could denote a couple of things. Garmin could choose to restrict LTE to safety features like emergency alerts and live tracking, so your friends and family can more readily see your location even if you've ventured off without your phone. A more exciting upgrade would be LTE as we know it on most watches, which enables streaming of music, calls, and texts. It's a mainstay option on many of thebest smartwatches,including thebest Apple Watchesin 2025, and an obvious gap in Garmin's repertoire. The veracity of this leak is impossible to determine at this stage, but there's no reason to suspect Garmin couldn't pull off an LTE Fenix 8. Naturally, cellular requires modified hardware, so this would be a more expensive new model that customers could buy from Garmin, rather than an upgrade to existing devices.

    "article_text": "These very light earbuds have long battery life and some clever features When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Shokz has launched its smallest open-ear wireless buds yet, the OpenDots ONE. Weighing just 0.23 ounces (just over6g) per bud they're extremely light, and their clip-on design should ensure they stay put even when you're active, despite they being smaller and not having the wrapround design of the Shokz that top our list of thebest open earbuds. The clip-on section is made from a nickel-titanium arch that Shokz says feels gentle but stays secure on all ear sizes. It's enclosed in soft silicone for comfort and the earbuds are interchangeable: simply stick them in whichever ear you like and they'll work out which bud is in which ear and adjust the stereo accordingly. The buds are powered by custom 11.8mm drivers with Shokz' Bassphere design for a strong low end. There are four EQ modes and what Shokz calls DirectPitch Audio, which is designed to minimize sound leakage despite the buds not being directly in your ear canal. There are two microphones for calls, and AI noise reduction for clarity when you're speaking to someone – though there's no active noise cancellation here. The battery life is up to 10 hours on a single charge and a total of 40 hours from the lightweight charging case. The buds are IP54 water and sweat resistant, and they have multipoint so you can connect to two devices simultaneously for easy switching.

    "article_text": "Up from 55,000 a year ago When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Four million people may have had their sensitive data stolen in the Verisource data breach that happened last year. The company confirmed the news in a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General, as well as in a data breach notification letter sent to affected individuals. VeriSource Services is a Houston-based employee benefits administration company, with clients in different industries in the US, including healthcare, education, and the public sector. It recently started sending out data breach notification letters, in which it said that it became aware of “unusual activity” that disrupted access to certain systems, on February 28, 2024. The subsequent investigation, which concluded on April 17, 2025, determined that threat actors stole “certain personal information” the day before being spotted. Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month ​Keeper is a cybersecurity platform primarily known for its password manager and digital vault, designed to help individuals, families, and businesses securely store and manage passwords, sensitive files, and other private data. It uses zero-knowledge encryption and offers features like two-factor authentication, dark web monitoring, secure file storage, and breach alerts to protect against cyber threats. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The information stolen includes people’s names, addresses, dates of birth, gender information, and/or Social Security numbers (SSN). “Please note that VSI has no evidence of any actual or suspected misuse of information involved in this incident,” the company said. It is also worth mentioning that no one has so far assumed responsibility for the attack and the data has not surfaced anywhere on the dark web. Therefore, it is difficult to determine if this was a simple smash-and-grab, or aransomwareattack. While the letter didn’t say how many people were affected by the breach, a listing on the website of the Maine Attorney General’s Office puts the number of victims at four million, up from 55,000 in May 2024, and another 112,000 in September 2024. VeriSource said that it offers 12 months of free credit monitoring, identity theft protection, and identity restoration services to the victims. Although it might sound too little too late, the fact that the data hasn’t surfaced yet could mean the offering might make sense.

    "title": "India planning ‘military strike’ within 24–36 hours – Pakistan",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has alleged that India is planning a military strike on its territory, signaling a further escalation in tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to launch a military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours, using the Pahalgam incident as a false pretext,”Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X on Tuesday evening. “Any act of aggression will be met with a decisive response. India will be fully responsible for any serious consequences in the region,”Tarar added. His statement came after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the country’s armed forces“full operational freedom”to determine the mode, targets, and timing of a response to the recent terrorist attack in India’s Jammu and Kashmir union territory, which killed 26 people, most of them tourists. New Delhi has linked the terrorist attack to Pakistan, reiterating long-standing accusations that its neighbor supports cross-border terrorism and insurgencies. Pakistan has denied the allegations and, in turn, accused India of backing“terrorist networks”operating on Pakistani soil. The two countries have a long-standing dispute over the Kashmir region, which is de facto divided by the Line of Control established after the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War. On April 22, terrorists opened fire on a group of people in Pahalgam, in the northern part of Jammu and Kashmir. The Resistance Front, believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistan-based jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, claimed responsibility for the attack. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to punish“the terrorists and their backers.”Indian media reported on Tuesday that four anti-terror operations were underway in Jammu and Kashmir. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif suggested that the Pahalgam attack was a“false flag operation.”In response, India’s Deputy Envoy to the United Nations, Yojna Patel, condemned Pakistan for making what she called“baseless allegations against India.”",

    "title": "Trump’s envoy sought to convince Putin on terms of ceasefire deal – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff sought to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire last week that would halt fighting in the Ukraine conflict along the current frontlines, Bloomberg has reported, citing sources. Putin maintained a firm stance during the lengthy meeting, the sources said. The discussions on Friday marked the latest in a series of contacts between Moscow and Washington in recent months. Witkoff, seen as a key figure in kickstarting negotiations on the Ukraine conflict, has held multiple rounds of talks with senior Russian officials, including at least three meetings with Putin. People familiar with the process told Bloomberg on Tuesday that Putin insisted any viable peace deal must include formal recognition of the four former Ukrainian regions that joined Russia after referendums in 2022. Moscow has long said it is open to negotiations but maintains that the status of Crimea – which joined Russia in 2014 – and the four other regions is not up for discussion.  Moscow insists that recognition of the“reality on the ground”is vital for a lasting peace. Last week, Axios reported that Washington had presented Kiev with what US President Donald Trump described as a“final offer”to end the conflict. Under the proposal, the US is said to be prepared to grant“de jure”recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, and unofficially acknowledge Moscow’s“de facto”control over the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, as well as the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye. Vladimir Zelensky’s subsequent declaration that Kiev would never recognize Crimea as Russian prompted a warning from Trump that he risked losing his whole country if he continued stalling talks with Moscow. Trump, who met with the Ukrainian leader on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican on Saturday, was later asked by journalists if Zelensky was now prepared to“give up”the peninsula.“Oh, I think so, yeah,”he replied. One source told Bloomberg that negotiations have stalled for now and that progress would likely require direct contact between Putin and Trump. The two leaders held a two-hour phone call in March, during which they reaffirmed their commitment to achieving a“lasting peace”rather than a temporary solution to the Ukraine conflict.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this month that a Putin-Trump meeting“will take place”but only“at the appropriate time.”",

    "title": "We’re about to glimpse the future of all conservative parties",
    "article_text": "Australian voters go to the polls next Saturday – voting in this country is compulsory, unlike in most Western democracies – but this is not a task that the electorate is looking forward to with any degree of enthusiasm, let alone optimism. The choice that confronts the electorate is a bleak one – one commentator has fittingly described this election as“the most dismal in decades.” Serious policy debate has been non-existent, with both leaders happy to offer meagre handouts to voters – an electricity price reduction from Prime Minister Albanese and a petrol price reduction from Conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton. The first term Albanese Labor government has, from any rational viewpoint, proved to be a rank failure and does not deserve to be re-elected – and any competent opposition leader should have been able to win this election easily and dispatch Labor to the opposition benches. Cost-of-living pressures have increased exponentially over the past three years – energy and food prices have skyrocketed, and house prices and rents in the major cities are now far beyond what ordinary wage earners in this country can afford to pay. This, according to every poll, is the major issue troubling voters – and the Albanese government has done absolutely nothing to alleviate it. Australian voters intuitively know, even if they are reluctant to admit it, that both the incumbent Labor government and the Conservative Liberal/National party opposition are incapable of alleviating the cost-of-living crisis. In fact, during the election campaign, both leaders have been reduced to telling outright lies (for example, that heavily subsidized renewable energy projects lead to lower energy prices) about how they will solve the crisis. The electorate’s escalating disenchantment with both major parties should come as no surprise to either Albanese or Dutton. As yet, however, no political alternative has emerged that offers voters a way out (no matter how illusory) of this seemingly intractable impasse. Australia, in this respect, appears to be a decade or so behind Donald Trump’s America, Nigel Farage’s UK and Marine Le Pen’s France. Both major parties in Australia are firmly committed to policies that favor the ruling global elites – with the result that the gap between the economic ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ will only grow wider in the future as the cost-of-living crisis intensifies. This is hardly surprising, given that Australia has always been a colonial political and economic satrap state of both the UK and the US. So dependent still is Australia on these waning and decrepit colonial empires – they differ only in the way they enforce their respective colonial hegemonies – that our current head of state is King Charles III, and our economic overlords remain, in the apt words of Woody Guthrie, the“money grubbing racket boys”of Wall Street. What then are we to make of next week’s election? If almost all recent polls are to be believed, the inept Albanese Labor government appears to be on track to be re-elected with an increased majority. How is this altogether surprising state of affairs to be explained? It cannot be explained by the“achievements”of the Albanese government because, as intelligent Labor supporters know, there have been no achievements. Nor can it be explained by Albanese’s political skills or charisma – he is completely lacking in both – although perhaps his dogged blandness and non-threatening demeanor appeal to some voters. Nor can it be explained by opposition leader Peter Dutton’s gross political incompetence, his brief flirtation with Trump that backfired disastrously when tariffs were imposed and the stock market crashed (Canada’s Liberal leader did not make this mistake), or the fact that he has run probably the worst election campaign in Australian political history. The answer lies rather in the inability of the conservative opposition to formulate an effective alternative political agenda to that of the Labor party – and this failure arises not from Dutton’s manifold personal shortcomings, but from the fundamental ideological division at the heart of all mainstream conservative parties in the West. A deep-seated ideological division has emerged over the past few decades within these parties: between those adhering to traditional middle-class values (individual autonomy, individual rights, the rule of law, a traditional definition of the family, etc.) and those that have embraced the newer woke ideologies of the emerging global elites  (catastrophic climate change, identity politics, DEI, transgender rights, etc).  This division has both economic and cultural aspects, and in the UK it was intensified by the Brexit referendum. This ideological division has caused serious ongoing instability within all mainstream conservative parties in the West – in Australia and the UK, for example, these parties have been characterized by endless leadership coups that eventually led voters to throw them out of office in recent years. One important consequence of this ideological division is that mainstream conservative parties cannot wholeheartedly and openly attack woke global ideologies with any degree of vigor  – because many of their politicians and supporters firmly subscribe to such views. It is this issue that has crippled Dutton’s election campaign. The Murdoch press and other conservative commentators have constantly urged Dutton to come out and explicitly attack dominant woke ideologies – that is, to adopt a fully-fledged Trump-like populist political agenda. Dutton, however, has refused to do so – because it is simply impossible for him to do so within the framework of the mainstream conservative political party that he so tenuously leads. If he tried to, he would alienate a large segment of his own party as well as a sizable component of conservative voters – thereby causing the coalition parties to split. More importantly, no traditional mainstream political party that is serious about winning an election can at present afford to openly attack dominant global ideologies – a majority of voters adhere to them, and no mainstream party can win office if it alienates a significant segment of these voters. Dutton, therefore, has found himself in an impossible position. This was graphically illustrated in one of the recent televised debates, when a journalist asked Dutton if he believed in climate change. Dutton responded by saying“I will leave that to the scientists”– notwithstanding that the opposition is committed to the Paris accords and net zero. This non-answer, of course, pleased no one. It alienated those conservative and undecided voters who firmly believe in climate change ideology – but it also alienated those conservative voters who believe that the climate change ideology has had lasting and pernicious economic effects. In refusing to take a firm stand on this key issue, Dutton appears to stand for nothing. Does he really think that disgruntled voters who cannot afford to pay their electricity bills believe that climate change is just a matter for the scientists? It must surely be obvious to Dutton that, in order to win over those disaffected voters who have been left behind by globalization and who are being increasingly marginalized by the cost-of-living crisis, he has to openly attack dominant woke ideologies like catastrophic climate change – because it is precisely these voters who completely reject, for very sound economic and cultural reasons, such elite doctrines. This, however, is Dutton’s dilemma – in order to differentiate the opposition from Labor and attract the increasing number of disaffected voters, Dutton is obliged to openly attack dominant woke ideologies, but, as the leader of a mainstream conservative party, he simply cannot do so. Dutton’s dilemma is also UK opposition leader Kemi Badenoch’s dilemma – and it is a dilemma that right-wing commentators who urge mainstream conservative party leaders to miraculously transform themselves into Trump-like populists utterly fail to understand. These commentators also fail to appreciate that, apart from the difficulties described above, two further insurmountable problems face conservative leaders seeking to instantly morph into populists – they would have to adopt an isolationist foreign policy stance, and they would have to at least pretend to represent the interests of the displaced working class. Dutton – just like Badenoch – is, however, a fervent Cold War warrior (fiercely anti-Russian and anti-Chinese) and a supporter of the Zelensky regime in Ukraine, as well as being a strident opponent of moderate trade union demands (he even consistently opposes basic wage increases). Trump, of course, can readily promise to end the conflict in Ukraine and accept endorsement from the head of the Teamsters Union – policy stances utterly impossible for a conservative leader like Dutton to even contemplate. If the above analysis is correct, and, as nearly all the polls predict, Dutton loses next week’s election, it follows that the conservative coalition in Australia will have no viable long-term future – in much the same way that the UK Conservative party appears to be doomed to political oblivion in the near future. This week’s local elections in the UK will be an important indicator of that party’s fate. If the Albanese government is returned to office with a majority, as seems likely, Dutton will no doubt be deposed as leader, but in fairness to Dutton, his shadow cabinet colleagues – who he has wisely kept hidden away during the election campaign – are all far less competent politicians than he is. There is, of course, an alternative scenario – one that mirrors the recent emergence of populist parties in other Western democracies – namely that the coalition parties will split and the right-wing segments of the Liberal and National parties will coalesce to form a new, genuinely populist party with a radically different political program. This is a distinct possibility – although it may take some time to eventuate and would involve a significant amount of blood-letting and political disruption. A new populist party would face a revitalized Labor party – energized by winning an election under an uninspiring leader that it did not deserve to win – but still firmly committed to elite ideologies and programs that can only deepen the cost-of-living crisis that continues to brutally divide Australia. If the conservative coalition’s dilemma is that it cannot attack elite ideologies and programs, the Labor party’s dilemma (much like that of the Democratic party in America and the UK Labour party) is that it is firmly and irretrievably committed to them. Whatever the consequences of next Saturday’s election it is safe to predict that the chronic ongoing instability that has characterized Australian politics for the past few decades – and politics in the West more generally – will only intensify. In that sense nothing much will change – and there is a more fundamental historical continuity in the Australian context at work here. In 1964, Donald Horne, a prominent Australian intellectual, wrote a book titled“The Lucky Country”in which he described Australia as follows:“Australia is a lucky country ruled mainly by second-rate people… It lives on other people’s ideas, and although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders… lack curiosity about the events that surround them.” Horne could easily have been writing about Dutton and Albanese and next Saturday’s federal election.",

    "title": "Oliver Stone warns Russia and US were close to World War III",
    "article_text": "There was a point in the last three years of the Ukraine conflict where Russia and the US have teetered on the edge of a nuclear war, acclaimed filmmaker Oliver Stone has said. Speaking to Russian students at the ‘Knowledge.First’ event in Moscow on Tuesday, spoke out against the US role in the Ukraine conflict, as well as its coverage in Western media. The Hollywood legend suggested that over the past three years, Moscow and Washington have relived the Cold War spike in tensions that previously culminated in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and said he hoped a corresponding wind down would follow. The US and the Soviet Union almost came to a nuclear clash at the height of the Cold War, after the USSR retaliated by placing nuclear weapons in Cuba, following Washington’s deployment of nukes in Turkey. ”I want to emphasize to you students how very close we came to World War III because of this awful leadership,”he said. ”We bring a great waste of our resources and height of this futility was a war which [former US President Joe] Biden recently dedicated to weakening Russia,”Stone said.“It is a retrograde war.” Western media coverage of the conflict and Russia has shocked him during the past three years, the director admitted. ”Even at the height of the Cold War, we didn’t treat Russia like this,”he said. Whereas now, the media has trained people in the West to equate Russia with President Vladimir Putin, Stone added. This is a tragic substitution of hatred for intelligence. “The propaganda state in the West is an incredible empire. Far further and stronger than I ever imagined. You are unable to see the inside of the matrix,”he said. Straight out of the works of George Orwell. While the anti-war filmmaker has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, he has criticized Biden and the US“neoconservative movement”for the Ukraine conflict. Stone produced the 2016 ‘Ukraine on Fire’ documentary showing the role Washington played in the 2014 Maidan coup that overthrew Kiev’s democratically-elected president Viktor Yanukovich.",

    "article_text": "Attempts by EU elites to diminish the significance of the USSR’s contribution to the victory over Nazism are a“perversion of history,”Oscar-winning American movie director Oliver Stone has told RT ahead of World War II Victory Day celebrations in Russia. The bloc’s“elitist leadership”has distorted the message that World War II provides to humanity, the filmmaker has said.“I’m shocked by it, by [what] is happening,”he stated, calling it“a shame”and“a disgrace that we forgot or pretend to [have forgotten]”about the sacrifices the Soviet Union made during the war. Stone also said he did not believe people in Europe“buy this at all.” “I think the people don’t agree with the government,”Stone maintained, going on to say that“the futility of this campaign against Russia by the EU”is obvious to“anybody, who reads history [books] and is intelligent.”The director of ‘Platoon’ and ‘JFK’ expressed his doubts that“fascism is popular”nowadays and stated instead that European elites had lost their way because of their“worship of the EU.” “We are not back to the times of Hitler, but what is happening is a loss of perspective and we need to get back to a sense of reason,”Stone told RT as he called on Western leaders to“listen to the Russians”instead of antagonizing them. He also expressed his hope that the US and Russia would manage to mend their relationship, opening the way to a better future for humanity.“Russia and the United States are a great partnership, as is China, by the way, and I think we could have a world that is much safer… if we all get together and realize that it’s a multilateral world.” US President Donald Trump’s administration has been engaged in efforts to restore bilateral ties with Russia and resolve the Ukraine conflict. On Wednesday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that America now has a“better”understanding of the Russian position on the crisis. Moscow’s key conditions for ending the conflict are Ukraine’s neutrality, demilitarization, and recognition of the new territorial reality on the ground. Last week, Trump also said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was easier to deal with than Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. Russian officials maintain they have always been ready to engage in peace talks, provided the discussions aim for a permanent solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict. Moscow has rejected any temporary agreement, explaining that it could be used by Kiev and its backers to rearm the Ukrainian military.",

    "article_text": "Media freedom is deteriorating in a number of EU countries, according to a recent report by the Civil Liberties Union for Europe (Liberties). The group has claimed that pluralism and freedom of speech are“under attack”as media companies become increasingly controlled by governments and wealthy owners. In the Media Freedom 2025report, the authors have outlined a range of pressures facing journalists and independent outlets, including legal and physical threats, declining ownership transparency, and political interference in public broadcasting. The group has warned that these factors have had a significant impact on the work of the media, limiting the diversity of opinions and the independence of publications, reducing public trust in content. Liberties has identified Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Croatia, France, Hungary, Slovakia and Spain as among the EU member states where the situation is most alarming. According to the report, public broadcasters in several of these countries are routinely manipulated by political interests, and legal protections for media workers remain weak or poorly enforced. The group also recorded at least 156 physical or verbal attacks on journalists in 2024, including cases of police intimidation and criminal defamation charges. In some states, the report notes, strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) are still being used to silence critical reporting, despite the EU’s recent efforts to curb their abuse. Liberties also noted that Russian and Belarusian journalists working in the bloc have repeatedly faced threats and harassment and become targets of spyware, raising concerns over their safety and what effect it could be having on their work. Earlier this month, Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported that the EU had denied its journalists accreditation for 2025, citing sanctions regulations. The outlet has appealed the decision, referencing the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and earlier EU statements that had assured journalistic activity would not be restricted. The rejection follows a broader crackdown on Russian media in the EU since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. The European Council has banned Russian outlets such as RT, Sputnik and RIA across the bloc. In its 16th sanctions package adopted this February, the bloc also added eight more Russian news outlets to the blacklist, including Lenta.ru and the Zvezda TV channel. Russian officials have repeatedly condemned the bans, arguing EU officials are afraid of people seeing a viewpoint that differs from the Western mainstream narrative and drawing their own conclusions about current events.",

    "title": "Argentina publishes files on notorious Nazi fugitives",
    "article_text": "The Argentinean government has made public almost 2,000 declassified secret service files on hundreds of Nazi war criminals who fled to the Latin American country after the Third Reich’s defeat in the Second World War. According to estimates, as many as 10,000 Nazis utilized so-called ‘ratlines’ to escape as the Axis powers collapsed. Infamously, around half of them are believed to have chosen Argentina –known for its reluctance to grant extradition requests — as their refuge. The 1,850 files uploaded online by the Argentinian National Archives (AGN) on Monday included intelligence reports, photographs, and police records. The documents on“Nazi activities in Argentina”are now available to all“thanks to extensive restoration and digitization work,”the AGN said in a statement. Among other things, the papers depict how the likes of Josef Mengele, Erich Priebke and Adolf Eichmann were able to make it to Argentina and what they did in the country. Mengele was a physician and Nazi SS officer, nicknamed the ‘Angel of Death’ for his inhumane medical experiments on prisoners at the Auschwitz concentration camp. The published records show he entered Argentina in 1949 under the name of Gregor Helmut and then openly lived in the country. “References obtained from different sectors of the German community allowed us to learn that he was commander of the Assault Guards and, at the same time, doctor in the German extermination camp of Auschwitz,”one of the files on Mengele read. The newly-published papers also included the 1995 extradition documents for Priebke, a mid-level SS commander, who had been in charge of a unit responsible for the massacre of 335 Italian civilians at the Ardeatine Caves outside Rome in 1944. They also shed light on the time that Eichmann, a high-ranking SS official often described as the logistics chief of the Holocaust, spent in Argentina. He was kidnapped in Buenos Aires in 1960 by Mossad agents and hanged for his crimes by Israel two years later. The files in question were declassified in 1992 under a decree from then-Argentine President Carlos Menem, but they could only be viewed in a specially designated room at the AGN. The country’s current leader Javier Milei ordered that the Nazi papers be released to the general public in March on a request from the US Jewish human rights organization, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which is currently investigating  links between Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, and Nazi Germany.",

    "article_text": "Hungary’s National Assembly has voted to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC), Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has announced. He described the institution as biased and discredited. The decision was passed with a more than two-thirds majority on Tuesday. “The Hungarian Parliament just voted to withdraw from the @IntlCrimCourt. With this decision, we refuse to be part of a politicized institution that has lost its impartiality and credibility,”Szijjartowroteon X. Earlier this month, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban accused the ICC of losing its impartiality and becoming a“political tribunal.”He announced his intention to end Budapest’s participation during a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Hungary. Last November, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as three figures in the Hamas leadership, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza. US President Donald Trump has sanctioned the ICC and its chief prosecutor Karim Khan for going after top Israeli officials. The US is not a party to the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty, and neither are China, Russia, and Israel, among others. In March of 2023, the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and children’s rights commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova over alleged unlawful deportation and transfer of children from former Ukrainian territories. Moscow has criticized the order as“null and void,”insisting that the children were evacuated from the front line for their own safety, and can be returned to their legal guardians upon request. The judicial body lacks the ability to enforce its warrants, and relies on member states to detain and transfer suspects. Hungary’s withdrawal requires notifying the UN Secretary-General, after which it will take effect one year later. Until then, Hungary remains obligated to cooperate with the ICC under the terms of the Rome Statute.",

    "title": "Ukraine could be ‘crushed very shortly’ – Trump",
    "article_text": "Ukraine could face a significant defeat in the near future if it does not sit down at the negotiating table with Russia, US President Donald Trump has warned. Trump made his comments in an interview with The Atlantic published on Monday. When asked whether he has sympathy for Kiev, the president replied by saying that his policy is aimed at“saving”Ukraine and warned that continued conflict would not bring the country any good. “I think I’m saving that nation. I think that nation will be crushed very shortly,”he said, adding that Russia has a“big war machine. Let’s face it.” Separately, US Vice President J.D. Vance also emphasized on Monday that Kiev would not win the conflict against Moscow.“If this doesn’t stop, the Ukrainians aren’t winning the war,”Vance, a US Marine Corps veteran, told Charlie Kirk. He also said it was“weird”to expect Russia to collapse because of the ongoing hostilities. The US has grown increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of negotiations between Washington, Moscow and Kiev. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned last week that the US could walk away from the talks altogether if the process stalls. Moscow has said it has always been ready to engage in peace talks, provided they ensure a permanent solution that addresses the root causes of the conflict. It opposed a proposal for a temporary ceasefire, pointing to past experience when Kiev and its Western backers used a hiatus to rearm the Ukrainian military. Last week, Trump himself also admitted that Russian President Vladimir Putin was easier to deal with than Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky.“I think Russia is ready… I think we have a deal with Russia. We have to get a deal with Zelensky,”Trump told journalists at the time. The Ukrainian leader had earlier publicly rejected a reported key point in the proposed US peace framework by refusing to consider recognizing Crimea as Russian territory. The Trump administration has been pushing for a resolution to the conflict  since he took office in early 2025. Washington is also seeking to secure a minerals extraction agreement with Kiev to help offset the billions of dollars the US had spent on military and financial assistance to Ukraine under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden.",

    "title": "Ukraine’s survival might cost it territory – Finnish president",
    "article_text": "Finnish President Alexander Stubb has suggested that Ukraine will have to make certain concessions to Russia in order to ensure its survival and continue receiving Western military support. Moscow has dismissed any resolution of the conflict that allows Ukraine to remain a threat. On Sunday, Stubb shared his thoughts with The New York Times on how to align US President Donald Trump more closely with the positions held by Kiev and Washington’s European NATO allies, as the White House seeks to mediate a compromise in the ongoing Ukraine conflict. He drew a historical parallel between Ukraine and Finland, which participated in Nazi Germany’s 1941 invasion of the USSR to reclaim territory it had lost in the Winter War earlier. As a result of being on the losing side, Finland faced military restrictions and observed neutrality during the Cold War. It formally joined NATO only in 2023, after years of military cooperation with the US-led alliance. Stubb reflected on the essence of statehood, comprising land, sovereignty, and independence. He noted that Finland lost two of these three elements in the 1940s, adding,“If we get at least two out of the three for Ukraine, I think it’s great.” Earlier this month, Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky publicly rejected American proposals reported in the media. Subsequently, Kiev and its European backers crafted a counteroffer for Trump’s consideration. Stubb suggested that the two plans should be“repackaged”into a viable proposal through“a little bit of creative writing.”If a ceasefire with Russia is achieved, Ukraine could be armed“to the teeth”by European NATO members, with a“backstop from the US,”he asserted. The current objective is to“maximize the pressure”on Russian President Vladimir Putin, Stubb added. Russia perceives the Ukraine conflict as a NATO proxy war led by a Western-backed“neo-Nazi regime”in Kiev. Moscow has repeatedly criticized the EU’s continued flow of armaments to Ukraine, arguing that Western European nations appear more interested in prolonging the fighting rather than resolving the conflict diplomatically.",

    "title": "Ukraine one of the world’s most corrupt countries – Trump adviser",
    "article_text": "US National Security Adviser Michael Waltz has called for proper oversight of the financial assistance Washington provides to Kiev. In a Monday interview with Fox News, the top state official called Ukraine one of the most corrupt nations in the world. The US Congress has authorized roughly $175 billion for Ukraine since 2022, although a significant portion of that funding has gone to American industries and government activities related to the conflict. Waltz’s comment comes days after US President Donald Trump held a face-to-face conversation with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican. “I will say Ukraine was one of, and is one of, the most corrupt countries in the world,”Waltz said, highlighting that Washington has to“always guard the taxpayer dollars.” The official also rebuked the administration of Trump’s predecessor for its failure to provide proper oversight of the way Kiev was spending the financial aid provided by the White House at the time. “We have to keep a hard eye on that, […] but secondly we have to find opportunities to end the war,”he said. Waltz, who had previously said that Washington must be reimbursed by Kiev for the“investments”it has made in the conflict, also accused the Ukrainian leader of intractability. He recalled the shouting match which took place at the White House earlier this year. “Rather than trying to correct the President of the US and the Vice President in the Oval Office when he was invited there for the first meeting, he could have sat side by side with the president, signing a minerals deal that bound our economies,”the adviser said. Washington and Kiev have been discussing a deal for weeks that would grant the US access to Ukraine’s deposits of rare-earth minerals. The Trump administration insists that the agreement should be used to compensate the US for past aid to Ukraine. Kiev, however, has maintained that the assistance was provided unconditionally. According to Germany’s Kiel Institute for the World Economy, as of October 2024, the US had provided Ukraine with approximately $92 billion in financial and military assistance. Meanwhile, the US-based Council on Foreign Relations estimated that Washington’s financial assistance to Kiev amounted to $195 billion as of April 2024, with $128 billion worth of the aid having gone straight to the government of Ukraine. Pentagon Inspector General Robert Storch reported last November that“corruption continues to complicate Ukraine’s efforts to achieve its EU and NATO aspirations,”particularly due to multiple scandals in the Defense Ministry.",

    "title": "Spain opens probe into major power grid failure",
    "article_text": "Spain has launched an investigation into this week’s widespread power outage to determine whether a cyberattack may have triggered the blackout that swept across almost the entire Iberian Peninsula. The Spanish government declared a state of emergency on Monday after a midday outage struck Spain and neighboring Portugal, also briefly affecting parts of France. The blackout left millions without electricity, causing disruption on roads and at airports. While power has mostly been restored, transport services remain affected. In a statement on Tuesday, Spain’s High Court said Judge Jose Luis Calama had ordered preliminary proceedings to assess whether the blackout was the result of cyber sabotage. The National Cryptologic Center, grid operator Red Electrica (REE), and the police have reportedly been instructed to submit reports within ten days detailing the causes of the outage and the events surrounding it. Calama said that although the cause was still unknown,“cyberterrorism is among the possible explanations.” REE said on Tuesday that a cyberattack had been ruled out in its initial assessment. System Operations Chief Eduardo Prieto told a news briefing it was possible that the disruption involved solar generation, but that it was too early to draw conclusions. Portugal’s grid operator, Redes Energeticas Nacionais (REN), earlier said that a“rare atmospheric phenomenon”over Spain, triggered by“extreme temperature variations,”may have caused the blackout. Spanish officials have yet to confirm the cause. On Monday evening, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said there was no conclusive information. Power has now been restored across almost all of Spain and Portugal, though both countries remain under states of emergency. On Tuesday morning, REE said electricity had been restored to 99% of Spain. The transport minister warned some trains, including high-speed rail services, would still run on reduced schedules. Experts say it might take weeks to determine the exact cause of the failure. Some have pointed to Spain’s increasing reliance on renewable energy, particularly solar power, as a potential factor. Sanchez rejected the claims.“Those linking the blackout to the lack of nuclear power are either lying or demonstrating their ignorance,”he said at a press briefing on Tuesday.",

    "title": "Israel insists ‘no chance’ of long-term truce with Hamas – media",
    "article_text": "Israel has rejected a proposed five-year ceasefire with Hamas, claiming that a long-term truce would allow the Palestinian group to rearm, according to multiple media reports citing Israeli officials. Egypt and Qatar have tried to mediate a ceasefire in Gaza. Israel broke the previous two-month truce in March by launching a new barrage of attacks on the enclave. The proposed new deal reportedly included the release of all remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza in exchange for a long-term cessation of hostilities. Hamas is said to have refused to lay down arms for as long as the Israeli occupation continues. “There is no chance that we will agree to a hudna with Hamas that just allows it to rearm, recover and to continue its war against Israel,”the official said, as cited by The Times of Israel.“Hudna”is an Arabic term that denotes a prolonged period between a ceasefire and a peace treaty, noted the news outlet. Israel has declared that its primary goal is the total disarmament and elimination of Hamas. Hamas’ founding charter calls for Israel’s destruction, but the movement has signaled that it might agree to a long-term truce in return for an end to occupation, noted Reuters. Earlier this month, the Palestinian group also said it wanted a comprehensive peace deal and that it would not accept any“partial”agreements. In response to Israel’s reported refusal to accept the long-term truce, a group representing the families of the hostages stated that“once again the ‘senior political source’ proves that the Israeli government has no plan”for the release of those still in captivity in Gaza. The Israeli authorities have reported that of the 59 hostages listed as remaining in the enclave, only 24 are thought to have survived. Dozens of others were previously released through ceasefire agreements or separate deals. Israeli forces have taken control of more than half of Gaza in a renewed offensive following the collapse of a ceasefire and the stalling of hostage negotiations in March. The IDF has resumed air strikes on the enclave in order to increase pressure on Hamas to release the remaining captives. The ongoing offensive in the enclave was triggered by the October 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, when the militants killed approximately 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. Since then, over 51,000 Palestinians have been killed amid the IDF military operation, according to Gazan health authorities. The humanitarian situation has deteriorated sharply since March due to an Israeli-imposed blockade, leading to severe shortages of food, medical supplies, and other essential resources.",

    "title": "UN must stand trial – Israel",
    "article_text": "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar has demanded that the United Nations and its refugee agency UNRWA face trial at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) instead of Israel. The UN top court began hearings on Monday on West Jerusalem’s role in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The ICJ hearings aim to examine whether Israel’s ban on UNRWA, the agency that provides food, education and medical care to the residents of Gaza, violates international law, including the UN Charter. Speaking at a news conference, Saar accused the UN of“double standards”and claimed that Israel had been subjected to“systematic persecution and delegitimization”by the international body. “I accuse UNRWA, I accuse the UN, I accuse the secretary general, and I accuse all those that weaponized international law”of depriving his country of“its most basic right to defend itself,”Saar said, stating that it’s“the UN and UNRWA that should be on trial today, not Israel.” The foreign minister went on to slam the New York-based institution as“a rotten, anti-Israel and antisemitic body.” The Israeli government has refused to take part in the hearings, which are scheduled to run for a week and will hear evidence from 40 states and four international organizations. A Palestinian representative told the court on Monday that Israel was killing and displacing civilians and targeting aid workers in Gaza. On Tuesday, a South African representative claimed that the“Palestinians are being subjected to atrocity, crimes, persecution, apartheid and genocide.” Israel designated UNRWA a“terrorist organization”and cut ties with the agency in November. It has also claimed many of its workers have engaged in terrorism in recent years, including taking part in the October 7 deadly attack by Hamas on southern Israel, which triggered the offensive into Gaza. While the UN has confirmed some individual cases and dismissed nine workers suspected of links to Hamas, it has rejected Israel’s broader allegations. The conflict in the enclave has resulted in over 51,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Most are reported to be civilians, including a significant number of women and children. The humanitarian situation has deteriorated sharply due to an Israeli-imposed blockade, leading to severe shortages of food, medical supplies, and other essential resources. International organizations have expressed grave concern over the crisis and its impact on the civilian population.",

    "title": "Think China is a ‘nation that can’t fight’? Think again",
    "article_text": "The internet is flooded with quotes attributed to Chinese philosophers. Who hasn’t seen a meme with a“Confucius”saying or heard of the so-called“ancient Chinese curse”about living in interesting times? In reality, 99% of these quotations are fake, reflecting Western projections of Chinese wisdom rather than its reality. Yet one saying –“good iron does not make nails; good men do not make soldiers”– is genuinely Chinese. Known since at least the Song Dynasty (late 10th – early 12th century), it remains in use today, much to the irritation of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) political officers. Globally, the proverb helped fuel a myth that China“never liked to fight”and“always lost wars.”Yet the absurdity of this view is clear if one simply looks at the world map today. Nevertheless, it persists – and now, as China becomes a true superpower, this misconception could have dangerous consequences for the world. To understand the proverb’s origin, we must look at the structure of the Song Dynasty's military. Early Chinese empires such as the Han relied on conscription, but over time, mercenary armies became the norm. Chronic shortages of volunteers were addressed by drafting criminals and debtors – turning armies into collections of society’s“undesirables.” Officers, by contrast, came from privileged classes who passed imperial military exams. These exams, though less prestigious than their civilian counterparts, still conferred status. But it is crucial to remember that the civil bureaucracy was tiny, making its officials extraordinarily powerful, while rank-and-file soldiers remained socially degraded. This pattern closely resembled Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries: a privileged officer corps and low-status, often criminal, enlisted men. Wellington’s remark in 1811 that“only men of the worst character enter the regular service”could have been said about China too. Military service was a punishment; soldiers were feared more for their misbehavior than admired for their valor. In that context, the“men and nails”proverb made perfect sense – and was hardly unique to China. The modern Western glorification of the soldier – tied to mass conscription, nationalism, and industrial militarism – only emerged in the 19th century. In China, where social and political backwardness lingered longer, this transformation began only in the 20th century with enormous difficulty. A regular, centrally commanded, professionally trained army – the PLA – was only created in the 1950s, after the Communist victory. Almost immediately, the PLA demonstrated its effectiveness by intervening in the Korean War, inflicting a series of defeats on UN forces and saving North Korea. The Soviet Union, by contrast, limited itself to sending small air and anti-aircraft units. In 1962, China launched a well-timed, surprise offensive against India, achieving a quick victory and territorial gains. Beijing struck while the world was distracted by the Cuban Missile Crisis. Throughout the 1960s, China also provided major military support to North Vietnam, at times deploying up to 170,000 troops – considerably more than the Soviet Union ever committed. In 1969, Beijing provoked and fought small border clashes with the USSR – a calculated show of strength aimed at achieving key foreign and domestic policy goals, including paving the way for rapprochement with the United States. The military component was minor; the political impact was enormous. Meanwhile, the PLA fought a prolonged counterinsurgency campaign in Tibet, defeating US- and Indian-backed guerrillas by the early 1970s. It also engaged in recurring military action against Taiwan, demonstrating clear superiority across the Taiwan Strait. In February 1979, China launched an invasion of Vietnam, a newly minted Soviet ally. This bold action risked conflict with a nuclear superpower. The campaign exposed PLA shortcomings but also demonstrated its resilience, willingness to absorb heavy casualties, and ability to carry out major offensives. While Vietnam held out thanks to Soviet military threats against China, Beijing’s ability to act – and to compel both Moscow and Washington to recalibrate their policies – was a major achievement. The Sino-Vietnamese conflict evolved into a decade-long border war marked by artillery duels, naval clashes, and raids, culminating in China’s decisive naval victory in the Spratly Islands in 1988. Comparing China’s record from 1949-1989 to the Soviet Union’s reveals a striking fact: China used military force more frequently, and arguably more effectively, than the USSR during the Cold War. After Mao’s death, the PLA underwent profound modernization, both politically and socially. Military service gained prestige. During the Cultural Revolution, the army became a pillar of governance and society. Yet, China’s foreign policy turned defensive from the 1990s onward – not from weakness, but from strategic calculation. After the Soviet collapse, China faced a unipolar world dominated by the United States. Survival and development required patience. Beijing avoided major military engagements for nearly 30 years, instead focusing on economic and technological breakthroughs. Shows of force were reserved for defending“core interests,”such as during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis. By the late 2010s, the global environment had changed. American dominance weakened. The unipolar order eroded. China’s rise, both economic and military, became undeniable. Beijing’s gradual reassertion of military power has been cautious but unmistakable: expanding operational reach, forging military partnerships, and conducting exercises in potential conflict zones. The myth of Chinese military incompetence is not only historically false; it is potentially catastrophic. In the past, underestimating China’s capabilities led adversaries to miscalculate – to their great cost. Today, as China carefully prepares for its first major combat operations in decades, its adversaries would do well to shed illusions and study history more carefully. Beijing will not rush into war. It will act only under conditions it judges favorable and under circumstances it has painstakingly prepared. But make no mistake: when it acts, China will not be the passive, incompetent power that outdated stereotypes imagine.

    "article_text": "The US Navy has lost an F/A-18E Super Hornet fighter jet and a tow tractor after both fell overboard from the USS Harry S. Truman. The aircraft carrier, part of Washington’s strike group in the Red Sea, was reportedly maneuvering to evade a missile attack from Yemen-based Houthis. The incident occurred on Monday in the Red Sea, where the Truman Carrier Strike Group is launching bombing raids against the Yemeni rebel group. While the Navy reported that one sailor had sustained a minor injury, it did not mention a Houthi threat. However, multiple news outlets have since cited anonymous sources linking the incident to a rebel attack. On the same day, the Houthis claimed to have launched drones and missiles targeting American forces. The US is bombing the Houthis in retaliation for their threats to navigation in the Red Sea, targeting vessels they associate with Israel. The Houthis’ claim they are responding to Israel’s destruction of Gaza, which was ignited by a deadly raid conducted by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in October 2023. Despite their imposing size, Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, measuring 333 meters in length, can execute sharp maneuvers when necessary to swiftly reposition against enemy fire. A former Navy captain informed CNN that their flight decks can tilt as much as 15 degrees during such positioning. Here's what aircraft carrier evasive maneuvers look like...pic.twitter.com/7wZVk7klIn Last December, the guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg inadvertentlyshot downan F/A-18 fighter jet that had just taken off from the USS Truman for a bombing sortie in Yemen. While both pilots were subsequently rescued reportsindicatedthat a second aircraft was also at risk during the same incident. An F/A-18 warplane costs between $60 million and $70 million, depending on its configuration, according to Pentagon figures. In February, the USS Harry S.

    "article_text": "Western European leaders are waging a“quiet war”against US President Donald Trump, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has claimed. Washington’s current tariffs standoff and disagreements on NATO spending with the EU and UK is not only an economic but also an ideological conflict, Medvedev, who currently serves as the deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, said on Tuesday. “I have no doubt that [Western] Europe will be put in its place [by the US], but at the same time the Europeans will continue their quiet war against Trump. They will try to wage a war against him on all possible fronts, observing the rules of decency on the outside. What will come of it – we will see,”he stated. The tensions between Washington on one side and the EU and UK on the other are explained by the fact that“in [Western] Europe, neo-globalist forces are still in power, trying to pursue the previous course, including the course against our country... But in the US, other forces have taken the reins. These are conservative, more traditionalist forces that want to calm the situation and, in a certain sense, achieve reconciliation with Russia,”the former president said at the ‘Knowledge. First’ educational event in Moscow. “One does not need to be a prophet\"to predict that the US will likely prevail against Western Europe, he stressed. “It will happen because the American economy is much stronger than the European one, despite the fact that the latter is also a huge economy. Nevertheless, it is still a segmented conglomerate of countries, even with the existence of the EU. And I am not even talking about the fact that an overwhelming majority of military forces and armaments are concentrated in the US,”Medvedev explained.",

    "title": "Most Americans disapprove of Musk’s DOGE performance – poll",
    "article_text": "The majority of Americans disapprove of Elon Musk’s performance of his role within the US government, according to a new poll conducted by ABC News, the Washington Post, and Ipsos. Musk recently announced plans to scale back his involvement as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Of the respondents, 57% said they disapprove of Musk’s job performance in the administration led by Donald Trump, while 35% said they approve of what has been done so far, ABC News reported on Monday. The outlet noted that opposition to the administration’s efforts to shrink the federal government – spearheaded by DOGE – is a key driver of the negative ratings. In recent months, the White House, through DOGE, has implemented widespread federal spending cuts. Under the department, which was established by Trump shortly after taking office in January, roughly 280,000 federal employees have reportedly been laid off in an effort to balance the US federal budget. Earlier this month, thousands of Americans took to the streets across the country to protest what they described as an“illegal power grab”and“coup”by Trump and Musk, claiming that the economic and social policies enacted by the president and his ally have plunged the country into a full-blown crisis. Last week, Musk stated he would scale back his involvement as head of DOGE and refocus on his business interests, saying that the“major work”to establish the department had been completed. The world’s richest man clarified, however, that he has no plans to step away from government work entirely, and that he would still devote“a day or two per week to government matters.” Musk’s role as a special government employee is expected to conclude by late May. After that, he is expected to return his focus to his private ventures, which include Tesla, the rocket company SpaceX, and the social media platform X, among others.",

    "title": "Trump rules out third term",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has ruled out seeking a third term, despite previously hinting at the possibility on multiple occasions. In an interview with The Atlantic, published on Monday and marking his first 100 days in office, Trump was asked about a rumor that he had directed the US Justice Department to examine whether it would be legal for him to run again in 2028, when he will turn 82. He stated that he had not done so but appeared to leave the possibility open, suggesting that he might be reluctant to break the democratic norm. “That would be a big shattering, wouldn’t it?”He mused.“Well, maybe I’m just trying to shatter.” Trump pointed out that his supporters had often urged him to run for a third term, but that he ultimately dismissed the idea, insisting that he has had no actual plans to stay in office beyond his second term. “It’s not something that I’m looking to do. And I think it would be a very hard thing to do.” However, profiting from the idea appears to be a feasible option. Earlier this month, the US president launched a new line of“TRUMP 2028”merchandise, driving speculation about a possible third-term bid. The official campaign store offers baseball caps and T-shirts, featuring“TRUMP 2028”and the slogan“Rewrite the Rules,”echoing the style of his iconic“Make America Great Again”branding. Last month, Trump said he is“not joking”about potentially seeking a third term, claiming that there are“methods”to pursue another run despite the US Constitution’s two-term limit on the presidency. His comments fueled fears that he might attempt to overhaul the country’s electoral system in order to remain in power, though several high-profile Republicans dismissed the idea as little more than a joke. Earlier this year, Republican Congressman Andy Ogles introduced a constitutional amendment that would allow presidents to serve three non-consecutive terms, though it has so far gained little traction.",

    "title": "EU fears Trump will quit Ukraine – FT",
    "article_text": "EU officials are worried that US President Donald Trump could be on the verge of abandoning his efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine conflict, the Financial Times has reported. During his election campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to swiftly put an end to the fighting between Moscow and Kiev. However, after the first 100 days of his second term in the White House he has not been able to get the two sides to engage in direct talks with each other or agree to a full 30-day ceasefire proposed by Washington. Russia’s reluctance to give in to key demands by the US and Ukraine and the overall“complexity of the conflict”have made Trump rethink his commitment to the peace process, the FT reported on Monday, citing unnamed Western European officials. One official suggested that Trump was“setting up a situation where he gives himself excuses to walk away and leave it to Ukraine and us [EU] to fix.” Another source, who is said to have been briefed on the discussions, claimed that US officials are“getting concerned that they are really coming back with nothing in talks with Russia”and have begun floating ideas for a deal that would fit into Trump’s quick timeline for achieving peace. The US president’s“impatience”when it comes to ending the conflict is a“problem,”the source added. A senior Ukrainian official also told the FT he believes there is a“serious possibility”that Washington could abandon Kiev. Trump said on Sunday that he wants a deal between Russia and Ukraine to be achieved within“two weeks or less.”US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned at the weekend that the US could disengage from the peace process if it does not see rapid progress in discussions. Washington is now trying to make a“determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in,”Rubio told NBC News’ Meet the Press. Russian officials have said on numerous occasions that Moscow is ready to begin talks with Kiev without any preconditions. However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted on Monday that so far Russia has not seen any steps from Ukraine that would signal its eagerness to start negotiating.",

    "title": "Anti-Trump Liberals win elections in Canada",
    "article_text": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberals are projected to form their fourth consecutive government following victory in the country’s federal election, according to CBC Decision Desk and CTV News. Carney centered his campaign on attacking US President Donald Trump over tariffs and the foreign leader’s suggestion that Canada could become America’s“51st state.” According to CTV, preliminary results from the snap election show the Liberals winning 89 seats in the House of Commons, while the Conservatives are projected to win 77. A total of 172 seats is required to form a majority government. The elections were called after Justin Trudeau, the Liberal prime minister for nearly a decade, announced his resignation in January. Trudeau stepped down amid an internal crisis in his party, as his once-high approval ratings sank to historic lows. Carney, a former financier who served as governor of both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, used tough language to rebuke Trump’s“unjustified”tariffs on Canadian goods.“His strategy is to break us so America can own us,”Carney said at a campaign event in the weeks leading up to the election. In his victory speech, Carney said he will deal with Trump in“full knowledge that we have many, many other options to build prosperity for all Canadians,”and pledged to maintain national independence. In early March, Trump imposed a 25% tariff on most Canadian goods, citing concerns over trade imbalances and drug trafficking. Ottawa responded by introducing its own duties on US-made products. Trump also argued that Canada would be better off as“the 51st state”of the US, provoking ire across the political spectrum in the run-up to elections. Carney stated that during their phone call, he made it clear to Trump that Canada would, under no circumstances, become part of the US.“Absolutely not. Never. Move on,”he said. Multiple media outlets argued that Trump’s tariffs and aggressive rhetoric had helped boost the Liberals’ popularity.“We were dead and buried in December. Now, we’re on track to form a government,”David Lametti, former Liberal Justice Minister, told CTV on Monday.“We’ve turned this around thanks to Mark,”he added.",

    "title": "Russia-Ukraine ceasefire could ‘return peace to Europe’ – de Gaulle’s grandson",
    "article_text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposed Victory Day ceasefire next month could pave the way to peace between Russia and Ukraine, Charles de Gaulle’s grandson Pierre has told RT. Pierre de Gaulle made his remarks after Putin announced that Russian troops will observe a truce from May 8 through May 10, as their country commemorates the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II on May 9. “The Russians are a peaceful people. Russia doesn’t want war. Russia wants peace,”de Gaulle told RT on Monday, welcoming the ceasefire announcement.“I think it’s a very strong symbol, as we celebrate the end of the Second World War,”he said. “We’re also celebrating, I hope, the return of peace to Ukraine and the return of peace to Europe – a peace in which I would have hoped France could play a role.” He argued that the current government in Paris was making“decisions contrary to common sense and reason.” “But I hope that, in the long term, we can once again celebrate the Franco-Russian friendship – which is what my grandfather always wanted,”he said, adding that both nations would benefit from closer ties. After leading the French resistance against Nazi occupation during World War II, Charles de Gaulle founded the modern French political system and served as president from 1959 until 1969. In his statement on Monday, Putin urged Ukraine to honor the ceasefire, warning that Russian troops would“give a proportionate and efficient response”to any violations. Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky responded by accusing Moscow of“manipulation”and called for an immediate 30-day ceasefire. According to Russia, Ukraine violated both the 30-day ‘energy truce’ brokered by the US last month and the 30-hour Easter truce, despite having promised to respect both arrangements. Putin has argued that in order for a comprehensive ceasefire to succeed, Kiev must halt its mobilization campaign and the West must stop delivering it weapons.",

    "article_text": "Sport Sport JEDDAH :Defender Roger Ibanez said Al-Ahli's players were fully behind head coach Matthias Jaissle after the Jeddah-based side reached the final of the Asian Champions League Elite on Tuesday, three months after the German was widely expected to be sacked. The 37-year-old was believed to be on his way out of the club in January after a string of disappointing results in the Saudi Pro League, with former Juventus boss Max Allegri reported to be lined up as his replacement. But protests by influential fan groups earned Jaissle a reprieve and the former Red Bull Salzburg coach is now one win from guiding Al-Ahli to their first-ever Asian title after handing Al-Hilal a 3-1 semi-final defeat. \"I think the coach has great support from us, the players,\" said Ibanez following his man-of-the-match performance against the four-times continental champions.

    "title": "7 Best Cooling Blankets to Stop Waking Up in a Pool of Sweat",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If yousleep hot, you know the hell ofwaking up at 3 a.m., sweaty and angry, kicking off your covers in a rage. Thankfully, the best cooling blankets can actually provide real relief andquality sleep. They’re lighter, better at regulating body temperature, and in some cases, genuinely cold to the touch. When you’re shopping for a cooling blanket, you’ll usually have two choices:High-tech optionsthat feel icy but take some getting used to, or lightweight blankets made from natural or plant-based fibers that feel more like a normal comforter but breathe easier. I tested a ton of options—risking my ownsleeping temperature(and layering a few on top of each other, in the name of journalism)—to find the best cooling blankets forhot sleepers, sweaty couples, and anyone dreaming of that crisp, cool-bed feeling year-round. You’re welcome. Rest Rest Material:Proprietary Evercool fabric, Tencel, Sorona Sizes:Twin/Twin XL, Full/Queen, King/Cali King Colors:6 There’s absolutely no contest: The Rest Evercool is the best cooling comforter on the market right now. The material is ultra-smooth, lightweight, and engineered to feel cold against the skin without ever feeling clammy. There have been moments when my fan is on blast and I’m bundled up in this blanket and I feel legitimatelycoldin the summer (something that used to feel impossible). But all other times, it just keeps my body nicely chill and prevents mid-night sweats. Even after a night of sleep, you can still shift the blanket and find the icy cool sensation all over again. I layer it under my duvet because I don’t love the way it looks on my bed (it lays flat compared to a regular comforter because it’s all drape and no loft), but this way I get the coziness of a normal comforter with the cool-to-the-touch magic right next to my skin. Some may not love the slinky, almost athletic-feeling texture, but if you’re serious about cooling power, nothing else comes close. Buffy Buffy Material:Lyocell Sizes:Twin/Twin XL, Full/Queen, King/Cali King Colors:9 If you want your bed to still look plush and appealing, the Buffy Cloud Comforter is your best bet. It’s technically a comforter, not just a blanket, and has a lightweight, quilted design that is breathable without sacrificing that cloud-like loft. That said, it got hotter faster when I was sharing the bed compared to some of the more technical fabrics on this list. Still, if you don’t want to give up coziness, texture, or aesthetics—and you sleep solo or only run moderately warm—it’s a strong option. Brooklinen Brooklinen Material:Turkish Cotton Sizes:Twin/Twin XL, Full/Queen, King/Cali King Colors:8 Brooklinen’s Dreamweave Waffle Blanket doesn’t have fancy phase-change cooling tech baked in, but it doesn’t really need it. The airy, waffle-weave Turkish cotton creates a natural breathability that kept me feeling crisp all night long during testing. It’s lightweight but still substantial enough that you don’t feel like you’re sleeping under a flimsy sheet. And unlike the slippery feeling of some synthetic cooling blankets, this one feels cozy, substantial, and classic—perfect if you want something that feels a little more traditional. Plus, it looks fantastic whether you cover your entire bed or use it as a throw and comes in rich, neutral colors. Cozy Earth Cozy Earth Material:Viscose from bamboo Sizes:Twin, Full/Queen, King Colors:13 If you’re in a committed relationship with your current comforter but hate waking up sweaty, a cooling duvet cover might be the smarter swap. Cozy Earth’s bamboo duvet cover doesn’t feel icy cold to the touch, but it breathes ridiculously well and helps regulate temperature better than most covers I’ve tested. I layered it on the Buffy Cloud Comforter (listed above) to create the dreamiest sleep system. The result? I now sleep through the night without doing the classic sweaty-limb escape move. Plus, it’s incredibly soft, has a nice sheen to it, and drapes nicely on the bed. Elegear Elegear Material:Mica Nylon, polyethylene Sizes:Throw, Twin, Queen, King Colors:7 The Elegear doesn’t perform at the level of the Rest Evercool (not even close), but for around $100 less, it’s a decent upgrade from whatever’s currently making you sweat. The ultra-thin material feels cool at first touch but tends to trap heat a bit faster as the night goes on, especially if you run hot. (I layered it under my regular comforter and tossed it off after a few hours—you might have better luck if you can bear the thought of sleeping with just a thin sheet.) Aesthetically, the slightly shiny, heathered material gives off college dorm vibes more than grown-up bedding energy. But if you want a cooling blanket that feels somewhat cool without spending big, it’s worth considering. Still, I’d chalk up the extra $100 for the Rest if possible. Breescape Breescape If you want a backup plan when the Rest Evercool is out of stock—or just can’t justify the non-sale price—the Breescape is a solid alternative. The main side feels very similar to the Rest: smooth, cold, and a little stretchy. The reverse side is softer and more cotton-like, but doesn’t have the same intense cooling effect. If you can live with the less dramatic chill (and the more limited color palette), it’s a respectable option that still offers legit temperature relief. Sleep Number Sleep Number While I haven’t personally slept with this blanket, I have worn clothing made with the same 37.5 Technology fibers it uses—and the tech is legit. The material is designed to actively pull heat and moisture away from your body, helping maintain a consistent, comfortable temperature throughout the night. Not exactly cooling, but more temperature-regulating at either extreme. If you tend to run hot and cold—or share a bed with someone who does—the True Temp blanket could be a smart upgrade at a decent price. It feels more like a classic, substantial blanket than some of the slinkier cooling options, and is pretty luxurious with a 300-thread-count cover. Do cooling blankets really work? Yes—if you pick the right one. Cooling blankets use either breathable natural fabrics or active cooling technologies to help regulate your body temperature. Some genuinely feel cold to the touch (like Rest Evercool), while others just stop you from overheating by letting heat escape more easily (like Brooklinen’s Dreamweave Bed Blanket.) What’s the difference between a cooling blanket and a regular lightweight blanket? A lightweight blanket might feel cooler simply because it’s thinner, but a real cooling blanket is designed with materials that either absorb, disperse, or block body heat. How do you wash a cooling blanket? Most cooling blankets are machine washable, but always check the label. Some technical fabrics need gentle cycles and air-drying to preserve their cooling properties. It’s also best to avoid high heat when drying. I personally tested a ton of these options to find the best cooling blankets for hot sleepers, sweaty couples, and anyone dreaming of that crisp, cool-bed feeling. We also scoured the web and our personal network of product testers to get their takes, cross-referencing anecdotal evidence with crowdsourced reviews to narrow our scope. We factored in everything from performance and feel to price points, looks, and more.",

    "title": "How Buck Mason Became America’s Next Great Everyman Brand",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Every great brand needs a great origin story. Levi Strauss peddled his riveted trousers to gold prospectors in the 1870s; Phil Knight paid $35 for the Nike swoosh logo in 1971. The Buck Mason mythology begins with co-founders Erik Allen Ford and Sasha Koehn obsessively tinkering with the design oftheir first T-shirtin a garage in Venice, California, going through more than 50 iterations to get every detail exactly right. A little more than a decade later, Ford and Koehn preside over a growing empire of classic American menswear, with dozens of retail stores across the country, a 200-piece catalog ranging from sweats to suiting, and a broad following of discerning dudes who sing its praises. It takes a lot of nerve (and maybe a touch of delusion) to devote years of your career—along with a substantial amount of your savings—to improving something as ubiquitous as awhite T-shirtorblue jeans. Such is Ford and Koehn’s fanatical devotion to the foundational elements of the 20th-century American wardrobe, and their belief in, as Charles Eames put it, \"Getting the most of the best to the greatest number of people for the least.\" While Buck Mason’s origin story makes for a charming anecdote about scrappiness and determination, it’s also the key to understanding how the brand has gone from upstartShark Tankcontestant to one of the best sources of deeply stylish, well-made, fairly-priced menswear in America. “The biggest lesson we learned was the importance of refinement,” Koehn says. “Perfection is achieved incrementally, and you can’t rush it.” Ford and Koehn grew up in the midwest (Missouri and Ohio, respectively), and neither has a conventional background in fashion. What they share, however, is an abiding love of old-school craftsmanship, mid-century design, and the rugged wardrobes that made guys like Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, and Marlon Brando style icons. “There’s a simplicity and durability in the clothing from the 1940s and 1950s that we truly admire,” Koehn says. Rather than simply recreating the look of these garments, Ford and Koehn’s approach to design involves a painstaking process of reverse engineering, from studying the way vintage fabrics were woven to replicating the bygone production techniques that helped them stand the test of time. “When you spend years poring over vintage references, you get hooked on the little things,” Ford says, explaining how the brand’s Welterweight sweats incorporate old-school construction techniques like seams reinforced with flatlock stitching and flexible ribbed gussets at high-stress points. “When function precedes form, it’s hard to go wrong”. When Ford and Koehn set out to create Buck Mason’s first pair of jeans, they started by pulling vintage pieces from their extensive personal collections, deconstructing them to analyze everything from the size and shape of the J-stitch over the fly and the type of stitches that secure the waistband, to the different styles of overlock stitching used on edges and hems. “Every detail affects how a pair of jeans ages over time, from the way they wash to how the whiskers develop within,” Koehn explains. “We wanted to create jeans that didn’t just look like our favorite vintage references, but actuallyworelike them, too.” Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Combining the attention to detail usually found in niche, higher-end labels with the accessibility of a mall brand has helped Buck Mason gain a loyal following, from guys who live in jeans and tees to card-carrying members of the menswear Illuminati. Part of the appeal is a strong and consistent aesthetic vision, explainsJake Woolf, a longtimeGQcontributor who now writes on Substack. “I think Buck Mason's popularity stems from the fact that they've cultivated a strong POV about their version of a high-quality, classic menswear wardrobe, but they've also maintained a vibe that's completely un-fussy,” he says. “It’s like, yeah, they do really great workwear, but nothing in the range is overly distressed or feels expensive just for the sake of it.” Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason The other side of this coin, and one that appeals as much to die-hard menswear nerds as guys who are just starting to build out their closets, is the fact that pretty much everything goes with everything else. “I appreciate that Buck Mason’s design ethos isn’t overly trend-driven, which means their pieces can be worn season after season without feeling dated,” saysTurner Allen, an NYC-based personal stylist. “Their color palette leans heavily into neutrals, which makes layering and mixing incredibly straightforward. It takes a lot of the guesswork out of building a cohesive wardrobe.” Buck Mason’s ability to nail the cross-section of style, quality, and affordability has been instrumental to its success, but it’s also managed to maintain the balance while growing exponentially over the past decade. Plenty of fashion brands with strong concepts and the best of intentions eventually run into a hard wall of uneven balance sheets and impatient investors. The sacrifices to quality and vision that ensue have defeated many a designer—and helped to create a retail landscape dominated by fast fashion and luxury,with little in between. For the rare brands that can thread the needle, though, Buck Mason has proven that staying the course pays off. “We were fortunate to be able to fund the business primarily through our own savings and some early investors who shared our vision,” Koehn says. “We worked for so many years with such little capital,” Ford adds, “that when we finally were able to raise money, we just declined it, because we liked running the business in a more instinctive way.” Despite this incremental approach to growth, the brand has been making big moves in recent years, rolling out a steady stream of collaborations with household names likeEddie BauerandLee, along with niche labels like Moonstar and Brycelands. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason In 2023, Buck Mason bought a shuttered sewing factory and cloth mill in Mohnton, Pennsylvania, where it now makes its best-selling Pima, Toughknit, and Slub tees, as well as the brand’s Toughknit waffle-knit thermals. “Eastern Pennsylvania was once an epicenter of American knitwear, and we’ve been able to mix the knowledge we scraped together roaming downtown Los Angeles with a completely different, but equally qualitative perspective out of Eastern Pennsylvania,” explains Ford. “Now, we’re making tees the old way in the same region of the country where some of the best were made during the heyday of American knitwear.” The same year that Buck Mason bought the Mohnton factory, the brand tappedNYC tailor Jake Mueserto help make its grandentree to tailoring. The result of the mind-meld, a suit that combines the casual, unstructured feel of Neapolitan tailoring with style cues from the Ivy League campuses of the ‘60s, has since become a staple of the Buck Mason catalog—and a formidable alternative to go-tos from the likes of J.Crew and Ralph Lauren. “Kind of surprised by how good Buck Mason has gotten in the last few years seemingly on the strength of them hiring some menswear nerds and taking their advice,”quipped Derek Guy, a.k.a. Twitter’s@dieworkwear, in a 2024 post. Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason The brand now operates more than 30 retail locations, with collections for men and women, and a constantly evolving range of products, including a recent collaboration with storied American shoemaker G.H. Bass. To create its own take on theclassic Larson Weejuns penny loafer—a prep staple since 1936—Buck Mason’s design team swapped the conventional polished cowhide for a higher-grade black leather with a matte finish, a subtle move that lends the final product a decidedlyWest Coast vibe. The loafers didn’t require 50 revisions to get right, but they tick all the boxes of provenance, craftsmanship, and style now distinct to the Buck Mason canon. “The consistent thread is history,” says Ford. “What are the greatest products that have ever been made and how can they be made better?” Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason Buck Mason",

You might find the best aroma to wear in the office an obvious choice, but afragranceto unlock the passions of your partner—or potential partner—is an entirely different prospect. Though you can obviously wear whatever you personally like most, a quality date night fragrance tends to require subtlety, sophistication, and no small dose of seduction. Dates are all about first impressions, but overpower the nose with too much and you risk souring the experience and striking out. Ultimately, you'll need to finesse your selection to find ascentthat complements your personality and adds that hint of mystery to win over your prospective date instantly. Tough, right? But don't fear, as we've got a fragrance expert on hand to help you own your next date and come out smelling of roses. Adrian Clarke—a long-time contributor toGQ's with a burgeoning collection of fragrance guides for all occasions—has selected his five favorite fragrances for seduction. From Tom Ford's masculine and sultry Black Orchid to Dior's heady Sauvage Elixir, these are the ultimate date night fragrances for men. Tom Ford Tom Ford Tom Ford Black Orchid When Tom Ford launched his first eponymous fragrance for women, few could have anticipated (me included) that it would also, unexpectedly, become a smash hit with men. Long-lasting, luxurious, and profusely sensual, its capacity to speak to multiple genders is testament to its enduring allure. Composed in collaboration with perfumers David Apel and Pierre Negrin, Ford used the “idea” of a black orchid (which, for the record, doesn’t exist) to inspire the opulent tour de force. In Tom’s words, “nothing is more desirable than the unattainable.” A heady mix of decadent noir accords, intoxicating florals, and a hint of spice, it opens with a unique truffle note wrapped in ylang ylang, blackcurrant, fresh bergamot, mandarin, and Amalfi lemon. With a heart of gardenia, jasmine, lotus wood, and rich fruit notes, the base is a tantalizing blend of Mexican chocolate, patchouli, vanilla, incense, amber, sandalwood, vetiver and white musk. A timeless and sophisticated chypre scent that defined the 2000s, it continues to be the secret weapon in my fragrance arsenal to this very day. Givenchy Macy's Givenchy Gentleman Society Eau de Parfum Ambrée This elegant, but audacious, masculine scent draws inspiration from the flamboyant quirks of creator Hubert de Givenchy’s personality; an olfactory peacock that’s full of roguish charisma and charm. Commemorating the 50-year anniversary of the original Givenchy Gentleman (Hubert’s first eponymous scent for men), it opens a new resinous, amber-filled, spicy, and warming chapter in the Gentleman Society fragrance franchise; essentially, it's been made to be worn after dark. Woody, textured and formulated by renowned perfumer Karine Dubreuil Sereni, it is, in my opinion, the best Gentleman Society spin-off to date. Constructed around the unique narcissus absolute and quartet of four different types of vetiver—Gentleman Society's signature note—the base is rich and spicy with Peruvian balsam and Madagascan vanilla of an exceptional quality, used by Givenchy for the first time. Uplifted with head winds of nutmeg, juniper berries, and clary sage and a smoky trail of leather, tobacco, and Australian sandalwood. Yves Saint Laurent Yves Saint Laurent Yves Saint Laurent Le Vestiaire des Parfums Muse edp Le Vestiaire des Parfums is YSL’s haute parfumerie fragrance collection; inspired by emblematic pieces and high-end materials from monsieur Saint Laurent’s rich fashion archive. Pricier than the more commercial YSL scents, they represent the pinnacle of the house’s olfactive artistry. This new addition to the line is a very evocative scent; a woody/floral/musk that feels very intimate. It’s essentially what the fragrance trade calls a “skin” perfume; meaning it has a musky sensuality that is a bit animalic. The perfect first-date fragrance, it’s defiantly elegant with a subtle smokiness which is quite sexy. Created by principal perfumer Marie Salamagne, who was inspired by ink sketches Yves made of his friends, models, and muses, the scent is based around a unique woody ink note, which has been softened up with orris (iris) and sensual bourbon vanilla. Its aromatic blend of lavender, incense, and clary sage leaves a distinctive and memorable impression. Lucius Lucius Fragrance Du Bois Lucius parfum Created for the modern champion and embodying invincibility, Lucius is the first male-focused fragrance from this (usually non-gender-specific) niche perfumery brand. Powerful, bold and commanding great attention, it doubles down on masculinity; a modern perfume with an old (traditional) soul. A specialist in using oud, Fragrance Du Bois, is celebrated for its punchy scents, but this one operates on a whole new level. It brings the intensity but doesn’t overwhelm, it’s the perfect date night wingman. Highly concentrated as a perfume, it also keeps on keeping on, into the early hours. When you first apply it, the scent crackles with pink pepper, mandarin, and sunny bergamot, which instantly boosts your fearless determination. The dry-down of orange flower, robust cedarwood, dry amber, and tonka bean takes you somewhere else; a safe place full of confidence and reassurance. Vetiver grounds the scent with earthy depth and leaves a sophisticated, lasting impression. Dior Dior Dior Sauvage Elixir Formulated with an unprecedented concentration unseen in the world of haute-perfumery, Sauvage Elixir is an intoxicating fragrance of unparalleled strength and potency. Blended by Dior’s master perfumer, François Demachy, the method taken to intensify this reformulation was to increase the “volume” but reduce the “orchestra.” In other words, supercharge the key ingredients of the original Sauvage and streamline the rest of the structure; Sauvage on steroids, kinda. It's a surprising scent that is striking and explorative; it hits you like downing a strong shot of liquor. Demarchy reinterpreted the iconic freshness of the original Sauvage with a tailor-made lavender (a perfume in its own right, really) that has fresh notes of hay and vanilla. The base bellows with sandalwood, amber, patchouli, and Haitian vetiver. Sparkling with citrus grapefruit, spiced with cinnamon, nutmeg, and cardamom—and spiked with a liquor-like Martinican rum absolute—for me, it's the perfect seducer. The best date night fragrances are a very personal choice. Your personality and general vibe can only be scent-matched when you test out these fragrances yourself, but we can certainly guide you towards the ultimate scent that's going to win compliments, fill you with confidence, and get the right reaction from the right people.Adrian Clarke, fragrance expert and long-timeGQwriter, has spent years testing the best masculine fragrances to give us this curated list of the ultimate date night scents.

    "title": "9 Best Underwear for Working Out in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you're not wearing the best underwear for working out while, well,working out, then you know what a literal pain in the ass it can be. Your everydayunderwearjust can't withstand all the sweat and movement: hence the wedgies, the swamp crotch, and every other bad thing that can happen below the waistband. If you've been struggling to hit a newsquatPR or if yourmile time'sstill far away from what you're aiming for, there's a big chance it's probably because you're wearing the wrong underwear (or you still have some extra training to do). Below, the best underwear for working out so that you can finally start training like you mean it. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Material: 91% Modal, 9% SpandexSizes: XS to 2XL When it comes to workout gear, Ten Thousand is a brand to know. From shirts to shorts, the brand's tough-as-nails workout apparel can handle any and every workout with ease so that you can do the heavy lifting without worrying about your fit. And its underwear? Well, let's just say it'd be disappointing if everything the brand made did wellexceptits undies. The A—L boxers perfectly teeter the line between supportive boxer briefs and compression liners—they're tight but not too tight where your balls are screaming for room. Its no-bunch waistband stays put so it's not digging into your skin as you're mid hip hinge and the front pouch cups your junk with dual layers for full coverage (i.e. no peekaboos here). They're designed to be stink-free thanks to silver ion technology, and the modal construction feels slick and smooth against the skin. Mack Weldon Mack Weldon Material: 50% Polyamide, 33% Polyester, 17% ElastaneSizes: S to 2XL If you're more of a briefs person, Mack Weldon's have you covered (literally). Its AIRKNIT material is cooling and soft to the touch for comfort, while being moisture-wicking and anti-odor. It's basically the perfect underwear for anyone who sweats with even the slightest movement. These lightweight briefs offer a barely there feel with a lay-flat waistband that won't disrupt your flow. Plus, targeted cool zones offer the breathability that you've been so desperately dying for so you can finally stop peeling off your underwear post-workout like it's a second skin. Lululemon Lululemon Material: 91% Modal,9% ElastaneSizes: XS to 2XL We love to razz Lululemon for its move to make clothes you can wear outside of the gym (c'mon, anactivewear suit?), but at its core, the brand does know how to do performance-wear well. Its Always In Motion boxers are the underwear you'd want to pair with those stretchy athleisure shorts. The majority-modal construction makes them sleek and smooth, but also breathable and quick-drying. The four-way stretch makes these perform especially well with any type of exercise that requires a bit, or a lot, of flexibility—yoga, pilates, barre. We'd recommend these for anyone who prefers briefs with a longer inseam, but if you like the idea of these but want something shorter, they also come in three-inch and five-inch options. Skims Skims Material: 72% Polyamide, 28% ElastaneSizes: XS to 5XL WhenGQSports writer Matthew Roberson tried out the OG Skims underwear, he called them “FUCKING PERFECT.” With the Skims Sport briefs, the brand ditched the cotton and made a pair of underwear that's pretty fucking perfect for working out, especially at their price point (just 10 bucks a pop now that they're on sale). They fit exactly the same as the original Skims underwear, but the fabric has been updated to make it more lightweight and quick-drying, two important factors for underwear designed to worn while exercising. They're extra stretchy and and breathable, and if you're looking to stock up on that underwear drawer, this is what you should be filling it with. Saxx Saxx Material: 85% Nylon, 15% ElastaneSizes: XS to 2XL Compression shorts are the secret to a good workout, and compression underwear could be the difference between a mid workout and a major one. Saxx's Kinetic Light-Compression mesh underwear offer lightweight, targeted compression to everyone's favorite leg muscles: the quads and hammies. The micro-mesh construction offers some breathability so that sweat can more easily evaporate, and the odor-resistant fabric avoids any dreaded stenches emanating from your gym bag as you're commuting home. Uniqlo Uniqlo Uniqlo's AIRism fabric is great for anyone who overheats, and that's the reason why it's a great material for workout clothes. These briefs offer odor control and are cool to the touch, although they can lean on the thinner side. Nike Nike A bit of compression and a whole lot of support make these an excellent choice for an elite athlete who wants to make sure that their choice of underwear won't restrict their movements and leave them stuck in a puddle of their own sweat. Tommy John Tommy John An extra-long inseam and four-way stretch lend themselves to a pair of boxer briefs that stay put and make it feel as if you're not wearing anything—because maybe you're used to going commando at the gym. Path Projects Path Projects If you've ever dealt with underwear chafing, then these Path Projects underwear will be a relief to your poor thighs. Stitch-free seams prevent any unwanted abrasion to your skin and a quick-drying fabric keeps you nice and cool while the rest of you gets your sweat on. What's the best underwear for working out for men? We found theTen Thousand A—L Boxersto be the best underwear for working out, combining an excellent fit with a superior drying abilities and zero post-exercise odors. What's the best material for workout underwear? While cotton is a great material for underwear in general, we think a synthetic like modal or lyocell make great options because of how quickly they dry and how they're breathable so that your privates don't get stuffy and sweaty. Are boxer shorts or briefs better underwear for working out? Your choice of underwear for working out is a totally personal decision, and the style doesn't really affect your workout. Just make sure that your choice of underwear lets you stay mobile and isn't restricting.",

    "title": "CoQ10 Benefits: Is It Really a Miracle Energy Booster?",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Are CoQ10 benefits really as magical and mythical as people say? It seems every other Tuesday there’s something being touted as the cure-all to your low-energyslumps—anything from 5 a.m.yogaand awful-tasting tea to snail secretion and perineum sunning (don’t Google that at work). But CoQ10 is a little different. For one, it’s naturally a part of our bodies. CoQ10—or coenzyme Q10, to be technical—is an antioxidant found in our cells, which helps with the body’s energy production. That doesn’t mean asupplementwith a synthesized version of CoQ10 is a miracle cure, but it does mean there’s a bit more research on that other energy boosting supplements. On top of energy, CoQ10 also promises to help with things like anti-aging andheart health. A tall order for any tablet. To separate fact from fiction, we asked health experts to break it down. Let’s start with the basics. “Coenzyme Q10 (or CoQ10) is a naturally occurring antioxidant found in every cell of the body,” says Dr. Edel Woods, an aesthetic doctor and founder ofORA Skin Clinic. “Its primary role is to help generate energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which powers cellular processes. “In addition to its energy-boosting effects, CoQ10 plays a crucial role in protecting cells from oxidative stress and damage caused by free radicals, both of which are associated with the aging process and skin health. As we age, the levels of CoQ10 in our body naturally decline, which can negatively impact skin elasticity, cell regeneration, and overall skin vitality.” Medicine often quotes the age of CoQ10 decline around 40. Unlike other deficiencies—say iron or zinc—being low in CoQ10 is hard to diagnose. That's because CoQ10 levels decrease by themselves with time, so catching them in the free fall is difficult, but not impossible. Reza Nassab, an aesthetic doctor atCLNQ, says to pay attention to your body, especially your heart function and energy levels. “A CoQ10 deficiency can be hard to spot since the symptoms are often mild or similar to other health issues,” says Nassab. “Aging, certain health conditions like heart disease, and medications like statins [drugs used to lower cholesterol] can lower CoQ10 levels. If you feel tired or weaker than usual, it could be a sign, but a doctor would need to confirm it with a test.” As to the symptoms, Nassab says they would be mostly to do with your energy. “If you have low CoQ10 levels, you might feel fatigued, weak or have trouble exercising. Since CoQ10 is important for heart health, some people may also notice heart-related symptoms, like palpitations or high blood pressure. Other possible signs include feeling mentally sluggish or having a weaker immune system.” Yes, a synthesized version of CoQ10 exists. As to its effectiveness, Woods says: “CoQ10 supplements offer a range of benefits. As an antioxidant, CoQ10 can also help protect skin cells from oxidative damage, improving skin elasticity, reducing fine lines, and promoting a youthful complexion. It also supports collagen production, helping to maintain skin vitality. Beyond skin health, CoQ10 is crucial for heart function, as it aids in energy production within heart cells and promotes better circulation and blood pressure regulation. Supplementing with CoQ10 can also combat fatigue by boosting ATP production, the primary energy source for cells, which is especially helpful for those feeling sluggish or recovering from physical exertion. As well as that, CoQ10 may enhance nutrient absorption and support oral health, reducing the risk of gum disease.” Another added benefit of taking a CoQ10supplementis the effect it may have onanti-aging. Although it’s not going to snap-reverseeye bagsor grey hair, correct and constant supplementation may slow down some of the most commons signs of wear and tear. “CoQ10 can play a significant role in anti-aging, particularly for skin health,” says Woods. “As a powerful antioxidant, topical CoQ10 in particular helps protect skin cells from oxidative stress caused by free radicals, which are a primary factor in aging. This protection helps reduce the appearance of fine lines,wrinkles, and sagging by supporting the skin's natural ability to repair itself and maintain elasticity. “CoQ10 also enhances collagen production, a key protein responsible for skin firmness and structure, helping to keep the skin looking plump and youthful. Additionally, it helps improve skin hydration and overall texture by energizing skin cells, ensuring they function optimally,” says Woods. CoQ10 has an effect on the outside stuff, but it may also have an effect on the inside stuff, too. As Nassab explains, the energy that CoQ10 helps with has a noticeable impact on heart health. “CoQ10 is essential for heart health,” says Nassab. “Since the heart uses a lot of energy, CoQ10 helps the heart work more efficiently and protects it from damage. Studies also suggest it can help improve heart function in people with heart disease, reduce symptoms of heart failure and support overall cardiovascular health.\" Not only that, but your blood pressure can also see some benefits from taking a supplement. “CoQ10 also may help lower blood pressure in some people, particularly those with high blood pressure. It improves how blood vessels work and reduces oxidative stress, which can help regulate blood pressure.\" Sidenote: if you’ve been diagnosed with high blood pressure, or that’s something you’re at risk of, you shouldn’t use CoQ10 as a replacement for proper medication. CoQ10 is generally considered safe to use. However, there are some things you should be aware of, says Harley Street nutritionistClarissa Lenherr, namely: “nausea or stomach discomfort, especially at higher doses. Taking CoQ10 with food may help reduce these symptoms.” On top of that, taking it at the wrong time can keep you awake. “CoQ10 may disrupt sleep for some people, particularly if taken later on in the day,” says Lenherr. “CoQ10 plays a role in cellular energy production, which can increase alertness and potentially make it harder to wind down at night. To avoid this effect, it’s generally recommended to take CoQ10 in the morning or early afternoon, especially for people sensitive to supplements that increase energy.” You sure can. Although it’s not quite as effective as taking asupplement, there are lots of foods that can help boost levels naturally. “If you're looking to boost your CoQ10 levels through food, there are several options that naturally contain this nutrient,” says Woods. “Fatty fish like salmon and tuna, organ meats like liver, and whole grains are excellent sources. You’ll also find smaller amounts in foods like spinach, broccoli, and peanuts. “However, since CoQ10 levels decline with age, it can be challenging to get enough from food alone, especially for optimal skin health. In such cases,supplementscan help ensure you’re getting the benefits of this powerful antioxidant.” Speaking of thosesupplements, here are our recommendations. (P.S. a note on dosage from Lenherr: “While there is no established upper limit for CoQ10, typical dosages range from 100 mg to 200 mg per day, but some might need more depending on their health situation.”) Nutricost Amazon BulkSupplements.com Amazon Life Extension Amazon Qunol Amazon Thorne Amazon The Nue Co.

    "title": "Rolex, Omega, Cartier, Breitling, and Others Are Raising Prices in Response to Tariffs",
    "article_text": "When President Trump first announced the sky-high 31% tariffs on Switzerland, where a vast majority of the world’s luxury timepieces are made, it prompted immediate defensive maneuvering in the watch world. One vintage dealer’s foreign supplier took an emergency flight with a huge cache of watches, while modern retailers stocked up on inventory, fearing new challenges in sourcing pieces. The panic quieted when the Trump administration put a 90-day pause on the most punitive tariffs but we’ve learned that brands are still responding to the remaining 10% tax. The bottom line is that the most desirable watches in the world are about to get pricier. Rolexwas one of the first dominoes to drop, asHodinkee first reported. Beginning May 1, the Crown will increase its prices by roughly 3%. According to that same report, Omega was set to follow with a 5% increase on average for the pieces in its catalog. Meanwhile, rumors are swirling among industry insiders that other marques will soon be following suit. While specific figures aren’t forthcoming, certain Richemont and Swatch Group companies, like Cartier, as well as independents such asBreitling, are among those who will increase the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, or MSRP, in the US. (LVMHbrands—which include the likes ofTAG HeuerandBvlgari—will almost certainly do the same.) Expect a 3% to 5% increase for these brands. Industry sources also confirmed that retailers’ margin will decrease in certain cases, hurting the authorized dealers who sell watches. Even Trump’s considerably smaller 10% levy is set to have a significant impact on the market, causing the aforementioned price hikes that may impact appetite for new watches among all but the most well-heeled clients. In addition to dampening demand for many luxury watches, it will almost certainly drive customers to the secondary market—a potential boon to resellers. “This isn’t just a policy shift—it’s a realignment of how collectors will access fine timepieces in the US,” said Joshua Ganjei of Boston’s European Watch Company. “Tariffs will put a lot of pressure on brands and authorized dealers while creating tremendous opportunities for the secondary market. If MSRP were to rise considerably, collectors would look for local, pre-owned alternatives to enjoy the hobby.” Still, certain brands—particularly high-end independents whose clientele are less subject to market volatility and tariffs—aren’t setting their hair aflame just yet. Edouard Meylan, CEO ofH. Moser & Cie, was certainly surprised by the initial 31% tariff. “That said, we remain serene,” he said. “Our relationships with US retail partners are built on trust, long-term vision, and mutual respect. The majority of orders for the year to come were placed well ahead of this announcement, and based on our initial conversations, we do not expect any cancellations. Many of our partners remain confident that this situation will evolve and potentially be resolved in time.” Meylan did note that as soon as the initial 31% tariff was announced, his brand proactively shipped product before it could take effect. Thankfully, of course, Trump backtracked somewhat, but the 10% tariff that remains in effect will certainly translate to some sticker shock at your local authorized dealer. Watches are, of course, luxury items—none of us needs a little mechanical timekeeper strapped to our wrist anymore. But the reverberations of Trump’s trade policy will certainly make themselves felt not only by American consumers but, depending upon what it does to dampen demand, on the watchmakers (and retailers) themselves. For now, if you’re looking to snag the latestSub,Speedmaster, orTank, expect to save up a few more Benjamins to do so.",

    "title": "Beyoncé Cowboy Carter Tour Review",
    "article_text": "There are certain moments in life that feel inevitable in retrospect. Like, if Beyoncé is doing a stadium tour in support of a country-themed album, you can assume she will, at some point, sit atop a golden mechanical bull, and actually ride it, to the tune of one of the project’s bounciest tracks, without surrendering one gasp of breath control. Give Beyoncé a theme, and she will execute. Flying around the stadium on a horseshoe, Americana imagery flipped on its head, dancers rocking Stetsons and grills—welcome to the hoedown. I still have nightmares about missing the Renaissance Tour (and watching the admittedly excellent concert film in theaters only made it worse), so it feels cosmically right that I made it to the Cowboy Carter Tour on opening night. I’ve written,in an earlier edition of this column, about how the album is already underrated, in a way; since then, it’s nabbed Beyoncé her elusive Album of the Year Grammy. But Night One of this new tour doesn’t feel like a smug victory lap, or a retread of the stadium tour she did just two summers ago.Cowboy Cartermay be Act II in a supposed trilogy of albums, but it is very much its own beast: a sprawling project full of ideas, themes and dares that it can barely contain. In Los Angeles for Night One, Beyoncé leaned into that, with a show longer than most blockbusters that felt every bit like a 70-millimeter, 15 perforation-per-frame visual spectacle. There were not-so-subtle rebuttals to the criticism of the album’s Americana imagery, like the transition from a rendition of the National Anthem into the Black empowerment anthem “Freedom.” Hits both new and old reinterpreted within aCCcontext. Appearances from not one but two Carter children. Cutscenes that, true to the rich history of Beyoncé tours past, could be edited into a coherent and compelling short film in their own right. She’s over 40 and performed over 40 songs, and stood tall as the least tired person in SoFi when it was all said and done. Watching her flawlessly attack something like “Spaghettii’s” breathless flow or bring the house down early with “Ya Ya” is like watching LeBron get a dunk off while a stunned Mike Breen exclaims “He’s FORTY!” over the broadcast. The creator’s exhaustive commitment to innovation, excellence and raising the bar was crystallized in a cut-scene that played before her grand finale: a montage tracing her home-video origins to her stadium-status present with increasingly frenetic pacing and editing, showing her growing busier and more dedicated as an old audio clip of her father instructed her to sing songs that she has genuine affinity for, because that way the work won’t appear as work. There were two pointed inclusions of two different televised moments where she learned with the rest of the world that she’d lost Album of the Year; footage of this year’s win was not included. And then Beyoncé soared around the stadium atop a flying car to sing a ballad aboutmaking sacrifices for greatness. Other thoughts below: Cowboy CarterIs Stadium StatusThis should’ve been obvious but just in case it wasn’t, you can have a great time at this show even if Beyonce’s latest album isn’t your favorite. It’s not like her Christmas halftime show, which exclusively showcased the new music; the enduring hits you’re looking for are in full effect here. But the 40-song setlist did reaffirm the case forCowboy Carterin a pretty effective and successful way. Maybe it’s because of how new and fresh they were—“This is the first time I’ve sang these songs,” she announced at one point—but some of theCCballads were among the most exciting parts of the night. Stirring performances of “Alligator Tears” or “Just for Fun” should send anyone who’s been sleeping on those tracks back for a revisit. “Ya Ya,” “Sweet Honey Buckin,” “Bodyguard” and “II Hands II Heaven” legitimately rang off, the latter so much so that I still can’t believe how early in the night it came up, much less that it’s not the show closer. For anyone who doubted the efficacy of some ofCC’smore album-cut-esque tracks, the show presents a firm urge to reconsider, or, less charitably, that you may have had B fucked up. She also made sure to showcase the album’s musical range, and how reductive it is to even simply call it “country.” She got inher Remmick bagand busted out an Irish line-dance for “Riiverdance,” went full Italian opera showcasing “Daughter” by itself towards the night’s end, and brought out “Flamenco” dancers for the eponymous ballad, quietly one of the best tracks on the project. Do Not Sleep On “My House”Including a new song with theRenaissancemovie was a nice touch but in retrospect maybe it deserved more. Co-written and co-produced by Beyoncé’s ace The-Dream, it’s a banger that deftly switches from Texas candy-paint turn-up (complete with B doing a Bun B flow) into a ballroom heater. Notably it stood out as the only non-CCsong she performed at her NFL Christmas halftime show, but it absolutely rang off last night as if it was on theRenaissancealbum proper. Been Country: Early in the show, B dropped “Formation” and sang its central mission statement—“Earned all this money, but they’ll never take the country out me”— twice for added emphasis. If that’s too subtle, then the trucker hat merch emblazoned with BNCNTRY (which she wore herself later in the show) should make the implication crystal clear: think ofCowboy Carter what you wil—but don’t call it a switch-up. (The setlist itself did try to emphasize this with some actual subtlety with deft, career-spanning sequencing placing key classics alongside the newer songs as a sort of sonic throughline.) She also kept her Texas roots alive and well with an extended Attack of the 50 Foot Woman cutscene scored to fellow Lone Star native’s BigXThaPlug’s “The Largest.” When I interviewed him in January, X told me if Beyoncé was keyed in enough to the Texas rap scene toshout out That Mexican OT, “then I guarantee Beyoncé knows me.” The Blue Ivy Show: In the years since the Renaissance Tour, Beyoncé’s eldest daughter has graduated from adorable show-stopping cameo to full-on member of the ensemble. If there’s a dancers union, then she probably technically has to be paid a salary at this point. But the novelty of seeing Beyoncé bust a move alongside her preteen clone has hardly worn off, and there were two notable points where Blue broke out on her own to show off and show out: the clip going around already is from early in the show during “America Has a Problem,” but the even iller moment came towards the end, when she strutted out to one of her parents’ very first (kind of underrated?) collabs, “Deja Vu,” looking every bit their spitting image. Last summer, Beyoncétold meit was somewhat inevitable that Blue and her siblings would get bitten by the performer bug, but she was still hesitant to indulge it. “My kids come with me everywhere I go. They come to my office after school, and they are in the studio with me. They are in dance rehearsals. It’s natural that they would learn my choreography. Blue is an artist. She has great taste in music and fashion. She is a fantastic editor, painter, and actress. She has been creating characters since she was three. She’s a natural, but I did not want Blue onstage. Blue wanted it for herself. She took it seriously and she earned it. And most importantly, she had fun! We all watched her grow more and more every night before our eyes.” Now she’s grown almost as tall as Beyoncé herself. Meanwhile Blue’s younger sister is now old enough to provide a quick, cute cameo, which she did during “Protector,” theCowboy Carterlullaby that she tees her mom up for on the album. Will she be a mainstay? Hard to tell, but the only thing cooler than watching Bey lock in for three hours with nary a misstep or missed note is seeing her break poise for a split second when Rumi gave her an impromptu hug before leaving the stage. RenaissanceIs a Classic: Every song from that album hit like crack and the Stans in the stands went full Hamsterdam. I still can’t believe I didn’t go to that tour, man. (It might be top two and not two, but maybe that’s a conversation for another day.) A Beyoncé B-Sides Show Would Go Crazy:There are only a few moments in contemporary music that I wish I was outside a little earlier for; Beyoncé already being arena-level but choosing to support her album 4 with intimate shows in venues like Roseland Ballroom is one of them. Will she ever downsize like that again? Probably not, but consider: she put forth 41 (forty-one) songs last night and I could name a dozen more classics I would’ve loved to see. At one point she trolled the audience by pretending to launch into “Suga Mama,” acknowledging the Beyhive’s very viral desire to see that song make the cut. I appreciate that she’s too committed to do the whole, Oldie-But-Goodie medley a lot of A-listers are doing now, a bit I’m getting tired of where older songs the performer clearly has no interest in gets some dutiful airtime just to titillate the crowd. But imagine a show where she actually does run “Suga Mama” and other random heaters like, “Kitty Kat,” “Speechless,” “Dance For You,” “Heard About Us”... the list goes on.",

    "title": "‘Law & Order: Organized Crime’'s Christopher Meloni Does Not Ship Benson & Stabler",
    "article_text": "Since the premiere ofLaw & Order: Organized Crime, Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) hasn’t been able to catch a break. His ex-wife was killed in a car bomb meant for him, international crime syndicates have placed targets on his back, and he is a 58-year-old in a 26-year-long situationship (with his formerSVUpartner Olivia Benson, played by Mariska Hargitay). To make matters worse, Season 5’s premiere episode ends with a suspect ramming into Stabler’s car as he escapes with a victim, leaving him in critical condition. The crash sets up the series’ intense second episode, directed and co-written by Meloni, which takes a deep dive into a comatose Stabler’s psyche. The pitch, Meloni explained, went like this: \"What do you think if we have Stabler do something superheroic, gets injured in the moment, and it's Benson who is there to bring him back to life with her presence?” The pair hadn’t seen each other since theSVUseason 24 finale, when Benson pulled away from Stabler when he went in for a kiss, leaving their unresolved feelings to linger. Benson’s confession in his hospital room this season only deepens the characters’ will-they-or-won’t-they dynamic, whichLaw & Orderproducer Dick Wolf has been teasing across various shows since 1999. As for Meloni's perspective on the show’s romantic tension, he’s leaving the shipping to fans. “I'm not a shipper. I see the characters and I don't yearn for shipping,” he states. He adds, “I let characters play out as the writers want them to play out.” Ahead of the Season 5 premiere ofOrganized Crimestreaming onPeacock, theL & Omultiverse veteran walked GQ through hisOrganized Crimedirectorial debut, Stabler’s complicated past, and tweeting through fascism. GQ:How has playing a detective on TV impacted the way you view the world? Christopher Meloni:The impact has been more on how I view the profession of law enforcement and their mindset, or how I portray the mindset and the difficulties, the stresses, and the world that they live in. I've found a kinship in that. I think my worldview has always been a bit jaundiced. I meet an awful lot of detectives who, even though they've seen some things, still swim through the world with a clearer eye as to human nature. I'm always impressed when I meet detectives and they'll tell me the stories that they've gone through, and they're really solid and adjusted and focused and clear. It hasn't broken them or spoiled their opinion of humanity. Are you as religious as Stabler? No, but we’re both still on a quest for the meaning of it all. I think we both share those questions:God, where are you? I want to have a relationship here, and I don't, what is it? Do I not have the tools? Am I not looking hard enough? Am I going about it the wrong way? Law & Order: SVUhas been the first job for many actors. Who is someone you worked with that you now see in films or shows, and are like “I know them!” Abigail Breslin was on our show. I guess she was eight or nine years old, maybe. When Mariska and I saw her act, we just looked at each other, going, “Uh-oh. That is some formidable kid.” Bradley Cooper, I've known him fromWet Hot American Summer, but he was on the show before he becameBradley Cooper, and you're like, “Wow.” You can tell, you just can tell. Elizabeth Banks, same way. She was on the show. You're just like, \"There's something in there that's just, they got it.\" So yeah, a lot of [actors passed] through and it kind of makes you feel like you're part of TV history. How would you describe your style versus Stabler’s? Do you dress alike? He can't wait to look for a moment to loosen thetie. When I wear a tie, I like to just keep it up and buttoned up for the most part. He's a better dresser than I. There’s a lot of running in these shows. Do you practice running indress shoesand slacks? At the beginning of every season, that was an absolute necessity. We can deal with all the wardrobe issues we want, but what we have to take care of is the comfort of our feet, because we're on our feet for 16 hours a day and very often chasing perps over cobblestoned roads. I don't know how the ladies do it. I don't know how Mariska does it. But God bless them. Afterthe 2020 protests,Law & Orderbegan to grapple with the corruption of the police force. Stabler is often caught in this controversy. What’s it like to film a police drama with that in mind? I remember when we started, Stabler was coming back, and I talked with a lot of professionals who are helping police forces go from the idea of being warriors to being guardians of the common good, which I thought was an interesting use of the words and an interesting change in the headset. It was tricky, and there was a lot of discussion in the Wolf Organization, because they knew—this is a delicate dance. I didn't feel the need to do a mea culpa tour. I always felt that Stabler, this character, was an honest cop, a good cop. His heart was in the right place. Was it always perfect? No. I don’t think that whatever my character did influenced the outside behaviors of society or cops. I think things have changed. I don't think we have changed. I think we're always very cognizant of how much is too much, but then you got to give a little bit of much for a sense of drama. You just have to be honest when trying to tell the stories of dangerous environments. He’s a complicated character. He’s flawed. I find the hero worship to be uncomfortable. I just find it far more interesting to see the struggle of an ordinary man put in extraordinary circumstances and how he handles and fails at things. He's a flawed human being. What’s it like to film this show during a secondTrumppresidency? I don't tie those two worlds together. If I go on X and all that, that's where I get very vocal. But on Instagram, I don't want to corrupt or pervert that space with what's happening. That's more of a whimsical personal engagement. So, I compartmentalize these things. I already get accused on Twitter of having Trump Derangement Syndrome, but I don't feel that way. Are you rockingthe goateethese days? Yeah, I'm rocking it hard. I'm keeping it trim. Are you thumbs up or thumbs down on the rocking of the goatee? I like the goatee. Do people in your life not like it? Well, you know, fandom—they're all over the map. You know, I heard someone tweeted something like, \"I hate Stabler. He's just a hothead with anger management issues.\" I'm like, \"Y'know, OK—you don't have to look.\" That's the way to look at it. I mean, I've either failed at my job, or maybe you need to look at the trauma that you have endured. I mean that without being sarcastic. We all have these prejudices or triggers. Definitely. Do you always read the tweets? Nah, super rarely. I mean, it really is a cesspool. That's why I took a break and I'm on the verge of taking another break. With the sense of fascism growing by the day and no one doing anything about it, I think my tweets will save the day [laughing].",

    "title": "Five Foods to Help You Reduce Bloating and Get Lean",
    "article_text": "Slimming down without shortcuts, prescription medication, or goingcarb-freeis hard. But, with a smarter approach to nutrition—embracing foods that reduce bloating—it isn’t impossible. You’ll need to reduce your body fat to 12 percent or for yourabs to start showing. This takes an iron will and a near-superhuman level of dedication. As Joseph Boyce, a senior associate at PwC, found out, it also requires a lot of know-how. After trying to get in shape for ages, Boyce finally admitted defeat, calling in Robert Utley, founder ofReal Body Performance, for help. At first, Joe was baffled by Utley’s unorthodox approach to banishing bloat. Then he started seeing results. Not only did heget lean, but he felt better and more energized than ever. He has now transformed his diet for good. “Joe came to me feeling deflated with how he looked,” says Utley. “His dietwas all wrong. The first step was to feed him more food, not only so he could put on size, but so that his body could get used to proper nutrients, meaning: lean proteins, easily digestible carbohydrates, and good healthy fats.” Like changing the oil in acar, Boyce’s training started to run much more smoothly after the transition. Once he was comfortable working out powered by good food instead of junk, Utley was confident they could work towards a successful cut. “This is the longest stage in a body recomposition, and we slowly chip away foods, graduallyincreasing cardioin order to start losing fat,” Utley explains. “The key is to make nice slow changes to allow the body to work efficiently. Rushing a fat loss process will make the body come to a grinding halt as the client burns out,” Utley adds. “Not only that, but the client will feel terrible, perform poorly, and ultimately fail in theirfat loss journey.” The focus, then, was on not only stripping fat and water weight, but actually letting Boyce’s body feel its best—a good deal of which came down to choosing debloating foods that would aid fat-loss, fuel him properly, and help expose the progress he’d already made. “I’m 29 now and started the process ofgetting in shapewhen I was 27. I’d been very athletic and very skinny when I was younger and wanted to put on size. The trouble was that I was eating all of the wrong things—pasta dishes, energy drinks, pastries—thinking it would help me get the body I wanted. But I wasn’t seeing results. “It came from a real lack of understanding about nutrition, and it took Rob to point out that I was actually undernourished and that I wasn’t eating the appropriate foods to meet my goals in the gym. “I wanted to lose weight, and thought that it was ludicrous that Rob wanted me to eat more to begin with. Obviously the normal conception is ‘eat less.’ Rob got rid of the crap stuff and saturated nonsense and focused onlean proteins, good fats, and digestible carbs. Once my body got used to that routine, we could start stripping away and getting me into a deficit. If I’d gone straight from bad food to a deficit I definitely wouldn’t have been able to sustain it. “Obviously it was a long process, and it was hard, but Rob knew what my body needed. The foods that he introduced me to were quite shocking; Cocoa Krispies on a diet, I thought was insane. But when you have no carbs, having chocolateycerealis actually a nice break. “I learned a lot about my body in the process, especially when it came to debloating foods. Brown rice andcow’s milkblow me up and make me feel lethargic. Switching those out to things like Basmati rice and unsweetened almond milk was a game changer. It’s more easily digestible and easier on the GI tract. Within a week of switching to them it had made a tremendous difference, not just in terms of removing the bloating, but increasing my energy levels, too—to the point where I then decided to do a food tolerance test and discovered I have an intolerance forcertain foods. “The final thing that really helped with the debloating, and helped me look as lean as I wanted wasdrinking five or six liters of water a day. Previously I’d drink half a liter, or a liter max per day. Again, it was difficult at first, but after a few weeks I had no issues at all and just generally felt much better.” For Boyce, exploring debloating foods was a journey of discovery. He not only achieved his goal of getting shredded, he also unlockedmore energyand learned what foods work best with his body. This is what an average day of eating now looks like for him. Breakfast: ShakeWhey isolate, unsweetened almond milk, frozen berries Meal 2Chicken breast,tortilla wrap, green salad or Mediterranean vegetable Meal 3Low sugar yogurt, flavoring drops, peanut butteror4 eggs, 4 rations of turkey bacon, choice of veg Pre workoutWhey isolate, unsweetened almond milk, Cocoa Krispies or Frosted Flakes Meal 4Lean mince or fish, Basmati rice, broccoli You can follow the above on your own mission to debloat, but it’s worth remembering that all bodies—and all fitness plans—are different. Instead, consider experimenting with the foods below, and maybe even discussing them with your physical trainer to see how much of a difference they can make. Cocoa Krispies“I like to really fire up the body with a nice simple sugar that’s easy to digest and really spikes your metabolism and energy level for a short period of time,” says Utley. “This produces shockingly effective results when used post workout in a no or low carb day. Although, it only works if you’re in a deficit.” Broccoli“Yes it’s full of nutrients and vitamins, but broccoli eaten before the rest of your meal has been scientifically proven to lower insulin response to food, keeping you in a much deeper fat burning state,” says Utley. “Over a prolonged period, it has a significant impact on extra pounds lost.” Avocadoand Dark Chocolate“Fats are good, including avocados, but also very dark, 80-90 percent [Cocoa] chocolate—even in a deficit,” says Utley. “Good fats will not only boost your function, but will also slow down digestion so you can absorb your nutrients properly, leading to less bloating and discomfort.” Basmati Rice“For years it’s been all about brown rice, but I’ve found that, for me, Basmati rice digests more efficiently, causing far less gastric issues,” says Utley. “Most importantly, I think thatbrown ricetastes awful and basmati tastes amazing!” Alternative Milks“Alternative milk options are a brilliant way to debloat, especially if you’re intolerant to dairy,” says Utley. “I stick with unsweetened almond milk and unsweetened oat milk, both of which are lower in sugar andcaloriesthan cow milk.” This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "How Sinners Became the Most Unique Box Office Hit in Years",
    "article_text": "It has been a hot minute since we saw a wholly original movie likeSinnersdominate the cultural conversation. But is it such a surprise that one has arrived in this moment? There has been a feeling for a while, not least with theMarvel Cinematic Universeon the wane, that film audiences are hungry for something new. That's not to say that there isn't room for aMinecraft Moviedoing astonishing business in its own right. But if a brilliant, bizarre genre-feast—a blues musical drawing on a thematic smorgasbord of American racism,Irish folk dancingand, yes, vampires—was ever going to do well, it's now. Over this past weekend,Sinnersall but matched its opening haul at the domestic box office, dropping a measly six percent week-on-week. To put this into perspective, you'd ordinarily expect a mega-budget,Avengers-gradesuperhero film to fall more like 50 or 60 percent following its first weekend, which in itself would mark a good performance. What's more,one box office analyst has gone on recordthat he expects it to make at least $200 million in the US overall—it'salready at $122.5 million after a week—which would make it the first original live-action film to hit suchheights since 2013'sGravity. Anecdotally, I can't say I'm surprised. At my various social functions over the weekend, all my friends were talking about wasSinners—even the guys at my Sunday league match who I wouldn't ordinarily describe as super tapped into film culture. (Hey, not everyone needs to be aLetterboxd nerdnerd.) It certainly seems like movie-going isn't quite the “outdated concept” thatNetflix's Ted Sarandos thinks it is, given the scale ofSinners' success. But why has word of mouth been so atypically strong for a non-franchise film in a multiplex era dominated by franchises? We should start by pointing at two names: directorRyan Cooglerand starMichael B. Jordan. The former, best known for directingBlack Panther(Marvel's only Best Picture nominee) andRockysequelCreed(the likely consensus pick for sports sequel of the century) has form for going over well with ordinary filmgoers; they won A+ and A-grades respectively on CinemaScore, a reliable platform for taking the temperature of audience sentiment. According toCollider,Sinnersmarks the first R-rated horror film to earn an A-grade, speaking to its outlier appeal. The cliché often goes that critics hate the films that “normal” audiences love, and vice versa, but this has not been the case for Coogler, whose movies score into the high 90s onRotten Tomatoes. Not that it's overly surprising that Coogler's films are so universally satisfying. First and foremost, they are escapist popcorn flicks that brim with personal expression; he's one of the only studio directors who is seemingly enabled to work with a creative blank check. His films also tend to be atypically thoughtful for the multiplex. TakeSinners, for example: on the face of it, it's a gnarly genre film that serves as a throwback star vehicle forJordan, whose own track record at the box office must rank him among Hollywood's most bankable stars. But it is also thematically rich and invites deeper interpretation than the merits of its wildly entertaining surface. If you want to read it as a biographical allegory forCoogler's experience within the Marvel machine, or as a sweeping metaphor for assimilation and/or the appropriation of Black culture by white people, you can—but it's equally valid to enjoy it as a barnstorming blockbuster. The box office-friendly byproduct of this attention to detail? You'll probably want to watch it more than once to pick up on what you missed the first time around. Coogler and Jordan have worked together five times now, and it's already a proven collab that ranks up there with Spielberg-Hanks, Nolan-Murphy and Scorsese-De Niro. Trust that all the money in the world will be thrown at them in the wake ofSinners' success. But it isn't just a huge W for the duo—it's a victory for the Hollywood ecosystem at large, a victory for art, and a victory for originality at the box office. We can't wait to see what they sink their teeth into next. This story originally appeared onBritish GQ.",

    "title": "The T-Shirt 'The Bear' Made Famous Has a Few New Cousins",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Back in 2022,The Bearchanged everything that genpop America knew about kitchen lingo,Jeremy Allen White’s acting range, and, of course,white T-shirts. Frazzled and sexy Carmen Berzatto turned a tiny German brand’s bicep-hugging, waist-grazing tee into thehottest piece of menswear available. Except it wasn’t all that available. That shirt, the Merz B. Schwannen 215 tee, launched the then-cult brand into the stratosphere. Which caused a bit of a problem, because the brand loves doing things the hard way. WhenThe Bearblew up the spot of the 215 shirt, old-world craftsmanship collided head-on with a hype train. The tee, hefty and structured, is made on vintage knitting machines that result in a side-seam-free experience; production couldn’t be scaled to match the hordes of men looking for a crisp white shortcut toJeremy Allen White’s biceps. What’s more, Merz B. Schwanen, culty as it was, could only be found at IYKYK-type menswear havens. Merz B. Schwanen Huckberry Merz B. Schwanen Huckberry Merz, founded in 1911 and reborn in 2011, has long been prized in very specific menswear circles that also care deeply about historical construction techniques in service of crafting long-lasting, beautifully made basics. The brand’s products are meticulously made in Germany, often using bygone methods and decades-old machines (the equipment dates back to the 1800s in some cases). None of the brand’s products are “cheap” in the financial sense, but trying a single piece often leads to obsession. When I worked at legendary menswear store Unionmade Goods in San Francisco (RIP) a decade ago, Merz B. Schwannen was one of the shop’s best-selling brands, partially due to a dozen or so guys who would buy basically everything we had, every season. Merz B. Schwanen Huckberry Merz B. Schwanen Huckberry Three years on from Jeremy Allen White’s first unwitting forayinto undergarment influencing, we have some great news: if you tried and failed to score the 215 T-Shirt in 2022—ordidbuy the 215 in 2022 and stopped there—then you’ve now got a chance to dive deeper into Merz B. Schwanen’s magical world. The once-elusive label is a touch easier to source, for one. Three years on from The Bear’s debut, you can now buy Merz B. Schwanen at places likeHuckberry,Nordstrom, andSSENSE, in addition to the more esoteric stockists that have backed the German knit geniuses for years. What’s more, the brand has managed to beef up its production without sacrificing quality—while, crucially, expanding its available styles into a sneaky-wide range of white tees that fit an even broader range of guys. Merz B. Schwanen Nordstrom Merz B. Schwanen Nordstrom While theBear-sanctified 215 remains a low-volume rarity, Merz has blessed us with a great alternative in theClassic 2M15 T-Shirt. Sure, it has side seams and a cotton that’s both a little lighter and a touch less structured than the Bear-famed original, but that means it wears a little more generously as a result. (The 215 is an incredible shirt, but the thick-and-slim style isn’t a win for everyone.) The brand’s Classic Cropped 2M15, meanwhile, is a sensibly shortened iteration that will look just right with some higher-waisted pants all summer long. Don’t sleep on Merz B. Schwanen’s sweatshirts, either. I’ve been wearing a black crewneck of the brand’s for years, and have every intention of doing so for many more. The extended ribbing on thisOrganic Cotton Hoodieis testing my devotion to every hoodie I currently enjoy. And for anyone still on the hunt for a killer quarter-zip, the brand’sQuarter Zip Organic Cotton Sweatshirtcan be scooped up, inexplicably, for just $114 at the moment. Cheap? No, nothing from Merz is cheap, even when the sale gods briefly shine down on us. But everything Merz B. Schwanen turns out is built to last. Just be careful—you might end up as obsessed as the Merz B.-lovers from my old job. Merz B. Schwanen Nordstrom Merz B. Schwanen Nordstrom",

    "title": "Your ‘Righteous Gemstones’ Final-Season Divine-Power Rankings, Week 8: Baby Billy is Jokic, a Smoking Monkey, and Dudes Rock Type Deaths",
    "article_text": "It’s easy for some to step into the trap of passivity, to surrender to the lull of hype around a given star prospect. True ball knowers, however, know there’s no substitute for grinding game tape. The tape never lies. It’s where the game within the game unfolds, and today we’re using it to reassess the draft stocks of every character in the penultimate episode of The Righteous Gemstones. You’ll notice a couple repeating paths to success here: Those who overcome their shortcomings and communicate honestly with their loved ones? They go on to thrive, even if they have to get abducted by a madman and subsequently knocked on their ass after ingesting a timely bump of coke. (The work has its costs, but it must continue.) And what of those who don’t? Well, the episode’s titled “On Your Belly You Shall Go” for a reason. BABY BILLY FREEMAN (Walton Goggins).M-V-P! M-V-P!There’s almost no limit to the blessings Baby Billy brought to the flock this week, so much so that we kinda hate that we used up COCAINE COCAINE HOURS* as a descriptorlast week. But we must adjust our metaphors to a changing world along with everything else, so you might think of this as Baby Billy’sStation to Station—a classic whose making he will not remember at all. Call him Nikola Jokic, because in just 40 minutes of game play Billy has put up ludicrous numbers in all the following categories: Where there’s room for improvement, you’ll find the familiar scouting knock of “zero situational awareness.” Baby Billiam Freeman! How you gonna get shot in the chest with a dart gun? This can’t possibly be your first time getting shot in the chest with a dart gun! Charges into battle fearlessly, but immediately gets his shit rocked, a combo move known as The Augusta Feather Duster, a.k.a. The Talladega Skater, a.k.a. The Full Begbie. *Right around the time “God, bless this cocaine to give me the gas to beat this demon,” dropped from his lips, we realized it was a failure of imagination on our part to think Billy might have reached his own particular sweet-stuff ceiling last week. In fairness, expecting him to yell the actual word “COCAINE” as he charged Cobb would have been a stretch even for the most jaded scouting eye. Again: clear communication wins championships. COREY MILSAP (Seann William Scott).The quiet runner-up in Doing The Most, until he’s not. Is trying to fix his mom’s relationship! (Because it might adversely affect his birthday party!) Got himself a genuine custom-made Gil Hibben knife from the maker of the Rambo knives, which is a plus. Promptly loses it, albeit for a noble purpose. (They’re real, but you should know:Gil Hibbenonly made the blades for Rambo III and IV. You want the O.G. First Blood or Rambo II knives, you gotta go get youa Jimmy Lile original.) (Are we going to point out that Cobb is such a shitty dad that he didn’t even spring for the more expensive version of the Rambo knife for his son? Yes. Safe to assume a craftsman likeDanny McBrideincluded this detail intentionally.) Cake was had, and it was also eaten: Corey can plausibly deny murdering his father, but still got to stab his father. Isnota good liar, but is good enough to get by the people in his life, and really, that’s all that matters, right? Slings his own Daddy into the swamp without a moment’s hesitation, and in doing so displays more utility than any of Eli’s actual children. And that’s one helluva flying leap he’s got. (This show will never get enough recognition for uncorking premium-grade action sequences out of nowhere each season.) DR. ELI GEMSTONE (John Goodman).Well, the first we see of him, he's got an open container of Talenti out and he’s looking at old pictures on his phone. Ice cream is for treats;gelatois for sads. Take it from a couple of bloggers: Real Sad Bitches know where you’re at, Padre. Cuts his hair in the sink. (ELI YOU KNOW YOUR HOUSEHOLD STAFF BY NAME, WHAT ARE YOU DOING CUTTING YOUR HAIR INTO THE SINK, THIS ISN'T A GAS STATION.) In the micro, Eli’s streak of bad decisions continues, via letting Baby Billy cajole him into an onscreen appearance inTeenjus, perhaps the greatest knock on his judgment all season. In the macro, as the series approaches its final act, of all the characters who currently find themselves the most stuck, you’ll find most of them not too far from where they began four seasons ago. For Eli, this is all quite literal: He’s drooping in his chair at church lunch, watching his idiot kids fight. It’s fair to ask: How can any of the Gemstones hope to veer out of their own circular ruts if he doesn’t do it first? All that said: In snatching a W at last, Eli succeeds by returning to theverybeginning, as in the series-within-a-series of “Prelude” episodes, where we learned a while back that the peace-craving patriarch has HANDS. As with his grandson last week, we’re reminded with a quickness that he’s more than the mere sum of the parts we’ve seen recently. That’s the Eli of old, ringing that dinner bell. Also appears to be at least partially impervious to tasing, which ought to serve him well at many points throughout his life. SOLA (Kerstin Schulze).Handed out the soundest advice heard on this show since Eli’s Easter sermon back in the Season 1 finale, and you know it was the good shit because she didn’t get any lip back from Baby Billy. (He may even respect her now! Or he may have just been weak from fatigue and coming down off a hard run down the slopes of Sugar Mountain.) Looked cool as hell smoking a German hunting pipe while telling Baby Billy point-blank, “They need YOU,” but also displayed real tenderness taking Billy and Tiffany both under her substantial wingspan in the aftermath of the Gator Park mayhem. Emotionally literate AND knows martial arts? This emerging throuple’s the best thing that’s ever happened to any of them. LORI MILSAP (Megan Mullally).Pitched the Gemstone children so convincingly they wept what appeared to be real human tears, and that was after Judy tried to have her shot on sight. Set a chain of events in motion that got her cartoon villain of a husband eaten by a huge reptile. Reunited with Eli under what are obviously the best circumstances for a romantic reconciliation, the scene of a very recently committed triple murder. Should get more praise for her primary unlocked in-game achievement, her reluctance to physically throttle the three grown Gemstone offspring until one or all of them are dead. But perhaps it’s more important to her long-term happiness that Miss Lori knows how to get results with her sweetie’s kids: Making it about them. She’s gonna do just fine in this family. BIG GUS (An Alligator).In time-honored HBO Sunday night fashion, Chekhov’s alligator makes his triumphant return one hour before the curtain comes down for good. Timely with it, Gus. Not great in the locker room, but timely with it. BJ (Tim Baltz).It’s hard to put a man who walked again for the first time after being paralyzed anywhere but up on the week. But if we may quibble: There’s a real missed opportunity here to capitalize (with the family, the church, anybody) on his renewed ability to walk. Maintained status as the ultimate glue guy, dismissing his menthol-puffing monkey companion with rapid selflessness. Dominated all male challengers in the fashion department with a sick pastel jacket/tie combo at the table. AMBER GEMSTONE (Cassidy Freeman).Controlled her objectives this week and played her game. You can see what’s probably the end of her arc here, if you squint just right: \"You know, there is satisfaction in being somebody behind the scenes who has an influence.\" Amber has made quite a lot of the hand she was dealt, but it’s hard not to want more for her (a lot of this is down to Freeman, maybe the most underrated combatant in this particular dojo). Maintained a visage of serenity through Judy’s whole entire monkey mama breakdown, and got through church lunch in white marabou without spilling a drop. But if you’ll permit us to return to this well: Remember that she’s also the person who set the Dr. Watson plot in motion in the first place! Is not one Gemstone going to even reach for this ring? Fine. We will create the MIRACLE MONKEY TENT REVIVAL ourselves. TIFFANY FREEMAN (Valyn Hall).Didn’t wait around all night on Baby Billy and his bullshit, so kudos to her for that. Slept good as hell, too! You just stay refreshed, duchess. Even if she does wind up ditching an increasingly manic Baby Billy, she has Sola’s devotion and care to ground her. This unlikely breakout sensation might be a hall-of-famer by the time this is all over. JUDY GEMSTONE (Edi Patterson).Sometimes the weather hands you a win: It’s always a good week in South Carolina when your husband’s capuchin monkey companion doesn’t fulfill its plot to electrocute you in your bathtub. The bad news: Judy’s still centered wholly on herself, usually to her spiritual or romantic detriment but this week also to her own financial and political loss: Sleepwalking past the obvious monetization potential of BJ’s miraculous healing isinexcusable. We’re mentioning this a third time because we kind of can’t believe nobody hopped on it. Judy’s a “faith alone” girlie, remember, and this in an episode where THERE IS LITERALLY ANOTHER GUY WHO LEARNS TO WALK AGAIN IN A DANCE SEQUENCE. Still, she served some insane Chanel Dress For Less looks (to say nothing of that QVC Bob Mackie boudoir getup [complimentary, somehow]), and her wanting to hug Miss Lori is one of like five things she’s done in four seasons that shouldn’t land her on some sort of watchlist. BIG DICK MITCH (Regan Burns).If you’re gonna be known for one thing, there are worse nicknames to get. Is never not selling. Showed real explosiveness out of the gate. Fate currently unknown, which while it could be worse does not bode great for anybody loitering nude around a gator park in Rogers, South Carolina at night. PONTIUS GEMSTONE (Kelton DuMont).A brief but solid outing for this emerging role player. Serves as the fulcrum of a lot of this episode’s plot, via suggesting that Dr. Watson be allowed to try a cigarette. Is evenatchurch lunch in the first place, which maybe should put points in both Gideon and Amber’s columns. GIDEON GEMSTONE (Skyler Gisondo).Is on better footing with his brother BUT is using that time to advocate for letting the monkey smoke. (So, he’s steady, but he’s way high up and steady, is what we’re saying here.) KEEFE (Tony Cavalero).Blink and you’ll miss him cutely crinkling his nose about Game Night, but being a) in your lane at all and b) staying there counts for a lot right now. JANA MILSAP (Arden Myrin).Gets barely more screen time than Keefe this week, but displays a quiet prowess in executing whatever’s asked of her. This week, that consists solely of throwing a birthday party for a grown man that strikes a remarkable balance between “harmlessly suburban” and “menacingly whimsical.” STACY (Michael Berthold).Casting a kid with that hair and naming him “Stacy” is the most indelibly South Carolinian thing this show has ever done. (Having him then get unceremoniously shot in the head by an unscrupulous gator park owner is 1a on this list.) Will miss the 4th of July after all, which really does suck for him, because they get the good fireworks in South Carolina! The ones you see on YouTube blowing up whole docksides in Shenzhen every couple years! DR. WATSON (A Capuchin Monkey).Anybody else get the sense we haven’t seen the last of this guy yet? Anyway! Let’s go to the tape, where you’ll find about as much to like as to dislike: COBB MILSAP (Michael Rooker).Sometimes the “falling” category can be uncomfortably literal, but let’s first give credit where it’s due: No one in the history of The Righteous Gemstones has done more with less time than Cobb Milsap. Fifteen minutes of screen time, max, and he accomplishes all of the following: three murders, one big-dicked car dealer forcibly menaced, one adult son slapped at his own birthday party, threatened his ex-wife, took down at least half a bottle of Beam, punched a coked-up Baby Billy in the solar plexus, got stabbed in the back by a custom-made knife wielded by the aforementioned son,andgot eaten by his own prize alligator. Points must be awarded for being as big a mess as this extremely messy show has ever had to offer. Just a historically nasty character. Cobb’s accomplishments tend to be sharply affected by their context, for good or otherwise: Did get eaten by an alligator, which while a stylish Dudes Rock-type death is still getting eaten by an alligator. Gets points for wearing double denim at the kids party, and in displaying choice knife-gifting chops at a reasonable price point for quality. (Again: Gil Hibben! A real guy!) Takes concrete steps to bond with his son, and the opposite of that for then hitting him and telling him his burgers are burning. He’s not wrong when he tells Lori she makes bad choices, but terribly wrong in thinking he’d be a better one. He’s proactive in dispensing with anybody who gets in his way, but you can safely set his situational awareness dial on negative five thousand, what with running out of bullets when it comes time to kill all thoseotherpeople in his way. Or you could, if that control panel wasn’t currently making its way through the digestive tract of Big Gus. (An aside: We would empty our wallets to watch this cast stageAntigonein a reptile park, except we kinda just got to see that very thing on Max for a reasonable monthly fee.) JESSE GEMSTONE (Danny McBride).Backsliding into his own worst tendencies, Jesse’s resting state is not the most pleasant of cul-de-sacs to begin with. The eldest Gemstone child is at heart a follower, a fact never more clear than when he pivots from \"This monkey was near bread I was thinking about eating\" to \"Can the monkey smoke for our entertainment?” Misses, in that same scene, the first of several opportunities in this episode to point out that Jesus had long hair. KELVIN GEMSTONE (Adam Devine).Relatable, in that he’s sulking and whining through afternoon meetings. Getting mommy-and-me feelings for Miss Lori, which if we’re being honest, is also relatable. Displays no visible follow-through on being TCFM, but champions earn their weeks off sometimes. VANCE SIMKINS (Stephen Dorff).Gets a coda to last week's sendoff even more ignominious than his TCFM defeat. Good. MARTIN IMARI (GregAlan Williams).Point: Shows up just long enough to dispense wisdom, and then wisely jets before the kids start saying words with their mouths. Counterpoint: Has not yet defrauded the Gemstones for millions, a caper that does not seem at all like it would be difficult to pull off. (Or maybe he’s been at it all along, and we’ll find out in a post-credits scene next week when he settles into a hammock in Bali with an umbrella drink in each hand. Let’s be optimistic.) THE LAW (J. Leon Pridgen II and Jackson Beals).A pair of highly cinematic deaths for two of Rogers’ finest. Looming divorce no longer a concern as a result. Still: There are better ways to be swayed to one’s doom than via free popcorn that’s been languishing in the machine all day at the Milsap Gator Park And Serpentarium, fellas. Y’allknowStacy hasn’t cleaned that thing since last Memorial Day.",

    "title": "What Was the New England Patriots’ Team Jet Doing at Guantánamo Bay?",
    "article_text": "In August 2024, private plane charter company Omni Air Internationalannounced a partnershipwith the NFL’s New England Patriots via a press release, a long-term agreement by which Omni would operate the team’s two custom-decorated Boeing 767-300s for “team travel and other charter flights including humanitarian and goodwill flights on behalf of the Kraft family, and as available for Omni’s other charter customers.”One of the planes, with tail number N36NE, was singled out in the announcement as particularly “attractive” to customers due to its custom seating arrangement, which includes 80 business-class seats. Maybe that’s what set it apart for whoever was on board on Monday, whenflight records showthat the plane made a trip from Fort Worth, Texas, to Guantánamo Bay, and a return flight the same day from Gitmo to Texas’s Fort Bliss. The Pats use the planes for team travel during the NFL’s season, and have been public about past non-athletic uses of the plane, like the2020 trip to pick up 1.5 million N95 masks from Chinaamid the Covid-19 pandemic, and the 2021 use of one of the aircraft toferry vaccinated healthcare workersto watch the team play in the Super Bowl, a trip gifted both from gratitude and to raise awareness of the importance of Covid vaccines. There are only so many reasons to go to Guantánamo Bay, and lately, pretty much all of them have to do withICE andDonald Trump’s gung-ho deportation push. At a congressional hearing earlier this month, it was revealed that about 400 migrants have been held (non-simultaneously) at the U.S. Navy base over the past two months, an endeavor that has cost more than $40 million in taxpayer funds. Patriots spokespersonAnisha Chakrabarti, contacted byVanity Fair, denied that the team’s plane had been used for rendition flights transporting migrants. “The New England Patriots plane was not used for any kind of deportation flight and there were no detainees on the plane,” Chakrabarti said via email. “Under our current charter manager, neither of the Patriots planes have ever been used for that purpose.” When the team isn’t using the planes, the charter company, Omni, manages them. “The New England Patriots organization is not involved in, nor does it approve, sanction, or coordinate the uses of the aircrafts when they are chartered for non-team purposes,\" Chakrabarti's statement continued. \"The charter company uses the Patriots planes as part of their inventory when chartering to the Department of Defense to move military personnel as well as other government agencies with no financial gain to the organization.” The Pats’ planes were previously managed by charter airline Eastern Airlines,a deal that resulted in a lawsuitalleging breach of contractby Eastern. It was under this contract that a2022 University of Washington Center for Human Rights report revealedthat Patriots-owned aircrafts had been used forat least three ICE rendition flightsto Honduras. Kathleen Bergin, an adjunct professor of law at Cornell University,wrote inFortunein 2021that migrants on ICE flights have reported being beaten and mistreated, a much different air travel experience from the well-paid athletes who also use the planes. “Athletes must accept that they are sitting in a seat perhaps last occupied by a migrant bloodied from abuse, or a parent taken from her child,” Bergin wrote. “Celebrities and corporate VIPs who’ve used their public image to promote human rights sacrifice their credibility the moment they board the plane.” Deputy White House press secretaryAnna KellytoldVFvia email, “While those assisting with President Trump’s mass deportation of migrant criminals are great patriots, there is no contract with the New England Patriots to facilitate deportations,” she said. Kym Dixon, a spokesperson for Omni parent company Air Transport Services Group, declined to elaborate on the nature of the flight when contacted byVF. “Due to the potential nature of the missions, we do not confirm flight or contract information,” she said via email. Omni counts the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security among two of its prominent government clients aspart of the so-called “ICE Air” program, and has been named in complaints of abuse of migrant passengers. Omni's parent company was recently acquired and taken private by Stonepeak ina $3.1 billion deal, but until April 11, 2025, none other thanAmazon owned nearly 20% of the parent company. The Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s agency, did not respond to a request for comment.

    "title": "59 Unforgettable Met Gala Looks",
    "article_text": "TheMet Gala, the annual fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, began as yet another society event in 1948. Through the decades, however, the Met Gala has evolved to become one of the year’s most exclusive invites for fashion and culture’s elite. No matter what the theme—whether 1999’s “Rock Style,” 2015’s “China: Through the Looking Glass,” 2025’s upcoming“Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,”or others through history—attendees show up and show out, bringing their most daring fashion out to play on the Met steps.

    "title": "New Polling Shows How Many People Hate Trump’s First 100 Days. What About the Next Thousand?",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpstormed back into power in January insisting he had a historic “mandate” to enact his extreme agenda. That was a dubious claim from the start. But, to the extent it was ever true, his mandate has largely evaporated over the course of his first 100 days in office. A majority of Americans regardDonald Trumpas a “dangerous dictator,” according to a newsurveyby the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute. After 100 days in office, the president's approval rating has tanked as he bleeds support on the two most salient issues of his successful 2024 campaign:the economyandimmigration. And, according to anew NPR/PBS/Marist poll, twice as many Americans give Trump an “F” grade over an “A” for how he’s handled the first 100 days in office. “Every single day is becoming increasingly worse,” asKen Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, summarized Trump’s first hundred days. “It’s bringing a whole host of folks who weren’t necessarily with us three months ago into this chorus of resistance,” he told me. Indeed, the unpopularity of Trump’s agenda has even seemed to rub off on those around him:Elon Musk, who has led Trump’s effort to dismantle the federal government, has said he willwithdrawfrom his role to focus on his car company, which has seen its stock plummet amid outrage over his antidemocratic work. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, havepulled back from public appearancesin their districts, reluctant to face the angry constituents who have turned up at town halls. None of this has significantly restrained Trump, who has swerved several times in his first hundred days, but continues to speed the United States toward his authoritarian fantasy. However, ithasbegun toreignite a resistance movement, and has given Democrats—demoralized by their 2024 losses—an opportunity to hit back. We saw one such counterattack in Wisconsin, where voters elected liberalSusan Crawfordto the state’s high court over her MAGA challenger. SenatorAdam Schiff, who led Trump’s first impeachment and has been a frequent target of the president’s ire, suggested recently that this iteration of the resistance may prove “more durable” than that of the first Trump term: “It may end up being a more crosscutting movement of American people to reject this authoritarian lurch,” the California Democrattold me. But the path ahead is riddled with unknowns: Trump has dismissed the opposition to his agenda the same way he has brushed off the notion that the other two branches of government can check his power. And Republicans—who control both the House and Senate—have given little indication so far they will stand in his way. As Minnesota GovernorTim Walz, the former vice presidential candidate, told a crowd of concerned Ohioans at a town hall I attended earlier this month, when Republicans are “more afraid of the people” than of Trump, “things [could] start to change.” But at least right now, Republicans clearly fear their leader more: “Retaliation is real,” as Alaska SenatorLisa Murkowskiconfessed in an appearance this month. That limits the Democrats’ power to deliver a formal institutional check on Trump. “The Republicans who used to believe in oversight and accountability now believe in overlooking and accommodating,” as Ohio DemocratShontel Brown, a member of the House Oversight Committee, told me. The public may be able to provide some check of its own—by making clear that he is acting outside of and beyond whatever “mandate” he thinks he earned with his 2024 victory. The backlash so far has already been responsible for some Trump backtracking, Brown said: “Hopefully, the people will be encouraged by that and not grow weary.” But of course,that’sthe challenge. It’s only been a hundred days of this, and there are more than a thousand to go. “I don’t know what the next 1,300 days looks like,” Brown told me, “but if it’s anything like the last hundred, we all have a lot to be worried about.” How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Gene Hackman’s Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Parris Goebel, Lady Gaga’s Coachella Choreographer, Talks Operas, Alexander McQueen, and Those Rihanna Rumors",
    "article_text": "Parris Goebel,the New Zealand–born co-creative director and choreographer behindLady Gaga’s Coachella performance, is no stranger to working with major pop stars. She was responsible for choreographingRihanna’s Super Bowl halftime show in 2023 andDoja Cat’s headlining set at last year’s Coachella. She’s created some of the most memorable moments in live concerts, including Doja’s rendition of “Demons” at Coachella—during which the pop star was covered in muppet-like blonde hair—and in music videos, withJustin Bieber’s “Sorry” and “What Do You Mean?” And the way she brought Lady Gaga’s Mayhem Ball to the desert was no exception. Presenting the performance as an opera, Goebel and Gaga took Coachella attendees on a journey through the pop star’s greatest hits and highlights fromMayhem,the synth-pop album she released in March. Just don’t ask Goebel for any spoilers in advance of Gaga’s Mayhem Ball tour, which kicks off in the United States in July; she gave a resounding “no comment” when asked how the tour and the now legendary Coachella set would differ. Vanity Fair:When did you start working with Lady Gaga on her Coachella performance? Parris Goebel:Honestly, we started pretty late because we had the “Abracadabra” music video and herSNLperformance. So I feel like we started later than we wanted to, about two months before Coachella, maybe even less. How many full run-throughs did you have before the first weekend? I feel like we only managed to have one. Onefulldress rehearsal before the show. Parris Goebel at The Cinema at Selfridges on July 25, 2024 in London, England. And what was that like? Mayhem! We were all a bit pushed for time. A show on this level, you just never have enough time. It was such a highly produced show. The lighting, the styling. Every look was custom-made. It just felt like no matter how hard all the departments were working, we just didn’t have enough time. The day before was a rough run-through. Things were going wrong. I was like, Are we going to pull this off? And then everything just was so smooth. It’s one of those “bad run-through, good show” instances. The dancers are the best of the best. When you are working with people who are masters of their craft, when it’s show time, everything just falls into place. During the second weekend of Coachella, there was a microphone issue during Gaga’s performance. Did you have a contingency plan for that? Well, you don’t expect that to happen. I don’t think we even thought of a backup plan. So yeah, I was gonna throw up as I was watching it happen. There was a stagehand in [Gaga’s] cage skirt. He’s there for safety. And there are back doors in the skirt, so he passed the microphone up to her really quickly. Gaga’s a pro. I loved how she played it off. What is the collaboration with Gaga like? How did you come up with the concept of making it an opera with five acts? Gaga and I talk every day, and we’re constantly sharing ideas, photos, and inspiration. It just kind of came to me: What if we do an opera house, like Mayhem Opera House? Throughout the rollout, we’ve been playing with the idea of what doesMayhem’s world look like? I’ve always had an obsession with theater. When I started working with Gaga, I very quickly learned that my wildest dreams and fantasies could transpire with her. I texted her, “Let’s do an opera house.” And she texted back and said, “I love it. Let’s do it.” How do you determine what songs to put into the set and their order? Gaga kept telling me she wanted to do the show of her dreams. And that meant we could not only do songs from her new album, but dive into her whole catalog and do the iconic songs and fan favorites. We were just like, “How do we make the most iconic opening ever?” And we started throwing out song names. “What if we open with ‘Abracadabra’?” I said we have to do “Scheiße,” because it’s my favorite. “And what if we end the act with ‘Poker Face’? It would be so unexpected.” I think people were expecting her to open with the new album, but we did this mash-up of new and old hits. I think it was the perfect blend to wake everyone up and say: She’s here! She’s back! What was the inspiration behind “Poker Face” and the chessboard? Was theAlexander McQueen 2005 showan inspiration? Both of us are heavily inspired by McQueen. He’s one of my favorite designers, and I’ve watched many documentaries on him. His fashion shows were just so ahead of their time. I don’t want to get too deep about the meaning of the “Poker Face” performance. It’s been cool to see what the fans took from it. I think it’s pretty obvious it’s this battle between herself that she fights every day. But also at the end of the day, she’s a human being. And I think people forget that. She has a really complex relationship with fame—the beauty and the darkness in it. It was cool to portray that in the “Poker Face” segment. Can you describe how you blended the old choreography from Gaga’s past with what you envisioned for this tour? The cool thing is, I’m coming in fresh with someone who already has such a massive legacy and impact on the world. I just wanted to honor what she’s done, what she’s created, and then also put a fresh twist on it. I’m always thinking about her fans. So it was like, What will the fans love to see again in this world, theMayhemworld? Then deciding to give them something new here, switching it up there. It was a beautiful balance of honoring what she’s done and then putting a fresh lens on it. You worked with Doja Cat on her headlining set at Coachella. What did you learn from that? I think the scale of the festival. Understanding that most people, like 90% of the crowd, are watching on screens. So really working closely with the DP and making sure it’s shot really beautifully, because at the end of the day, what really matters is what’s on the screens and what’s on the livestream. Making sure people at home that are watching can feel her spirit and her passion. And even if you’re in the crowd, you can feel immersed in the world. What’s the most fun part of putting together a performance at this level? This is probably the most fun I’ve ever had on a project, and I think that comes down to working with Gaga. Working with such a free thinker, someone who’s just open-minded and takes risks and cares about true artistry. She really puts the time, energy, and money into her art. You can see that. We both managed to lock ourselves away in this littleMayhemworld and be kids again. To dream and think big. And it was so theatrical. I really thrive in those spaces. I love the drama—how dance, music, and visuals can take you to another world. It’s obviously been a lot of hard work, but it’s been a dream. There were rumors that Rihanna was going to be doing a residency out of London. Were you at all involved with that? There are always rumors with her. So, you know, I think just take it as a rumor. Are there any artists you want to collaborate with in the future? Tyler, the Creator, Doechii,andPharrell.

    "article_text": "It’s hard to believe it’s been fourteen years sincePrince Williammarried his university sweetheart,Kate Middleton. Having charted their romance from those heady days at the University of St Andrews to their wedding at Westminster Abbey, April 29th2011, is a day I fondly remember. The roar of the crowds on the mall as the newly married Duke and Duchess of Cambridge stepped out onto the famousBuckingham Palacebalcony for the very first time was palpable. Both William and Kate were beaming, unable to conceal their joy. Kate in her magnificent Alexander McQueen wedding dress looked every inch the modern princess while William, resplendent in his red Colonel of the Irish Guards frock coat, looked like the proudest man on the planet. As they surveyed the sea of people which stretched from the gleaming Queen Victoria Memorial to St James’s Park, William whispered to his wife: “Shall we do one more?” The world had waited patiently for that kiss, but when William leaned in for a second, the crowds cheered and stamped so loudly, I remember the floor of the studio where I was broadcasting, vibrating. Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smile following their marriage at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011 in London, England. The couple was on such a high that when they went back to Clarence House ahead of the evening reception – they watched the entire wedding on playback. As I revealed in my book,The Making of A Royal Romance, Kate was still in her tiara. Perhaps on Tuesday, as they toast 14 years together, they will reflect on some of the highlights of that magical day.The couple is in Scotland on a two-day tour of the Inner Hebrides, their first joint trip away since Princess Kate announcedshe had been diagnosed with cancer last March. Usually, William and Kate celebrate their wedding anniversary privately but when they were told the trip fell on their anniversary, they were more than happy to take advantage of the opportunity for a night away. Eschewing the luxury of a five-star hotel, the couple will be staying in a modest lodge in the remote countryside. It is, according to those who know the couple best, their idea of a perfect night in. “They really love the simple things in life,” a family friend tellsVanity Fair. “A little cottage in the middle of nowhere is their idea of heaven.” Prince William, Prince of Wales, known as the Duke of Rothesay and Catherine, Princess of Wales, known as the Duchess of Rothesay when in Scotland, smile during a tour of an artisan market on April 29, 2025 in Tobermory, Scotland. That they are in Scotland is also poignant and romantic. They met at the University of St Andrews and they spent much of their early courtship eloping to a remote cottage on the grounds of theBalmoral estatefor long weekends as students. Recently,the couple has returned to the Scottish Highlandsfor a handful of romantic trips together, leaving their three children at home with Kate’s parents, and spending some much-needed time together after what has been a challenging time for the family. Last year, Prince William opened up and revealed that 2024, when bothhis fatherand wife were diagnosed with cancer, had been “brutal” and one of the hardest years of his life. A year and two months after Kate’s cancer diagnosis, the future looks a lot brighter as she has been given the all-clear and has returned to work. Sources close to the family say that her prognosis is very positive and that she is “doing exceptionally well.” Princess Kate has said she is doing everything she can to stay cancer-free, and while she has returned to work, her priorities are her health and her family. “Getting cancer changed her, it changed William, and it changed everything between them. They were both shocked to their core, but they knew they would get through it together,” reveals a family friend. “William stepped up. He made Catherine front and center of everything and will continue to do so. It’s made them both prioritize family and each other over everything else.” King Charles III and Queen Camilla attend the traditional Easter Sunday Mattins Service at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on April 20, 2025 in Windsor, England. Certainly,the couple’s recent decision to skip Easter SundaywithKing CharlesandQueen Camillaso that they could celebrate quietly as a family was a change noted by royal watchers. Last year, the family was in Norfolk for the Easter holidays and Kate was undergoing treatment, but their decision not to join Charles and senior royals a second year in a row was significant. “Usually they are there, and everyone loves seeing the little ones. This year they decided to have a quiet family Easter. The king was fully supportive, and I think it is an example of William and Catherine doing things the way they want to and doing what works for them as a family,” adds the royal insider. Spending time together is said to be the couple’s number one priority. “They know with the children growing up andGeorgeabout to start a new school, the family unit as it is will change a bit and they want to spend as much time together as they can,” the source adds. “They love being in Norfolk, it’s where they bond as a family and where they make very happy memories. It’s their happy place and they love being there.” Prince William, Prince of Wales, Prince Louis of Wales, Prince George of Wales, Catherine, Princess of Wales and Princess Charlotte of Wales attend the Christmas Morning Service at Sandringham Church on December 25, 2024 in Sandringham, Norfolk. While they have been married for 14 years, the couple’s long-term courtship means they have actually been together for more than two decades. “Like all couples, the relationship has ups and downs, but I would say they are stronger than ever, they are a very tight partnership,” says a long-standing friend. “It’s very clear that William is deeply in love with his wife, more than ever, and she is eternally grateful to him for the support he has given her this past year and how he has been with the children. He has shouldered a lot.” Indeed, a lot has happened over the course of fourteen years: the couple has had three children, moved to Windsor for a quieter life out of the spotlight, and become the Prince and Princess of Wales following the death of Queen Elizabeth II. The past year has been the most eventful and the toughest for them as a family, but watching them in Scotland on Tuesday, twinning in matching tweeds, while doing what they love is a reminder of their brilliant partnership that is vital to the future of the British monarchy and why they really should be celebrating such an important milestone.

    "title": "Did Princess Diana Spend a Night Out in Drag With Freddie Mercury?",
    "article_text": "AfterPrincess Dianamarried the futureKing Charles IIIin 1981, the couple moved into a large apartment at Kensington Palace, where Diana would remain even after they separated a decade later. Though the palace was in the middle of London, it is an isolated oasis surrounded by gardens. Still, the princess took advantage of city living and was apparently known to exit the palace grounds in disguise in order to enjoy nearby bars and hot spots, especially during the years after her divorce. In his new book,Dianaworld: An Obsession,authorEdward Whiteretells a vivid story of the princess’s escapades, when she joined the actress and TV presenterCleo Rocoson a journey to the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, a famous London gay bar in the late 1980s.In her memoir, Rocos writes that she, Diana, and Freddie Mercury were at the apartment of TV host Kenny Everett, watchingGolden Girlson TV when the princess had an idea. “At some point in the evening, Rocos claims, Diana persuaded them to take her to the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, a place that Everett warned was ‘not for you . . . full of hairy gay men.’ Diana was insistent, however, so Everett helped her disguise herself in male drag,” White writes, in an excerpt that appeared inPeople. According to Rocos, Diana's costume included aviator sunglasses, a leather cap, and army jacket. “It seemed to work,” White writes. “They stayed for one drink and left. Diana returned to Kensington Palace and sent back Everett’s clothes the following day.” In his book, which dives into the worldwide fascination with Princess Diana and how it has lasted long after her death, White admits that the story seems a bit “far-fetched.” But the legend has had a fascinating afterlife, eventually becoming the subject of Desmond O’Connor’s cabaret musicalRoyal Vauxhall,which premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festin 2016.“Irrespective of its veracity, the story of Diana in drag at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern has been taken up as an illustration of her connection with the gay community and a metaphor for her own search for a family in which she felt truly accepted,” White adds. Along with her activism with AIDS patients, Diana’s accepting attitude meant that she gained the status of gay icon in life and in death. Though it’s unclear if Diana and Mercury really spent a night on the town together before his death in 1991, we know they were in the same place on one night. In 1985, both were present at the Live Aid concert in Wembley Stadium, which brought together some of the world’s biggest pop stars to raise awareness about world hunger. Together, Diana and Charles opened the concert, and Queen was on the night’s list of performers. According toMark Blake’s 2011 bookIs This the Real Life?: The Untold Story of Queen,the prince and princess spent the night sitting in front of the band and their entourage.

    "title": "Meghan Markle’s Strategy to Win Us Over With Pictures of Her Children Is Working",
    "article_text": "For the last five years,Meghan MarkleandPrince Harryhave been livinga private life in Montecito, the exclusive Santa Barbara enclave where they purchased a home in July 2020. But ever since the duchessstarted a new Instagram account in January, she has been posting photos from the 7.4-acre estate, including images of her children that would have previously been reserved for a TV special orNetflix docuseries. Over the weekend,Prince ArchieandPrincess Lilibet of Sussexwere the stars of a post on Meghan’s account, which featured them in the family’s garden. “Sunday kind of love…with my little loves,” Meghan captioned the photo, which showed off Archie and Lili’s fiery red hair but not their faces. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Lili also moonlit as a taste taster inan Instagram Stories videothat demonstrated Meghan turning strawberries from the garden intopreserves. “What do we think, Lili?” Meghan said in footage that only featured her three-year-old daughter’s hands. Lili replied, “I think it’s beautiful.” The posts are a sign that Meghan and Harry are comfortable giving the public a sneak peek into their home life in a way that is closer to what they might have done when still living in the palace. When they first became parents in May 2019, Meghan and Harry were working royals, and that meant there was some expectation that their children would also be public figures. But from the beginning,they had plans to do things differentlythanKate MiddletonandPrince William,who, like Princess Diana and thenPrince Charlesbefore them, posed for photos on the steps of the Lindo Wing at St. Mary’s Hospital in London soon after each of their children were born. In contrast, Harry and Meghan delayed Archie’s birth announcement until after they had returned home from the hospital, bypassing the traditional Royal Rota press information system in favor of a post on their now defunct joint Instagram account, @SussexRoyal. The new member of the Windsor clan was first introduced to the world ina Frogmore Hall photo callthat took place two days after his birth, but Meghan and Harry’s bid for some control had already caused a serious controversy among the UK’s tabloid media, which ultimately led the couple to becoming more agitated by press intrusion. Eventually, though, Archie was shown in official photos of his christening, and when Harry and Meghan took a trip to South Africa that fall, he posed with Archbishop Desmond Tutu. By the time Lilibet was born in June 2021, more than a year had passed since their initial royal exit, and the couple was luxuriating in their privacy. They shut down their Instagram account and were vigilant about protecting their children, evensuinga photo agency that sought a photo of Archie in 2020. That said, by announcing Meghan’s second pregnancy withan image from a maternity shootandsharing their baby’s genderduring a high-profile interview withOprah Winfrey,they were walking a fine line between privacy and publicity that would later be mocked inaSouth Parkparody, which called their recent years a “Worldwide Privacy Tour.” The first public picture of Lili was a profile view in the family’s 2021 holiday card, and the public didn’t see her whole face until the next summer. In June 2022, photographerMisan Harrimanshared a portrait he took at her first birthday party, which was held duringQueen Elizabeth II’s Platinum Jubilee weekend. Though the public hasn’t gotten a direct view of her face since, Lili in particular has becomean increasingly large partof Meghan’s social media output. When Meghan launched lifestyle company As Ever, Liliwas a costar in the brand imagery, seen running alongside her mother in an aerial photograph. In hindsight, it’s clear that some of the differences between Archie and Lili’s early relationship with the press have to do with their safety. In the years since their royal exit, Harry’s battle with the UK government over his security hasrevealedexactly how specific and credible the threats against the family were. In 2022, the Metropolitan Police’s former head of counterterrorism told UK network Channel 4 that the threats against the couple from right-wing extremists were “disgusting and very real.” Over the past few years, Meghan’s relationship with social media has also changed greatly. During her five-year break from Instagram, she and Harry became involved with activism against hate speech and online bullying through their Archewell Foundation. When Meghan rejoined the platform in January, she turned the comments feature off. A source toldVanity Fairthat she only returned after discussions with the platform’s parent company, Meta, and was looking forward to connecting directly with her audience. At last week’s event spotlighting online safety for children, the duchesstold reportersthat she hoped adults would use social media “to set an example and really put as much good and joy into the world as we can” to counteract some of the negative effects of social media that she has encountered in the course of her charity work. Meghan has helped tofundandpromote educational programsto help teenagers have healthier relationships to the digital world,notingthat it became a priority because of her own experiences. There has also been a sea change in how many well-known figures approach public images of their children. The move toward privacy beganin the early 2010s, when celebrities likeHalle Berry, Jennifer Garner,andKristen Bellfought for changes in how paparazzi and media outlets treat the children of celebrities. Over the last five years, influencers of all sizes have started to rethink sharing their children’s identities and private information, leading to thenow common emoji strategyfor covering a child’s face. For TikTok star and podcasterBobbi Althoff,this started when she realizedher two-year-old daughter had already been the target of harassment. Recent scandals around child influencers and family vloggers have started a legal movement encouraging states to pass laws promoting child privacy and the right to be forgotten. Meghan and Harry’s shifting attitudes about the relationship between their children and the public might just come downstream of their relationship to the royal family. Though the Sussex clan is reportedly not on great terms with the rest of the Windsors, Archie and Lili stillreceived royal titleswhen their grandfather, King Charles III, ascended the throne in September 2022, and they are currently sixth and seventh in the line of succession and featured onthe monarchy’s official website. For Archie,current lawstates that he would technically need the king’s permission to get married, though that could change in the future.As with their royal cousins, there might eventually be a time when Archie and Lili choose to take on a more public role for themselves. Of course, some of the changes might have to do with the fact that Harry and Meghan’s kids are slightly older now. For the early years of Lili’s life, Meghan had reduced her public activities significantly, and in interviews,she saidmotherhood had become her main focus. Over the last year, Meghan has launcheda business,a TV show, anda podcast. After a few years away from the spotlight, she seems to be embracing life in the public eye again. When she traveled to New York for an appearance at the Time 100 summit this past Wednesday,Harry accompanied herfrom their hotel to the conference venue but was happy waiting in the wings while his wife had her moment onstage. In an interview earlier this year, Meghan said that her kids were getting to the age where she felt like she could include them in her activities and get some of her personality back. “When your children get to a certain age—when you’re not just playing in the sandbox with them but almost playing in your own sandbox again—it’s super joyful,” she toldPeoplein March. “As a woman, a mom and a wife, to be able to find yourself again—in a way that was always present but that you maybe couldn’t put as much attention on as you now can when your kids are a little bit older—is a wonderful feeling.” How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Gene Hackman’s Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Bruce Springsteen Can’t Believe Everyone in the E Street Band Still Likes Each Other",
    "article_text": "Bruce Springsteengets asked all the time when he plans to hang up his guitar. “You meet people who go, ‘When are you going to retire?’” he said on Monday, likening it to someone asking him: “Are you still alive?” Indeed, Springsteen and the E Street Band are still hard-charging around the world, more than a half century after their founding. As for retiring, the 75-year-old rock icon has an unequivocal answer:Never.“At this late date, like we say in the film, we’re going to be rolling until the wheels come off,” he said. The Boss made these remarks at the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences in North Hollywood on Monday after a screening of his documentaryRoad Diary, an Emmy hopeful that’s streaming on Hulu and Disney+.Joined by his longtime E Street Band drummerMax Weinbergand the film’s Emmy- and Grammy-winning director,Thom Zimny,Springsteen was in a reflective mood. The film intercuts the band’s recent global tour with flashes back to its legendary past. It’s no coincidence that his 1984 hit “No Surrender” opened most shows. Springsteen haswon 20 Grammysover the decades, with 51 total nominations, and in 1994 he won the original-song Oscar for “Streets of Philadelphia” from theTom Hanks–Denzel WashingtonfilmPhiladelphia.He was honored with a specialTony Awardin 2018 for his storytelling Broadway show. If he gets an Emmy this year as the writer and producer ofRoad Diary,he’ll be one of the few artists in the world to score afull EGOT. Even Springsteen acknowledged how unusual it is that he and the E Street Band are still working. “I mean, we’ve been together for 50 years. The nature of bands is to break up, it’s not to stay together,” he says. “Everything deteriorates in the natural world.” Weinberg has been playing with Springsteen since 1974. The only two longtime members of the band who aren’t still playing with them are organist Danny Federici and saxophonist Clarence Clemons, who died in 2008 and 2011, respectively. The film explores how their influence on their bandmates continues, even more than a decade after their deaths. Springsteen says such bonds are typically unheard of in the music industry. “Forget aboutbandsbreaking up; usuallytwo peoplecan’t stay together,” he says. “Simoncan’t staywith Garfunkel.Sam hated Dave. Phil EverlyhatedDon Everly. Hall don’t likeOates. You know, the Gallagher brothers…forget that. So that’s just human nature.” He theorized that for most people, the test of time is simply too much to overcome. “Imagine this, if in your job, the people you went to high school with—you arestillwith those people 50 years later doing the same job. I mean, you go througheverythingwith those people. So it’s a very, very unnatural thing for bands to stay together. And particularly bands when you get to our vintage.” Springsteen then counted on his fingers the reasons that such musical acts do continue to tour. “I mean there’s a lot of reasons bands stay together. You know, money. Uh…money. And money,” he joked. “So in our case, we’re lucky. Our band still legitimately likes one another. The film sort of encapsulates an amazing thing—the band remains as committed to its ideals as it was from the beginning.” The drummer persisted with the band even when he experienced grave medical concerns. “You have to understand something about Max Weinberg,” Springsteen said. “Max, how many operations have you had on your hands?” “Oh, I’ve had eight operations on my hands,” the drummer answered. “Two on my back, with my shoulder rebuilt…all to serve.” “And he’s skipping over his 13-hour heart surgery,” Springsteen added. The drummer kept that procedure hidden from his bandmates until he was on the mend. “I said, ‘Max, Jesus Christ, why didn’t you tell me, man? I could have killed you doing one of the encores,’” Springsteen said. “But I have to salute Max. As you can watch in the film, he’s doing things that guy half his age would have a very difficult time doing.” As for other difficulties, Springsteen and Weinberg revealed at the Q&A that they got over their squabbles early. “When Max initially got in the band—and I don’t think he’d mind me telling you this—he had trouble staying in time,” Springsteen says. “It was onThe Riveralbum. I said, ‘Max, here’s why you have to stay in time. When you stay in time, you deepen the characters in my writing. You make them more steadfast, steady. You dig deeper into their souls and you bring more meaning to my music.’ And what’d you do? Max went home and slept with his drum kit.” “It was my rock-and-roll bar mitzvah conversation,” Weinberg says. “It took place in June of 1979, in the lounge of a recording studio in New York. I was 28, and it really did change my life. I had a lot of potential. At that age, I also had a lot of anxiety that I brought out in my drumming. But Bruce sat me down and we talked. Well, Ilistened.He talked.” Weinberg said Springsteen made a cinematic reference to get him to see the beat of the song in a different way. “He used a wonderful metaphor,” Weinberg says. “He said, ‘Picture a John Ford movie. The character is on the horse going across Monument Valley.’ And I’ll never forget this: ‘You are the mountains. You have to be the mountains.’ That conversation changed the course of my life, because I’d been in the band five years. I could have gone one way; I went the other way. When Bruce said I slept with a drum set, I went into this deep, deep [study].” The drummer said he essentially relearned how to play. “I went back, took drum lessons, I talked to drummers,” he said. “The expedient thing would have been just simply bringing in someone else. Very common. But Bruce came in and said to me, ‘I know you can do this.’ And the strength of that conversation, the belief that he had in me, that I could rise to the occasion…I think that’s what Thom captured in this movie.” Zimny has been working with Springsteen since the 2001 specialLive in New York City,and directed the 2018 filmSpringsteen on Broadwayamong other projects. He said his approach was to stay close, but also stay out of the way. “I have been blessed with a lot of time that people don’t think about me being there, and I don’t make myself a presence. I’m taking in everything, but I’m not announcing anything. I’m just invisible,” he says. “There’s an energy there that you just want to be part of.” Weinberg recalled his earliest days playing with Springsteen, when they were doing marathon shows in September 1974. “Bruce will remember this. It was outside of Philadelphia, and we had yet another show to do. [I said,] ‘Bruce, how do you do this twice in a row?’ He said, ‘The key is, youdon’tpace yourself. You give a thousand percent all the time.’ And that was really important to hear. When you adopt that and internalize it, it just becomes a natural way of doing it.” “It’s a good job,” Springsteen concluded. “And…it pays very well.” How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Gene Hackman’s Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Mark Zuckerberg Says He’s “Raw-Dogging Reality”",
    "article_text": "Mark Zuckerbergknows people think he’s a robot. So this week, he popped by podcasterTheo Von’s showto demonstrate that he is, in fact, a regular human. A regular human who believes that, in life, “You want your car to have almost as much horsepower as your helicopter,” he told Von. Just a normal Joe with an underground tunnel at his compound in Kauai, but “it’s not that big of a tunnel,” he clarified. He is simply your average guy’s guy who said that “sometimes on vacation” he drinks coffee “recreationally,” but for the most part, he prefers “raw dogging reality,” an unfortunate phrase Zuckerberg used not once, but twice, while peering through Meta’s thick-framed AI glasses with a camera embedded in the corner. Guy stuff! Zuckerberg’s appearance onThis Past Weekendis just the latest in his tour of the manosphere podcast circuit, which also recently included astoponThe Joe Rogan Experiencein January, where he critiqued the “culturally neutered” workforce and called for “more masculine energy” in the corporate world. All of it is part of the Meta CEO’s attempt to transform himself in the public eye from a tight t-shirt wearing apologist for Facebook’s failings into a loose t-shirt wearing, jiu jitsu fightingalpha male. On podcasts, Zuck can escape the inconvenient questions about, oh, the existential antitrust trialMeta is going throughor his recent coziness withDonald Trump, and instead bro out about his morning jiu jitsu routine and how he met his wifePriscilla Chanin the bathroom line at a college party. “Where were you at in school?” Von asked, somehow. “Harvard,” Zuckerberg said, before noting later, “There's this whole movie that got made about all this stuff.” Still, to Von’s credit, even Zuckerberg’s answers to some of his simplest questions were revealing. Asked about the most “magical” date he’s ever taken his wife on, Zuckerberg said, instead, that he personally loves working with artists, so he commissioned a sculpture of his wife and put it in the front yard. “Because I'm like, I'm not gonna make a sculpture of myself. That's crazy,” he said. “I don't think she was that happy with it, because again, I mean, who wants a sculpture of themselves in the front yard?” He said he also designed a souped up minivan for her because \"I like cars, but I'm not going to design a supercar for myself.” Over the course of the conversation Zuckerberg touched on some more meaty topics, like the future of AI (\"We're going to have systems that are smarter than than any individual.”), higher education (“Maybe not everyone needs to go to college, because there's a lot of jobs that don't require that.”), and raising his three daughters to be fluent in technology (“I want them to learn how to code, how to use technology. I think it's important because a lot of socialization obviously happens online at this point.”) But the closest Zuckerberg came to being challenged was when Von asked earnestly, “Is social media bad?” “I don't think so,” the Facebook founder replied. “Our modern online environment is, it's just an environment where we live in a way that has pros and cons.” Alright then! Von also asked Zuckerberg why it seems like the most socially awkward people (See also:Elon Musk) control the technology that's supposed to socially connect people. Zuckerberg, at least, didn’t take offense. “Obviously I’m the most awkward person,” he said. “People have been calling me a robot online for 20 years.\" He conceded that communication isn’t his strong suit. “I got to where I am because I think I kind of understand what people like, and I have the ability to build it, but I don't think my strength is: Oh I can really communicate about why what I'm building is awesome.” Von didn’t put up much of a protest. “There are times,\" Von said, \"where, yeah, you seem like a guy who probably watched a video of how to be a guy on YouTube.” How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Gene Hackman’s Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Terrence Howard Rejected Marvin Gaye Biopic Because He Didn’t Want to Kiss a Man",
    "article_text": "Terrence Howard,the Oscar-nominated actor who once claimed thatone times one equals two, has found another thing he can’t compute: kissing a man onscreen. Speaking toBill Maheron the host’sClub Randompodcast, Howard said that the “biggest mistake” of his career was turning down the lead role in a potentialSmokey Robinsonbiopic, something he did because he was already in talks withEmpirecocreatorLee Danielsabout playing another musician. That would be “Sexual Healing” and “What’s Going On” singer Marvin Gaye. Though Gaye had straight relationships—he married twice before his death at age 44—he’s also faced speculation about his sexuality. “I was over atQuincy Jones’s house,” Howard told Maher, “and I’m asking Quincy, ‘I’m hearing rumors that Marvin was gay.’ And I’m like, ‘Was he gay?’ And Quincy’s like, ‘Yes.’” (In a 2018 interview withVulture,Jones alleged that Gaye was one of several famous men who slept with Marlon Brando: “He’d fuck anything. Anything! He’d fuck a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye.”) Once Howard learned this information, he could no longer entertain the idea of following through with the project. “They would’ve wanted to do that, and I wouldn’t have been able to do that,” said the actor. Maher then said, “You mean you couldn’t kiss a guy onscreen in a movie?” Howard replied, “No, because I don’t fake it. That would fuck me. I’d cut my lips off. If I kissed some man, I would cut my lips off.” Howard maintained that he bowed out of the project because he knew he wouldn’t be able to fully “play that character 100%—I can’t surrender myself to a place that I don’t understand.” The actor’s comments echoed controversial remarks that he made on thePBD Podcastearlier this month. “I’ve lost businesses because I don’t bend over in that way. I don’t compromise. I don’t play gay roles. I don’t kiss a man,” said theIron Manstar. “I don’t do that shit because the man card means everything.” There have been multipleattempted Marvin Gaye biopicsover the years, involving stars likeLenny KravitzandLaw & Order’sJesse L. Martin,as well asStraight Outta ComptonfilmmakerF. Gary Gray.Vanity Fairhas reached out to reps for Daniels for comment on Howard’s version of events. Elsewhere on the podcast, Howard revealed that he was on board withDonald Trumpuntil the president carried outmass deportations—in the exact way Trump said he wouldwhile running for reelection. “I was all in his corner,” Howard said. But “that right there, that hit me. I was like, Dude, you can’t do that to somebody’s family. You cannot do that. Bring them home.” Maher, who has received criticism from figuressuch asLarry Davidfor praising Trump as “gracious and measured” after visiting with the president late last month, agreed with Howard’s stance. “You just can’t send American citizens…right to a prison, and not just a prison—a gulag,” Maher said. Want more off-the-cuff remarks from Howard? You’re in luck. The actor recently toldTMZthat he plans to launch his own Hollywood-centered podcast, which he described as a “studio’s nightmare and every actor’s wet dream.” How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Gene Hackman’s Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Florence Pugh Is a Marvel in the Otherwise Dreary Thunderbolts*",
    "article_text": "After the disappointment ofCaptain America: Brave New World, andThe Marvelsbefore that (andAnt-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania, andEternals), we probably can’t blame Marvel for being a bit down in the dumps. The studio has had some rough going in the last few years, a steep fall from a decade-plus of utter market dominance, gilded with good reviews. Which might explain the existence ofThunderbolts*(May 2—and yes, the asterisk is meant to be there), a film about dejection and disillusionment and aimlessness. The movie opens on a morose note, asFlorence Pugh’s weary assassin Yelena explains in voiceover that she feels deadened by the loss of her sister (Scarlett Johansson’sBlack Widow) and the empty routine of her life. She’s merely going through the motions, which in her case are flips and kicks and punches as she infiltrates some kind of high-tech science facility with deadly results. Everyone around her is in a similar funk. The Avengers have been lost—to age, to mortality, to expired studio contracts—and the world has become a grayer place. Former killing machine Bucky, a.k.a. the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), is trying his hand at legitimacy as a newly elected congressman, but he seems itchy in that particular suit. Yelena’s dad, Alexei/Red Guardian (David Harbour), is couch-bound and nostalgic for his glory days. The only person who seems to be having any fun is Yelena’s boss, the nefarious deep state wheeler-dealer Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). But even she is under congressional investigation and feeling the hot breath of justice on her neck. Directed byJake Schreierand written byEric PearsonandJoanna Calo,Thunderbolts*is designed as a tale of wayward misfits finding renewed purpose in life. The film leans into the doleful comedy of these once-wicked people contemplating the shambles they’ve made of themselves, while also trying to interrogate something serious. On occasion the film is wryly amusing. But too often the humor is strained, playing as meek attempt to laugh through the pain—for the characters, the movie itself, the entire franchise, even. “Haha! We are having fun,” says this newly nervous and bruised juggernaut, desperate to recapture the good times but unable to fend off the lingering haunt of a paradise snatched away. Thunderbolts*is meant to propel Marvel out of its slump and toward its next great era, when a new team of heroes will emerge and eventually battle a phase-spanning super villain. (In this case, I believe that will beRobert Downey Jr.’s Dr. Doom.) Yelena does indeed find herself in a wary alliance with other murderous sad sacks, includingWyatt Russell’s John Walker—who flopped terribly during his brief stint as Captain America—andHannah John-Kamen’s Ghost, last seen inAnt-Man and the Wasp. But they’re lacking the gleam of the old gang. This is partly the fault of their characters’ B-tier status, and partly because time and saturation have made all this superhero stuff feel so much less special. By the time this ragtag band is dragged back to the streets outside Grand Central Station—where the Avengers first did big battle together 13 years ago—the “here we go again” ofThunderbolts*is ultimately one of exasperation instead of excitement. Still, the film is stylishly shot and well performed—especially by Pugh, one of the most magnetic film actors of her generation. The wise-beyond-its-years scratch of her voice is nicely complemented by her nimble comic touch. She’s utterly natural in a story of wholly unnatural things, a rare and difficult feat. The film has given her an actual emotional arc to play, and she finds interesting variations within it. I only wish that Yelena’s journey was drawn out more carefully and thoughtfully; we’re really only given a few scenes to grasp the weight or meaning of it before we’re meant to be deeply moved. The end result is less than effective, though the attempt is appreciated. As is the film’s curious choice of villain, a mega-hero who is essentially a depressive Superman. There’s a bit of Homelander, from the TV seriesThe Boys, in there too, though I’m not sure Marvel would appreciate that comparison. Either way, the character has an interesting pathos: his villainy is motivated entirely by personal sorrow rather than any mandate to galactic domination. In that way,Thunderbolts*is almost quaint, a standalone and downbeat little side adventure into the more shadowy corners of a world governed by übermensches. Alas, downbeat little side adventures are not going to get the Marvel engine back up to full speed. And soThunderbolts*must, inevitably, draw the rest of the universe toward it, which makes all of its discrete action seem thin and insufficient. Here these weary characters are, trying to tend to their psychic wounds, while the weight of something enormous bears down on them. I suppose that’s the point of the film. But one nonetheless leavesThunderbolts*wishing the powers that be would simply let them mope in peace.

    "title": "How Miriam Adelson Went From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days",
    "article_text": "One hundred days ago,Miriam Adelsonwas on top of the world. The billionaire and far-right mega-donor was in the Capitol Rotunda, dressed in an all-white version of a Sgt. Pepper’s coat and her signature round sunglasses, standing next toLaura BushandBarack Obama,watching her chosen candidate, the man she had spent more than $100 million on, be sworn in as president. Her basketball team, the Dallas Mavericks, was fresh off of a run to the NBA finals, thanks toLuka Dončić,the league’s most talented young superstar. Las Vegas Sands, the gambling company founded by her late husband and fellow kingmaker Sheldon Adelson, was making slow progress toward its long-term goal of building a casino about 20 minutes’ drive from the squad’s home court. Perhaps most exciting, at least from a pure profit perspective, was the firm’s potential to land a license to operate a casino on Long Island, just outside of New York City, widely believed to be the one of the most lucrative untapped gambling markets on the planet. If Sands could secure it, the MAGA queen would have a cash register that would never stop ringing. Ofcourseshe was happy. But that was 100 days ago. In the three months or so since, Trump’s approval rating has tanked as he declared a trade war on the entire world—even on Israel, where Adelson was born, and where she remains an influential figure. Under the leadership of Adelson’s son-in-law,Patrick Dumont,the Mavericksgave away their superstarin what was instantly panned as theworst trade in NBA history. The Adelsons’ family-controlled company, Las Vegas Sands, dropped its plans to build theDallas-area gambling housefor now. And now there’s New York, where Sands spent about $400 million and hired a squad of lawyers, lobbyists, architects, engineers, and image makers, all for a chance at that jackpot in Nassau County. On Wednesday, Sands president Dumont announced to investors that the Adeslon family wasending its East Coast pursuit, after more than a decade of trying. Miriam’s winning streak was over. Dumont, inan investor call, blamed Sands’ change of heart on the rise of online gambling as a competitor to real-world action. (A company spokesperson declined to comment on the record for this story, and pointed toSands’ statementon the topic.) Multiple sources familiar with the situation tellVanity Fairthat’s only a partial answer. Politics was one of several other factors. Adelson wasn’t the only Trump superfan trying to bid in this cobalt blue state. But she was the most visible. The president’s erratic, extreme first 100 days only made any highlighting of that connection more uncomfortable, pushing get-along moderates like GovernorKathy Hochulto reposition themselves as hell-no resistors. In that way, Adelson’s big bet on Trump may have helped spoil her even bigger bet on New York. “Not a fucking chance that Kathy Hochul lets a casino owned by Miriam Adelson into Nassau County, in the state of New York,” one casino industry insider says. “It’s like [liberal billionaire]George Sorosopening a casino in Fort Worth. Ain’t happening.” Technically, the state gaming commission will make the final decision on who gets three casino licenses in the New York City region later this year. “The governor isn’t getting involved in the process whatsoever, and anyone claiming otherwise is just lying,” says one senior Democrat in Albany, the state capital. Hochul’s office directedVanity Fairto similar pledges by the governor to stay hands-off. But even getting thechanceto bid requires getting approval from local politicians. Sands long ago hired former Democratic governorDavid Patersonto help the famously Republican Adelsons in their New York casino quest. (“There was a lot of chatter that we were Republicans, we were Trumpers, we were, you know, blah, blah, blah,” one source familiar with the matter says. “So Paterson softens some of that.”) FormerMichael BloombergspokespersonMichael Levoffalso became SVP of public affairs and strategy at Sands, which retained the services of a number of outside PR and lobbying gurus, includingStu Loeser,another Bloomberg alum and the former communications director forChuck Schumer. Sands needed the help. According toNew York,it was competing against 10 other teams, made up of awho’s-who of political, cultural, and financial power players, including Mets ownerSteve Cohen,the rapperNas,his crosstown rivalJay-Z,new World Trade Center towers builderLarry Silverstein,former police commissionerBill Bratton,andJoe Sitt,the king of Coney Island real estate. Each team pledged billions of dollars to their casino proposals. And each team came with its own phalanx of fixers, lobbyists, and publicists. Of course, many of the bidders have current and former connections to the president, a onetime casino mogul himself. Wynn Resorts, the gambling company founded by Trump allySteve Wynn,is teaming up with Trump donorStephen Ross’s real estate behemoth for a massive casino project on the west side of Manhattan. Bally’s wants to build a casino on the site of the old Trump golf course in the Bronx; if it wins, according toThe New York Times,the Trump Organizationgets $115 million—a lot of money, but not nearly as much as the Adelsons have contributed to Republican campaigns like Trump’s over the years. Sands scouted locations throughout the five boroughs. Eventually, in January of 2023, it landed on an enormous, 80-acre property just outside of it: the current site of Nassau Coliseum, the home arena of the New York Islanders hockey team for 43 seasons, until 2015, and the site of32Billy Joelconcerts. Perennial Republican candidate and freshly installed Nassau County executiveBruce Blakemanquickly gravitated to the idea. The Adelsons and the Blakemans went back decades. Sheldon Adelson, Miriam’s late husband and fellow kingmaker, hadfinanced a political groupfronted by Bruce’s brother, according toNewsday. Sands launched a multipronged campaign to promote the casino. It enlisted ordinarily left-leaning groups, such as the local AFL-CIO and the NAACP branches, with the promise of thousands of new jobs for residents. The company poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into local charities, and estimated that the casino would generate another billion or more to “county, town, police, and community organizations.”David Beckhamflew in for apromotional event. Paterson posted photos of himself withHillary Clintonto Sands’ Instagram. Sands released CGI renditions of the multibillion-dollar resort, promising that it would include aCanyon Ranch spaand high-end restaurants from Rao’s and Jean-Georges. But the casino campaign wasn’t all celebrity endorsements and slick presentations. Sands’ union supporters packed local town halls. Onelocal environmental activistwas not only convinced to praise the casino project at those public events; she shouted down people bold enough to say otherwise. (“Keep a zipper on it!” she yelled in earshot of this reporter.) When nearby Hofstra University sued to block the county from leasing the site to Sands, Paterson turned around andaccusedhis alma mater of discriminating against him and other nonprofits funded by the casino. Blakeman held a series of press conferences in which he claimed “smoking gun” proof that Hofstra was teaming up with Steve Cohen’s casino crew to somehow box out Sands. (The university denied both allegations.) Blakeman had a knack for standing out in New York’s crowded political landscape: Heattacked trans athletesbefore that became standard operating procedure in the Republican Party; he announced the recruitment of 75 armed “special deputies,” which looked to opponents like the making of a militia. Naturally, all of this made him a much-discussed potential candidate in the 2026 GOP primary to challenge Hochul. And why should Hochul want to give him—and Miriam Adelson—this big of a win? “You think the governor can allow an ATM machine for the Republican Party—in a place where the county executive might be running against her?” the casino industry insider asks. The senior Albany Democrat calls that an “insane conspiracy theory,” while taking the opportunity to tie Blakeman to the collapse of the Sands bid in Nassau County. “Another massive failure on Bruce’s watch,” the Democrat says. The Sands project encountered other obstacles. It was never clear whether the company would knock down the actual Coliseum, or refurbish it for casino purposes—a significant detail. Nor did the company have a great answer for how the hell all of an estimated 20,000 daily customers were supposed to get there without clogging Long Island’s already famously crowded highways. The Coliseum has no access to public transportation, which is one of the reasons why the Islanders now play a few towns over in Elmont, and why Billy Joel’s next tour includes a stop instead at Cohen’s team’s ballpark, Citi Field, in Queens. At least Trump managed a rally at the Coliseum last September. If these sound like insurmountable obstacles to you, the Nassau County legislature felt otherwise, approving the Sands lease and authorizing in its Rules Committee anadditional $3 millionto fight off legal challenges to the casino. “We had multiple members of the Democratic legislature vote in favor of this,” the source with direct knowledge of the matter says. “Now, granted, it was before Trump came back.” About that. Adelson was absolutely thrilled about the election results. (After all, the two were so close that Trump had given her theMedal of Freedomin his last term and appointed one of her allies asUS antisemitism envoyin this one.) How thrilled? When the votes were counted, the ordinarily publicity-shy Miriam told her daughter in arare podcast appearance(with captions translated from Hebrew to English by YouTube) that she had walked up to a nearly life-size picture she kept of Sheldon and asked, “Are you proud of me? Aren’t you proud of me?” Miriam Adelson added to her daughter, the investorYasmin Lukatz,that she was then filled with a sense of love, a sense that Sheldon was “smiling at me.” It would be wrong to say it’s the end of her lucky run. Even though Adelsonfell outof theForbes50, she’s still worth around $30 billion. And Trump was the first Republican to winNassau Countysince 1988. But Trump’s15 points underwaterin the latest local polling, while Hochul is in positive territory for the first time in 15 months, after making a hard pivot against the president. “Trump’s acting a fool,” says the casino industry insider. “Miriam Adelson didn’t want to get dragged through the mud repeatedly, and they didn’t want to put in a bid and lose for that reason.” Among Adelson’s executives, there were active discussions about whether it made sense to operate a casinoanywherein the United States at the moment. Despite the name, Las Vegas Sands has no current holdings in America; all of its gamblingpropertiesare in Singapore or Chinese-controlled Macao. The thinking went something like this: Better to sell the Coliseum lease to another company. Let the next guy deal with the political hassles that put question marks around our multibillion-dollar resorts, and the union contracts that eat into our margins. We’ll work in Macao, where we’ve got none of those concerns. Making America great again? That’s a hand someone else can play.

    "title": "“Are You Out of Your F—ing Mind?” The Wild True Story of Smash’s Original Ending",
    "article_text": "Steven Spielbergwanted Ivy Lynn to die. Okay, that’s dramatic. But so isSmash,the failed TV series about the making of a Broadway show (produced by Spielberg) turnedactual Broadway show(still produced by Spielberg). The originalSmash, which ran on NBC from 2012 to 2013, was a dud with everyone but the devoted cohort who tuned in specifically to make fun of it. (They’re the people who popularized the term“hate-watching.”) The stage version, which opened earlier this month, has earned actual praise:New York TimescriticJesse Greencalled it“the great musical comedy no one saw coming.” In trueSmashfashion, it’s also got detractors likeNew Yorkmagazine’sJackson McHenry, who saidthat the musical“finally arrived on Broadway overmasticated and gummy.” But if writersBob MartinandRick Elicehad gotten their way,Smash’sBroadway iteration may have been even more polarizing. As they reveal exclusively here, their show originally ended with Ivy, the troubled diva played onscreen byMegan Hiltyand on Broadway byRobyn Hurder, literally dying onstage at the end of a big musical number. The idea was absurd and ballsy and truly unexpected—incrediblySmash. And at the show’s initial table read, it was received enthusiastically. “That was the first time that Spielberg had heard it all the way through,” Elice says. “He said, ‘Yes, this is it. This is the show we want to do.’ We never thought we would get that far because we thought people would be nervous about killing your leading lady. But everybody thought it was great.” Then, as so often happens in theSmash-verse, the audience screwed everything up. Katharine McPhee in season two ofSmash. Plenty of people in New York’s insular theater community might admit to beingSmash-ochists, if that were a real word and not one I just made up. During its brief run, the show employed dozens of theater artists; scores more watched it for sport, marveling at the yawning gulf between its ambitions and its execution. But neither Martin nor Elice count themselves among that group. Both caught the show’s pilot, which they thought was excellent. “But somehow or other, I don’t even remember seeing more than maybe one or two episodes,” Elice says. “It was a soap opera,” Martin adds. “I had written a TV series about the theater”—the beloved Canadian dramedySlings & Arrows—“and we’d spent so much time detailing the process [of making theater]. For me, I didn’t see that in this series.” So neither felt a strong need for their adaptation to stick closely to the original text. Instead, Martin and Elice took the series as a jumping-off point for their own backstage farce focused on a different creative team assembling a cursed musical about Marilyn Monroe calledBombshell. As onSmash, the actress playing Marilyn was named Ivy. On the series, she was a struggling chorus girl finally getting her big break; in the stage version, she’s reimagined as a triple-threat Broadway legend. But Martin, whose credits also includeThe Drowsy ChaperoneandBoop! The Musical—currently playing just one block south ofSmash—and Elice, best known forJersey BoysandPeter and the Starcatcher, also added in a meta twist. After reading a book onMethod acting, Ivy falls so deeply into her performance that her commitment completely derailsBombshell. As we all know, “Marilyn Monroe died tragically at a young age,” Elice says. “And a good farce wants to take things always as far as you can possibly go, and then even a little bit further. Wouldn’t it be ridiculous if, in devoting herself so much to playing this character, she actually suffers the same fate?” The writers went for it, saddling Ivy with a spiraling pill addiction as well as a hopeless devotion to her role. In the stage show’s original iteration, her story reaches its climax onBombshell’sopening night, when Ivy has an epiphany: She’s been acting like a monster. She throws her pills away, resolves to be a better person, and goes to work. We next see her performing the hell out of “Let’s Be Bad,” aMarc Shaiman/Scott Wittmannumber from the TV series that’s so good it has now appeared intwo separate Broadway shows. “Robyn was just going crazy. It was a really athletic performance,” Martin says. “She’s held up by the other dancers, right at the peak of everything she’s done, and just collapses. It was really entertaining.” After Ivy’s unexpected demise, theBombshellteam gathers glumly at their favorite Theater District haunt, knowing that there’s no way for the show to go on. But after a rousing final number, they decide to turn their broken hearts into art. They refashion everything that just happened into adifferentBroadway show—one about the making ofBombshell. It’s calledBombshell: The Ivy Lynn Story, and, in a final meta twist, it stars Ivy’s one-time rival and understudy Karen (a character played on the series byKatharine McPhee,and on Broadway byCaroline Bowman) playing Ivy,playingMarilyn. “That felt very brilliant in terms of structure, and on the page,” Elice says. “Or clean, at least,” Martin adds. “It was very, very clean.” And they might have gotten away with it, too—if Hurder weren’t so damn good at her job. “She works harder than everybody,” Elice says. “She does everything brilliantly, and she’s also a delicious human being.” As the show moved forward,Smash’sproducers also began asking Martin and Elice to round out Ivy’s character. In that first reading, she’d been a bit of a one-note prima donna; they wanted more backstory. “Make her more of a human, make her more detailed,” says Martin. That detail and depth wound up working against Martin and Elice’s perfect ending. In 2024, their workshop version ofSmashwas presented for the first time before an audience at Hunter College. “What we encountered when we had an audience last year,” Elice says, “was that the people loved Robyn so much that they hated the show for killing her.” Even worse, “the last 20 minutes of the show didn’t have her in it.” They tried to make it work anyway, at first, by cobbling together a reason for Hurder to reappear. “We were, like, did she come in as a ghost?” Martin says. “It was never entirely satisfactory.” So finally, Martin and Elice reworked their reworking. “We were pumping Act Two full of comedy, and we were constantly adjusting the mechanics of the ending,” Martin says. “Not only the death of Ivy, but the scene that followed was rewritten extensively. And then the one original song in the show, ‘Smash,’ was rewritten over and over and over again.” Finally, they landed on a new conclusion. Instead of literally dying onstage, we’d see Ivy “die” as Marilyn Monroe inBombshell, the musical within the musical. Andthatending would be received so poorly it would sinkBombshellentirely.Smashstill ends with its characters rallying to write a show about their terrible experience makingBombshell—but this time, Ivy’s still alive to play herself. In the final iteration ofSmash, the moment lands. But it works even better when you know that Martin and Elice channeled their frustration about how the original ending was received into this new kicker. After Marilyn’s death, we see dozens of angry social media posts that blastBombshellfor finishing on such a down note. EvenJulie Andrewshates it. None of the comments were actually taken from workshop audiences—but only because “it would’ve been too obscene if we literally used what people said,” Elice says with a laugh. “​​Because they said, ‘Are you out of your fucking mind?’ Which we changed to, ‘Well, that was bleak.’” The goal of a confection likeSmashis to send people into the streets smiling and humming “Let Me Be Your Star”—not to smack them in the face, then lower the curtain. And though they’ve still got affection for their original ending, Elice and Martin are generally happy with the waySmash’s final form has been received. “Not everybody liked it,” Martin says. “And we got some bad reviews. We also got lots of people on social media baffled by what they had just seen. But largely, the proof is in the pudding. And every night, people are really, really, really laughing. That’s the test of a comedy.” Perhaps even more impressively, both had a great time working onSmash. “The show that we were creating was about creatives who could barely speak to each other,” Martin says. But he, Elice, Shaiman, Wittman, directorSusan Stroman, and the rest of theSmashteam worked together beautifully. “Maybe because we were able to put it into the show, it never happened with us,” Elice says. “No one ever walked out of the room and disappeared for a week. There were no Arthur Laurents moments where he goes in at night and slashes the scenery. There were no trap doors left open for people to fall through.” Now that the experience is in the rearview, both have several more irons in the fire. Martin is working on an adaptation of the 2004 filmMillions; the pair is preparing to workshop a top-secret new collaboration this fall. But anySmash-ochist would be pleased to know that they’re also not ruling out the possibility of writing a show about writingSmash. “That’s a show I would pay to see,” Martin says. “It would just be overwhelmingly meta. It would be theInceptionof musicals.” How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Gene Hackman’s Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Meghan Markle Says More Flavors of As Ever Jam Are Coming “Like Sneaker Drops”",
    "article_text": "It’s been less than a month sinceMeghan Marklelaunched her lifestyle company As Ever andthe initial offerings sold out in less than an hour. One of the most popular products was a decorative display of raspberry preserves, inspired by the jam she made fromberries in her own garden. In a podcast interview with her friend, IT Cosmetics founderJamie Kern Lima,Meghan said she is planning to release more flavors of jam in future As Ever product launches. “Of course, more jam drops,” Meghan told Lima on Monday’s episode ofThe Jamie Kern Lima Show.“Think of them like sneaker drops.” When As Ever, which Meghan developed in partnership with Netflix’s Consumer Product Group, released its initial products in early April, the company announced that its offerings would continue to grow seasonally. In addition, Netflixsharedthata second season of her showWith Love, Meghan,had already been recorded and would premiere in the fall. In her conversation with Lima, Meghan added that As Ever has plenty more products in the pipeline, offering a few hints that hostess gifts will be a part of the next drop. “There’s so much in development,” she said. “Let’s say this: If it started with what I was just making on my stove, and it starts in your kitchen as these sweet offerings—actually sweet—and then the extension of what do you pair that with? For me, as we’ve talked about a lot today, what are these small gestures? What are these thoughtful details? What are these ways that you can show up for someone? Hostess gifts and hospitality is a big category that I’m really excited that we’re developing.” On Tuesday, Lima was the week’s guest on the fourth episode of Meghan’s new podcast,Confessions of a Female Founder,where their conversation focused on the challenges of building a new business. Meghan said that Lima advised her to be patient when she was working on As Ever. “You and I had just become friends, and I was talking to you about business. I remember you said to me, ‘Okay, so what’s the timeline?’ I said, ‘Oh, a couple months from now.’ You said, ‘That’s too soon.’ And I didn’t want to hear that, but you’re right,\" Meghan said. “To really not be concerned about someone else’s urgency, or the media’s urgency, or speculation’s urgency, somehow becoming my urgency––to wait until you’re ready. Even if I didn’t want to hear it, it was the thing that I needed to hear.” Meghan’s friendship with Lima, who led the cosmetics brand from its 2007 founding until 2019, first became public last summer, whenPage Sixreported that the pair traveled toa Hamptons business summitin Long Island. OnConfessions of a Female Founder, Meghan explained how their friendship began. “Since selling IT Cosmetics, Jamie has become a best-selling author, invested in over a dozen businesses, and has appeared as a guest shark onShark Tank. But when I met her, I didn’t know any of that. I just knew her as Jamie, my new neighbor, and she soon became my rocking chair friend,” she said. “The kind of person where you can just go and sit in your sweats and cozies with no makeup on and just chat for hours.

    "title": "Prince William and Kate Middleton Celebrate 14th Wedding Anniversary Where It All Began",
    "article_text": "Prince WilliamandKate Middletontraveled to Scotland, where they’ll celebrate their 14th wedding anniversary on Tuesday. It is the couple’s first away tour sincePrincess Kate’s cancer diagnosis, and a milestone for the Princess of Wales, who underwent a grueling course of chemotherapy this time last year. Sources close to the couple say that William and Kate chose to visit the Isles of Mull and Iona in the Inner Hebrides despite it coinciding with their anniversary, which they have always celebrated privately. Their decision to visit Scotland,where they met at University of St Andrews more than two decades ago, is a poignant reminder of how important the country is to the couple, who also hold the Scottish titles the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay. After a day of engagements on the Isle of Mull on Tuesday, including a visit to a community hub in Tobermory, an area famous for its colorful buildings, the couple will visit a popular artisan market. They will also tour a working croft, where they will learn about farming and hospitality in the area and look at locally produced food on the land. On Tuesday evening, the couple who hosted a lavish wedding party at Buckingham Palace on April 29, 2011, will stay in a modest self-catering cottage (which is equipped with a kitchen). Prince William, Prince of Wales, known as the Duke of Rothesay and Catherine, Princess of Wales, known as the Duchess of Rothesay when in Scotland, smile to well-wishers as they arrive for a visit to Aros Hall, a local community hub on April 29, 2025 in Tobermory, Scotland. “It says a lot about them,” says a longtime friend. “They could be doing something opulent but this is typically down to earth. They love being in nature, switching off and just being together. I think they both have a renewed sense of purpose and perspective after this past year.” The traditional gift for 14 years of marriage is ivory, however, as Prince William is an advocate for wildlife protection who is vehemently opposed to the illegal ivory trade, it’s unlikely he will gift anything to do with elephants’ tusks. While he may give his wife a special and meaningful present following their turbulent year, the source added that the couple are unlikely to exchange lavish presents. “They are not showy in the slightest. In the past, I recall William gifting Kate a pair of binoculars which she absolutely loved.” The focus of the two-day visit is on the island’s unique rural communities and nature. Being outdoors has been particularly important to Princess Kate during her recovery from cancer. A portrait of the princess, taken byMatt Porteousand released on the couple’s social media accounts amid her recovery, showed her standing against a willow tree, anda video released to mark the end of her chemotherapy treatmentfeatured the Waleses enjoying the wild beaches and woodland of Norfolk where they recently spent the Easter holidays. In a notable departure from the norm, the couple did not attend Easter Sunday service withKing CharlesandQueen Camillaand instead spent the celebration privately at their Norfolk home Anmer Hall with Kate’s parents,CaroleandMichael Middleton. Prince William, Prince of Wales and Britain's Catherine, Princess of Wales react during a visit to a soft play area at Aros Hall, a local community hub on April 29, 2025 in Tobermory, Scotland. Their Scottish tour will also see the couple visit the Isle of Iona which has a population of just 170 people and receives around 130,000 visitors each year. The Prince and Princess of Wales will join school children for an outdoor lesson in the ancient forest of Ardura, a place known for “gentle recreation, experiencing nature, finding solace and reflecting on cultural and personal links to our ancestors who used the forest before us,”according to the Mull & Iona Community Trust. The royals are keen to learn more about how the rural communities live and how the Mull and Iona Ranger service is vital to the population. On Tuesday, it was announced by Kensington Palace that the couple’s Royal Foundation will support and develop two community spaces on the Isle of Mull, Aros Hall, situated in the heart of the main street in Tobermory in the North of the island and Pennyghael Community Hall, in the rural Ross of Mull in the South. According to the palace, the halls will “provide vital social spaces where islanders can come together.” How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Gene Hackman’s Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "‘Caught Stealing’ First Look: Austin Butler Goes On the Run in Darren Aronofsky’s Crime Caper",
    "article_text": "Darren Aronofskyknew he was truly capturing the essence of New York’s wild and unpredictable nightlife when his new movie got hit with a sprinkling of urine. The uncomfortable encounter happened last fall asCaught Stealingshot scenes beside a tenement in a New York neighborhood that’s famous for its boisterous and bohemian residents and club-goers. Aronofsky rubs the back of his neck and brings up The Incident. “Well, a PA got peed on from someone on a fire escape. That was intense,” he says. Austin Butler,who plays a hard-luck former ballplayer who becomes the target of an assortment of underworld thugs and sociopaths, fills in the strange details. “That wasreallyintense,” Butler says. “She got peed on by afully naked womanon a fire escape. She thought an air conditioner was leaking on her from above, and looked up and sawthat.” Matt Smith as neighbor Russ and Austin Butler as Hank Thompson. Guess what's in the bag? “Terrible,” Aronofsky concludes. But such are the risks of shooting on location, especially when that location is known for its offbeat atmosphere. “The thing about the East Village is that there’s so many of those great kind of characters,” theRequiem for a DreamandBlack Swanfilmmaker tellsVanity Fairfor this exclusive first look. “It’s just filled with oddballs, this movie. And that’s kind of my experience and why I love the East Village so much. It’s just such a magnet for that, still to this day.” The East Village is practically a character itself. “Filming overnights, it was madness,” Butler says. “Everyone thinks that East Village belongs to them. And it’s funny, because I believe the East Village belongs tome,” Aronofsky adds. “I’ve been going there since I was in high school. I was a little kid from Brooklyn, and that was the coolest place in the world to be, partly because it was the only place that served underage minors at the time. We would just always go to the East Village and get into trouble.” “Trouble” is the best way to sum upCaught Stealing, which hits theaters on August 29. Butler’s Hank Thompson is trying his best to avoid it, but not doing a very good job. He was once a promising ballplayer in high school, but his sports career fell flat. “It all went wrong,” Aronofsky says. Now he’s tending bar at a dive to make ends meet, but he’s got some good prospects, like his romance with Yvonne, played byZoë Kravitz. “She’s great for him. She’s an EMT, and she’s a caring woman and she’s cool and she’s strong,” Butler says. Regina King's organized crime investigator Elise Roman gives Austin Butler's Hank some heavy news inCaught Stealing. “She’s a solid New York girl,” Aronofsky adds. “New York strength, but also levity and lightness,” Butler says. “I think she sees the stupor that he’s in and is trying to shake him out of it,” Aronofsky says. “But she’s also got her own life. When I was casting, I was looking for someone that was the kind of real downtown New York person that I knew back then, that just didn’t take shit. And it makes sense that Zoë was able to jump in.” Hank is trying his best to demonstrate to her that he’s the trustworthy and reliable type, someone who can be counted upon in a crisis. Maybe that’s why he happily obliges when his punk rock neighbor Russ (House of the Dragon’sMatt Smithsporting a ceiling-scraping orange mohawk) asks him to check in on his pet cat while he’s away. Later, a couple of thugs catch Hank coming out of Russ’s apartment and mistake the pet-sitter for the punk rocker, whom they believe knows the whereabouts of $4 million in laundered mob money. That’s when his luck turns even further south. Bad Bunny waits patiently on behalf of the Puerto Rican mob while two other gangsters (Nikita Kukushkin and Yuri Kolokolnikov) go about their illicit business. Caught Stealingwas crafted as a kind of period piece, set in the bygone era of 1998. ScreenwriterCharlie Huston,who adapted his own 2004 novel, set the story in September 2000 in the book, but Aronofsky wound back the clock a couple more years to satisfy his own nostalgic craving. “There are lots of weird characters and lots of weird sub-stories going on. But I think it’s very much a crime caper,” he says. “I tried to make a genre film with the best actors in the world, with the best crew in the world, and bring it to life with the kind of energy that I felt in ’98.” The Twin Towers were still standing,Rudy Giulianiwas mayor, and the around-the-clock surveillance of cell phones and closed-circuit cameras was not yet omnipresent. Dirty deeds could still be conducted out of sight in a city that had its spirit hardened but was not yet on high alert. For Aronofsky, it’s the perfect backdrop for a group of oddballs to lash out at each other over some illicit cash. The filmmaker had once tempted fate himself in Manhattan’s Lower East Side as an underage party seeker, and he missed the good old days of getting away with things. While on the awards circuit in late 2022 forThe Whale, Aronofsky found himself turning back to Huston’s book, which he’d read about 15 years before. He liked Huston’s script, and the emotional anguish ofThe Whalehad him yearning for something that would make him laugh. “I was really upset that I couldn’t figure out what was next. And I kind of had this urge to do something fun,” he says. “I felt like there was just so much tension in our normal lives that I felt like the one thing that Hollywood has always done great is entertain. I looked at my projects and I said, ‘You know what? The most fun one I have is Charlie's script.’” During the awards campaign forElvis, Aronofsky found himself on the same event circuit as Butler. “We had bumped into each other a few times and we hit it off,” Aronofsky says. Butler was also unsure about to take on next. “It was the beginning of December,” Aronofsky says, “I was, like, ‘Give me till the beginning of the year, and I’m going to have something for you.’ I just worked really hard through December. We wrote, I think, six or seven drafts to get it more polished.” Batter Up: Austin Butler's Hank Thompson is a once-promising baseball player whose career didn't work out. He's still got a swing, though. When Aronofsky and Huston sent the script, Butler was already primed to say yes. “I was 11 or 12 or something, and the director of the first audition I ever went to—Jacob Chasewas his name—cast me in this student film. I remember talking to him. I’m this little kid, and I said, ‘Who’s your favorite director?’ I’m trying to seek mentorship in whatever way. And he said, ‘Darren Aronofsky.’ He said, ‘Go watchRequiem for a Dream.’” “At 11 or 12?” Aronofsky interrupts. “Get away from that director as quick as you can.” The harrowing drug addiction drama is a hard watch for anyone of any age, but Butler was transfixed. “It became my favorite film,” he says. “Highly inappropriate as a youngster, but I remember watching it, going, ‘Wow, I didn’t realize you could do this. How inventive and visceral. As the years went on, then I dug into every one of his films and always wanted to work with him. And so when we met, I remember having this moment of: That’s actually Darren Aronofsky!” For that reason alone,Caught Stealingwas an easy yes for him. “Also, the setting being ’90s New York, which Darren knows so well,” Butler says. “It’s something that I could sink my teeth into as an actor and explore this guy who’s tortured and has been sort of numbing himself and then, suddenly, is thrown into this world…” “The world really spirals out of control,” Aronofsky says. But there was one point of disagreement from the start. “Darren kept talking about how fun the movie was,” Butler says. “And I was, like—the stuffI’mgoing through is not a lot of fun.” But now that he’s seen it, he gets it: “Something that can be a nightmare for the character can actually have humor.” Zoë Kravitz's Yvonne: “She’s great for him. She’s an EMT, and she’s a caring woman and she’s cool and she’s strong,” Butler says. The first misfortune to befall Hank is the brawl with a pair of bad guys outside his neighbor’s door. Then he gets a warning from a New York Police Department detective named Elise Roman, of the organized crime unit, who informs him that he’s not tangling with low-level crooks. The people targeting him are out for blood if they don’t get their money—and he doesn’t actually know where it is. Roman is played byIf Beale Street Could TalkOscar winnerRegina King,who tries to reason with the headstrong young man. “She comes in at a very sobering moment, when the film needs it,” Aronofsky says. “The wordgravitascomes to mind with her as well,” Butler says. “She has a power and this internal weight.” Liev Schreiber’s Lipa and Vincent D’Onofrio's Shmully are two “badass motherfuckers,” according to Aronofsky. During filming, Aronofsky recommended that Butler rewatchMartin Scorsese’s1985 comedyAfter Hoursto get a feel for the vibe he wanted. That movie, about a clean-cut young man’s strange encounters during one wild night in New York, starredGriffin Dunne,who also turns up inCaught Stealing. Not only was this a chance to pay tribute to that earlier movie, but Dunne is also a longtime resident of the neighborhood in real life. “Heisan East Village character,” Aronofsky says. Viewers can be forgiven for not recognizing Dunne right away because he’s not so clean-cut this time. “He’s got a ponytail and a handlebar mustache,” Aronofsky says. “He’s in the trailer. He screams the line, ‘They killed my lizard!’” The lizard, sadly, is a victim of this whole morass involving the missing money. And more than one gang wants to squeeze Hank for information about it. “Basically, it’s Austin versus all these different types of criminals,” Aronofsky says. “The Russians, the Hebrews, the Puerto Ricans— they’re all out to get him.” Darren Aronofsky directs Austin Butler on the streets of New York inCaught Stealing. The Jewish mobsters are represented byLiev Schreiber’sLipa andVincent D’Onofrio’s Shmully, two Orthodox brothers who appear reverential and gentlemanly, but rigorously following religious strictures does not mean they always obey the laws of the city, county, and state of New York. “I just don’t know how much I want to give away, but they’re a bunch of badass motherfuckers,” Aronofsky says. “In their own minds, they think they’re doing the right thing. Mayor Giuliani might’ve thought that they were on the wrong side.” Even then, they’re not all bad. The brothers may be strong-arming Hank, but they also introduce him to the comforting matzo ball soup ofCarol Kane,playing the prototypical nurturing Jewish mother, who thinks the young man is far too skinny. Butler says Schreiber and D’Onofrio’s chemistry was so good, he found himself making videos of their conversations between takes. “They had me in stitches at times because they just had this rapport back and forth that was comedic gold,” he says. Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, taking a moment to refuel beside a cat who wants some too. Caught Stealingalso featuresBenito Antonio Martínez Ocasio,a.k.a. music superstar Bad Bunny, as Colorado, a trigger-happy member of the Puerto Rican gang who rounds out the underworld figures who are closing in on Hank. “He’s, like, the sweetest guy in the world. My casting directorMary Vernieuwas, like, ‘Benito’s interested in acting,’ and we ended up talking,” Aronofsky says. “There was a character that he fit really well and he was great. He was so down-to-earth, and he was so one of us, and so part of the team.” The only trouble is that, even in a movie packed with star power, Ocasio caused an especially big fervor. “We were constantly terrified that the neighborhood would be overthrown as soon as they found out that Benito was there,” Aronofsky says. “He was also a good sport. He actually would come to set and then just camp out there, knowing he was not going to be able to get back to his trailer or anywhere.” But ultimately, he did have to arrive and depart, which meant shielding him from view and getting him in and out of locations without onlookers recognizing him.. “There were a lot of back exits and going through tunnels that no one ever knew existed in the East Village to get him out and back and over fences, so he didn’t have to go through the street,” Aronofsky says. “It was constantly like: ‘Hide the Benito.’” How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Gene Hackman’s Autopsy Sheds Light on His Bleak Final Days WhatIvanka Trumpand Anti-Trumpers Have In Common Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "“It’s About Him”: Renowned White House Photographer Pete Souza on How Trump Is Perverting the Presidential Photo Stream",
    "article_text": "Yoichi Okamoto, Lyndon Baines Johnson’s chief official White House photographer, set the bar high for visually documenting the presidency. LBJ gave Okamoto unprecedented access to his private moments and public events because he knew the importance of having a visual archive for history’s sake. Looking at Okamoto’s behind-the-scenes photographs, 60 years later, puts us back in the room. They show us what was really going on. His images give us context. They show emotion. And humanity. Subsequently, every official White House photographer, including me, has tried to reach the standard that Okamoto set. This is true of photographers for both Democratic and Republican presidents. There are no laws or rules that dictate an official photographer’s access or exactly what or when they can photograph. Thus, there have been some bumps along the way since LBJ’s day. President Richard Nixon, for instance, did not give his chief photographer, Ollie Atkins, very much access, especially duringthe Watergate scandal. I was fortunate to be an official White House photographer for President Ronald Reagan and then, 20 years later, the chief official White House photographer for PresidentBarack Obama.During his administration, I was grantedunprecedented fly-on-the-wall access. Like Okamoto, I was able to show context and emotion in my photographs. More importantly, I was able to capture moments that showed the humanity of both presidents in good times, but also during their setbacks. Because all of it is history. I’ve been perusing the official White House photographs from the first 100 days of PresidentDonald Trump’s second term. The White House has already posted more than 2,600 photos on itsFlickr photostream. (The landing page reads: “The official photostream of the White House. Joined January 2025.” Flickr was also the main receptacle of official photos underBarack Obama, Trump I, andJoe Biden.) Numerous still photographs also appear on the @POTUS and @WhiteHouse Instagram and Facebook accounts, often with superimposed campaign-like words or graphics. (On Trump’s own platform, Truth Social, text is the preferred medium, though the president’s feed has many photos and videos, as do the White House feeds for X and TikTok.) It is apparent that the current official photographers have unlimited access to all of Trump’s public events—and good access to some situations not open to the press. I have no criticism of the technical or aesthetic quality of their images. They do a standout job documenting the situations they have access to. I personally know two of his official photographers, one of whom worked for me during the early part of the Obama administration. But it’s a bit unsettling to look through the nearly 100 albums on Flickr. It’s like looking at the set of a reality TV show, starring Donald Trump. The Oval Office itself has been ornately decorated in a style akin to that of his Mar-a-Lago estate. There is gold everywhere, even gold coasters branded with his name. Rather than selecting two or three paintings to place around the fabled fireplace—where many official encounters are photographed—Trump has chosen to hang more than a dozen gold-framed presidential portraits. TheSwedish ivythat has been on the mantle since at least the Ford administration has beenreplacedwith seven gold decorative objects. Many of the official photographs that have been made public depict situations in which the White House also invited hand-selected members of the press into the Oval Office. The president is seated at theResolute Deskfor the purposes of signing his latest executive order with a fat Sharpie pen. Or he’s seated in a chair next to a head of state at the opposite end of the Oval, in front of the fireplace. From videos, we know that it’s mainly a performance. These sessions last 20, 30, 40 minutes; typically, Trump holds court, at times verbally spewing word salad often mixed with falsehoods. Photographs often appear on the official White House Facebook and Instagram accounts soon thereafter. On Flickr, the White House tends to post too many images from the same setting. Do we really need to see 67 photos from theswearing-in ceremony ofRobert F. Kennedy Jr.? Wouldn’t two or three selects suffice? Do we really need to see80 framesofTrump with the president of El Salvador, surrounded by members of the media? Each album of photos posted on Flickr has a title. For example, a recent album of 43 photos is entitled “President Trump signs executive orders alongside Sec of EducationLinda McMahonand wounded warriors in the Oval Office.” In one photo, about a dozen MAGA hats are on the Resolute Desk. After signing the orders, Trump, in other photos, is shown handing out the autographed hats or signing prostheses. I applaud Trump for doing an event with the wounded warriors. But how do the “executive orders” relate to them? Why not identify them and tell ustheirstories, too? The only recognizable person in this album is Donald Trump (notwithstanding that some people might recognize the education secretary). And judging from the lack of information about the other people pictured and the sheer volume of imagery, I guess that’s the point. It’s about him, not them. Even the behind-the-scenes images—despite being top-notch photographically— often look like part of the reality show. There is little hint of the president’s humanity, and even when there is, there’s an oddity to it. For example, three recent photographs show himmeetingwith “Patty Morin,the mother of Rachel Morin.” At first, the name didn’t register, until I searched the internet to refresh my memory: Rachel Morin had been murdered by an immigrant from El Salvador whom the US accused of entering the States without authorization. During this “meeting,” Patty Morin is shown standing the entire time while Trump remains seated at the Resolute Desk. His attempt at humanity appears passive: He is shown in the photo receiving a hug from her. He doesn’t bother to stand up; instead, she awkwardly bends overto embrace him.A large map of theGulf of Americacan be seen in the background. From my years working in the West Wing, I know that any given day has the potential to yield images of significance. And as I’ve monitored the recent output of pictures, it is clear to me what the White House isnotshowing. Thus far on the Flickr photostream there are no pictures of Trump during national security meetings in the Situation Room. There are no pictures of Trump’s substantive phone calls withVladimir Putin.There are no pictures of Trump with his national security adviser,Mike Waltz,in the aftermath of the Signal-chat scandal. When the US launched military strikes against the Houthis in March, a handful of photos werepostedon Trump’s Instagram account, but not on Flickr. (He is wearing headphones over a red MAGA hat that is signed with his own autograph.) As far as I can tell, we haven’t publicly seen pictures of him meeting with the DOGE team.Elon Muskdoesappearin some situations, includinga Tesla eventopen to the press on the South Grounds, where Trump claimed he had just purchased one of Musk’s vehicles. There appear to be no officially released pictures of him at his club in Florida after his raft of tariffs caused many an American’s 401(k) to plummet. Do photographs from these situations exist? Could they be holding them back for an album about the first 100 days? The first photograph, in my opinion, that shows any semblance of a true behind-the-scenes historical moment came on day 97 of the administration. It shows Trump meeting privately with Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyat the Vatican prior to the funeral of Pope Francis. The photoappearedon Zelenskyy’s social media accounts and was distributed by the Associated Press, Getty Images, and others. The embedded metadata has no photographer credited but includes the copyright notice “Ukrainian Presidential Press Office.” To my eye, it looks like an iPhone photo, and I surmise it was taken not by an official photographer but by one of Zelenskyy’s aides. A similar version later appeared on some of the White House social media accounts, but not on Flickr. It, too, is uncredited. President Trump was impeached twice by the House—and cleared twice by the Senate. If you’ll recall, his first impeachment hinged in part on what he characterized as a “perfect” phone call to Zelenskyy. Trump had asked the Ukrainian president to launch an investigation into the alleged actions ofHunter Biden—or else Trump implied he would not agree to release funds earmarked for Ukraine that Congress had already appropriated. Trump’s supposed motivation—as laid out inthe articles of impeachment against him—was to damage the prospects of Joe Biden, who was his opponent in the 2020 election. Remember the photograph of that call? You can’t, because none exists—or has not been made public. (Since Zelenskyy refused the alleged request for a quid pro quo, I can’t help but wonder if Trump had any lingering resentment toward him when the two presidents had their infamousWest Wing blowuptwo months ago.) By contrast, the practice under Obama was to allow me to photograph all head-of-state calls during his eight years in office. You might say, “What’s the big deal? It’s just a picture of a guy on a phone.” But photographs can show the mood and emotion during such a high-level conversation. A photograph can showwherethe call is taking place. A photograph can show who else is in the room. These visual elements are crucial for the record. On January 6, 2021, during the insurrection at the Capitol, President Trump remained in the Oval Office dining room for several hours,watching the situation unfold on television, before taking any action to intervene. There are no photographs of this because Trump barred his chief photographer,Shealah Craighead,from the room. She latertestifiedunder oath before the January 6 congressional committee. According to Craighead, Trump’s assistant,Molly Michael,told her, “No photos for the rest of the day.” To her credit, Craighead responded, “You’re going to want photos. This is historical. Everything that’s happening today is historical.… You’ll want photos for the archives. It might not seem like you do now, but perhaps later you will. It’s all history.” But Trump’s assistant purportedly wouldn’t budge. “No photos today,” she said, as described in Craighead’s sworn testimony. “He doesn’t want any photos.” (Michael was not questioned by the committee about Craighead’s assertions, which were made nearly three months after Michael testified.) At times, Trump has a rather unique sense of what he thinks is a good photograph of himself. One memorable picture from Craighead during Trump’s first term really stands out. The president had a contentious meeting in the Cabinet Room with House SpeakerNancy Pelosi.In the photo, Pelosi is standing up, surrounded by male congressional leaders and Joint Chiefs of Staff chairMark Milley,pointing her right index finger towards Trump. He looks angry, maybe a bit stunned. Milley and others seated next to Trump are looking down, seemingly embarrassed at what’s taking place. Trump himself made the photo public. Hepostedit on what was then Twitter, with the caption “Nervous Nancy’s unhinged meltdown.” Many other observers, however, looked at this photograph and thought, Nancy Pelosi is a badass for standing up to the bully. Pelosi, in fact, made the image the cover photo on both her Twitter and Facebook profiles. (I should note thatDaniel Torok,not Craighead, is the chief official White House photographer for Trump 2.0.) Today, at an entranceway through which White House aides and some guests walk into the Oval Office, Trump hashunga framed copy of aNew York Postfront page. It’s the one with his defiant mug shot, in Georgia, after he was indicted on charges of plotting to overturn the state’s vote count in the 2020 presidential election. (The case, though suspended for now, is still pending.) The placement of that front page sets a tone:I can do anything; nothing’s going to stop me.It’s probably no coincidence that his official photographic portrait, which hangs in most federal buildings, echoes the scowl and pose from that mug shot, yet with more dramatic, photorealistic lighting. What happened a couple of weeks ago is even stranger. First, some background. The White House Historical Association commissions a painting to hang at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue after every president leaves office. The outgoing president chooses the artist. I was there in 2022 when President Obama’s official portrait wasunveiledand hung in the Grand Foyer on the State Floor. The painting, byRobert McCurdy,was so lifelike that to my eye it was reminiscent of a Richard Avedon portrait. Trump recently had Obama’s portrait removed and positioned in another location not far away. Which is the president’s right. But what’s particularly galling is that in its place, Trump decided to hang a painting depicting the well-known photograph of himself pumping his fist in the air after the July 2024 assassination attempt. Let’s recap what happened that day in Pennsylvania. Someone had tried to kill him. A bullet had grazed his ear, and after he realized he was not gravely injured, he had the presence of mind to create his own reality show moment for the cameras: raising his fist in defiance. Click, click, click.The photo byEvan Vucciof the Associated Press was on the front page of newspapers throughout the country. It soon became a cornerstone of MAGA iconography: a would-be martyr, miraculously resurrected. In several aspects, the image—showing a president looking outward, his security detail surrounding him, graced by the presence of an American flag—is Trumpworld’s version of the Emanuel Leutze’s paintingWashington Crossing the Delaware. And now a painting based on this photograph has pride of place on the State Floor. For those on White House tours, it is displayed in the most prominent position they pass. White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittsaid in a statement that the portrait was displayed “temporarily,” implying that another painting will take its place. Nonetheless, a recentphotoposted on his Flickr photostream shows Trump standing in front of the painting with two guests on hand for an Easter prayer service, one of them evangelistFranklin Graham(son of Billy Graham). Giving his trademark thumbs up, the president offers a camera-ready grin, seemingly unaware of how his expression and gesture diverge from the gravity of the instant conveyed behind him. It’s a jarring contrast to the moment when, in Trump’s own words, a “vicious monster unleashed evil.” At the end of the Trump administration, convention dictates that the official White House photostream will be locked and become forever viewable, just as we’re seeing it now, under the propriety of the National Archives. In 60 years, I wonder what people will think as they look back at these albums of photographs. That’s assuming the National Archives still exists. Pete Souza, who served on the photo staff of President Ronald Reagan, spent eight years as Barack Obama’s chief official White House photographer. Souza, the subject ofDawn Porter’s documentaryThe Way I See It,has gained renown for his Instagram feed (@petesouza, with 3 million followers), on which he has posted images from his time in the Obama White House—images that contrasted sharply with those from Donald Trump’s first term. These juxtapositions became the subject of his book,Shade: A Tale of Two Presidents,a follow-up to his #1New York TimesbestsellerObama: An Intimate Portrait.In 2022, Souza publishedThe West Wing and Beyond: What I Saw Inside the Presidency.

    "article_text": "City records 10 Covid-related deaths in a month, while fewer than 100,000 vaccine doses given to those aged 50 and above over past year Hong Kong health experts have called for older residents to get at least one Covid-19 booster shot annually after the city recorded 10 coronavirus-related deaths in one month, with fewer than 100,000 vaccine doses given to those aged 50 and above over the past year. A total of 98,049 doses of vaccines were administered to people aged 50 and older over the 12-month period up to the end of March, according to the Centre for Health Protection. A further breakdown by age groups was not available. About 3.56 million people were aged 50 or above in Hong Kong as of the end of last year, according to official population data. Figures from the centre also showed that 4,758 doses were given to those aged 12 to 49, while only 1,258 doses were administered to children aged six months to 11 years over the same period. Ivan Hung Fan-ngai, chair professor of infectious diseases at the University of Hong Kong, said a surge in Covid-19 infections normally occurred every six months because of the decreasing levels of antibodies in the population.",

    "article_text": "Patient, 47, sprained his back while lifting heavy objects before seeking traditional Chinese medicine treatment, investigations show A 47-year-old Hong Kong man has undergone an amputation of his left lower leg two days after developing a Group A Streptococcal infection following acupuncture treatment he received at two traditional Chinese medicine clinics. The Centre for Health Protection said on Tuesday the man developed a fever and left thigh pain on April 11 and subsequently sought care from a private hospital, where he was diagnosed with septic shock and necrotising fasciitis, commonly known as “flesh-eating infection”. He was transferred to Queen Mary Hospital the next day and underwent a left lower limb amputation the following day. The centre said the man, who had underlying illnesses, remained hospitalised in stable condition. Group A Streptococcal infection is caused by bacteria, namely Streptococcus pyogenes, that can be found in the throat and on the skin. It can be transmitted by droplets and physical contact. The centre said the initial epidemiological investigations revealed on April 6 that the patient had sprained his back while lifting heavy objects, subsequently experiencing pain in his left hip and numbness in his left leg and foot. The patient sought traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture treatment from two registered practitioners in Sheung Wan and Causeway Bay on April 7, 9 and 10.",

    "article_text": "Voters in parts of England will elect councillors and mayors on 1 May. Voters in the Runcorn and Helsby constituency will also choose their new MP on the same day. What can and can't you do in the polling station when voting in person? If you areregistered to vote,external, you will be sent a polling card with your polling number and polling station details. You do not need to take the polling card with you but it might speed up the process. You do have to takevalid photo ID,external. You can only vote at your local polling station, which might not be the same as in previous elections. You can alsofind your local polling station online,external. Polling stations are open between 0700 BST and 2200. You can vote after 22:00 as long as you were already in the queue at that point. Who can vote in the May local elections? Who is standing in my area? Writing implements are provided but you can bring your own if you wish. You are not allowed to take photos inside a polling station because the Electoral Commission - which oversees UK elections - says it risks the secrecy of the ballot. The punishment for revealing how someone else voted - even accidentally - is a fine of up to Â£5,000, or six months in prison. People are welcome to take photos outside. Can I take children or pets to a polling station? You can, but voters are advised not to update their social media accounts inside the polling station. The rules for postal voting are different, so voters can share photos of their own postal ballot paper on social media if they wish. The Electoral Commission says there is nothing in law to prevent someone wearing a political slogan when going into a polling station to vote. However, they should leave immediately afterwards, as campaigning inside polling stations is not allowed. Political discussion is banned inside polling stations. Staff will intervene if they hear any references to candidates or parties. Animals, apart from assistance dogs,are not usually allowed in polling stations.,external However, other dogs can be admitted at the discretion of the local authority. Bringing children to the polling station is encouraged, to help educate them about democracy. But children are not allowed to mark your vote on the ballot paper. People who have been drinking or are drunk can vote, unless they are disruptive. Polling station staff can help you, or you can bring someone with you. In England, anyone over the age of 18 can help you cast your vote. They do not need to be eligible to vote in the election. Polling stations should have large-print sample ballot papers and tactile voting devices to help people with visual impairments. You can take your phone into the polling booth to use magnifier or text-to-speech apps, or the phone torch to improve lighting. But you must not take any photos inside the polling station. Voting in UK elections is not compulsory. It is entirely up to you whether or not to vote. Some people deliberately spoil their vote - for example, by writing a message on the ballot paper as a protest. These are recorded, but do not count for or against any candidate. If you sign your ballot and your name is identifiable, the vote does not count. Sometimes so-called \"tellers\" stand outside the polling station and ask voters for the number on their polling card. They are volunteers who work for candidates. They use the information to check who has voted, so they can remind people who have not yet done so. They are allowed to ask for your polling card number, but you do not have to give it to them.",

Alternatively, anyoneregistered to vote,externalwithout the correct ID - or who no longer looks like their photo - can apply fora free document called a voter authority certificate,external.

Both they and their proxy - a person nominated to vote on their behalf - must already be registered to vote. Can I take children or pets to a polling station? If you go to the polling station without the correct ID, you will be asked to come back with valid documentation. If you think your ID has been wrongly rejected, the Electoral Commission - which oversees UK elections - saysyou should notify the presiding officer at the polling station.,external If this does not resolve the issue, you can raise your concerns with your council's returning officer. Polling station staff record how many voters are turned away, as well as the number who return with valid ID. According to the commission: 0.2% of people trying to vote at a polling station in the May 2024 local elections were unable to because of the ID requirement 0.08% were turned away from polling stations at the general election because of a lack of ID When the photo ID rules were introduced in May 2023, the government said it would stop votes being stolen, although that is quite unusual in the UK. There were 1,462 cases of alleged electoral fraud reported to police between 2019 and 2023,according to the most recent figures from the Electoral Commission.,external Of these, 11 involved impersonation at polling stations. One resulted in a conviction and one in a caution, and the police took no further action in the other nine cases. The Electoral Commission has called on the government to expand the list of accepted ID and to allow voters to cast their ballot without ID if another registered voter could vouch for their identity.",

    "title": "White House calls Amazon tariff fee display \"hostile and political\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 29, 2025 / 3:31 PM EDT/ CBS News White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, citing a report that Amazon plans to display tariff charges on imported goods, called the move \"a hostile and political act.\" The e-commerce giant plans to display new tariff costs next to products' prices, political news site Punchbowlreportedearlier Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. The move would provide shoppers with clarity into the cost of the new levies on imported goods. \"Why didn't Amazon do this when the Biden administration hiked inflation to the highest level in 40 years?\" Leavitt said during a press briefing Tuesday. However, Amazon pushed back on the report, saying in a Tuesday statement to CBS News that its Amazon Haul store \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products.\" Amazon Haul wasintroduced late last yearby the e-commerce giant to sell low-cost goods to compete with Temu and Shein. \"This was never approved and is not going to happen,\" said Tim Doyle, an Amazon spokesperson. President Trump confirmed to reporters that he spoke with Amazon founder Jeff Bezos on the phone Tuesday morning. \"Jeff Bezos was very nice,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. And he did the right thing.\" The president has imposed tariffs as high as 145% on goods imported from China, while he lowered a range of tariffs on most other nations to a 10% baseline rate during a90-day pausethat began earlier this month. Tariffs are import duties that are paid by U.S. companies such as Walmart and Target, which typically pass on the added fee to consumers in the form of higher costs. The duties are already making foreign-made goods more expensive for U.S.-based consumers. Earlier this month, data showed thatAmazon sellers had already hiked priceson nearly 1,000 of the top 100,000 selling products on the site, according to SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike was about 30%. At the time, Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\" \"We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement earlier this month to CBS MoneyWatch. Otherretailers are introducing \"tariff surcharges,\" such as Dame, a sexual wellness brand, which has implemented a $5\"Trump tariff surcharge\"that is automatically added to customers' online shopping carts at checkout.

    "title": "India planning ‘military strike’ within 24-36 hours – Pakistan",
    "article_text": "Pakistan has alleged that India is planning a military strike on its territory, signaling a further escalation in tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends to launch a military strike within the next 24 to 36 hours, using the Pahalgam incident as a false pretext,”Islamabad's Information Minister Attaullah Tarar wrote on X on Tuesday evening. “Any act of aggression will be met with a decisive response. India will be fully responsible for any serious consequences in the region,”Tarar added. His statement came after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave his country’s armed forces“full operational freedom”to determine the mode, targets, and timing of a response to the recent terrorist attack in India’s Jammu and Kashmir union territory, which left 26 people dead, mostly tourists. New Delhi has linked the terrorist attack to Pakistan, reiterating long-standing accusations that its neighbor supports cross-border terrorism and insurgencies. Islamabad has denied the allegations and, in turn, accused India of backing“terrorist networks”operating on Pakistani soil. The two countries have a long-standing dispute over the Kashmir region, which is de facto divided by the Line of Control established after the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War. On April 22, terrorists opened fire on a group of people in Pahalgam, in the northern part of Jammu and Kashmir. The Resistance Front, believed to be an offshoot of the Pakistan-based jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, has claimed responsibility for the attack. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to punish“the terrorists and their backers.”Indian media reported on Tuesday that four anti-terror operations were underway in Jammu and Kashmir. In an interview with Al Jazeera, Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif suggested that the Pahalgam attack was a false flag operation staged by India. In response, New Delhi’s Deputy Envoy to the United Nations, Yojna Patel, condemned Islamabad for making what she called“baseless allegations against India.”",

    "title": "Trump envoy sought to convince Putin on terms of ceasefire deal – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "US special envoy Steve Witkoff sought to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire last week that would halt fighting in the Ukraine conflict along the current frontlines, Bloomberg has reported, citing sources. Putin maintained a firm stance during the lengthy meeting, the sources said. The discussions on Friday marked the latest in a series of contacts between Moscow and Washington in recent months. Witkoff, seen as a key figure in kickstarting negotiations on the Ukraine conflict, has held multiple rounds of talks with senior Russian officials, including at least three meetings with Putin. People familiar with the process told Bloomberg on Tuesday that Putin insisted any viable peace deal must include formal recognition of the four former Ukrainian regions that joined Russia after referendums in 2022. Moscow has long said it is open to negotiations but maintains that the status of Crimea – which joined Russia in 2014 – and the four other regions is not up for discussion.  Moscow insists that recognition of the“reality on the ground”is vital for a lasting peace. Last week, Axios reported that Washington had presented Kiev with what US President Donald Trump described as a“final offer”to end the conflict. Under the proposal, the US is said to be prepared to grant“de jure”recognition of Crimea as part of Russia, and unofficially acknowledge Moscow’s“de facto”control over the Lugansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, as well as the regions of Kherson and Zaporozhye. Vladimir Zelensky’s subsequent declaration that Kiev would never recognize Crimea as Russian prompted a warning from Trump that he risked losing his whole country if he continued stalling talks with Moscow. Trump, who met with the Ukrainian leader on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral at the Vatican on Saturday, was later asked by journalists if Zelensky was now prepared to“give up”the peninsula.“Oh, I think so, yeah,”he replied. One source told Bloomberg that negotiations have stalled for now and that progress would likely require direct contact between Putin and Trump. The two leaders held a two-hour phone call in March, during which they reaffirmed their commitment to achieving a“lasting peace”rather than a temporary solution to the Ukraine conflict.  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this month that a Putin-Trump meeting“will take place”but only“at the appropriate time.”",

    "title": "Russia and US were close to World War III – Oliver Stone",
    "article_text": "There was a point during the last three years of the Ukraine conflict where Russia and the US were teetering on the edge of nuclear war, according to acclaimed filmmaker Oliver Stone. Speaking to Russian students at the ‘Knowledge.First’ event in Moscow on Tuesday, Stone spoke out against the US role in the Ukraine conflict, as well as its biased coverage in Western media. The Hollywood legend suggested that over the past three years, Moscow and Washington have relived the Cold War spike in tensions that previously culminated in the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and said he hoped a corresponding wind-down would follow. The United States and the Soviet Union came close to a nuclear confrontation during the Cold War after the USSR positioned medium-range ballistic missiles in Cuba, partly in response to the earlier deployment of American nukes in Turkey. ”I want to emphasize to you students how very close we came to World War III because of this awful leadership,”he said. ”We bring a great waste of our resources, and the height of this futility was a war which [former US President Joe] Biden recently dedicated to weakening Russia,”Stone said.“It is a retrograde war.” Western media coverage of the conflict and Russia has shocked him during the past three years, the director admitted. ”Even at the height of the Cold War, we didn’t treat Russia like this,”he said. Whereas now, the media has trained people in the West to equate Russia with President Vladimir Putin, Stone added. This is a tragic substitution of hatred for intelligence. “The propaganda state in the West is an incredible empire. Far further and stronger than I ever imagined. You are unable to see the inside of the matrix,”he said. Straight out of the works of George Orwell. While the anti-war filmmaker has been a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, he has criticized Biden and the US“neoconservative movement”for the Ukraine conflict. Stone produced the 2016 documentary ‘Ukraine on Fire’ showing the role Washington played in the 2014 Maidan coup that overthrew Kiev’s democratically-elected president Viktor Yanukovich.",

    "title": "Law & Order: Organized Crime’s Christopher Meloni Does Not Ship Benson & Stabler",
    "article_text": "Since the premiere ofLaw & Order: Organized Crime, Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) hasn’t been able to catch a break. His wife was killed in a car bomb meant for him, international crime syndicates have placed targets on his back, and he is a 58-year-old in a 26-year-long situationship (with his formerSVUpartner Olivia Benson, played by Mariska Hargitay). To make matters worse, season five’s premiere episode ends with a suspect ramming into Stabler’s car as he escapes with a victim, leaving him in critical condition. The crash sets up the series’s intense second episode, co-written by Meloni, which takes a deep dive into a comatose Stabler’s psyche. The pitch, Meloni explained, went like this: \"What do you think if we have Stabler do something superheroic, gets injured in the moment, and it's Benson who is there to bring him back to life with her presence?” The pair hadn’t seen each other since theSVUseason 24 finale, when Benson pulled away from Stabler when he went in for a kiss, leaving their unresolved feelings to linger. Benson’s confession in his hospital room this season only deepens the characters’ will-they-or-won’t-they dynamic, whichLaw & Orderproducer Dick Wolf has been teasing across various shows since 1999. As for Meloni's perspective on the show’s romantic tension, he’s leaving the shipping to fans. “I'm not a shipper. I see the characters and I don't yearn for shipping,” he states. He adds, “I let characters play out as the writers want them to play out.” Ahead of the season five premiere ofOrganized Crimestreaming onPeacock, theL & Omultiverse veteran walkedGQthrough hisOrganized Crimewriting debut, Stabler’s complicated past, and tweeting through fascism. Christopher Meloni:The impact has been more on how I view the profession of law enforcement and their mindset, or how I portray the mindset and the difficulties, the stresses, and the world that they live in. I've found a kinship in that. I think my worldview has always been a bit jaundiced. I meet an awful lot of detectives who, even though they've seen some things, still swim through the world with a clearer eye as to human nature. I'm always impressed when I meet detectives and they'll tell me the stories that they've gone through, and they're really solid and adjusted and focused and clear. It hasn't broken them or spoiled their opinion of humanity. No, but we’re both still on a quest for the meaning of it all. I think we both share those questions:God, where are you? I want to have a relationship here, and I don't, what is it? Do I not have the tools? Am I not looking hard enough? Am I going about it the wrong way? Abigail Breslin was on our show. I guess she was eight or nine years old, maybe. When Mariska and I saw her act, we just looked at each other, going, “Uh-oh. That is some formidable kid.” Bradley Cooper, I've known him fromWet Hot American Summer, but he was on the show before he becameBradley Cooper, and you're like, “Wow.” You can tell, you just can tell. Elizabeth Banks, same way. She was on the show. You're just like, \"There's something in there that's just, they got it.\" So yeah, a lot of [actors passed] through and it kind of makes you feel like you're part of TV history. He can't wait to look for a moment to loosen thetie. When I wear a tie, I like to just keep it up and buttoned up for the most part. He's a better dresser than I. At the beginning of every season, that was an absolute necessity. We can deal with all the wardrobe issues we want, but what we have to take care of is the comfort of our feet, because we're on our feet for 16 hours a day and very often chasing perps over cobblestoned roads. I don't know how the ladies do it. I don't know how Mariska does it. But God bless them. I remember when we started, Stabler was coming back, and I talked with a lot of professionals who are helping police forces go from the idea of being warriors to being guardians of the common good, which I thought was an interesting use of the words and an interesting change in the headset. It was tricky, and there was a lot of discussion in the Wolf Organization, because they knew—this is a delicate dance. I didn't feel the need to do a mea culpa tour. I always felt that Stabler, this character, was an honest cop, a good cop. His heart was in the right place. Was it always perfect? No. I don’t think that whatever my character did influenced the outside behaviors of society or cops. I think things have changed. I don't think we have changed. I think we're always very cognizant of how much is too much, but then you got to give a little bit of much for a sense of drama. You just have to be honest when trying to tell the stories of dangerous environments. I find the hero worship to be uncomfortable. I just find it far more interesting to see the struggle of an ordinary man put in extraordinary circumstances and how he handles and fails at things. He's a flawed human being. I don't tie those two worlds together. If I go on X and all that, that's where I get very vocal. But on Instagram, I don't want to corrupt or pervert that space with what's happening. That's more of a whimsical personal engagement. So, I compartmentalize these things. I already get accused on Twitter of having Trump Derangement Syndrome, but I don't feel that way. Yeah, I'm rocking it hard. I'm keeping it trim. Are you thumbs up or thumbs down on the rocking of the goatee? Well, you know, fandom—they're all over the map. You know, I heard someone tweeted something like, \"I hate Stabler. He's just a hothead with anger management issues.\" I'm like, \"Y'know, OK—you don't have to look.\" That's the way to look at it. I mean, I've either failed at my job, or maybe you need to look at the trauma that you have endured. I mean that without being sarcastic. We all have these prejudices or triggers. Nah, super rarely. I mean, it really is a cesspool. That's why I took a break and I'm on the verge of taking another break. With the sense of fascism growing by the day and no one doing anything about it, I think my tweets will save the day [laughing].",

    "title": "Hong Kong man suffers ‘flesh-eating infection’ after acupuncture, leg amputated",
    "article_text": "Patient, 47, sprained his back while lifting heavy objects before seeking traditional Chinese medicine treatment, investigations show A 47-year-old Hong Kong man has undergone an amputation of his left lower leg two days after developing a Group A Streptococcal infection following acupuncture treatment he received at two traditional Chinese medicine clinics. The Centre for Health Protection said on Tuesday the man developed a fever and left thigh pain on April 11 and subsequently sought care from a private hospital, where he was diagnosed with septic shock and necrotising fasciitis, commonly known as “flesh-eating infection”. He was transferred to Queen Mary Hospital the next day and underwent a left lower limb amputation the following day. The centre said the man, who had underlying illnesses, remained hospitalised in stable condition. Group A Streptococcal infection is caused by bacteria, namely Streptococcus pyogenes, that can be found in the throat and on the skin. It can be transmitted by droplets and physical contact. The centre said the initial epidemiological investigations revealed on April 6 that the patient had sprained his back while lifting heavy objects, subsequently experiencing pain in his left hip and numbness in his left leg and foot. The patient sought traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture treatment from two registered practitioners in Sheung Wan and Causeway Bay on April 7, 9 and 10.",
