During a heated discussion on transgender individuals serving in the military this week, The Atlantic contributing writer Jemele Hill made a comparison between Martin Luther King Jr. during the civil rights movement and transgender Americans. This comes after theSupreme Courton Tuesday sided with the Trump administration in lifting a lower court order that paused the Pentagon's transgender military ban from taking effect. Trump officials have argued that the transgender military policy \"furthers the government’s important interests in military readiness, unit cohesion, good order and discipline, and avoiding disproportionate costs.\" On Tuesday during \"CNN NewsNight with Abby Phillip,\" a roundtable conversation and debate occurred about the decision.

Jennings hit back, \"Are you really going to go down this ridiculous road?… This is a ridiculous argument.\" Republican strategist Shermichael Singleton also said on the hypothetical question, \"I personally think there is a difference, and I am just going to leave it at that.\" Jennings continued to push back on the claim that there is a comparison between the two.

Jennings quickly responded, \"It's also sports today, by the way… 80% of Americans agree, by the way.\" \"The majority sometimes is wrong,\" Hill said. \"The majority used to believe that Dr. MLK Jr. was somebody who was a threat and somebody who was not a good American.

    "title": "California track meet turns to political rally over trans athletes as schools speak out vs. state",
    "article_text": "California high school student-athletes Olivia Viola and Reese Hogan speak at a rally ahead of a major track and field event to oppose trans athletes in their sports. (Credit: Sophia Lorey of the California Family Council) A girls' track meet in California was turned into a political rally on Saturday amid agrowing controversyover a trans athlete who has dominated in the girls' high-jump, long-jump and triple-jump this season. The rally came less than two days after three of the state's esteemed Christian high schools sent a letter to theCalifornia Interscholastic Federation(CIF) challenging its longstanding policy that allows biological males in girls' sports. JSerra Catholic High School, Orange Lutheran High School and Crean Lutheran High School sent a joint letter to the CIF Thursday, referencing the trans athlete who competed in Saturday's state semifinal prelims. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"For young women, CIF’s Gender Identity Policy means lost opportunities and an unlevel playing field. The consequences of this Policy will be felt this weekend as CIF’s state semi-final competitions for track and field events take place. Star female athletes, some of whom attend our schools, will soon compete in multiple track and field events against a male athlete who self-identifies as a female,\"the letter read. \"CIF’s Gender Identity Policy also fosters an environment that is increasingly hostile to religious member schools. CIF’s expectation that all faith-based schools facilitate the CIF Gender Identity Policy puts religious schools in the untenable position of adhering to the tenets of their faith in their classrooms and communities but practicing something contrary to their faith on their athletic fields.\" The letter went on to suggest that some of the female athletes competing for the three Christian schools considered not competing against the trans athlete in Saturday's semifinal prelims. And then prior to Saturday's meet at Yorba Linda High School, multiple girls' athletes, parents and school officials spoke at a press conference organized by California Family Council outreach director Sophia Lorey. \"No matter how hard we train, how many hours we put in, reality will always set in that men and women are different,\" said Olivia Viola of Crean Lutheran. \"To me, this just doesn't seem fair. CIF is doing nothing to protect us female athletes.\" The CIF is currently under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for allowing trans athletes to compete in girls' sports, and potential Title IX violations. CALIFORNIA GIRL OPENS UP ON FIGHTING LEGAL AND POLITICAL BATTLE OVER TRANS ATHLETES AFTER LIFE-CHANGING PAIN California was one of the first states to openly defy President Donald Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order after he signed it on Feb. 5. \"The CIF provides students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete in education-based experiences in compliance with California law [Education Code section 221.5. (f)] which permits students to participate in school programs and activities, including athletic teams and competitions, consistent with the student’s gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the student’s records,\" the CIF previously said in a statement to Fox News Digital. California Governor Gavin Newsom said during an episode of his podcast that he believes trans athletes competing with girls is \"deeply unfair.\" But the governor still justified policies that enable it for the sake of empathy for the trans community. The state has seen multiple controversies erupt over the past year regarding the issue, and many other residents and even some schools are taking stands against the state officials enforcing the inclusion policies. The Redlands Unified school board in San Bernardino voted in late April to adopt a new policy that would keep transgender athletes out of girls’ sports. Abipartisan surveyby the Public Policy Institute of California found that the majority of California residents oppose biological male trans athletes competing in women's sports. That figure included more than 70% ofthe state's school parents. \"Most Californians support requiring transgender athletes to compete on teams matching the sex they were assigned at birth,\" the poll stated. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Solid majorities of adults (65%) and likely voters (64%) support requiring that transgender athletes compete on teams that match the sex they were assigned at birth, not the gender they identify with.

    "article_text": "Author Peachy Keenan discusses President Donald Trump floating the idea of a $5,000 baby bonus for new mothers on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’ What should have been the happiest day of 17-year-old Darla Svenby’s life became quickly mired in heartbreak. After a long night of labor at St. Margaret’s Hospital in Montgomery, Alabama, the young woman was told her baby was breech and that a C-section was necessary. A few hours later, she gave birth to ahealthy baby boy. FIRST LADY MELANIA TRUMP WELCOMES MILITARY MOMS TO WHITE HOUSE FOR MOTHER'S DAY But there was no celebration. The unwed mother had made the painful decision to allowher child to be adopted. As the adoptive parents tingled with joy, the young mother who had just given birth was left with a hollow ache. The young mother is shown in a photograph as a teenager.(Darla Allgood) \"Please,\" she cried to her nurse. \"Please let me hold my baby. Just once. I need to tell him goodbye.\" Nurse Danella Walters was a woman ofdeep faith. She had seen many mothers in distress during her years of service, but she also knew the hospital’s policy: Birth mothers were not permitted to bond with their babies in adoption cases. MOTHER'S DAY QUIZ! HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW THE ANNUAL HOLIDAY FOR MOMS? But something about this young mother's raw grief struck her to the core. Moments later, Darla Svenby’s own mother entered the room. She gently told her daughter that she’d seen — and even held — the baby. The young new mom couldn't stop her tears. Mrs. Svenby reached out to hug her daughter, whispering, \"He’s perfect.\" \"He’s beautiful. I prayed for him. And I promised God we would pray for him every day of our lives.\"(iStock) Those simple words settled Darla Sveny's sobs into silence. Her mother went on, \"He’s beautiful. I prayed for him.

    "article_text": "Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss President Donald Trump’s announcement that India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire, following escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed nations. As officials in the White House became increasingly concerned about the escalation in theconflict between Pakistan and India,it was decided Friday morning that Vice PresidentJD Vancewould call Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Twenty-four hours before PresidentDonald Trumpannounced on social media Saturday morning that aceasefire had been reached,the scramble in the White House began. Senior officials began to fear that the situation could spiral out of control with neither side seriously considering options for de-escalation after Pakistan hit back at Indian military sites on Friday following an Indian missile attack on Pakistan. The strikes mark the latest escalation between the nuclear-armed rivals, a move triggered by a mass shooting for which India blames Pakistan.

The vice president encouraged Modi to consider de-escalation options, including a potential off-ramp that U.S. officials knew the Pakistanis would be amenable to. Modi listened to the vice president’s message, although he didn’t explicitly indicate openness to any of the options put forth. Vance's call to Modi came less than a month after hemet with the Indian leaderin New Delhi to discuss trade talks. From that point, key U.S. officials continued to work the phones with their counterparts in India and Pakistan into the night to help re-establish communications between the two sides, allowing them to work out terms for a ceasefire in the next 12 to 18 hours.

    "article_text": "The ‘Fox & Friends’ hosts discuss comedian Bill Maher’s decision to accept President Donald Trump’s invitation to visit the White House, and the reaction from both supporters and critics. New Democratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg told \"Real Time\" hostBill Maheron Friday that the Democratic Party lost in 2024 because they paid two billion dollars to get voters not to believe their own eyes and ears. Hogg, the 25-year-old progressive, who was elected to the position earlier this year, argued that his party lost voters among most demographics last November because they wanted voters to believe former President Biden was fine and that the economy was good, despite Americans seeing the opposite. \"People said to us that Joe Biden is too old, and they said that prices are too high. And we said with the power of two billion behind us, ‘No, he’s not,’ then ‘Yes, he is,’ and then, ‘No, they’re not. Look at this graph of the stock market,’\" he said on the HBO talk show.

Isn’t that the strategy that Trump employed? Like, ‘She’s for they/them and he’s for you.’ That was the big ad that worked.\" Hogg acknowledged the point but zoomed out, saying it was more about PresidentDonald Trumpshowing voters that he heard their concerns, while Democratic leaders seemed to deny what their voters were really feeling. \"I think the reason why that worked though, Bill, is because people felt like they weren’t heard by us,\" he said. DAVID HOGG AND EX-TRUMP OFFICIAL SPAR IN FIERY CLASH OVER KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION David Hogg was elected as the DNC's vice chair earlier this year.(GABY VELASQUEZ/ EL PASO TIMES / USA TODAY NETWORK) After mentioning the party covering for Biden, or being in denial about prices, he declared, \"If you tell people not to believe their eyes and their wallets, you’re going to lose them.\" The progressive has taken heat from fellow Democratic figures since being elected to the vice chair position. He made headlines last month for clashing with veteran Democratic strategistJames Carvilleduring an episode of journalist Tara Palmeri’s podcast. The two sparred over Hogg’s strategy of primarying older Democratic lawmakers in blue districts to make room for new Democratic leaders. Carville criticized it as \"abominable\" and \"jacka--ery of the highest level\" for prioritizing pushing out Democrats over beating Republicans. Hogg shot back that the party is capable of both. Carville demanded Hogg focus on winning elections against the GOP. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Hogg insisted that the point of his strategy is to \"win elections.\" \"It’s not to win an election in Queens which you don’t ever run against a Republican. It’s to help Democrats win elections.\" The two ended up burying the hatchet, with Carville posting to X that the DNC \"needs him,\" as he \"fights\" for the party. Hogg’s strategy even ran afoul of new DNC Chair Ken Martin, who said in an April conference call, \"I've said to him, if you want to challenge incumbents, you're more than free to do that, but just not as an officer of the DNC, because our job is to be neutral arbiters.

Former Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita, Trump 2016 campaign manager Paul Manafort, and strategist and pollster Tony Fabrizio round out the team backing Berisha, according to the Associated Press. LaCivita has compared Trump and Berisha, saying they are both \"unfairly prosecuted and persecuted by a government that has no regard for Democracy.\" When asked by Syri TV’s Cim Peka why the Albanian election is important for the world, LaCivita said that \"one of the things that many of us know in the United States is that the Soros family is very active in politics around the globe, and it’s not just regular politics, it’s destabilizing politics.\" LaCivita said that the family thrives \"in an environment where the governments are insecure and they found the perfect home unfortunately in Albania, and they found the perfect prime minister in Edi Rama.\" SOROS V TRUMP — SOCIALISTS TARGET CONSERVATIVES IN UPCOMING EUROPEAN NATION'S ELECTION Chris LaCivita, who served as co-campaign manager of Donald Trump's successful 2024 presidential campaign, shakes hands with Sali Berisha, leader of Albania's main opposition center-right Democratic Party that he is consulting for the upcoming May 11 parliamentary election, in Tirana, Albania, Feb. 10, 2025.(AP Photo) The Socialist Rama is hoping to win a fourth consecutive term as PM in Sunday's election on a promise of bringing Albania into the European Union while the country still faces major problems of graft and corruption. LaCivita explained that calling out Soros’ involvement was important \"because it has an impact on Albania’s future.\" He said that Berisha’s campaign is \"about the Albanian people,\" explaining that their \"biggest desire is to be able to work, live, and raise a family and have a future and so any time that there are individuals or that there are organizations that want to create an atmosphere that make that difficult, to me they’re the actual enemy and those are the people that we wage campaigns to actually defeat.\" George and Alex Soros’ Open Society Foundations has been very involved in the Balkans and has invested over $131 million in Albania in a period of 18 years. Requests sent to representatives of the Soros' Open Society were not returned by press time. When Fox News Digital spoke to Berisha in April about the impediments he faced in the May 11 elections, he named the sanctions placed against him by the Biden administration for allegations of corruption in 2021. \"I’m not able to meet with Albanian Americans, which are so numerous, and in this election, for the first time, they have the right to vote for the party and candidate they prefer in their country of origin,\" Berisha explained.

In April, the State Department did not respond to Fox News Digital’s questions about whether it would consider lifting sanctions against Berisha, and whether the sanctions in place impeded free and fair elections in Albania. A spokesperson told Fox News Digital Thursday that \"the Department has nothing to report on this designation at this time.\" Berisha’s race has been fraught by other complications, including being stripped of his legal immunity in December 2023 and held under house arrest until November 2024. Berisha is currently awaiting trial on corruption charges. Berisha told Fox News Digital that thecharges were the product of lawfareleveled against him by Rama and Soros. Berisha is not the only opposition candidate who has faced charges in the lead-up to elections. Former Albanian president Ilir Meta was alsoarrested on corruption allegationsin October 2024.

Major right-wing opposition parties have accused the longtime Prime Minister Edi Rama of corruption and have called for the government to resign.(Photo by Adnan Beci/AFP via Getty Images) Former Albanian Ambassador to the United States and the United Nations Agim Nesho told Fox News Digital that \"May 11 elections are unfolding under intense pressure from the ruling Socialist Party, which has clung to power for over 12 years. The regime stands accused of jailing opposition leaders on fabricated charges, weaponizing state institutions, and silencing dissent in a country where citizens are increasingly afraid to speak freely.\" Nesho claimed that \"the Albanian people are being denied the basic democratic rights to organize, vote, and oppose the government without fear. This system of repression, critics say, is supported—either tacitly or directly—by elements of the Biden administration and global actors likeAlex Soros, who have worked to undercut the opposition and prevent free and fair elections, much like the political persecution seen in the United States against former President Donald Trump.\" Saying that the \"election could mark a turning point,\" as \"a true grassroots movement is rising—ready to challenge state corruption and restore Albania’s path to freedom, development, and democratic self-determination,\" Nesho called \"on the Trump administration to closely monitor these elections and send a clear message to Tirana: America is watching.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama waves as he addresses his supporters in the central square of Tirana, following his Socialist Party election victory on April 27, 2021.

The Albanian people deserve free elections, not another manipulated outcome enforced through fear and political imprisonment.\" Politico reportedthat while Rama’s Socialist Party appears to be ahead in polling, the impact Albanians who live abroad being allowed to vote for the first time, and a lack of reliability in polling data may still leave room for Berisha to secure victory and return to office as prime minister.

    "title": "Ukraine and its allies push for a 30-day ceasefire starting Monday",
    "article_text": "Vice President JD Vance describes the Trump administrations Russia-Ukraine war strategy and addresses the economic impact of tariffs on The Story. In a show of unity in Kyiv on Saturday, leaders from four major European countries threatened to ratchet up pressure ifRussian President Vladimir Putindoes not accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. The leaders, from France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, said the proposal to start the ceasefire on Monday was supported byU.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day. Their statement came amid mounting efforts to persuade Moscow to agree to a truce that would allow for peace talks on ending over three years of full-scale war. ON THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF UKRAINE INVASION, EUROPEAN LEADERS SHOW SUPPORT, EXPRESS UNEASE The demand was announced in a joint press conference withUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyand countries leading the so-called \"coalition of the willing\": a group of over 30 countries who have pledged to strengthen Ukraine to deter Russian aggression. They included French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who on Saturday traveled to Ukraine together for the first time. The ceasefire would include a halt to fighting on land, sea and in the air. The leaders threatened to ratchet up sanctions, including on Russia’s energy and banking sectors, if Putin did not comply.

(Ludovic Marin, Pool Photo via AP)(Ludovic Marin/AP) Earlier that day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv and its allies are ready for a \"full, unconditional ceasefire\"with Russiafor \"at least 30 days\" starting Monday. He added the four visiting leaders and Zelenskyy had had a \"constructive\" phone call with Trump. Saturday marked the last day of a unilateral three-day ceasefire declared by Russia that Ukraine says the Kremlin’s forces have repeatedly violated. In March, the United States proposed an immediate, limited 30-day truce, which Ukraine accepted, but the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking. Building upUkraine’s military capabilitieswill be a key deterrent against Russia, the European leaders said Saturday. This will require supplying Ukraine with robust quantities of arms to deter future attacks and investing in its defense sector. A force comprised of foreign troops could also be deployed as an added \"reassurance\" measure, Macron said. RUSSIA DECLARES 3-DAY CEASEFIRE IN UKRAINE FOR WWII VICTORY DAY The French president added that the United States will take the lead in monitoring a proposed ceasefire, with support from European countries, and threatened \"massive sanctions ... prepared and coordinated between Europeans and Americans,\" should Russia violate the truce. But he said details about potential European deployments to Ukraine were still being fine-tuned. No mention was made of NATO membership, still Kyiv’s top choice for a security guarantee. The priority is to make the war too costly for Russia to keep fighting, Ukraine's Sybiha told reporters on the sidelines of the event. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said Saturday that a \"comprehensive\" 30-day ceasefire, covering attacks from the air, land, sea and on infrastructure, \"will start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.\" From left, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrive to put flowers on memorial of fallen Ukrainian soldiers at independence square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Saturday, May 10, 2025.

(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka)(AP Photo/Evgeniy Maloletka) Earlier on Saturday, theEuropean leadersjoined a ceremony at Kyiv's Independence Square marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. They lit candles alongside Zelenskyy at a makeshift flag memorial for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and civilians slain since Russia's invasion. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war, but while Zelenskyy agreed to the American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, Russia has not signed on. Instead, it has kept up attacks along the roughly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) front line, including deadly strikes on residential areas with no obvious military targets. On Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day killed three residents and wounded four more. Another civilian man died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin. Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"What’s happening with Poland, Germany and Great Britain is a historic moment for European defense and toward a greater independence for our security. Obviously, for Ukraine and all of us. It’s a new era. It’s a Europe that sees itself as a power.\" PUTIN ORDERS PARTIAL CEASEFIRE AFTER CALL WITH TRUMP BUT NOT THE ONE HOPED FOR Trump said last week that he doubts Putin wants to end his war in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon, and hinted at further sanctions against Russia. U.S. President Donald Trump gestures as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy looks on on the day they meet at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 28, 2025.(REUTERS/Nathan Howard) Progress on ending the war has seemed elusive in the months since Trump returned to the White House, and his previous claims of imminent breakthroughs have failed to come to fruition. Trump has previously pushed Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war, threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult. Ukraine’s European allies view its fate as fundamental to the continent’s security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily, regardless of whether Trump pulls out.

    "article_text": "Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney told President Donald Trump that Canada wouldn't ever be available for purchase. In response, Trump told him the option wasn't off the table. PresidentDonald Trumpand his administration inked a major trade deal with the U.K. Thursday, and closed the week gearing up for trade talks with China over the weekend. Details of the specific trade plan with the U.K. are sparse, but the deal keeps the existing 10% tariffs in place against U.K. goods while removing some import taxes on items like steel and cars. \"With this deal, the U.K. joins the United States in affirming that reciprocity and fairness is an essential and vital principle of international trade,\" Trump said Thursday. \"The deal includes billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports, especially in agriculture, dramatically increasing access for American beef, ethanol and virtually all of the products produced by our great farmers.\" TRUMP SIGNALS CHINA ‘VERY MUCH’ INTERESTED IN SECURING TRADE DEAL AHEAD OF SWITZERLAND NEGOTIATIONS President Donald Trump along with Vice President JD Vance and Peter Mandelson, British Ambassador to the United States, third from left, listen as Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain speaks on the speakerphone in the Oval Office at the White House May 8, 2025, following Trump's U.K. trade deal announcement.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) The deal is the first historic trade negotiation signed followingLiberation Day,when Trump announced widespread tariffs for multiple countries April 2 at a range of rates. The administration later adjusted its initial proposal and announced April 9 it would immediately impose a 145% tariff on Chinese goods, while reducing reciprocal tariffs on other countries for 90 days to a baseline of 10%. China responded by raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. Trump also shed some insight into trade negotiations with China, given that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to kick off trade negotiations with China in Switzerland Saturday. \"Scott's going to be going to Switzerland, meeting with China,\" Trump told reporters Thursday at theWhite House.\"And you know, they very much want to make a deal. We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make them? It doesn't matter. Only matters what happens in that room. But I will tell you that China very much wants to make a deal. We'll see how that works out.\" Here’s what also happened this week: Trump also doubled down on his interest in expanding the U.S. during a Tuesday visit with Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney. Trump regularly has said he wantsCanada to become a U.S. state,and has discussed acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal for security purposes. However, the matter of Canada isn’t open to negotiation, Carney said. \"Having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale,\" Carney said at the White House Tuesday. \"Won't be for sale ever, but the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together. We have done that in the past, and part of that, as the president just said, is with respect to our security, and my government is committed for a step change in our investment in Canadian security and our partnership.\" CARNEY SAYS CANADA IS NOT FOR SALE, TRUMP REPLIES ‘NEVER SAY NEVER’ President Donald Trump meets with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, May 6, 2025.(Jim Watson/AFP) While Trump acknowledged that Canada was stepping up its investment in military security, he said, \"Never say never\" in response to Canada becoming another state. \"I’ve had many, many things that were not doable, and they ended up being doable,\" Trump said.

    "title": "House Republicans release tax plan for Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the Republican Party divide over potential tax hikes on ‘Special Report.’ House Republicans released a portion of PresidentDonald Trump’stax agenda late on Friday evening, bringing them one step closer to completing the commander-in-chief’s \"big, beautiful bill.\" The legislation includes an increased child tax credit (CTC), a higher threshold for estate tax liability – what Republicans have referred to as the \"death tax\" – and several other measures. It also lays the groundwork for making Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanent. Republican leaders had warned that failing to do so would lead to a tax increase of over 20% for millions of Americans, if TCJA were allowed to expire at the end of this year. There is no information in the bill so far about state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps, which have been asignificant point of contentionbetween blue state Republicans critical to keeping the House majority, and GOP lawmakers from deeper red, lower-tax states. SCOOP: REPUBLICANS DISCUSS DEFUNDING 'BIG ABORTION' LIKE PLANNED PARENTHOOD IN TRUMP AGENDA BILL President Donald Trump is helping to get House Republicans' budget bill over the line.(Getty Images) Another notable exclusion is anew millionaires’ tax bracket.Trump had floated the idea of a small tax increase on the ultra-wealthy, and a source familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital earlier this week that Trump was considering allowing a pre-TCJA 2.6% tax hike on people making $2.5 million per year or more. Those measures and others are not necessarily excluded from the final bill, however. The legislation is also expected to include new Trump tax pledges like eliminating taxes on tips, overtime wages and Social Security checks for retirees. More elements are expected to be added in the coming days via amendments. The full legislation is expected to advance through the Ways & Means Committee, the House’s tax-writing panel, on Tuesday afternoon. Release of the legislation is a major sign of progress for House GOP leaders, who had been forced to punt their initial planned deadline of having a bill on Trump’s desk by sometime between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July. But SALT deduction caps and a millionaire’s tax hike are two of the most volatile discussion points. House Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith said his panel will advance the bill on Tuesday.(Tom Williams) House Republicans currently have a razor-thin three-vote margin, meaning they can afford to have little dissent and still pass anything without Democratic support. They’re hoping to do just that, with virtually no Democrats currently on board with Trump’s massive Republican policy overhaul. Republican lawmakers are working to pass their legislation via the budget-reconciliation process, which lowers the Senate’s passage threshold from 60 votes to 51, lining up the House’s own simple majority threshold. Reconciliation allows the party in power to effectively skirt the minority and pass broad pieces of legislation – provided they address taxes, spending or the national debt. Trump wants Republicans to use the maneuver to tackle his priorities on the border, immigration, taxes, defense, energy, and raising the debt ceiling. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY Both the House and Senate passed frameworks setting the stage for the bill earlier this year. Now, the relevant committees of jurisdiction on either side must craft policy in line with that framework, before all the parts are fitted into a final bill that must again pass both houses of Congress before being signed into law by Trump. The most recent portion released by the House Ways & Means Committee would increase the current maximum CTC from $2,000 to $2,500. It would also boost the maximum deduction for qualified business income, a tax provision known as 199A, from 20% to 22%. That would largely affect small business owners whose entities are taxed under individual income tax rates. On the estate tax, which is levied on assets after person's death, it raises the exemption level to $15 million from the current level of roughly $13.9 million. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans havelong criticized the estate taxas a needless financial burden on grieving families, particularly hitting small family-owned businesses. Supporters of the federal estate tax point out that it affects a relatively small number of estates. \"Seven years ago, the Trump tax cuts sparked an economic boom and provided needed relief to working families. Pro-family, pro-worker tax provisions are the heart of President Trump’s economic agenda that puts working families ahead of Washington and will create jobs, grow wages and investment and help usher in a new golden age of prosperity,\" House Ways & Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said in a statement on Friday night. \"Ways and Means Republicans have spent two years preparing for this moment, and we will deliver for the American people.\" Elizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

Why is it that Democrats care so much about supporting violent criminal illegal aliens, they care so much about supporting MS-13 gang members?\" Though many Democrats claim that Abrego Garcia is an innocent man who was wrongly deported, the administration has pointed to considerable evidence that he is a member of the MS-13gang. According to police and court records shared with Fox News Digital, Abrego Garcia was arrested in Hyattsville, Maryland, in October 2019, at which point he was identified by the Prince George's County Police Gang Unit as an MS-13 gang member. WHO IS THE DEMOCRATIC GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE ARRESTED FOR TRESPASSING AT AN ICE DETENTION CENTER? An undated photo of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.(Murray Osorio PLLC via AP) A federal immigration court in Baltimore further determined that Abrego Garcia was not eligible for release, because he had \"failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that his release from custody would not pose a danger to others, as the evidence shows that he is a verified member of MS-13.\" Several DHS sources have confirmed to Fox News Digital records indicating that Abrego Garcia also had been pulled over by a Tennessee highway patrol trooper while driving an SUV belonging to Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, another illegal alien who in 2020 confessed to human smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border.

    "article_text": "Fox News’ Martha MacCallum reports from Vatican City covering Pope Francis’ funeral mass. The Catholic bishops ofWashington stateare resisting a new law signed by Democratic Governor Bob Ferguson that they say would violate the seal of confession, which would result in excommunication for any priest who complies. Spokane, Washington, Bishop Thomas Daly released a statement in response to the law in which he said that he and his priests \"are committed to keeping the seal of confession – even to the point of going to jail.\" The new law,signed last week by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, who is Catholic, added \"members of the clergy\" to a list of professionals who are required to report information that relates to child abuse or neglect to law enforcement, and the measure does not provide an exception for information offered at a confessional. The law is set to go into effect on July 26. A central tenet of the Catholic sacrament of confession is that priests are bound by an absoluteseal of confidentiality, an obligation that requires them to keep anything learned in confession a secret. Violating this tenet results in what is called \"excommunication,\" which cuts a person off from the church and eternal life, according to Catholic teaching. DOJ INVESTIGATING ‘ANTI-CATHOLIC’ WASHINGTON STATE LAW REQUIRING CLERGY TO REPORT CHILD ABUSE The Catholic bishops of Washington state are resisting a new law signed by Democratic Governor Bob Ferguson that they say would violate the seal of confession, which would result in excommunication for any priest who complies.(Chona Kasinger/Bloomberg via Getty Images and iStock) While Daly said that his diocese has a zero-tolerance policy regarding child sexual abuse and that the church would \"do everything within our power to keep your children safe,\" he said the \"Sacrament of Penance is sacred and will remain that way in the Diocese of Spokane.\" Seattle Archbishop Paul Etienneframed the issue as a question of whether the clergy is \"answerable to God or state.\" He quoted a scripture passage that reads, \"We must obey God rather than men.\" \"This is our stance now in the face of this new law. Catholic clergy may not violate the seal of confession – or they will be excommunicated from the Church,\" said Etienne, adding: \"All Catholics must know and be assured that their confessions remain sacred, secure, confidential and protected by the law of the Church.\" CHOOSING AN AMERICAN POPE 'CANNOT BE AN ACCIDENT,' SAYS PAUL MAURO Democrat Bob Ferguon won the 2024 Washington state governor's race, defeating Republican challenger Dave Reichert.(Getty Images) Etienne said that the law cuts to the heart of the First Amendment’s ban on the state either establishing or prohibiting the free exercise of a religion. \"Once the state asserts the right to dictate religious practices and coerce information obtained within this sacrament – privileged communication – where is the line drawn between Church and state? What else may the state now demand the right to know? Which other religious practices will it try to legislate?\" asked the archbishop. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division opened an investigation into the law for possible violations of the First Amendment'sreligious protections. A statement by the division said that the new law \"singles out ‘members of the clergy’ as the only ‘supervisors’ who may not rely on applicable legal privileges, including religious confessions, as a defense to mandatory reporting.\" BROOKLYN BISHOP BRENNAN ON WHAT POPE LEO XIV MEANS FOR THE CHURCH Archbishop Paul Etienne is the leading Catholic cleric for the city of Seattle.(Reuters/Chris Helgren) \"The law appears to single out clergy as not entitled to assert applicable privileges, as compared to other reporting professionals,\" said Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division. \"We take this matter very seriously and look forward to Washington State’s cooperation with our investigation,\" said Dhillon. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Bishop Joseph Tyson of Yakima, Washington, posted on Facebook that he was grateful for theJustice Department’sinvestigation, saying that the bishops’ attempts to meet with the governor about the law had gone unanswered. \"I realize that many may disagree but in a way that parallels attorney client privilege, the seal of confession allows the penitent to come to grips with moral accountability and culpability,\" said Tyson. \"We want to hope and pray that the heart of an offender would be so moved by the mercy of God and the guidance of the skilled clergy that it would necessarily lead to an encounter beyond the sacramental seal with law enforcement.\" Ferguson did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

Trump said that there would be stiff consequences for those who do not comply with his order, but added that migrants who have behaved in the U.S. may get a chance to come back in – as long as they follow the rules of the new plan. \"Illegal aliens who stay in America face punishments, including significant jail time, enormous financial penalties, confiscation of all property, garnishment of all wages, imprisonment and incarceration and sudden deportation, in a place, and manner solely of our discretion,\"Trump said. \"So to all illegal aliens who book your free flight right now, we want you out of America.

    "article_text": "Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage, in an exclusive Fox News Digital interview, points to President Trump and says a main reason he’s coming out of retirement to run for Congress is ‘I have a friend in the White House right now’ LEWISTON, MAINE -EXCLUSIVE -Former two-term Gov. Paul LePage of Maine says PresidentDonald Trumpis a major reason why he's coming out of political retirement at age 76 – and he's eyeing a campaign comeback. \"I never, ever had any aspirations to go to Washington until now,\" LePage said this week in his first national interview after launching his bid for the House in Maine's SecondCongressional District,which is a top swing seat the GOP aims to flip in the 2026 midterm elections. The contest will likely be one of the most closely watched House races in the country next year as the Republicans aim to hold their fragile majority in the chamber. \"Donald Trump, I think, is doing what is necessary in addressing the debt this country is facing. And I think that's a big, big thing for me,\" LePage said as he was interviewed in the Maine city where he was born and raised. HOUSE REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN CHAIR SPELLS OUT HIS PLAYBOOK TO HOLD THE CONGRESSIONAL MAJORITY Former Republican Gov. Paul LePage, who is running for the House in 2026 in Maine's 2nd Congressional District, speaks with Fox News Digital in Lewiston, Maine, on May 7, 2025, in his first interview after announcing his candidacy.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) LePage highlighted, \"I have a friend in the White House right now. I know President Trump. I think I can have an audience of President Trump. I know several of his secretaries very well. And so I think this is a good time. It's a good time for me to go help.\" LePage – the brash and blunt politician who won over blue-collar workers struggling with economic woes, which helped the Republican businessman win election and re-election in the blue-leaning state – was one of the first major GOP elected officials to endorse Trump when the president first ran for the White House nearly a decade ago. \"I was Donald Trump before Donald Trump became popular,\" LePage joked at the time, in a line that's since become famous. The conservative governor, who grabbed national attention with controversial comments made during his tenure, briefly moved with his wife, Ann, to Florida after finishing his second term in 2019. \"I am done with politics. I have done my eight years. It’s time for somebody else,\" he said at the time. CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS TARGETING THESE HOUSE REPUBLICANS IN 2026 MIDTERM BATTLE But LePage re-establishedresidency in Mainefive years ago and challenged his successor as governor, Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, in the 2022 election. LePage ended up losing his bid for a third term by 13 points to Mills, but he did carry the 2nd Congressional District in that race. Moderate Democratic Rep.Jared Golden, a U.S. Marine veteran who deployed to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and who often bucks his own party in Congress, has held the seat since first winning it in 2018.

Jared Golden, D-Maine, at a news conference in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, March 6, 2024, has represented Maine's 2nd Congressional District since first winning the seat in 2018.(Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc. via Getty Images) But Golden won re-election by a razor-thin margin last year in the district, which is the second-most rural in the U.S. and the largest east of the Mississippi River. And Trump, who carried the district in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections by nine, seven and 10 points, earned an electoral vote each time, as Maine and Nebraska, are the only two states in the union to allocate their electoral votes partially by congressional district. MAINE'S GOLDEN TAKES AIM AT FELLOW DEMOCRATS OVER POLICY Golden, in a statement after LePage announced his candidacy, said, \"I thought Paul was doing his best work in retirement.\" But the 42-year-old Golden has yet to announce whether he'll seek re-election next year or instead run for either the state's Senate seat or the open governor's office. Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spotlighted LePage's tenure as governor. \"Paul LePage’s time in office was defined by his obsession with blocking Mainers’ ability to receive quality health care, opposing Medicaid expansion at every possible opportunity,\" DCCC national press secretary Viet Shelton argued in a statement. \"At a time when Republicans in Congress are pushing the largest cut to Medicaid in history, Mainers can’t afford LePage’s crusade to rip health care away from people.\" In his Fox News interview, LePage reiterated that the nation's debt is a top motivation for him to return to politics. As of May 8, the national debt was $36,212,886,111,158.26, according to Fox News'National Debt Tracker. \"It's the spending and the debt that this country has, and I'm worried about my grandchildren, great-grandchildren. And I think we have a president now that's really willing to tackle it, and I’m willing to help,\" he said. But LePage added that \"the other thing that is really big is what's happening in our country with the woke environment. I think I want to be there to help clean that up if we can. Having boys play in girls' sports is really sad.\" He also highlighted his Tuesday meeting—part of a three-day swing through the congressional district—with Maine student Cassidy Carlisle, whom he described as \"the courageous young woman fighting unfair male competition in girls’ sports.\" Maine's 2nd Congressional District shares a long border withCanada. When asked if he'll be spotlighting border security and immigration as major issues in his campaign, Lepage said, \"Big time.\" But the controversial tariffs the president placed on nations across the globe last month has strained relations with Canada. Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage, who's running a Republican campaign for Congress in 2026, speaks to a voter at a gun shop and indoor firing range, on May 7, 2025, in Poland, Maine.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) \"I'm all for the tariffs,\" LePage said. \"The tariffs will fix our international trade and lower taxes.\" LePage acknowledged: \"Is it going to hurt in the short term? Yeah, it's going to hurt a little bit in the short term, but I think it's necessary.\" And he predicted that \"the tariffs are going to be a short-term problem. I think they're going to settle out.\" LePage spoke with Fox News at Lewiston's Franco Center, a performing arts center and historic site of Franco-American culture located in a former Gothic church built in 1907 for French Canadian immigrants in Maine, which is located alongside the city's historical mills and canals. Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage, who's running a 2026 Republican campaign for Congress, tours the Franco Center, a performing arts center and historic site of Franco-American culture located in a former Gothic church in the city of Lewiston, on May 7, 2025. Lepage was baptized as a child in the church.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) The former governor, who survived a troubling and often brutal upbringing, gave Fox News a tour of the many dwellings within blocks of the Franco Center, where he spent his childhood. The eldest son of 18 children, LePage grew up speaking French in an impoverished home with an alcoholic and abusive father who was amill worker. At age 11, he ran away from home after his father beat him and broke his nose. He lived on the streets of Lewiston and often crashed on friends' couches for a couple of years before earning a living shining shoes, washing dishes at a restaurant, and haling boxes for a local truck driver. \"I had a very, very, rough upbringing as a youth. We were in welfare, we were in poverty,\" he said. Former Maine Gov. Paul LePage points in the location of a building where he lived during his childhood, in Lewiston, Maine, on May 7, 2025.(Fox News - Paul Steinhauser) LePage, speaking in the church where he was baptized and sought refuge during his family troubles, told Fox News, \"It feels good coming in this building. This was a special building. A couple of nuns and priests were really helpful in my upbringing.\" He went on to graduate from high school, and with financial help from friends, attended and graduated from college. He later enjoyed success as a businessman, including greatly expanding Marden's Surplus and Salvage, a Maine-based discount store chain. Years later, he ventured into politics, winning election to the Waterville city council and later serving as the city's mayor before winning statewide office in 2010. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The former governor says his rough childhood has influenced his political life in a way that not many other politicians can understand. And he lamented, \"Unfortunately, the mentality in the current society is not to help people get out of poverty, but it's to keep them in poverty.\" \"I want to help get them out of poverty,\" he said. \"I think there are so many programs that we can institute that will elevate people in poverty, rather than keep them.\" Paul Steinhauser is a politics reporter based in the swing state of New Hampshire.

Nearly two dozen states have banded together, filing an amicus brief to defend the constitutional rights of aFlorida family, whose public middle school is accused of secretly \"socially transitioning\" their 13-year-old daughter without their consent. The brief, filed on April 30, involves January and Jeffrey Littlejohn, parents inLeon County, Florida, who allege school officials met privately with their child about using a new name and pronouns, and did not inform or involve them as parents. School staff allegedly asked the Littlejohns' daughter which bathroom and locker rooms she wanted to use, which gender she wanted to room with during overnight trips, and if she wanted her parents to be notified. A three-judge panel from the11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlantasided 2-1 with the school district in a ruling on March 12, finding school officials \"did not act with intent to injure\" or \"force the child to attend a student support plan meeting,\" thus not meeting the \"shock the conscience\" standard. The Littlejohns appealed, requesting the court hear the case in full.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital asked Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill about 'due process' in President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration. (Nicholas Ballasy) While Republicans have celebrated PresidentDonald Trump'scrackdown on illegal immigration, Democrats have accused the Trump administration's deportations of violating due process. \"We need judges that are not going to be demanding a trial for every single illegal immigrant. We have millions of people who have come in here illegally, and we can't have a trial for every single person. That would be millions of trials,\" Trump recently told reporters on Air Force One. Fox News Digital asked lawmakers on Capitol Hill to respond to Trump's argument thatillegal immigrantsare not entitled to due process. \"People come here and get a legal process called parole and have a right to due process,\" said Sen.Mark Kelly, D-Ariz. \"We are a country of laws, and we shouldn't be kicking people out of the country without having that due process.\" FOX NEWS RIDES ALONG AS FLORIDA HIGHWAY PATROL BEGINS ENFORCING FEDERAL IMMIGRATION LAWS ON STATE ROADS Senators including, from left, Rick Scott, R-Fla.; James Lankford, D-Okla.; and Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., respond to President Donald Trump's comments about due process.(Fox News Digital) According to theFifth Amendmentof the U.S. Constitution, all \"persons\" are entitled to due process. While the extent of due process for deporting illegal immigrants hasplayed out in the courts, Kelly made his position clear when pressed by Fox News Digital. DEM CONGRESS MEMBERS STORM NEW JERSEY ICE PRISON TO CONDUCT 'OVERSIGHT VISIT': 'PEOPLE DESERVE DIGNITY' \"I'll also say, throwing out little kids who are U.S. citizens, it's wrong, it's dangerous. It is certainly not fair to them or their parents, but it really does affect everybody. I mean, tossing out a 2-year-old who's a U.S. citizen is crazy,\" Kelly said.

Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., agreeing with Trump. \"These people are illegal.\" Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., explained to Fox News Digital that while illegal immigrants are entitled to prior notice before deportationunder habeas corpus, the judicial system has not clearly defined how long that window is. \"Basically, the courts have said under a habeas proceeding, there needs to be notice,\" said Schmitt. \"But the question is, what does that notice mean? Is it an hour, is it a day or is it a week? I think what you're ultimately going to see, not under the Alien Enemies Act, but under the habeas cases, is that there's going to be a relatively short window, and [Trump's] going to be able to proceed with these deportations.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Millertold reporters on Fridaythat the White House is considering suspending habeas corpus, which he said the Trump administration has the authority to do during \"a time of invasion.\" \"A lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not,\" Miller said.

    "article_text": "Unleash Prosperity senior fellow EJ Antoni weighs in on the progress DOGE has made exposing 'clear fraud' while Elon Musk is set to step back from the department on 'Fox Report.' A federal judge on Friday issued a temporary pause on the Trump administration’s plans to restructure various government agencies and cut tens of thousands of federal workers because the government overhaul was notauthorized by Congress. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston put a 14-day pause on the mass layoffs, siding with a group of unions, non-profits and local governments after they filed a lawsuit on April 28. Illston said Trump may broadly restructure federal agencies, but only in \"lawful ways\" with approval from Congress. \"The President has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch,\" Illston said. \"Many presidents have sought this cooperation before; many iterations of Congress have provided it.\" FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP ADMIN FROM DISMANTLING 3 AGENCIES A federal judge issued a temporary pause on the Trump administration’s plan to restructure various government agencies and carry out mass layoffs.(Reuters/Leah Millis) \"Nothing prevents the President from requesting this cooperation—as he did in his prior term of office,\" the judge continued. \"Indeed, the Court holds the President likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime.\" Illston's ruling was the broadest of its kind against administration efforts to overhaul the federal government, which have been led byElon Muskand the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE. Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment. In February, Trump directed agencies towork with DOGEto identify targets for mass layoffs as part of the administration's plans to restructure the government. FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS HALT TO TRUMP ADMIN'S CFPB TERMINATIONS The ruling was the broadest of its kind against administration efforts to overhaul the federal government, which have been led by Elon Musk and DOGE.(AP Images) The president instructed agencies to eliminate duplicate roles, unnecessary management layers and non-critical jobs, as well as to automate routine tasks, close regional field offices and reduce the use of outside contractors. The group of plaintiffs said the administration's \"unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation.\" \"Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government – laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that,\" the groups said in a statement. Illston scheduled a hearing for May 22 for a potential longerpreliminary injunction.She said plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm without the temporary restraining order, which she said preserves the status quo. Trump had directed agencies to work with DOGE to identify targets for mass layoffs.(Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The judge said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of some of their claims. They accuse Trump of exceeding his authority and say that DOGE, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management exceeded their authority and violated administrative law. \"The Court here is not considering the potential loss of income of one individual employee, but the widespread termination of salaries and benefits for individuals, families, and communities,\" Illston wrote.

Mexico has filed alawsuit against Googleafter it changed the label for the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform to match U.S. President Donald Trump's executive order to amend the name of the body of water, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced Friday. Sheinbaum said at a press briefing that the lawsuit had been filed against the tech giant, without providing additional details. The lawsuit comes after Sheinbaum threatened in Februaryto sue Google for the name change.

We are already seeing, observing what this would mean from the perspective of legal advice, but we hope that they will make a revision,\" Sheinbaum said at the time. Mexico’s Foreign Relations Ministry has also previously sent letters to Google urging it not to relabel the oceanic basin as the Gulf of America. Trump signed an orderon his first day back in the White House in January to rename the northern part of the gulf to the Gulf of America.

The U.S. has control over about 46% of the gulf, Mexico controls about 49% and Cuba controls about 5%, according to Sovereign Limits, a database of international boundaries. \"What Google is doing here is changing the name of the continental shelf of Mexico and Cuba, which has nothing to do with Trump’s decree, which applied only to the U.S. continental shelf,\" Sheinbaum said in February.

In February, theMexican presidentshared a response from Google's vice president of government affairs and public policy, Cris Turner, who said the company would not change its policy after Trump's order. Sheinbaum’s announcement of the lawsuit comes after House Republicans passed the Gulf of America Act in a 211-206 vote, marking the first step in codifying Trump's order.

    "article_text": "American Bishop Robert Barron details his view on Cardinal Robert Prevost's papal name selection, noting it strikes a balance between opposing views impacting the Church. (Credit: Bishop Robert Barron) American author, speaker and theologian Bishop Robert Barron was at the Vatican this week to witness the election of a new pope, and he shared his thoughts with Fox News Digital about Cardinal Robert Prevost's \"intriguing\" new papal name. Papal names are often very symbolic with regard to how a Pope will serve as the leader of the Catholic Church. Typically, Pope's select the names of predecessors they admire or want to emulate. Prevost ultimately went withLeo XIVin honor of Pope Leo XIII, who served from 1878 to 1903. \"He could have been Francis II, and we would have said, ‘Oh, there he is clearly in the line of Francis.’ He could have been John Paul III, then we would have thought, ‘Oh, he’s very much in that more conservative line.' He could have been John XXIV, and we say ‘Oh, now he’s a real revolutionary liberal, et cetera,'\" Barron said. \"The fact that he went back, well over 100 years, to this very interesting and pivotal figure … our new pope was saying, I too, want a critical engagement with the modern world, not simply a ‘no,’ but also not simply a ‘yes,’ not simply an acquiescence to it.\" CARDINAL DOLAN DESCRIBES POPE XIV AS ‘CITIZEN OF THE WORLD,’ WILL BUILD BRIDGES WITH TRUMP From left to right: Pope John XXIII, Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis I, Pope Leo XIV(Getty Images/Fox News) Barron pointed out that Leo XIII was a pivotal figure due to the timing of his reign, which came during a moment whenthe Churchwas contending with the tremendous political and philosophical upheavals of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the French and American Revolutions, and the introduction of philosophies such as Marxism. \"The church's first reaction [to these changes] was very negative. It was a great ‘no’ to modernity. By the end of the 19th century, I think, with a certain distance and a certain critical intelligence, the church was willing to enter into a more, call it, creative engagement with modernity. And I think Pope Leo the 13th represents precisely that,\" Barron said. The bishop pointed to the Rerum Novarum to further his point, an encyclical letter issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891. BEARS STAR CALEB WILLIAMS ISSUES TWO-WORDED REACTION TO POPE LEO XIV'S ELECTION \"In that document, [Leo XIII] is a fierce opponent of Marxism, a fierce opponent of socialism and communism, a great defender of private property and of the market economy,\" Barron said. \"So you say, 'Okay, there's that great ‘no’ to the left-wing economic revolutions.' At the same time, in that same letter, [Leo XIII] comes out strongly in favor of the right toform unions.He comes out very strongly in favor of what we call the universal destination of goods.\" Newly elected Pope Leo XIV (Right) took his papal name from the late-19th century Pope Leo XIII (Left).(Getty Images/Fox News) \"In fact, Pope Leo says in that letter, once the requirements of necessity and propriety have been met in your life, the rest of what you own belongs to the poor,\" Barron continued. \"That's not a just a standard, boring, mainstream point of view. That's a pretty revolutionary statement. But notice the lovely balance in that letter between ‘yes’ to private property, the great ‘no’ to socialism and Marxism, but the great ‘yes’ to the universal destination of goods. Leo sets the tone thereby for the rest ofCatholic social teachingthat followed him.\" In conclusion, Barron said he thinks Prevost's selection of Leo XIV makes the new pope \"a very interesting player\" in terms of the debate between the Right and the Left in politics. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"[Leo XIV] doesn't fit – and I've said this 1,000 times – he and other great representatives of Catholic social teaching don't fit into our categories of left and right,\" Barron said. \"They don't fit into Democrat-Republican, they're in a space beyond those distinctions. So, I think that's what's perhaps most interesting about him.\"",

The three-term conservative lawmaker who represents a solidly red district in northwest Georgia, in a lengthy statement announcing her decision that was posted to social media on Friday night, took aim at Democratic incumbentSen. Jon Ossoff,a top GOP target whom Republicans view as extremely vulnerable in next year's midterm elections. But Greene saved much of her venom for fellow Republicans, many of whom feared a polarizing campaign if Greene became the party's 2026 nominee in Georgia, and for the institution of the Senate itself. \"Someone once said,‘The Senateis where good ideas go to die.’ They were right.

Why? Because their donors and handlers don’t want change. They want to protect their own interests, not yours,\" Greene charged.

    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says 329,000 mph fusion rocket promises to be fast, disruptive and enable deep-space missions. A Soviet-era spacecraft plunged to Earth on Saturday, more than a half-century after its failed launch to Venus. TheEuropean Union SpaceSurveillance and Tracking confirmed its uncontrolled reentry, based on analysis and no-shows of the spacecraft on subsequent orbits. The European Space Agency’s space debris office also indicated that the spacecraft had reentered after it failed to appear over a German radar station. It was not immediately known where the spacecraft came in or how much, if any, of the half-ton spacecraft survived the fiery descent from orbit. Experts said ahead of time that some if not all of it might come crashing down, given it was built to withstand a landingon Venus, the solar system’s hottest planet. This photo provided by researcher Jane Greaves shows the planet Venus, seen from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Akatsuki probe in May 2016.((J. Greaves/Cardiff University/JAXA via AP) SPACE FORCE'S MYSTERIOUS X-37B PLANE RETURNS TO EARTH AFTER 434 DAYS IN ORBIT The chances of anyone getting clobbered by spacecraft debris were exceedingly low, scientists said. Launched in 1972 bythe Soviet Union, the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 was part of a series of missions bound for Venus. But this one never made it out of orbit around Earth, stranded there by a rocket malfunction. Much of the spacecraft came tumbling back to Earth within a decade of the failed launch. No longer able to resist gravity’s tug as its orbit dwindled, the spherical lander — an estimated 3 feet (1 meter) across — was the last part of the spacecraft to come down. The lander was encased in titanium, according to experts, and weighed more than 1,000 pounds (495 kilograms). The US Space Command has yet to confirm the spacecraft's whereabouts. After following the spacecraft’s downward spiral, scientists, military experts and others could not pinpoint in advance precisely when or where the spacecraft might come down. MASSIVE EUROPEAN POWER OUTAGE BLAMED ON SOLAR PLANT BREAKDOWNS Solar activity added to the uncertainty as well as the spacecraft’s deteriorating condition after so long in space. As of Saturday morning, the U.S. Space Command had yet to confirm the spacecraft's demise as it collected and analyzed data from orbit. The U.S. Space Command routinely monitors dozens of reentries each month. What set Kosmos 482 apart — and earned it extra attention from government and private space trackers — was that it was more likely to survive reentry, according to officials. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It was also coming in uncontrolled, without any intervention by flight controllers who normally target the Pacific and other vast expanses of water for old satellites and other space debris.",

    "article_text": "Emma Dimery, a Minnesota woman who had stage 4 colon cancer, shares how an experimental trial led by Dr. Emil Lou at the University of Minnesota saved her life. The patient and doctor both discuss. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first at-home screening test forcervical cancer, the product’s maker announced on Friday. The DIY test could serve as an alternative to in-person \"Pap smears,\" which are recommended every three years for women up to age 65. The self-collection device — the Teal Wand, made by Teal Health in San Francisco — allows women to procure a sample and mail it in for laboratory analysis. NEW CERVICAL CANCER TREATMENT APPROACH COULD REDUCE RISK OF DEATH BY 40%, TRIAL RESULTS SHOW The test is designed to detecthuman papillomavirus(HPV), the virus that causes almost all cervical cancer cases. The Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home screening test for cervical cancer, the product’s maker announced on Friday.(iStock) The approval comes after a clinical trial includingmore than 600 women, in which the Teal Wand had a 96% accuracy rate of detecting cervical precancers. In the study, 86% of participants said they’d be more likely to comply with cervical cancer screening recommendations if they could do it at home, Teal Health reported. Additionally, 94% said they would prefer to self-collect at home as long as the results were accurate. CERVICAL CANCER DEATHS COULD BE REDUCED WITH HOME HPV TESTING, STUDY FINDS \"Cervical cancer is largely preventable, yet screening rates in the U.S. continue to lag, and the FDA approval of this at-home Teal Wand self-collection device is a critical step forward,\" said Dr. Christine Conageski, associate professor, OB-GYN and director of the Complex Dysplasia Clinic at the University of Colorado, who was a principal investigator in the SELF-CERV trial. \"It offers an evidence-based way to expand access without compromising accuracy,\" she added in a statement. \"Cervical cancer is largely preventable, yet screening rates in the U.S. continue to lag, and the FDA approval of this at-home Teal Wand self-collection device is a critical step forward,\" a doctor said.(iStock) Approximately 11,500 newcervical cancer diagnosesare made in the U.S. each year, and the disease causes 4,000 annual deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

    "article_text": "Rheumatologist Dr. Mahsa Tehrani shares strategies for preventing what a new study projects will be a prevalence of Parkinson's disease on 'America Reports.' An Ohio music conductor is using deep brain stimulation to combat hisParkinson’s disease. Rand Laycock, 70, the director and conductor of a symphony orchestra, was diagnosed just before his 60th birthday, according to a press release from Cleveland Clinic. \"My doctor at the time told me [a Parkinson’s diagnosis] wasn’t a death sentence, and there would be advancements over the next few years to help with my treatment,\" said Laycock. STEM-CELL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S SHOWS 'STRONG PROMISE' IN RELIEVING SYMPTOMS Even after aregimen of medications, however, Laycock's symptoms continued to progress over the next 11 years. When tremors in his right hand began increasing in severity and frequency, he began exploring other treatments. Rand Laycock (pictured), a symphony orchestra conductor, was diagnosed with Parkinson's nearly 11 years ago, just before his 60th birthday.(Cleveland Clinic) \"The tremor would really start to be pronounced if I had a deadline coming up for something with the orchestra,\" Laycock told Cleveland Clinic. DOCTOR SHARES WAYS TO PREVENT GETTING PARKINSON'S DISEASE He also started experiencing dyskinesias, which are involuntary movements that can be a side effect of long-term use of certain Parkinson's medications. Michal Gostkowski, DO, a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic, introduced Laycock to the alternative option ofdeep brain stimulation(DBS), which was described as a \"pacemaker for the brain.\" \"My doctor at the time told me [a Parkinson’s diagnosis] wasn’t a death sentence, and there would be advancements over the next few years to help with my treatment,\" Laycock told Cleveland Clinic.(Cleveland Clinic) DBS is a \"treatment that involves an implanted device that delivers an electrical current directly to areas of your brain,\" according to Cleveland Clinic. There are billions of neurons in the brain, which communicate using electrical and chemical signals. Somebrain conditions, including Parkinson's, can make those neurons less active, the same source stated. PARALYZED MAN WITH ALS IS THIRD TO RECEIVE NEURALINK IMPLANT, CAN TYPE WITH BRAIN Deep brain stimulation applies an electrical current to make those neurons more active. In May 2024, Laycock received abrain implantas the first step of the DBS therapy. He then activated and set up his device with programmer Erica Hennigs, the release detailed. \"I know the thought of brain surgery can be intimidating, but it’s a life-changing procedure that allows you to become your own self again.\" \"When it comes to programming the device, we try different settings at first,\" said Hennigs. \"We then adjust those during follow-up visits as we learn more about how his symptoms are being controlled.\" After seeing success for nearly a year, Laycock progressed to a more advanced form of DBS called adaptive deep brain stimulation, or aDBS. \"Traditional DBS gives the same stimulation to the brain 24 hours a day. What makes aDBS different is that it can adapt and fine-tune the stimulation in real time.\"(Cleveland Clinic) \"Traditional DBS gives the same stimulation to the brain 24 hours a day. What makes aDBS different is that it can adapt and fine-tune the stimulation in real time,\" said Dr. Michael Gostkowski, a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic, in the release. \"By tracking a certain frequency in the brain, it can increase or decrease the stimulation as needed to better control symptoms.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER Laycock was a good candidate for the advanced therapy because his symptoms fluctuated throughout the day, which means a treatment that could adapt to those fluctuations could be more effective, according to the clinic. \"Since Rand’s a music conductor, fine-tuning with aDBS would reduce the risk of him experiencing tremors if his medication were to wear off in the middle of a concert or performance,\" said Hennigs. Laycock was a good candidate for the advanced therapy because his symptoms fluctuated throughout the day.(Rand Laycock) Because of his previous positive experience with DBS, Laycock jumped at the chance to receive the new version. \"It sounded like it would make my life simpler – not having to worry about adjusting my device settings and medications as frequently,\" he told Cleveland Clinic. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The conductor’s implanted device was able to support new adaptive technology, so it was just a matter of working with Hennigs to update the settings. Laycock began receiving aDBS in March 2025. Now, his tremors are almost completely gone except for times of extremestress or anxiety, according to the release. Throughout his health journey, Laycock has not only been supported by his care team, but also his family.(Rand Laycock) \"And my dyskinesia is pretty well under control,\" he said. \"My symptoms are minimal compared to the way they were, and a lot of that is due to adaptive deep brain stimulation.\" Laycock is now approaching his 47th year as a music conductor, the release stated, and he looks forward to spending time with his wife, two children and granddaughter.

    "article_text": "Amanda Harpell-Franz, mother of a 7-year-old boy with autism, shares how the boy's service dog, Kalvin, has helped him socially and emotionally. Left-handedness and certainneurological disorderscould go hand-in-hand, a new study revealed, though the researchers and others acknowledged potential limitations. While about 10% of people in the world are left-handed,people with autismare 3.5 times more likely to have the trait, according to an international team of researchers that analyzed data from over 200,000 individuals. The study, published in the journal Psychological Bulletin, indicated that left- and mixed-handedness also appear more often in people who have diagnoses such as schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability. RISING AUTISM RATES NOW AFFECT 3% OF CHILDREN, SAYS CDC REPORT Mixed-handedness refers to a situation in which people may use their left hand for a certain task and their right hand for others, according to psychology experts. This is slightly different from ambidexterity, which is the equal use of both hands. The study showed that left- and mixed-handedness appear more often in people who have certain diagnoses like schizophrenia, autism and intellectual disability.(iStock) \"The key takeaways of this study are that alterations in hand preference from the norm (i.e., right-handedness) are associated especially with psychiatric and psychological conditions that affect the language system (e.g., dyslexia or schizophrenia) or affect neurodevelopment through an early age of onset (e.g., autismor ADHD),\" lead author Dr. Julian Packheiser told Fox News Digital. He is a researcher at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany. \"Correlation doesn’t imply causation — and being left-handed does not mean someone will develop autism or schizophrenia.\" Not all neurological conditions showed a link to people's dominant hand. Depression and dyscalculia(a math learning disability), for example, showed no meaningful difference in hand preference compared to control groups, the study found. The researchers also determined that \"atypical handedness\" may be associated with long-term linguistic symptoms like stuttering and dyslexia. \"In most people, the dominantside of their brainis typically where speech, language, logical thought processing and hand preference is located,\" Dr. Earnest Lee Murray, a neurologist with West Tennessee Medical Group, told Fox News Digital. He was not involved with the new study. CHILDREN WITH AUTISM MAY SEE SPEECH IMPROVEMENTS WITH OFF-LABEL PRESCRIPTION DRUG \"People who are left-handed or ambidextrous often don’t have such a dominant one-sided brain — rather, the key portions of language can be divided between both sides,\" Murray also said. The study also examined the likelihood of atypical handedness in clinical populations, or groups of people diagnosed with a specific set ofhealth conditionscompared to a control population. It appears that the earlier a disorder's symptoms emerged, the more frequently researchers saw cases of left- and mixed-handedness.(iStock) \"We suspected that left- and mixed-handedness could be associated with disorders whose symptoms are related to language,\" said Packheiser in a press release about the study. \"Language, like handedness, has a very one-sided location in the brain, so it stands to reason that the development of both and their disorders could be linked.\" The researchers also considered other factors that could come into play, such as the age at which a person might exhibit symptoms. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER It appears that the earlier adisorder’s symptomsemerged, the more frequently researchers saw cases of left- and mixed-handedness. The researchers hypothesized that left- and mixed-handedness could be associated with diseases that occur very early in life, because the dominant hand is determined at a very early age – possibly evenbefore birth. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the womb, thumb-sucking at 10 weeks' gestation is heavily linked to which hand will be preferred later in life, they noted. The connection could help experts potentially understand the way brains are organized and how they develop. The new study comes with potential limitations. Not all neurological conditions show a link to the person’s dominant hand, according to experts.(iStock) \"The study has implications when understanding ways of finetuning the neurorehabilitation of patients with one-sided brain conditions, such as stroke,multiple sclerosisor traumatic brain injury,\" Murray said. Jonathan Alpert, a Manhattan-based psychotherapist and author, said the study was \"interesting,\" though he emphasized its limitations. \"Correlation doesn’t imply causation — and being left-handed does not mean someone will develop autism or schizophrenia,\" Alpert, who was not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital. \"Handedness is just one of many factors that can be associated with neurological traits, and these findings should be interpreted with caution to avoid unnecessary alarm or stigma.\" Depression showed no meaningful difference in hand preference compared to control groups, the study found.(iStock) Alpert called for more research to understand the relationship, if any, between handedness and mental health. Lead author Packheiser agreed the results are \"purely correlational.\" \"We have no causal evidence that developing a psychiatric disorder linked tolanguage or neurodevelopmentcauses a change in handedness, or whether changes in handedness cause any disorder,\" he told Fox News Digital.

Once dubbed theNew York Yankees' top prospect, this is Dominguez's first full season, and we are now seeing why the Yankees have touted him so highly ever since he was 16 years old. At age 22, Dominguez made history as the youngest Yankee to ever hit three home runs in a game, doing so against the Athletics in Sacramento. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Jasson Dominguez became the 16th player in MLB history to have a three-homer game with at least one coming from both sides of the plate.(Getty Images) However, there's quite a twist to this historic achievement: The switch-hitter actually hit home runs from both sides of the plate. Dominguez belted his first blast of the night from the left side in the third inning, going back-to-back with Paul Goldschmidt. In the seventh, this time from the right side, he went deep for a solo shot. But to cap it all off, he hit a grand slam in the eighth, back to the left side of the box.

Other Yankees to accomplish the feat include Tom Tresh, Roy White and Mark Teixeira, who actually did it two other times with two other teams.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Rafael Devers' position saga continues, and now, it appears the front office is getting involved. Devers, who has played third base his entire career with theBoston Red Sox, found himself in a peculiar spot when the team signed Alex Bregman, also a lifelong third baseman (and a much better defensive one), shortly before the season started. Devers is a three-time All-Star, and despite plenty of turnover in Boston (most notably, trading Mookie Betts in 2020), Devers was the one star the team opted to keep. They signed him to an 11-year deal worth $313.5 million ahead of the 2023 season, which would have been a contract year.

The plan after Bregman signed appeared to be to move Devers to second, but Devers actually has only DH'd this year. Bregman, meanwhile, has manned the hot corner, and the emergence of rookie Kristian Campbell at second has left Devers without a position in the field. Well, first baseman Triston Casas is out for the season with a knee injury, and the Sox approached Devers with the idea of playing first base, but he shut it down quite quickly. Now, it's being reported that Sox owner John Henry, general manager Craig Breslow and team president Sam Kennedy all flew to Kansas City, where the Sox are playing this weekend, to meet with the four-time All-Star. Manager Alex Coraspoke privately with Devers on Friday, and it's been reported that Devers' attitude about the positions has not been well-received in the clubhouse.

Devers then questioned whether Breslow, the pitcher-turned team executive, had some level of discontent towards him. \"I’m not certain what [issue] he has with me,\" Devers told reporters. \"He played ball, and I would like to think that he knows that changing positions like that isn’t easy.\" Devers is currently hitting .253, his lowest since a .240 campaign in 2018, his second year in the big leagues.

    "article_text": "Officials with the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C, created an animated video showcasing the ancient site where the Megiddo Mosaic would have been found in Israel. The mosaic is on display for the first time since being found. Historians recently unveiled their findings about an ancient purple dye factory located in modern-day Israel — revealing a glimpse into life during biblical times. In an article recently published in the journalPLOS One, historians announced the discovery of Tel Shiqmona, an archaeological mound south of the Israeli city of Haifa. The site is located on the coast of the Mediterreanean Sea. Tel Shiqmona, the article's authors say, \"can unequivocally be identified as a specialized facility for large-scale and long-term production of the lucrative purple dye.\" HISTORIC MARYLAND CHURCH OPENS DOORS TO VISITORS 320 YEARS AFTER CLOSING DOWN The site dates back as early as 1100 B.C., during the Iron Age. InBiblical terms,the site predated the reigns of Kings Solomon and David by over a century, and likely became more sophisticated over time. \"It is the only site in the Near East or around the Mediterranean – indeed, in the entire world – where a sequence of purple-dye workshops has been excavated and which has clear evidence for large-scale, sustained manufacture of purple dye and dyeing in a specialized facility for half a millennium, during the Iron Age,\" the article describes. Historians recently unveiled findings about an ancient purple dye factory. Purple dye was valued in ancient times, as seen on the robes of Justinian (inset, right).(Maria Bukin / PLOS; Getty Images) \"The number and diversity of artifacts related to purple dye manufacturing are unparalleled.\" Pictures show fragments of vats with purple dye stains, as well as purple residue on various stone tools. What makes the site so unique is that it produced purple dye on an industrial scale – which historians previously thought was introduced by Romans in the first century A.D. LONG-LOST CAPITAL OF ANCIENT CIVILIZATION MAY HAVE FINALLY BEEN UNCOVERED, ARCHAEOLOGISTS SAY: 'UNIQUE FIND' The dye, which was harvested by crushing the shells of certain mollusks, was highly valued in antiquity, and mentioned in the Bible several times. Onebiblical mentionof purple dye occurs in Acts 16:14, which describes a female merchant. Archaeologists were able to piece together vat fragments from the factory site.(Moshe Caine / PLOS) \"One of those listening was a woman from the city of Thyatira named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth,\" the verse reads. \"She was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to respond to Paul’s message.\" In Mark 15:17, Jesus was dressed in purple cloth by his captors in order to humiliate him, as the color was associated with royalty. For more Lifestyle articles, visit foxnews.com/lifestyle \"And they clothed him in a purple cloak; and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on him,\" the verse says. At Tel Shiqmona, researchers used a variety of techniques, including chemical and mineralogical analyses, to understand each artifact that was uncovered. In an interview with New Scientist, archaeologist Golan Shalvi said the mollusks would secrete a greenish fluid when crushed, and the fluid would turn purple when oxidized. Purple dye was made from crushing the shells of certain types of mollusks.(Moshe Caine / PLOS) \"However, in order to transform it into an actual dye – one that chemically bonds with textiles – it must be processed into a solution through a complex series of chemical steps,\" Salvi explained. \"It was an industrial site throughout most ofthe Iron Age,without monumental architecture or any particular beauty or elegance,\" he added. \"I imagine it as a very smelly place – especially to a modern nose – since the production process emitted a terrible odor. I picture wool fleeces dyed in various shades drying outside and inside the buildings, which may have given the site a purplish-reddish-blue hue.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER The team of analysts found that the factory at Tel Shiqmona both produced purple dye and then dyed fibers and fleeces, as opposed to simply producing dye. \"The size and opening of the vats would have allowed the dipping of the fleeces or fibers into the vats,\" the article explains. Archaeologists believe that the site at Tel Shiqmona supported industrial-scale dye-making processes.(Moshe Caine / PLOS) \"Given their substantial weight when full, it is unlikely that the vats were intended to be moved, nor could they be tilted. Producing the dye in these very large vessels and then transferring it to other containers for dyeing (at Shiqmona or elsewhere) does not seem to be a plausible reconstruction of the process.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Therefore, we conclude that the entire manufacture, from harvesting the snails to dyeing, was conducted at the site, and that dye-production and dyeing were conducted in one container – apparently a rather efficient process.\" Andrea Margolis is a writer for Fox News Digital and Fox Business.

    "article_text": "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before. A French startup named Robeauté has just raised about $29 million to develop a truly groundbreaking neurosurgical microrobot. Imagine a device no bigger than a grain of rice that can carefully navigate the complex and delicate pathways of the brain. This little robot could change the way doctors treat brain tumors and other neurological conditions, making surgeries safer and more precise than ever before. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts, and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfree Ultimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! A neurosurgical microrobot.(Robeauté) Brain surgery is incredibly complex. The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech. In some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options. A neurosurgical microrobot.(Robeauté) TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT Robeauté’s microrobotis designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales. Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson’s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely. What is really impressive is how the robot’s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot’s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision. A neurosurgical microrobot.(Robeauté) AI ENABLES PARALYZED MAN TO CONTROL ROBOTIC ARM WITH BRAIN SIGNALS So far, the microrobot has been tested in preclinical trials, mainly on sheep, with very promising results. There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeauté plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030. A neurosurgical microrobot.(Robeauté) AI SYSTEM RESTORES SPEECH FOR PARALYZED PATIENTS USING OWN VOICE The potential impact of this microrobot is huge. It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Robeauté’s microrobot represents an exciting fusion of robotics, artificial intelligence, biology, and medicine. It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain. While there are still hurdles to overcome, such as regulatory approvals and manufacturing at scale, this tiny device has the potential to turn previously \"inoperable\" brain tumors into treatable conditions. As one of the company’s founders describes it, the microrobot acts like a \"brain gardener,\" delicately tending to damaged tissue from within. With strong funding and a growing portfolio of patents, Robeauté is poised to make a lasting impact on the future of neurosurgery.

But today, I want to offer something more meaningful than a gift or a meal: I want to remind you that America needs you now more than ever. In a moment when our culture feels fractured, our families are under pressure and our future is uncertain, it’s mothers who hold the line. It’s mothers who hold homes and hold hearts together. And it’s mothers who quietly, faithfully lead with the kind of strength this nation cannot survive without. It’s mothers who quietly, faithfully lead with the kind of strength this nation cannot survive without.(iStock) While the headlines celebrate celebrity CEOs or political powerhouses, I believe the mostprofound leadershipin America is happening quietly, around kitchen tables, in carpool lines and beside hospital beds. It’s happening through you. MOTHERHOOD DOES NOT FIT SO WELL IN A CULTURE THAT VALUES SELF-CARE OVER SERVICE. AND THAT'S A PROBLEM Think about it: every day, you make a thousand small but powerfuldecisions for your family. Every lunch packed, every schedule coordinated, every hard conversation navigated. You manage conflicts, negotiate compromises, anticipate needs, and carry the weight of other people’s futures in your hands. And you do it not for applause, not for titles, but out of love. That’s not weakness. That’s strength under control. That’s servant leadership in action. I’ve seen it firsthand in my own home. My wife doesn’t lead with a spotlight; she leads with steadfastness. She doesn’t chase recognition; she shoulders responsibility. And through her daily sacrifices, both seen and unseen, our family flourishes. Real leadership isn’t measured by followers or influence, it’s measured by the flourishing of those entrusted to your care.(iStock) THE WORLD’S TOUGHEST, YET MOST REWARDING JOB: MOMS ARE HEROES Her leadership has shaped character,cultivated faithand built resilience in our children far more effectively than any platform or podium ever could. You may not always feel it, but the influence you carry is immeasurable. In a world obsessed with platform and prestige, your leadership reminds us of something better: real leadership isn’t measured by followers or influence, it’s measured by the flourishing of those entrusted to your care. Jesus said it plainly: \"Whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant\" (Matthew 20:26). CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION And you’re living that kind of greatness every day.

Today, I simply want to say: thank you. Thank you for leading with grit, grace and selfless love. Thank you for persevering in the unseen moments. Thank you for reminding us that the leadership that bends low to lift others up is the leadership that leaves the deepest mark on the world.

    "article_text": "Ras Baraka was arrested at an ICE prison in New Jersey on Friday. Lawmakers also attempted to storm the facility to conduct an \"oversight visit.\" (Credit: NEWS12NJ) Among the most dangerous jobs that any American can do is guarding prisons, and among the hardest prisons to guard are facilities that hold members of foreign gangs likeMS-13. Yet, for some idiotic reason, the mayor of Newark, N.J., and three members of Congress, all Democrats, decided to make that job even more dangerous on Friday. At the Delaney Hall ICE facility in Newark, these so-called leaders didn’t just stage a protest, theyillegally trespassedon a federal detention facility, pulling its guards away from normal duties and forcing the photo-op arrest of the mayor. NEWARK MAYOR ARRESTED AS DEM CONGRESS MEMBERS STORM ice FACILITY U.S. Attorney for the District of New JerseyAlina Habbadescribed the desperate grandstanding on X shortly after the incident. \"The Mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center in Newark, New Jersey this afternoon,\" Habba wrote. \"He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW.\" This hapless foursome of Garden State windbags consisted of hizzoner, as well House of Representative members Bonnie Watson Coleman, LaMonica McIver, and Rob Menendez, Jr. If that last name sounds familiar it is because his father,Robert Menendez Sr., is the disgraced ex-senator recently convicted of taking bribes, including gold bars from foreign governments. Maybe Menedez the Younger was just practicing visiting his dad behind iron bars. Top Democratic gubernatorial candidate  Ras Baraka was arrested on Friday for trespassing at an ICE holding facility in Newark during a protest.(AP Photo/Seth Wenig and Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg via Getty Images) In any event, these four blustering blowhards waited for a bus to enter the facility and ran in behind the bus, in clear violation of federal laws. They were told to leave and refused. Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested during the despicable display, something he almost certainly planned to happen. Did I mention he’s running for governor? And Democrats from across the country decried his detention as another example of Trumpian authoritarianism. Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, a Democrat, of course, rushed to his peer's defense. \"Regardless of your views on ICE, the law is the law and any facility operating in a New Jersey municipality must follow it,\" said Fulop, who is also running for governor. \"If Delaney Hall doesn’t have proper local authorization, Mayor Baraka had every reason to be there, and every right to demand accountability.\" But what did Baraka think was going to happen when he illegally and stupidly tried to break into prison? There are countless ways that Baraka and the lawmakers could have exerted oversight without inviting criminal chaos. Where was this outpouring of moral outrage when former President Biden was letting illegal migrants pour into the country and murder innocent people? What is most shameful here is the utter disregard these public servants had for the law enforcement officials who had to referee their little parade. Last week in Charleston, West Va., I spoke to a police officer who trains others and asked how the deportations impact their job. \"There is no such thing as a low-risk encounter,\" he said. \"There is only high risk and unknown risk,\" and, of course, the possibility that a suspect might have a deportation order makes every stop potentially more dangerous. The point here is that while these Democrat doofuses were enjoying their made-for-TV moment, law enforcement at the facility were forced to face a new challenge to their already demanding jobs. These officers had no idea if anyone in the assembled crowd might be armed, if others might use the farcical distraction caused by these politicians to rush the facility, or if those inside might take the opportunity to make mayhem. In other words, it was an unknown risk. Indeed, as the White House was quick to point out, this facility holds murderers and rapists, the worst of the worst, but somehow, through the slow-working moral poison of leftism, these elected officials are convinced the criminals are the victims. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION These four Jersey Democrats owe every law enforcement official who had to waste their time and put themselves in danger on Friday an apology. Whatever one thinks of Trump’s deportation policies, it's not these officers’ fault, and they shouldn’t pay a price for it. Americans understand what is happening with deportations; Many approve, many don’t, but there is no reason for Democrat politicians to stage elaborate and potentially dangerous pity pageants in our prisons. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Where was this outpouring of moral outrage when former President Biden was letting illegal migrants pour into the country and murder innocent people? If the Democrats want to change our deportation policies, they'd better get to winning elections and stop aggravating our law enforcement with pointless antics. Until then, Trump will continue to target and remove those who are in our nation illegally.

    "title": "BROADCAST BIAS: Networks ooze with sympathy to anyone who opposes Trump",
    "article_text": "Columbia University student Lishi Baker joins ‘America Reports’ to describe the tense atmosphere as masked protesters shouted anti-Israel slogans. Everything the broadcast networks reportabout politics revolves around fervent opposition to President Donald Trump. If you watch them daily, you feel very certain that Trump has put the economy in a \"tariff meltdown,\" he’s ruined our reputation around the world, and he’s running roughshod over poor, innocent immigrants. Now that theircelebrated deportee Kilmar Abrego Garcialooks more undeniably like a wife beater who was actively employed in human trafficking of other illegal immigrants, the networks need a new sympathetic victim. They found one in Mohsen Mahdawi, a 34-year-old U.S. permanent resident who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank who, as a student at Columbia, led pro-Hamas protests as they chanted \"From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,\" which means theywant the nation of Israel destroyed. COLUMBIA'S ACTING PRESIDENT SLAMS STORMING OF CAMPUS LIBRARY BY ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS: 'UTTERLY UNACCEPTABLE' In April, ICE took him into custody and prepared him for deportation. When a judge overruled them and Mahdawi was released, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin argued: \"When you advocate for violence, glorify and support terrorists that relish the killing of Americans, and harass Jews, that privilege should be revoked, and you should not be in this country.\" Mohsen Mahdawi, center, looks on during an anti-Israel protest at Columbia University on Oct. 12, 2023, in New York.(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura) But CBS reporter Lilia Luciano celebrated Mahdawi, as he proclaimed his \"freedom signals a light of hope\" and, after being asked what he \"felt\" when he learned he’d be released, he added he \"was reassured in my heart of the belief that justice will prevail and the justice system is functioning.\" Mahdawi quoted Martin Luther King Jr., as if his heroes in Hamas are role models of nonviolence. Luciano failed to revisit the interview Mahdawi gave to \"60 Minutes\" for a December 2023 segment on campus protests. Mahdawi supported Hamas by arguing \"When somebody is hurting you, when you see this person is being punched in the face and this feeling, it is: You now feel my pain.\" CBS’s Bill Whitaker pushed back: \"But this Hamas attack wasn't a punch in the face. This was a horrible terror attack.\" Mahdawi claimed he wasn’t justifying the slaughter of 1,200 people, but he then said he \"can empathize\" with Hamas. \"To empathize is to understand the root cause, and to not look at any event or situation in a vacuum. This is, for me, the path moving forward.\" CBS is now ignoring that court documents show Mahdawi allegedly told a gun shop owner he would work at his shop for free, and that he,\"had considerable firearm experienceand used to build modified 9mm submachine guns to kill Jews while he was in Palestine.\" But he's presented positively as a peaceful protester. On April 29, NPR anchor Leila Fadel also promoted Mahdawi, and asserted there was no evidence Mahdawi used \"threatening rhetoric,\" since \"from the river to the sea\" chants calling for the destruction of Israel is somehow not defined as \"threatening.\" He \"finds peace in meditation,\" NPR oozed. Mahdawi's lawyer, Luna Droubi, claimed that \"Mahdawi has been very vocal in his opposition to antisemitism.\" So much for the \"killing Jews\" allegations. The networks also find Trump’s victims among his former employees. In her \"Meet the Press\" interview, host Kristen Welker pressed the president about an apparent Justice Department investigation of Miles Taylor, the former DHS bureaucrat who was granted a much-promoted anti-Trump op-ed in The New York Times as \"Anonymous\" and then came an \"Anonymous\" book deal. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION \"Last month, you directed your attorney general, Pam Bondi, to review two people who you perceive to be your political adversaries,\" Welker weirdly claimed, as if you can’t be sure Taylor has been all over television trashing Trump. \"You told me in December that you would not direct the Justice Department to investigate your political foes.\" These TV anchors pretend Biden’s Justice Department didn’t spend every minute prosecuting Trump and his supporters. They followed up by interviewing Taylor on \"NBC Nightly News.\" Legal reporter Laura Jarrett — the daughter of Obama chief of staff Valerie Jarrett — clearly constructed the interview to elicit sympathy for Taylor, presenting him as an endangered whistleblower, not an attention-seeking opportunist who may have divulged classified information as he capitalized on his \"anonymous\" revelations. On April 29, NPR anchor Leila Fadel also promoted Mahdawi, and asserted there was no evidence Mahdawi used \"threatening rhetoric,\" since \"from the river to the sea\" chants calling for the destruction of Israel is somehow not defined as \"threatening.\" \"The 38-year-old says he's now receiving a barrage of threats,\" warned Jarrett. Taylor claimed \"My wife has to read online about people saying that they'll put me in front of a firing squad. We were told by security experts to go update our last will and testament.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Jarrett wasn’t going to imagine what people say on the internet about Trump and how some rooted for his assassination. Taylor was allowed to play the hero who won’t be silenced: \"What I worry about is that they will try to use this tactic, this bludgeon of the bully pulpit of the presidency to go shut people up.\" ABC, CBS, and NBC all use their \"bludgeon of a bully pulpit\" to intimidate conservatives and Republicans and seek victory for the Democrats. Anyone opposed to Trump will be lionized as Trump is routinely demonized. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TIM GRAHAM",

The rule, which wasfirst proposed in 2023, took aim at businesses selling physical and digital subscriptions — everything from streaming services to gym memberships — through simple signup flows, only to have customers discover later that they have to go through a much more complex or time-consuming process to cancel. Under the Negative Option Rule, businesses would not be able to force customers to cancel subscriptions through a method different from the one they used to sign up — so if you signed up with a few clicks on a company’s website, you should be able cancel on their website, too. Companies are also required to provide relevant information about cancellation before they collect customers’ payment information. According to the FTC,the rule went into effecton January 19, but enforcement of some provisions was delayed until May 14. Now the FTC is delaying enforcement by another 60 days, until July 14. “Having conducted a fresh assessment of the burdens that forcing compliance by this date would impose, the Commission has determined that the original deferral period insufficiently accounted for the complexity of compliance,” the FTC said in a statement. The commission voted 3-0 to delay enforcement. The FTC traditionally has five commissioners — three from the president’s party and two from the opposing party — but President Donald Trumpfired the two Democratic commissionersin March. Those commissioners thensued Trump, arguing their firing violates a Supreme Court precedent that the president cannot fire FTC commissioners without cause. Despite the delay, the FTC said it will indeed begin enforcement July 14, when “regulated entities must be in compliance.” “Of course, if that enforcement experience exposes problems with the Rule, the Commission is open to amending the Rule to address any such problems,” the FTC added.

We’ve got lots of news for you this week: There were CEO shake-ups at Instacart and 11x; the web series is back — kind of; Threads is getting video ads; and much more. Let’s get to it! Big move:Instacart CEO Fidji Simowill become OpenAI’s CEO for Applications, the company said this week. Simo is already on the OpenAI board. She’ll be tasked with helping OpenAI in scaling “traditional” company functions, CEO Sam Altman said, but he didn’t provide any details on what that means. Speaking of OpenAI:The company decided that itsnonprofit division will retain controlover its for-profit organization after initially announcing that it planned to convert to a for-profit organization. OpenAI says that it made the decision “after hearing from civic leaders and engaging in constructive dialogue with the offices of the Attorney General of Delaware and the Attorney General of California.” And speaking of CEO moves:11x CEO Hasan Sukkar announced thathe’s stepping downand moving into a “non-executive chairman” position. In March, TechCrunch reported that 11x had been showing off on its website customer logos of companies that were not active customers, and one of those companies was threatening to sue over the matter.

The lawsuits were brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in 2022. Facebook’s parent companyMeta agreed to pay a similar amountto settle a facial recognition-related lawsuit from Paxton last year. “In Texas, Big Tech is not above the law,” Paxton said ina statement. “For years, Google secretly tracked people’s movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won.” Paxton’s office also said this is the “highest recovery nationwide against Google for any attorney general’s enforcement of state privacy laws.” A Google spokesperson said the company is settling the lawsuits without any admission of wrongdoing or liability, and without having to change any of its products. “This settles a raft of old claims, many of which have already been resolved elsewhere, concerning product policies we have long since changed,” said spokesperson José Castañeda in a statement. “We are pleased to put them behind us, and we will continue to build robust privacy controls into our services.” Google won some earlier victories in these suits, for example with an appeals court ruling thatthe company lacks sufficient ties to Texasto face a lawsuit there. The company had initially responding by sayingPaxton mischaracterized its products“in another breathless lawsuit” — for example, the company said Google Photos only scanned users’ faces in order to group similar photos together, and that it did not use the feature for advertising. The settlement comes after major antitrust rulings finding that Google acted illegally to maintain monopolies inweb searchandadvertising tech, with proposed remedies including the divestment of Chrome. (Google has said it will appeal both rulings.) Paxton, meanwhile, recently announced that he willchallenge U.S. Senator John Cornynin next year’s mid-term elections.

According toRamp’s AI Index, which estimates the business adoption rate of AI products by drawing on Ramp’s card and bill pay data, 32.4% of U.S. businesses were paying for subscriptions to OpenAI AI models, platforms, and tools as of April. That’s up from 18.9% in January and 28% in March. Competitors have struggled to make similar progress, Ramp’s data shows. Just 8% of businesses had subscriptions to Anthropic’s products as of last month compared to 4.6% in January. Google AI subscriptions saw a decline from 2.3% in February to 0.1% in April, meanwhile. “OpenAI continues to add customers faster than any other business on Ramp’s platform,” wrote Ramp Economist Ara Kharzian in ablog post published Tuesday. “Our […] Ramp AI Index shows business adoption of OpenAI growing faster than competitor model companies.” To be clear, Ramp’s AI Index isn’t a perfect measure. It only looks at a sample of corporate spend data from around 30,000 companies. Moreover, because the index identifies AI products and services using merchant name and line-item details, it likely misses spend lumped into other cost centers. Still, the figures suggest that OpenAI is strengthening its grip on the large and growingenterprise market for AI. In areportpublished in April, OpenAI said that it had over 2 million business users, an increase from 1 million usersas of September. The company expects enterprise revenue to contribute significantly to its bottom line.According to Bloomberg, OpenAI is projecting $12.7 billion in revenue this year and $29.4 billion in 2026. OpenAI, which doesn’t anticipate being cash-flow positive until 2029, it’s mulling plans to charge business customersthousands of dollarsfor specialized AI “agents” designed to aid with software engineering and research tasks.

Every pedal stroke helps melt away the stressors that piled up throughout the week, and I’ve collected a few gadgets that make these rides better. However, I’ve learned the hard way that bringing along too much gear takes away from the ride itself, forcing you to manage a network of pings and battery levels instead of just riding the damn bike. Enter Ray-Ban Meta: smart glasses that made my weekend rides simpler and a bit more fun. Instead of wearing sunglasses, a pair of headphones, and fumbling around with my phone to take photos throughout the ride, I now have one device that helps with everything. The Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses have been a surprise hit with more folks than just me — Meta saysit has sold millions of these devices, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently saidsales have tripled in the last year. SeveralReddit threadsandYouTube videossuggest that lots of folks are wearing Ray-Ban Meta glasses while biking. Meta has caught on as well — it’s reportedly building anext generation of AI smart glasses with Oakley, specifically built for athletes. I never expected to use my Ray-Ban Metas on the bike. But a few months ago, I decided to try them out. Now, I wear these glasses on bike rides more than anywhere else. Meta got just enough things right with these smart glasses to convince me there’ssomethinghere. It’s almost a joy to use, and with a few upgrades, it could get there. A key selling point of Ray-Ban Meta is that they’re just a solid pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses — mine are the Wayfarer style with transition lenses and a clear plastic body. I found these work well for bike rides, protecting my eyes from the sun, dirt, and pollen. They sit comfortably under a bike helmet — but maybe not perfectly. (More on that later.) The killer feature of Meta’s smart glasses is the camera that sits above your right and left eyes. The glasses allow me to grab photos and videos of things I see on my rides just by pressing a button on the top right corner of the frames, instead of fumbling with my phone — something that feels slightly cumbersome and dangerous on the bike. While riding through Golden Gate Park in San Francisco last weekend, I used the Ray-Ban Meta glasses to snap photos of the beautiful Blue Heron Lake, the shrub-covered dunes where the park meets the Pacific Ocean, and the tree-covered track that sits at the park’s entrance. Is the camera amazing? No. But it’s pretty good, and I end up capturing moments I simply never would have if I weren’t wearing the glasses. For that reason, I don’t see the camera as a replacement for my phone’s camera, but rather a way to capture more photos and videos altogether. Went biking through the pan handle with Ray Ban Meta last weekendpic.twitter.com/6WLKmSAHQi The feature I use the most: the open-ear speakers in the arms of the glasses, which allow me to listen to podcasts and music without blocking the noise of people, bikers, and cars around me. Meta was far from the first company to put speakers in glasses —Bose has had a solid pair for years. But Meta’s take on open-ear speakers is surprisingly good. I’ve been impressed by the audio quality and how little I miss traditional headphones on these rides. I’ve found myself chatting with Meta’s AI assistant a bit on my weekend rides. I recently asked it questions about the nature I was seeing throughout the park — such as “Hey, Meta, look and tell me what kind of tree this is?” — as well as the origins of the historic buildings I saw. I typically use bike rides as a way to unplug from the world, so it seemed counterintuitive to talk with an AI chatbot during the rides. However, I found these short queries stoked my curiosity about the world around me without sucking me into a rabbit hole of content and notifications, which is what usually happens when I use my phone. And, again, the greatest thing about these features is they all come in one device. That means fewer things to charge, less clutter in my biking gear box, and fewer devices to manage along my ride. While the Ray-Ban Meta glasses look great for walking around, they clearly weren’t designed with biking in mind. Oftentimes, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses fall down my nose during a bumpy ride. When I’m bent over on the bike and looking up to see what’s ahead of me, the thick frames block my view. (Most sunglasses for cyclists have thin frames and nose pads to solve these problems.) There are some limitations around how the Ray-Ban Meta glasses work with other apps, which is a problem. While I love taking photos and pausing music with the glasses, for anything else, my phone has to come out of my pocket. For example, Ray-Ban Meta has a Spotify integration, but I had a hard time getting the AI assistant to play specific playlists. Sometimes, the glasses played nothing when I asked for a playlist or played the wrong playlist altogether. I’d love to see these integrations improved — and expanded to include more biking-specific integrations with apps like Strava or Garmin. Ray-Ban Meta also doesn’t work super well with the rest of my iPhone, which is likely due to Apple’s restrictive policies. I’d love to be able to fire off texts or easily navigate through Apple Maps with my Ray-Ban Meta glasses, but features like that may not be available until Apple releases its own smart glasses. That leaves Meta’s AI assistant. The AI feature is often touted as the main selling point of these glasses, but I often found it lacking. Meta’s voice AI is not as impressive as other voice AI products from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Google. Its AI voices feel more robotic, and I find its answers are less reliable. I tested the recently launched Ray-Ban Meta’s live video AI sessions, which werefirst unveiled at last year’s Meta Connect conference. The feature streams live video and audio from Ray-Ban Meta into an AI model in the cloud, aiming to create a more seamless way to interact with your AI assistant and letting it “see” what you see. In reality, it was a hallucinated hot mess. I asked Ray-Ban Meta to identify some of the interesting cars I was biking past near my apartment. The glasses described a modern Ford Bronco as a vintage Volkswagen Beetle, even though the two look nothing alike. Later, the glasses confidently told me that a 1980s BMW was a Honda Civic. Closer, but still very different cars. During the live AI session, I asked the AI to help identify some plants and trees. The AI told me a eucalyptus tree was an oak tree. When I said, “No, I think that’s a eucalyptus tree,” the AI responded, “Oh yeah, you’re right.” Experiences like that make me question why I’m talking to AI at all. Google DeepMind and OpenAI are also working on multimodal AI sessions like the one that Meta offers with its smart glasses. But for now, the experiences seem far from finished. I really want to see an improved version of AI smart glasses that I can take on bike rides. The Ray-Ban Meta glasses are one of the most convincing AI devices I’ve seen yet, and I could see how wearing them on a ride would be a joy after a few key upgrades.

The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to CEO, to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that may or may not actually stick. Here’s a look at what’s happened since the beginning of the year. May 7: Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, includingAxiosandBloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework. April 30:Anthropicdoubled down on its supportfor restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’” April 22:Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus. April 15:Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an exportlicensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week. April 9:Nvidia’s CEOJensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lagoresort, according to reports. At the time,NPR reportedHuang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S. April 3:Intel and TSMCallegedly reached a tentative agreementto launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come. April 1:CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going tospin off non-core assetsso it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products including custom semiconductors for customers. March 12:Intel announced that industry veteran, and former board member,Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEOon March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said he Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership. February 28:Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead,the company slowed down constructionon the plant for the second time in February. Now, the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031. February 3:U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnickurging the Trump administration to further restrictAI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. January 27:Chinese AI startupDeepSeekcaused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released theopen version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry. January 13:With just a week left in office, former President Joe Bidenproposed sweeping new export restrictionson U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions. January 6: Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed inThe Wall Street Journalendorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S.’. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.

Now, in aNew York Times interview, Wolfe Herd opens up about what happened. “I had no intentions of coming back,” Wolfe Herd says. Her post-Bumble life initially brought existential questions about her identity, eventually giving way to daily meditation and board calls from the sidelines.

Wolfe Herd dismisses speculation of conflict between them. “I think the world wants people –  particularly when it’s a woman to a woman –  they want there to be some riff. There’s no riff,” she emphasizes. Wolfe Herd recognized her own burnout reflected in Jones’s exhaustion. “I felt like I was looking in a mirror.

The ruling concluded a legal battle spanning more than five years, which started in October 2019 whenWhatsApp accused NSO Groupof hacking more than 1,400 of its users by taking advantage of a vulnerability in the chat app’saudio-calling functionality. The verdict came after a week-long jury trial that featured several testimonies, including NSO Group’s CEO Yaron Shohat and WhatsApp employees who responded and investigated the incident. Even before the trial began, the case had unearthed several revelations, including that NSO Grouphad cut off 10 of its government customersfor abusing its Pegasus spyware,the locations of 1,223 of the victimsof the spyware campaign, and the names of three of the spyware maker’s customers: Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan. TechCrunch read the transcripts of the trial’s hearings and is highlighting the most interesting facts and revelations that came out. We will update this post as we learn more from the cache of more than 1,000 pages. Thezero-click attack, which means the spyware required no interaction from the target, “worked by placing a fake WhatsApp phone call to the target,” as WhatsApp’s lawyer Antonio Perez said during the trial. The lawyer explained that NSO Group had built what it called the “WhatsApp Installation Server,” a special machine designed to send malicious messages across WhatsApp’s infrastructure mimicking real messages. “Once received, those messages would trigger the user’s phone to reach out to a third server and download the Pegasus spyware. The only thing they needed to make this happen was the phone number,” said Perez. NSO Group’s research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli testified that “any zero-click solution whatsoever is a significant milestone for Pegasus.” Contact UsDo you have more information about NSO Group, or other spyware companies? From a non-work device and network, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, oremail. For years, NSO Group has claimed that its spyware cannot be used against American phone numbers, meaning any cell number that starts with the +1 country code. In 2022,The New York Times first reportedthat the company did “attack” a U.S. phone but it was part of a test for the FBI. NSO Group’s lawyer Joe Akrotirianakis confirmed this, saying the “single exception” to Pegasus not being able to target +1 numbers “was a specially configured version of Pegasus to be used in demonstration to potential U.S. government customers.” The FBIreportedly chosenot to deploy Pegasus following its test. NSO’s CEO Shohat explained that Pegasus’ user interface for its government customers does not provide an option to choose which hacking method or technique to use against the targets they are interested in, “because customers don’t care which vector they use, as long as they get the intelligence they need.” In other words, it’s the Pegasus system in the backend that picks out which hacking technology, known as anexploit, to use each time the spyware targets an individual. In a funny coincidence, NSO Group’sheadquartersin Herzliya, a suburb of Tel Aviv in Israel, is in the same buildingas Apple, whose iPhone customers are also frequently targeted by NSO’s Pegasus spyware. Shohat said NSO occupies the top five floors and Apple occupies the remainder of the 14-floor building. The fact that NSO Group’s headquarters are openly advertised is somewhat interesting on its own. Other companies that develop spyware or zero-days likethe Barcelona-based Variston, whichshuttered in February, was located in a co-working space while claiming on its official website to be located somewhere else. Following the spyware attack, WhatsApp filed its lawsuit against NSO Group in November 2019. Despite the active legal challenge, the spyware maker kept targeting the chat app’s users, according to NSO Group’s research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli. Gazneli said that “Erised,” the codename for one of the versions of the WhatsApp zero-click vector, was in use from late-2019 up to May 2020. The other versions were called “Eden” and “Heaven,” and the three were collectively known as “Hummingbird.” Topics Senior Reporter, Cybersecurity Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

    "title": "India and Pakistan accuse each other of 'violations' after ceasefire deal",
    "article_text": "India and Pakistan have accused each other of \"violations\" hours after the two nations said they had agreed to a ceasefire following days of cross-border military strikes. After sounds of explosions were heard in Indian-administered Kashmir, India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said there had been \"repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at\". A short while later, Pakistan's foreign ministry said it remained \"committed to faithful implementation of a ceasefire...notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas\". The fighting between India and Pakistan over the last four days has been the worst military confrontation between the two rivals in decades. The use of drones, missiles and artillery started when India struck targets in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in response to a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam last month. Pakistan had denied any involvement. After four days of cross-border strikes, India and Pakistan said they had agreed on a full and immediate ceasfire. US President Donald Trump announced the news on his Truth Social Platform on Saturday morning. He said it had been brokered by the US. Pakistan's Foreign Minister later confirmed the agreement had been reached by the two countries, adding that \"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy. But hours after the announcement, residents - and BBC reporters - in the main Indian-administered Kashmiri cities of Srinagar and Jammu reported hearing the sounds of explosions and seeing flashes in the sky. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said: \"For the last few hours, there have been repeated violations of the understanding we arrived at earlier this evening. \"This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today.\" Misri said India's armed forces was \"giving an appropriate response\" and he concluded his briefing by \"calling upon Pakistan to address these violations\". In response, a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: \"Pakistan remains committed to faithful implementation of ceasefire between Pakistan and India, announced earlier today. \"Notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas, our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint. \"We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. \"The troops on ground should also exercise restraint.\" Kashmir is claimed in full by India and Pakistan, but administered only in part by each since they were partitioned following independence from Britain in 1947. It has been a flashpoint between the two nuclear-armed nations and they have fought two wars over it. Confirming the ceasefire, India's external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the two nations had \"worked out an understanding on stoppage of firing and military action\". \"India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It will continue to do so,\" he added. Later, in an address to the nation, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the ceasefire had been reached \"for the benefit of everybody\". Speaking after the ceasefire announcement, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said India and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site. He said he and US Vice-President JD Vance had spent 48 hours with senior Indian and Pakistani officials, including their respective Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he welcomed \"all efforts to de-escalate the conflict\". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Britain has been \"engaged\" in talks for \"some days\", with Foreign Secretary David Lammy speaking to both sides. \"I'm pleased to see today that there's a ceasefire,\" Sir Keir said. \"The task now is to make sure that that is enduring and is lasting.\" The recent fighting came after two weeks of tension following the killing of 26 tourists in the resort town of Pahalgam. Survivors of the 22 April attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 25 Indians and one Nepali national, said the militants were singling out Hindu men. The Indian defence ministry said its strikes this week were part of a \"commitment\" to hold \"accountable\" those responsible for the attack. Pakistan described them as \"unprovoked\". Pakistan said Indian air strikes and cross-border fire since Wednesday had killed 36 people in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while India's army reported at least 21 civilians deaths from Pakistani shelling. Fighting intensified overnight on Friday, with both countries accusing each other of targeting airbases and other military sites. One of India's modern-day greats steps away from Test cricket, leaving a significant void. Any potential resumption of the Indian Premier League would depend on the \"mood of the nation\", according to former India wicketkeeper Deep Dasgupta. Experts say the tit-for-tat attacks mark a dangerous new phase in the decades-old rivalry. What next? India has accused Pakistan of attacking three military bases, a claim which has been denied by Islamabad. The jewels are described as one of the most astonishing archaeological finds of the modern era.",

    "title": "Labour to unveil big immigration plans next week - but will they win back votes?",
    "article_text": "\"A failed free market experiment\" – that's how the home secretary will describe the approach that's seen vast numbers of people from around the world come to the UK to pour pints in pubs, to cut hair, to care for the most vulnerable, to pick fruit, or to fix our plumbing. Yvette Cooper is getting ready to unveil the government's overhaul of the rules that determine who can come to the UK with permission, and for how long. Her White Paper, which will be called \"Restoring Control Over the Immigration System\" and be 69 pages long, is a big moment for Labour to try to sort a messy system, under which the numbers of people moving here rose way over most people's imagination. With Reform hard on Labour's heels, capitalising on public concern about immigration, the success or failure of Cooper is vital to the government. It will emerge in full on Monday, but we know a lot about what's on the table. It's expected that work visas will be strictly time-limited for jobs that don't need graduate-level skills. Foreign students who have studied for degrees here could lose the right to stay in the UK after they finish at university. Overseas workers will be expected to have a better understanding of English, but reported suggestions of A-level equivalent are wide off the mark. And companies who repeatedly can't show efforts to recruit UK-based staff, rather than hunt abroad, might lose their right to sponsor foreign workers to come here at all. There are also likely to be proposals designed to change how judges apply what's known as Article 8 of the Human Rights Act. It's designed to protect everyone's right to a family life. But how it's used sometimes by immigration lawyers to stop deportations has long been a concern of politicians – in 2011, I even remember Theresa May claiming an asylum seeker had beenallowed to stay in the UK because of their cat. More than a decade later,recent cases like this one raised at Prime Minister's Questionshave led the government to review how the courts have been interpreting everyone's right to a family life. We'll hear more of the details from the home secretary in the studio tomorrow, and likely from the prime minister on Monday. Some Conservatives and Reform argue the only way of making a material difference is to leave the European Convention on Human Rights altogether, rather than see ministers stick their nose into the courts. Whether the government's proposals here make a difference, we'll have to see. But the big principle in Cooper's thinking is that the immigration system should be fundamentally linked to the labour market – helping British workers get the skills to fill vacancies, rather than overseas workers being brought in again and again, to plug the gaps. The Whitehall wiring will be redirected to try to make that happen with a new approach under a 'quad' – where employers, the Department for Work and Pensions, the job centres, skills bodies, and the Migration Advisory Committee, that sets the specific rules, all work together. The idea, to wean the economy off relying on staff from overseas, by pushing employers to work much harder to find staff from here at home. That's the theory. Here are the politics: for years, conventional thinking in both main parties was the immigration was broadly good because it helped the economy. Politicians and members of the public who raised concern about the pace and scale of workers coming were sometimes dismissed. One Cabinet minister says last time Labour was in power, when \"people raised concerns, it was too easy to say it's a race question – there's a good understanding now that good, decent people worry about immigration – it's about fairness\". When it emerged that 900,000 people came to the UK in 2023 the prime minister held an emergency press conference accusing the Tories of a failed \"open border experiment\"'. A senior government source says now the previous government wasn't \"bringing in 100,000 scientists to live in central London, it was bringing in people to fix problems of the economy everywhere, often in poor communities\". Ministers accept there might always be a need for overseas staff with specific expertise to come to the UK. But Sir Keir Starmer's allies say he's been making the case for years, since a speech to the CBI in 2022, warning employers they wouldn't be able to rely on cheap foreign labour on his watch. Since then, partly down to the Conservatives' tightening up of visa rules before they left office, the numbers of people coming to the UK legally has dropped a lot and is expected to fall further this year. But the political prominence of the issue overall has gone the other way. By some polling measures in spring this year, immigration and small boats passed the NHS as the biggest worry for voters in 2025. Sources inside government acknowledge that for many of the public, the issues of legal and illegal migration are bundled together. While legal migration has been falling, the numbers of those coming in ways considered illegal and trying to claim asylum has gone the other way,hitting the highest level since 1979. And there are two highly visible signs of that – small boat crossings, and asylum seekers being housed in hotels around the country. One member of the government told me: \"It's the boats, and everything is amplified on social media, we know it's having an effect as it's fed back to us on the doorstep – as a party we just seem to be floundering.\" The use of hotels isn't just costly – projected recently to be £15bn, triple the amount the Conservatives reckoned when they signed the contracts back in 2019 – they can also create unease and resentment in communities. A Labour MP with an asylum hotel in their constituency tells me a big part of the problem is that constituents link spending on hotels with the government squeezing cash elsewhere. \"It is impossible to make the case we need to do some form of austerity while we are spending so much money on putting people up here – whether it's winter fuel and PIP (welfare payments) – you haven't got money for this, but you have money for that.\" There's even a belief in Downing Street that had there not been an asylum hotel in Runcorn, Labour would likely have held on to its seat in the by-election last week. The other blindingly obvious reason immigration has become so fraught politically is that for decades, successive governments have told the public one thing but done another. Under Tony Blair, people from countries joining the EU were allowed immediately to come and work in the UK. The government had publicly estimated the numbers likely to move would be around 13,000, but hundreds of thousands of people from Eastern Europe made the UK their home in the following years.Papers released at the end of last year revealthat some of Blair's team worried precisely about that happening. David Cameron then promised repeatedly that he'd get the number of extra people settling in the UK under 100,000. That vow was repeatedly broken. His government's lack of ability to control migration from Europe was at the core of the Brexit argument. With deep irony, Boris Johnson won that argument in the referendum, then set up an immigration system that allowed even more people to move to the UK, peaking at 900,000 in 2023. Rishi Sunak then promised to \"Stop the Boats\" - but they still came. A No 10 insider says the \"public has been gaslit for years – taxpayers have been told it's happening, but nothing has been changing\". It's Cooper and Sir Keir who are now under huge pressure to get the numbers down and keep their vow to \"smash the gangs\". The plans for managing legal migration better on Monday will be followed by a meeting in Albania later in the week, where the focus will be on cracking the illegal trade that smuggles people across Europe. Ministers hope their plans will make a difference, although screeds of extra immigration law have not exactly improved the situation in recent years. Making a complex system that doesn't work even more complicated will not necessarily be a success. But in government there's no doubt how vital it is – not just to fix a system that's been failing, but to demonstrate to voters that something is being done. The plans we'll talk about in the next couple of days have been long in the making. But Reform's massive success at the ballot box shows why Labour has to get this right. As one member of the government reckons, the public \"got rid of the Tories by voting for us, there was no love for Labour, and they are prepared to do the same to us\".

Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, no stranger to a relegation, was quiet for most of the game as Pep Guardiola's side failed to move out of first gear to worry him. But as the clock ticked towards added time he was called into action, tipping away a header from Ruben Dias and then beaten by Omar Marmoush's dipping strike which bounced off the crossbar. Saints marked the draw with a message to Derby on social media, saying \"Sorry if we got your hopes up\". And Ramsdale added: \"Not one person outside our dressing room thought we could do anything today and rightly so. People thought we would get zero points for the rest of the season, it was down to us. \"Everyone knows it's been a difficult season for us. The sun was shining, Man City threw everything at us. That one was for the fans. \"We're not happy at all with how the season has gone but we are definitely happy with the fact we have managed to avoid that record. \"We are under no illusion it's still not a great points tally, but it's that one off our back.\" Not that City defender Dias was impressed. \"It's frustrating,\" he said. \"In a moment like this, every point matters - and it is frustrating to play against a team like this. \"Just wasting time the whole game. They don't even try anything, they just sit and they don't even want to win the game. They just want to be there. It is no good for the show and no good for themselves. It is no good for anyone, but it is what it is.\" Saints playfully sent a message to Derby County on social media after the game BBC's Match of the Day showed Manchester City's attacking heat map against Southampton You can rely on the Premier League to bring you back to earth with a bump. And speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 phone-in after the game, Premier League winner Chris Sutton was not impressed with the Saints' celebrations. He said: \"I don't mind the fans celebrating because they haven't had much to celebrate, but the players on the full-time whistle? That is embarrassing, celebrating being the second-worst Premier League team of all time with 12 measly points. How low is your bar? \"Is it something to celebrate being the second-worst team? Watching players punch the air and celebrate, that is embarrassing. It is absolute amateur hour. \"It has been a disastrous season. If I am a Southampton fan I am excited, but if I am seeing my players celebrating I would be thinking 'heaven help us for next season'. What a bunch of losers.\" Co-presenter on the 606 show, Robbie Savage, who captained Derby in that record low 2007-08 season, also called the players' reactions \"pathetic\". This video can not be played How Man City's poor service frustrated Haaland Interim manager Simon Rusk - Saints' third boss of a sorry campaign - lost his last game as a full-time manager2-1 at home to Barnet. It's a long way from the National League to shutting out Erling Haaland and Co, and Rusk believes the point against Guardiola could stand the Saints in good stead back in the Championship. They won at Wembley in the play-off final last season and will be among the favourites to return in another year - despite their frugal top-flight points tally. Rusk said: \"I understood the importance of that record, but we were focusing on performances, improvement and environment. \"We were fighting for an immense amount of pride. \"We wanted to make it clear that we were aspiring to finish the season as strong as possible. We delivered that. \"With seven games to go I was confident we could take care of this points issue and that's what happened. \"On day one of this job I spoke about moments in football. We are not getting carried away, we know it's been a difficult year but hopefully the supporters go home really happy.\" Next up is another chance to put their names in the history books, with Saints the final ever visitors to Goodison Parkon 18 May.

    "title": "'WeightWatchers set me up to fail' - Why diet industry is losing to jabs like Ozempic",
    "article_text": "Symone has been using weight loss injections for nearly a year. She says they have done what the diet industry could never do for her - free her from a life controlled by food. From a very young age, the 34-year-old could not switch off the constant noise in her head. When would her next meal come? What would it be? Would there be enough for her? \"The food noise was just so loud, it could be unbearable,\" she says. \"I have tried every single diet going - I've done Atkins, eating clean, SlimFast, Slimming World, meal-replacement shakes - you name it - I've done it and none have them worked for me.\" Several years ago, weighing 16st (102kg), she was one of the many millions who signed up to WeightWatchers, downloading the app and meticulously following its points plan, scanning in everything she ate and staying within her daily points budget. WeightWatchers attributes points to food and drink, stating that it uses a \"groundbreaking algorithm\" to assess their nutritional makeup and then uses a point system to inform its members which food is better to eat. But after a few weeks, Symone says she started to feel like she was being set up to fail. \"How could I lose weight long term if I had to follow this mad points system? Food is not measured in points - it's measured in calories, fat, macro nutrients. \"I felt trapped, and the more research I did, the more I educated myself, the more I thought this is not for me.\" The only thing that has ever worked in her quest to lose weight, she says, isweight loss injection Mounjaro, which she started using nearly a year ago. \"I was at my heaviest, just over 21 stone, and the doctor told me I was pre-diabetic. I knew something had to change - I've got two children who depend on me too.\" She was advised to start on the weight loss medication but with a two-year wait, she decided to buy it privately online and within just a few days, she was crying with relief. \"I couldn't believe that I had control over food. For the first time, I wasn't panicking about when I would next eat.\" Weight loss jabs work by mimicking a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which suppresses people's appetites and makes them feel full. Symone has now lost 4st 7lb (26kg) and is losing weight gradually, documenting her experiences on social media. \"I don't want a quick fix,\" she says, \"I'm using weight loss injections to give me the control I never had.\" For many, weight loss jabs can produce rapid results, but some experts are concerned about the meteoric rise in their popularity and how people will be affected by them long term - both physically and mentally. At its peak, WeightWatchers was seen as being synonymous with safe and controlled weight loss. With 4.5million subscribers globally, its workshops were held in most towns, on most high streets, popping up in local church halls - they were everywhere. Now, after dominating the diet industry for more than half a century, it has lost more than a million members andfiled for bankruptcy, struggling to compete in a market transformed by social media influencers and weight loss injections. The company has stressed that it is not going out of business and that filing for bankruptcy will help it resolve its debt of $1.25bn (£860m). In a statement, the brand says its weight loss programme (which also includes its own brand of weight loss jabs) and weight loss workshops will continue. The company says it has been the brand with the most scientific backing in the diet industry for over 60 years, and that there have been more than 180 published studies showing the effectiveness of its approach. WeightWatchers says it uses an \"holistic model of care\" to support \"the whole person\" with \"access to obesity-trained clinicians and registered dietitians\". It is also one of several companies GPs can use for weight loss referrals, with the NHS paying for patients to attend weekly meetings in the community. \"It's no longer about calorie control and diets,\" Deanne Jade, clinical director of the National Centre for Eating Disorders, told the BBC. \"There's a new movement out there and it's all about wellbeing. \"People like to move in tribes – it used to be the WeightWatchers tribe, counting points and calories, now millions follow different ways to lose weight or be healthy through social media influencers, through weight loss drugs, and they're forming new tribes.\" She is not convinced that medication will be the answer that so many are looking for. \"None of these pharmaceutical interventions protect people from regaining the weight when they stop injecting.\" She believes they are not a quick fix, and that the best way to effectively lose weight and keep it off is to understand the psychological reasons behind overeating. Dr Joanne Silver, lead psychologist at the London-based eating disorder clinic, Orri, agrees. She says the weight loss injections \"completely silence what the body is asking for\", which is counterintuitive to understanding what the body needs. \"People can binge eat because of psychological reasons – they can use food to manage their emotions, to soothe themselves. \"Eating disorders are not just about food.\" Food and nutrition have become just one part of a more holistic approach so many are now adopting when it comes to their overall wellbeing. Jennifer Pybis, a fitness coach based in Liverpool, works with clients both online and in person. She says achieving a healthy lifestyle is not just about hitting a target weight. \"I encourage the women I work with to consider lots of ways to measure their progress rather than just jumping on the scales. \"Thinking about how they feel, comparing photographs of themselves to see how their bodies have changed shape, how their sleep is, their resting heart rate, their improvements in the gym - all of that is so important.\" The diet industry might be transforming but there are many who still prefer the more traditional model of sitting together and sharing their experiences, supporting others in their community to lose weight. In a small church hall in Winsford, Cheshire, a group of women are waiting patiently to get on the scales. Muttering and good-natured laughter can be heard as they share their latest weights with each other. \"I've put on a pound! I did have a little bit - well maybe alot -of wine at the weekend.\" \"Why didn't you have gin?\" another one asks, \"it's only 55 calories a shot!\" They're here for their weekly check-in at the BeeWeighed slimming group. Some of the women have lost several pounds, others have a put on a pound or two, but overall, since joining the class, they have all lost weight. They are learning about how to eat in moderation, how to exercise safely and how to feel good about themselves. At first glance, it could be a WeightWatchers class – women meeting up to share their stories of weight loss and support each other – but there are crucial differences, says BeeWeighed owner and founder Lynda Leadbetter. She was a group leader for WeightWatchers for 18 years but left to set up her own group in 2018. \"I think WeightWatchers did provide something different and something hopeful for so many women but I think it has lost its way,\" she says. \"I teach nutrition, I educate, I don't sell anything extra. I feel WeightWatchers became about selling extra products, it was always about pushing those extra sales, and not about supporting people to lose weight properly.\" She's sceptical about the effectiveness of weight loss medications, and some members who have turned to thelikes of Ozempic and WeGovyhave left her groups, but many have stayed – continuing to attend the meetings for support while using weight loss injections. Kathryn Brady, 38, has been a member of BeeWeighed since 2023, and in that time, she's lost over three stone. But with her wedding in a matter of weeks, the burlesque dancer has started to take Mounjaro to lose weight more rapidly. It's not quite worked out as she had hoped. \"I've been on Mounjaro for over a month now, and while I lost 6lb in the first week or so, I've put half of that back on. \"Having absolutely no appetite for two weeks was really weird and I'm paying a lot of money to not lose that much weight.\" She's going to keep on using it, but she's not completely sold yet. \"Even if I continue with the skinny jab, I'll still attend BeeWeighed, having others there supporting me keeps me going.\" More than 100 schools that support pupils with special educational needs will use the kits. Tina Hobin is urging people of all ages to keep active as she looks back on her career. They are calling on the government to take immediate action to protect babies and children from sugar-laden food. The healthy food company's products have disappeared from the shelves of some of NI's biggest supermarkets. The scheme in Hemsworth could have \"negative impacts\" on the \"health-deprived\" town, council says.",

    "title": "Plaque unveiled as reminder of decades of forced adoptions",
    "article_text": "Victims of forced adoption have gathered in Cornwall for a public event condemning the treatment of unmarried mothers in post-war Britain. They unveiled a plaque at Rosemundy House in St Agnes -  formerly a home for unmarried mothers - while calling for a formal \"adoption apology\" from the  government. Dr Phil Frampton, who was born at the Rosemundy Mother and Baby Home in 1953, said: \"We want an apology, not only for the mothers but also for their children who suffered.\" Lyn Rodden, from Camborne, who was one of those forced to give up her baby, said: \"It means everything that we've been recognised at last.\" It is estimated up to 250,000 women in Britainwere forced to give up their babiesin the decades after World War Two. Campaigners also want \"restorative actions\" from the government, such as providing counselling and search support for mothers and those forcibly adopted. Dr Frampton, a member of the Rosemundy Commemoration Committee, said he spent years in foster care after he was separated from his mother as a baby. He said: \"It's really pleasing to be here today, it's the start of a new chapter in the struggle for an apology for all those unmarried mothers who suffered in the post-war period.\" Mr Frampton said the day was \"part of a day of healing, part of a day of recognising the grief of those mothers...\" He added: \"This is not something that's just in the past, for a lot of women they lived with this, you hear women today 80, 88 years old, who are still having to live with what happened, and the children live with it, and families live with it.\" Mr Frampton said it was \"important\" to be able to give the mothers, children, and families affected by forced adoptions \"a sense of relief and release\". Another plaque is due to be unveiled by the campaigners in Kendal, Cumbria, on 23 May. In  September 1956, 19-year-old Lyn Rodden from Camborne, Cornwall,  gave birth to her son at the Rosemundy home. She said she was forced to get on a train and take her son to Bath to be adopted. Ms Rodden said: \"For everybody else the parents came here and took them away from here, but I had to get on a train and take my son up to Bath, and leave him in an office. \"A woman just came out and said 'name' and 'I'll take the baby' and she took him into the back office, came out and said 'hurry up' she said, 'catch your train' she said, 'and back to St Agnes, you'll be there for another six weeks'. \"That was it. I cried all the way home...\" Ms Rodden said she was eventually reunited with her son 50 years later when he found her. \"[It was] like the final piece of a jigsaw being fitted,\" she said. She added: \"To think that  although slavery was abolished in the 1800s, a Dickensian way of life was gone, but not at Rosemundy. \"It was still in the past, and that was it really, and it means everything that we've been recognised at last...\" A Government spokesperson said: \"This abhorrent practice should never have taken place, and our deepest sympathies are with all those affected. \"We take this issue extremely seriously and continue to engage with those impacted to provide support.\" Follow BBC Cornwall onX,FacebookandInstagram.

    "title": "We're in unified position, says Starmer after talks between Ukraine allies",
    "article_text": "Sir Keir Starmer has said that the outcome of talks between Ukraine's allies in Kyiv marks a \"significant moment\" in the push to secure a ceasefire in its conflict with Russia - but admitted it was not \"the end of the process\". Speaking to the BBC in Kyiv following a virtual meeting of the \"coalition of the willing\", the UK prime minister said \"we haven't seen unity like this pretty well throughout the conflict\". Around 30 global leaders reasserted their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire from Monday, threatening \"massive\" sanctions if it does not comply. Noting other conflicts including India-Pakistan hostilities, Sir Keir said \"we are living in a more uncertain world\" that \"requires leadership stepping up\". The UK prime minister joined French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk for the meeting, which was hosted by Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Zelensky. Other members of the \"coalition of the willing\" participated remotely, including Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Canadian PM Mark Carney, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and Mark Rutte, the secretary-general of Nato. In a phone call with Donald Trump following the meeting, the US president reportedly reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire, after Vladimir Putin rejected his initial proposal in March. Sir Keir said Trump was \"absolutely clear that this is a demand that must be met\". The leaders assembled in Kyiv warned that \"new and massive\" sanctions will be imposed on Russia's energy and banking sectors if Putin does not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire \"in the air, at sea and on land\". Sir Keir told the BBC that \"material progress\" had been made during the meeting. \"We've been able to collectively get to a much better position and a more unified position today that holds out a better prospect of a ceasefire,\" he said. \"You've got unity in the demand, but also unity in what the response will be if the demand is not met. We haven't seen that sort of unity during this conflict.\" \"I'm not going to pretend this is the end of the process but this is a significant moment we now need to push on and make sure this happens,\" he added. Further coordinating sanctions on Russian oil, fossil fuels and other assets would make a \"material difference\", the prime minister said. The Kremlin reacted to the proposal by accusing European leaders of making \"contradictory\" and \"generally confrontational\" remarks about Russia. Press secretary Dmitry Peskov said that Ukraine's allies must stop sending weapons to Ukraine before any ceasefire can happen - something European leaders have rejected - before later saying Russia would consider the proposal. \"We have to think about this. This is a new development,\" state-run Russian news agency Tass reported Peskov as saying. The Kyiv meeting was a symbolic show of support for Ukraine a day after more than20 world leaders joined Putin in Moscowfor Russia's World War Two Victory Day parade. The massive military parade was held in Moscow's Red Square to commemorate the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945 with leaders including China's Xi Jinping, Brazil's  President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, an EU member, in attendance. \"It was a hugely important, symbolic day here in Kyiv because there was a propaganda exercise in Moscow yesterday,\" Sir Keir told the BBC. \"80 years on from VE Day it was really important that we were here today... to demonstrate that the values that underpinned what was being fought for 80 years ago are the same values now\". Asked whether he feels \"scared about the state of the world\" as others in Britain do - given conflicts in the Middle East and India-Pakistan tensions - Sir Keir said \"we are living in a more uncertain world and we're in a different era of defence and security\". But he said it did not keep him up at night \"because it's really important that I focus on what I can do - bringing people together, making significant steps today, making sure we're preparing with Ukraine for what might happen next\". The so-called\"coalition of the willing\" was established by the UK and Franceto reinforce any eventual peace deal with security guarantees, including the presence of peacekeeping troops in Ukraine. BC Monitoring's Russia Editor Vitaly Shevchenko reflects on the Victory Day spectacle in Moscow. Ukraine's security service says the state-backed spy network sought to obtain information about military defences on its border with Hungary.

    "title": "Taylor Swift criticises court summons in Lively-Baldoni row",
    "article_text": "Taylor Swift's representatives have told the BBC she is being brought into a legal row between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively to create \"tabloid clickbait\". The 35-year-old singer was summoned to a US court after it was alleged she encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for It Ends With Us, a film that both starred in and is the centre of a sexual harassment case. Baldoni says he was invited to Lively's New York home in 2023 to discuss script changes, where Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and Swift were there to serve as her \"dragons\". Representatives for Swift said \"she was not involved in any casting or creative decision\" and \"never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\". Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy. Lively and Baldoni have been locked in a dispute since the film, which is an adaption of a Colleen Hoover novel, was released last summer. According to Baldoni, there were tensions over the 2023 re-write of the scene, at which he was surprised to find Reynolds and Swift present. He alleges Lively wrote in a text to him: \"If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you'll appreciate that I'm Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for.\" Baldoni says he responded supportively, writing: \"I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor). \"You really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.\" It is also alleged that Swift was involved in the casting of Isabela Ferrer in the film, who played a younger version of Lively's character, Lily Bloom. Speaking at the New York premiere of It Ends With Us, Ferrer said: \"She [Taylor Swift] was a helpful part of the audition, which I found out later when I got it, and that rocked my world.\" But Swift's representatives said the only involvement she had in the film was permitting the use of her song, My Tears Ricochet, noting that she was among 20 artists featured in the film. Swift \"never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, [and] she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\", they said. They added that Swift did not see It Ends With Us until \"weeks after its release\" as she was \"travelling around the globe\" on tour at the time. The popstar's spokespeople argued that the subpoena \"designed to use Taylor Swift's name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case\". Hollywood blockbusters such and World War Z and Spider-Man, were made closer to home than you think. The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\". He also directed Madonna in three music videos as well as the 1987 film Who's That Girl? Crash and Casino Royale writer Paul Haggis was arrested after being accused of rape by a British woman. The Hollywood actor says his offer to help players when they need anything was taken literally.",

    "title": "Cardinal reveals what it was like to be part of highly secretive conclave",
    "article_text": "Being sealed off from the world in the conclave to choose the new Pope was \"immensely peaceful\", England and Wales's most senior Roman Catholic has told the BBC. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales, was one of 133 cardinals who were shut into the Vatican's Sistine Chapel and later elected Pope Leo XIV on Thursday. He told BBC Breakfast on Saturday that nobody in the highly secretive meeting was saying who to vote for or who to not vote for, adding that there was \"no rancour\" or \"politicking\" among the cardinals. \"It was a much calmer process than that and I found it actually a rather wonderful experience,\" he added. Conclaves have taken place in the Sistine Chapel since the 15th Century and cardinals must have no communication with the outside world until a new Pope is elected. The recent conclave came afterthe death of Pope Francis on 21 April. Cardinal Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, said that his mobile phone was taken off him, adding that he found he had \"more time on my hands just to be prayerful, just to reflect, just to be still, rather than being constantly agitated... or prompted by what might be coming in\" on his phone. \"For me, one of the experiences of these last few days was to learn a bit of patience, to just take this step by step,\" he said. \"There was a calmness, a bit of solemnity,\" he continued, adding that everyone he spoke to when in it was \"peaceful and just wanting to do this well\". At 79 years old, Cardinal Nichols was one of the oldest cardinals in the conclave as they must be under 80 to be eligible to vote. There is no timescale on how long it takes for a conclave to elect a new Pope, with previous ones in 2005 and 2013 lasting two days. The conclave that elected Pope Leo lasted for one day. \"I think it was a short conclave in part because Pope Francis left us with a good inheritance,\" the cardinal said. \"He left a college of cardinals who were dedicated, who had this desire for the church to be more missionary, and that led us forward actually very, very easily to the decision that we made.\" Pope Leo will be formally inaugurated at a mass in St Peter's Square on 18 May, which delegations from countries around the world will attend. The Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Edward, will attend on behalf of King Charles, Buckingham Palace confirmed on Saturday. Speaking about the new Pope, Cardinal Nichols said Pope Leo is \"very decisive\" in a \"quiet way\", adding that he has seen him \"make decisions which disappoint people but don't destroy them\". \"A good thing about a pope is if he's able to say, 'No', to you when he thinks something is not right and then give you a hug so you don't go away offended, and I think he's got that ability to do both those things, which is very important.\" Born in the Windy City in 1955 to parents of Spanish and Franco-Italian descent, Prevost served as an altar boy and was ordained in 1982. Catholics across Northern Ireland react to the news of a new Pope. The Roman Catholic Bishop of Salford welcomes the election of the first Pope from the United States. Chicago-born Robert Prevost, 69, is the first North American to be elected pontiff. A priest who knows Pope Leo XIV recalls how the pontiff referred to Britain's Got Talent.",

    "title": "Kwik Fit founder Sir Tom Farmer dies aged 84",
    "article_text": "The founder of the Kwik Fit garage chain, Sir Tom Farmer, has died at the age of 84. The Edinburgh-born businessman died peacefully at his home in the city on Friday, his family said. He built the company into the world's biggest independent tyre and automotive chain, selling it to Ford for £1bn in 1999. Sir Tom owned a majority stake in Hibernian FC for 28 years,selling his interest in the club in 2019. Sir Tom was born in Leith in 1940 and first opened a tyre business in 1964. He started Kwik Fit in 1971, eventually operating in more than 2,000 locations in 18 countries. He was knighted in 1997 for his services to the automotive industry and was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 2009 for his charitable work. A statement from his family said: \"Sir Tom's long and extensive career touched many aspects of Scottish and UK life. \"His business career is well documented, as was his commitment to philanthropy, his many public roles and his unwavering support and appreciation for the communities and people that he lived his life within.\" Sir Tom's philanthropic work saw him awarded the Carnegie Medal and he became a Knight Commander with Star of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, an honour bestowed by the Pope, in 1997. \"Sir Tom's Roman Catholic faith was present throughout all areas of his life. He attended mass weekly in Edinburgh and enjoyed the friendship and company of many people with the Catholic community both here in Scotland and further afield,\" his family said. \"Sir Tom will be remembered by many for his deep commitment to his family, his work and his faith and for being at all times a proud Scotsman,\" they added. A statement from Hibernian on the social media platform X said: \"Hibernian FC are devastated to hear of the passing of former owner Sir Tom Farmer, aged 84. \"Thank you for everything, Tom. Rest in peace.\" First Minister John Swinney wrote: \"Very sorry to hear of the death of Sir Tom Farmer, an outstanding entrepreneur and such a generous individual to so many causes in Scotland. \"My condolences to his family.\" Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said he was a \"proud Scot\" and a \"huge contributor\" to Edinburgh's community football. Sir Tom was described as a \"family man\" in the announcement. He married Anne in 1966 after they met at their local church and they were together for 57 years until her death in 2023. Their family said Sir Tom often credited Anne for his business success: \"In later years when asked about the secret to his success, he would often say it was because he 'married a girl like Anne,'\" they said. \"They lived their whole married life in Edinburgh and are survived by their two children and four grandchildren.\" Sir Tom Farmer became better known in later life for his role at Hibs, his philanthropy and his support for younger entrepreneurs. But his business skills had a real impact. Having made a small fortune in the 1960s, he moved to the USA, and it was there that he absorbed sales techniques he would adapt for the Kwik Fit chain he went on to found. He had an innovative, disruptive response to the oily independent repair garages his company replaced, with a new approach to branding and marketing. What really made Kwik Fit stand out was customer service and staff training. As a man of faith, Tom Farmer conveyed humility with a recognition that every individual mattered. Each employee had a role in customer service. The aim was not just to satisfy customers but to leave them \"delighted\". Relationship sales, in a service which had the customer at a disadvantage in knowing what's required to mend a car, relied on building trust in the brand. The advertising underlined that. You weren't just buying new tyres; you were buying a service from skilled staff, and the advertising portrayed them as delighted to serve. That much became standard in customer care. It was Sir Tom Farmer who brought that to Scotland, and built it out across other countries. Arguably, online commerce has sacrificed much of that human connection. Edinburgh boost their hopes of a top-eight finish in the United Rugby Championship with a vital bonus-point victory over Connacht. The Scottish Institute of Theatre, Dance, Film and Television shut its doors on Wednesday after a winding up petition. Darcy Graham is a \"fighter\" who will bounce back from missing out on selection for the British and Irish Lions, according to Edinburgh head coach Sean Everitt. It was estimated the project would cost £22m but it is now thought the bill for the overhaul will be at least £85m. Officers are probing whether the deliberate blaze is connected to an ongoing feud between rival groups in Edinburgh.",

    "title": "Champions League race hots up as Man City slip & Villa win",
    "article_text": "Pep Guardiola has never managed in the Europa League before Manchester Cityboss Pep Guardiola says his side will have to \"fight until the end\" in the race to secure a Champions League spot after slipping up on Saturday. City could have taken a huge step towards sealing a top-five spot, but drew 0-0 at rock bottom Southampton. They are now only two points aboveNewcastleandChelsea- who meet on Sunday - plusAston Villa,who beat Bournemouth on Saturday evening. Seventh-placedNottingham Forest,who play relegated Leicester on Sunday, are four points behind City. After the Saints draw, Guardiola said his side had three cup finals left - including next weekend's actual FA Cup final against Crystal Palace. \"I didn't expect differently from a month ago, that it's a fight until the end,\" he said. City could find themselves outside the Champions League places before they play in the league again (against Bournemouth on Tuesday, 20 May) - because most of their rivals will have played once or twice before then. Only championsLiverpoolhave sealed a Champions League place so far but second-placedArsenal,who visit Anfield on Sunday, will hope to soon join them. Saturday's results meant Aston Villa guaranteed European football next season and manager Unai Emery said: \"[The Champions League] is the best competition in the world. [To qualify] through the Premier League, it's very difficult with lots of teams competing very well and they have more points than us. \"We are going to fight for it. First objective clearly is to qualify for Europe again and we've achieved that today.\" As things stand Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Newcastle and Chelsea would play in next season's Champions League There will be nine Premier league teams competing in Europe next season - up from the usual seven - but things could change in the final weeks of the campaign. Crystal Palace,who are 12th,would qualify for the Europa League if they win the FA Cup final. Brentford,Brighton, Bournemouth,and to a lesser extentFulham,are all vying for eighth spot which might be enough. The Bees are in eighth, above Albion on goal difference, two points ahead of the Cherries and four clear of the Cottagers. Brentford boss Thomas Frank, after a 1-0 win at Ipswich, told BBC Sport: \"We have got the momentum which is important. \"We are close to finishing eighth which would be the best position ever in the league. We are laser focused on what we can do. We have given very little away but still created a lot. \"We just need to push and enjoy it, the next two games, and then reset our target.\" Manchester UnitedandTottenhammeet in the Europa League final with the winners taking a sixth Champions League spot for English teams next season. Statisticians Opta give Arsenal a 99.7% chance of qualifying for the Champions League. They give a 91.2% chance for City, 69.4% for Newcastle and 67.9% for Chelsea. For Forest it's 37.8% and for Villa it's 34.2%. BBC Match of the Day's graphic showing the Champions League contenders' remaining fixtures Liverpool:Arsenal (H); Brighton (A); Crystal Palace (H) Arsenal:Liverpool (A); Newcastle (H); Southampton (A) Manchester City:Bournemouth (H); Fulham (A) Newcastle:Chelsea (H); Arsenal (A); Everton (H) Chelsea:Newcastle (A); Manchester United (H); Nottingham Forest (A) Aston Villa:Tottenham (H); Manchester United (A) Nottingham Forest:Leicester (H); West Ham (A); Chelsea (H) Brentford:Fulham (H); Wolves (A) Brighton:Liverpool (H); Tottenham (A) Bournemouth:Manchester City (A); Leicester (H) Fulham:Brentford (A); Manchester City (H) There will be nine English teams in European competitions next season - with six in the Champions League. England got an extra spot because of their teams' performances in Europe this season - and another one because of the make-up of the Europa League final. Manchester United and Tottenham meet in the final on Wednesday, 28 May in Bilbao - with the winner guaranteed a Champions League spot. But since neither side can qualify for Europe through their league position, that will be a bonus spot. A maximum of three Premier League teams could be competing in the Europa League next season. The team who finish sixth and the FA Cup winners are the two currently due to get a spot. However, if the cup winners have already secured a European place, it will then go to the next highest placed side who have not qualified for Europe. A third place could be awarded if Chelsea win the Conference League and fail to qualify for the Champions League. The Blues face Real Betis in the final on Wednesday, 21 May in Wroclaw. If Chelsea beat Betis and finish in the top five, there would be two English teams in the Europa League and one in the Conference League. There would usually be one Conference League place awarded to a Premier League team. As things stand that will go to Carabao Cup winners Newcastle, but that could change if Eddie Howe's side qualify for the Champions League or the Europa League (so finish in the top six at least). In that scenario seventh spot would be a Conference League place if Crystal Palace win the FA Cup. If Manchester City win the FA Cup and qualify for Europe through the league, then the team in eighth place will head into the Conference League. However as mentioned above, if Chelsea win the Conference League but do not finish in the top five then there will no English teams in next season's competition.

    "title": "'Sorry if we got your hopes up' - Saints avoid unwanted record",
    "article_text": "Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale has been relegated from the Premier League with Bournemouth, Sheffield United and Southampton Southampton fans have had precious few moments to be happy about this season as they slumped to a pitiful relegation a full fortnight before Easter. But their class of 2025 have at least avoided becoming an addition to a pub quiz question after moving past Derby County's record Premier League low total of 11 points from 2007-08. Southampton may have been up against it at the end of the0-0 draw at home to Manchester Citybut held on to move to 12 points for the season. Just generationally poor, instead of all-timers. Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, no stranger to a relegation, was quiet for most of the game as Pep Guardiola's side failed to move out of first gear to worry him. But as the clock ticked towards added time he was called into action, tipping away a header from Ruben Dias and then beaten by Omar Marmoush's dipping strike which bounced off the crossbar. Saints marked the draw with a message to Derby on social media, saying \"Sorry if we got your hopes up\". And Ramsdale added: \"Not one person outside our dressing room thought we could do anything today and rightly so. People thought we would get zero points for the rest of the season, it was down to us. \"Everyone knows it's been a difficult season for us. The sun was shining, Man City threw everything at us. That one was for the fans. \"We're not happy at all with how the season has gone but we are definitely happy with the fact we have managed to avoid that record. \"We are under no illusion it's still not a great points tally, but it's that one off our back.\" Not that City defender Dias was impressed. \"It's frustrating,\" he said. \"In a moment like this, every point matters - and it is frustrating to play against a team like this. \"Just wasting time the whole game. They don't even try anything, they just sit and they don't even want to win the game. They just want to be there. It is no good for the show and no good for themselves. It is no good for anyone, but it is what it is.\" Saints playfully sent a message to Derby County on social media after the game BBC's Match of the Day showed Manchester City's attacking heat map against Southampton You can rely on the Premier League to bring you back to earth with a bump. And speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's 606 phone-in after the game, Premier League winner Chris Sutton was not impressed with the Saints' celebrations. He said: \"I don't mind the fans celebrating because they haven't had much to celebrate, but the players on the full-time whistle? That is embarrassing, celebrating being the second-worst Premier League team of all time with 12 measly points. How low is your bar? \"Is it something to celebrate being the second-worst team? Watching players punch the air and celebrate, that is embarrassing. It is absolute amateur hour. \"It has been a disastrous season. If I am a Southampton fan I am excited, but if I am seeing my players celebrating I would be thinking 'heaven help us for next season'. What a bunch of losers.\" Co-presenter on the 606 show, Robbie Savage, who captained Derby in that record low 2007-08 season, also called the players' reactions \"pathetic\". This video can not be played How Man City's poor service frustrated Haaland Interim manager Simon Rusk - Saints' third boss of a sorry campaign - lost his last game as a full-time manager2-1 at home to Barnet. It's a long way from the National League to shutting out Erling Haaland and Co, and Rusk believes the point against Guardiola could stand the Saints in good stead back in the Championship. They won at Wembley in the play-off final last season and will be among the favourites to return in another year - despite their frugal top-flight points tally. Rusk said: \"I understood the importance of that record, but we were focusing on performances, improvement and environment. \"We were fighting for an immense amount of pride. \"We wanted to make it clear that we were aspiring to finish the season as strong as possible. We delivered that. \"With seven games to go I was confident we could take care of this points issue and that's what happened. \"On day one of this job I spoke about moments in football. We are not getting carried away, we know it's been a difficult year but hopefully the supporters go home really happy.\" Next up is another chance to put their names in the history books, with Saints the final ever visitors to Goodison Parkon 18 May.

    "article_text": "Tyrone Mings checks on the injured Alex Scott Bournemouth midfielder Alex Scott suffered a fractured jaw from what manager Andoni Iraola described as a \"very violent\" elbow by Aston Villa's Tyrone Mings. The 21-year-old midfielder went down in the sixth minute after being caught by Mings' right elbow in Saturday's Premier Leaguedefeat at Vitality Stadium. Scott required lengthy treatment but continued to play, before going to ground again holding his face after an incident involving Amadou Onana, and was subsequently replaced at half-time. Aston Villa were reduced to 10 men with 10 minutes to play when Jacob Ramsey was shown a second yellow card, but Mings did not receive a caution, to Iraola's dismay. \"The second yellow that Ramsey received is not a second yellow,\" the Spaniard told BBC Sport. \"Tyrone Mings knows what he is doing, he knew where Alex was. It was very violent. \"The value of a red card in the sixth minute or the 80th minute is very different. He sees Alex coming and for me it is very dangerous. \"I hope he can finish the season but I really don't know. He was almost knocked out. After the elbow we didn't know if he could continue.

It's a nasty collision.\" Former Newcastle and Aston Villa goalkeeper Shay Given said: \"I kind of disagree. I think he knows what he's doing a little bit. He does have a look at him.

    "title": "'Fantastic' record-breaker Watkins 'shows weight in gold'",
    "article_text": "Ollie Watkins has scored 16 goals for Aston Villa this season \"I said from the start when I joined the club, that's what I had my eyes on,\" says Ollie Watkins. Now it's official. He is Aston Villa's record Premier League goalscorer. Watkins' winner against Bournemouth was his 75th league goal for the club and moved him one clear of Gabby Agbonlahor's previous record haul. It marks a dramatic return to favour for the 29-year-old, who joined from Brentford in 2020. When he equalled Agbonlahor's record in April, Watkins saidhe was \"fuming\" with his lack of game time- calling out his manager Unai Emery. But, four matches later, he's once again Villa's main man with his boss calling his achievement \"very fantastic\". \"He deserves it completely because he is a hard worker,\" said Emery. \"He is committed with Aston Villa. \"His courage has been fantastic and to achieve it is very fantastic. I am so, so grateful to have a player like him.\" Watkins breaks record as Villa guarantee European football Champions League race hots up as Man City slip & Villa win This video can not be played Emery praise for 'fantastic' Watkins On Saturday at a sun-kissed Bournemouth,Watkins guided Morgan Rogers' low cross into the bottom corner with a delicate, deft touch. It was his 16th Premier League goal of the season - no other Englishman has more. Longevity is key. Watkins has scored at least 10 league goals in all five of his seasons at Villa, helping him move ahead of Dwight Yorke, Dion Dublin and Juan Pablo Angel in the club's top-scorer charts. \"It's a big achievement - some unbelievable players have played for this club,\" Watkins told BBC Match of the Day. \"You look at the names, so to be up there on the top of that I'm really proud. It's a great achievement.\" This season, Watkins has had to battle for a starting place with Jhon Duran, who then moved to Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr for Â£71m in January, and Marcus Rashford, who joined on loan from Manchester United in the same window. Watkins had started each of Villa's first 14 Premier League matches, but was limited to two league starts and three substitute appearances in April, and did not start either of Villa's Champions League quarter-final matches against Paris St-Germain. With Emery preferring Rashford in the starting XI, speculation was rife Watkins may leave Villa. The club had already rejected a Â£40m bid for the England forward from Arsenal in January. But Rashford was ruled out for the rest of the season last month with a hamstring injury and, since then, Watkins has returned up front to shine again. \"He's shown his weight in gold,\" former Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie told Sky Sports. \"It's not only his goals, but his team play. He works hard off the ball. He was chasing defenders in the last five minutes. He's always looking what he can do to affect the game - that just shows how important he is.\" Watkins' winner ensures Villa cannot finish lower than seventh this season, meaning the Birmingham side will, at worst, qualify for next season's Uefa Conference League. Emery's side have reached Europe for a third consecutive season, and still have a decent shot of a Champions League return via a top-five finish. Indeed, Villa's victory boosted their chances of qualifying for the Champions League from 15.5% before the weekend to 34.2% according to the Opta supercomputer. \"I think it is massive for us,\" Watkins told Sky Sports. \"There are a lot of teams that are pushing for Champions League spots and it is going down to the wire.\" Villa are currently sixth and level on points with fourth and fifth-placed Newcastle and Chelsea, who play each other on Sunday. Emery's side next face Tottenham at home on Friday, before taking on Manchester United at Old Trafford in their final game of the season.

    "title": "'Moments to remember' - Bompastor savours 'special' season",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Unbeaten Chelsea lift WSL trophy \"I'm only about titles but Sonia [Bompastor] said she's after the records - so now so am I,\" said Chelsea's Erin Cuthbert. The Scotland midfielder, 26, is used to chasing trophies but when you have already won them, you need new targets. Her side delivered the goods on Saturday, grabbing a stoppage-time winner against Liverpool to ensure they ended the season unbeaten, creating \"history\" in the process. They are the first Women's Super League (WSL) club to remain 'invincible' in a 22-game campaign and the champions broke their record points tally to do it. It capped a brilliant debut season for French manager Bompastor and Chelsea can still achieve a domestic treble, having also lifted the Women's League Cup, and face Manchester United in the Women's FA Cup final on Sunday, 18 May. The scene was set at Stamford Bridge to celebrate in front of their fans in the final game of the season and it was fitting that academy graduate Aggie Beever-Jones claimed the winner after 91 minutes in their 1-0 victory. It led to joyous scenes afterwards as captain Millie Bright was drenched with champagne as she lifted the trophy, before her team-mates grabbed the stadium announcer's microphone and started singing, draped in gold confetti. Chelsea players danced and celebrated at full-time at Stamford Bridge Smoke from the fireworks behind the trophy stage drifted across the pitch as players danced in front of the stands - Bompastor watching on with her four children by her side. \"It was wonderful,\" she said, when asked how special it was to have her family alongside her. \"I had goosebumps just because sometimes behind the scenes [my children] cry because you are travelling and not home. \"It can be difficult, but they understand your job and it's even better when they can share these moments with you. They know what it means for us. \"I think they realised how lucky they are. When they are sometimes sad, I have these moments to remember why we are doing it as a family. It is the best thing you can give to your kids.\" Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor and her assistant Camille Abily enjoyed the celebrations with their children Chelsea end WSL season unbeaten with win over Liverpool How Chelsea extended dynasty with latest WSL title Winning a sixth successive WSL title is one thing, but going unbeaten is another. It is only the fourth time an English women's team has gone a full campaign without suffering defeat, excluding the curtailed Covid campaign in 2020. Chelsea did it themselves in 2017-18 after 18 games, while rivals Manchester City (2016) and Arsenal (2012) had achieved the feat previously in 16 and 14-game seasons - but none in 22 matches until the Blues. Bompastor's side also eclipsed Chelsea's own points record set in 2022-23 (58) with their success against Liverpool taking their tally to 60. It is the best points-per-game ratio in a single WSL campaign (2.73) as well - a record previously held by Arsenal in 2018-19 (2.70). This video can not be played 'It feels great!' - Bompastor delighted with unbeaten season The records, like the trophies, continue to roll in. \"To be able to achieve that, for me, is more than the title,\" said Bompastor, as she reflected on the magnitude of their unbeaten campaign. She revealed it was not something she had thought about until Chelsea had the WSL title wrapped up with victory over Manchester United, with two games to spare. But defender Lucy Bronze had her eyes on the record for months, stating their goal to be 'invincible' back in Januaryfollowing a 1-0 win over Arsenal. They did not shy away from their ambitions in the end with the word \"unrivalled\" printed on the front of Saturday's match programme, surrounded by flowers bearing the dates of their eight league titles. Having come out on top against their rivals yet again, are they the greatest WSL team in history? \"It's difficult to say that. For the club to be able to win six titles in a row means we have been consistent and every year we have managed to win trophies,\" added Bompastor. \"Maybe the fact this year we were unbeaten makes it even more special because it never happened before. \"When you reflect on that, from now, we will be part of history. We had this unbeaten season and we broke records in terms of points so it will stay in history.\" \"Consistency\" was the word repeatedly used by Bompastor to sum up Chelsea's campaign but it has not been easy. With the former Lyon boss stepping into the big shoes left by Emma Hayes, the squad went through what they described as a \"transitional season\", bedding in new players and adapting to the new manager's style and coaching methods. Hayes herself was one of the first to congratulate Chelsea, posting on Instagram that their achievements were \"so, so deserved\". The results were immaculate but not the performances - they won by one-goal margins on 10 occasions and trailed four times during the season. Of their 56 goals, 17 came in the last 15 minutes of matches (30.4% of their total), and eight were scored in stoppage time. Between 26 January and 2 March, they dropped two points and won four successive matches by a one-goal margin in a period where they had to grind out results. \"It is sometimes difficult to describe my feelings and emotions. We had the right mentality from the beginning of the season until the end,\" said Bompastor. \"We have been consistent even when sometimes performances were not the best - we always found a way to win and get the three points. \"I think maybe the game we had against Arsenal [in January] was probably when we started to realise we were in a really good position to win the league. \"The second part of the season was more difficult because we were not as dominant as we would have liked to have been. \"For me, it is a great achievement because we were able to be consistent, unbeaten, and in this league it means a lot because it is really competitive.\" All-in-all, Chelsea's title was never in doubt as they finished 12 points clear with 19 wins and three draws. They won six of their six matches against the other top-four sides - Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City. The only times they dropped points were in three draws against Leicester (1-1), Brighton (2-2) and West Ham (2-2). They remain, as they have done for the past five years, the best team in England.

    "title": "Hull KR beat Catalans to reach Challenge Cup final",
    "article_text": "Jack Broadbent's second-half brace of tries proved decisive as Rovers reached their ninth Challenge Cup final Betfred Challenge Cup semi-final Hull KR (16) 36 Tries:Batchelor 2, Lewis, Broadbent 2, BurgessGoals:Lewis 6 Catalans (12) 12 Tries:Smith, KearyGoals:Aispuro-Bichet 2 Hull KR reached the Challenge Cup final for the second time in three seasons, after overpowering Catalans Dragons 36-12 in York. James Batchelor crossed within four minutes and then claimed a second score after a lengthy video review to put Rovers on top. Two tries in five minutes from Reimis Smith and Luke Keary put Les Dracs ahead, but Mikey Lewis wrestled back a narrow 16-12 lead before the break. Hull KR restarted with high intensity as Lewis, who contributed 16 points, booted a penalty before Jack Broadbent's scorching run opened up a 12-point cushion. Broadbent's second sealed the win before Joe Burgess added late gloss. Hull KR have gone 40 years without a major trophy and lifted their only Challenge Cup even further back, in 1980. But their hopes are sky high with Rovers sitting top of Super League and now in their ninth Challenge Cup final after an emphatic second-half display. KR showed first as both sides ignored the unusually high spring temperatures and went full-tilt in a breathless first half. Batchelor chased down Lewis' kick through to score after Guillermo Aispuro-Bichet failed to punch the ball out of the in-goal area, and then added a hotly-debated second try after a lengthy video review. Matthieu Laguerre appeared to ground the ball at the same time as the second-rower, but video referee Ben Thaler could not overrule Chris Kendall's on-field decision to award the try. Dragons offered little in attack in the opening 15 minutes but then exploded into life, as Smith cut back inside to split open the Rovers defence and cross near the posts. And when Keary chased down a chip ahead soon after, Thaler did this time overrule Kendall - who had called offside - as the Dragons pinched the lead. Catalans went close to extending that lead moments later, but Julian Bousquet's rash flicked offload just metres from the line instead found a Rovers hand. But the match turned again before half-time as Jai Whitbread's brilliant offload in the tackle sent Lewis flying over to restore the Hull KR advantage. Lewis booted a penalty as Rovers piled on the pressure after the restart and then cracked the French side when Broadbent spotted a gap and launched a scorching diagonal run through to the posts. Jez Litten's thrilling run from his own half sparked a breathless move which fell just short, but KR killed the game with 10 minutes left as Catalans visibly wilted. Kelepi Tanginoa was sent clear by Lewis' cut-out pass and fed Burgess, whose pass inside gave Broadbent a clear run to the line. Burgess then ran in at the left corner for try number six. Hull KR head coach Willie Peters told BBC Radio Humberside: \"That last eight-minute period (before half-time) there were no points scored but I thought that we really started to find our groove and find our game. \"Then we spoke at half-time about taking that and doing it for the next 40 and I thought the players did that. They were exceptional. \"First half we got to 10-0, but I didn't think we were playing that great. \"I think we were both just feeling our way in, but then that last 10 minutes of the first half that's when it was set-for-set attrition and I think we then came out the other end. \"We haven't won anything yet. We're happy, but we've just got to make sure we prepare right.\" Hull KR:Broadbent; Davies, Hiku, Batchelor, Burgess; Lewis, May; Sue, Litten, Waerea-Hargreaves, Hadley, Whitbread, Minchella.

    "title": "Are we heading for another world war – or has it already started?",
    "article_text": "In a week in which former allies in a redividing globe separately commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war, the sense of a runaway descent towards a third world war draws ever closer. The implosion of Pax Americana, the interconnectedness of conflicts, the new willingness to resort to unbridled state-sponsored violence and the irrelevance of the institutions of the rules-based order have all been on brutal display this week. FromKashmirto Khan Younis, Hodeidah, Port Sudan and Kursk, the only sound is of explosions, and the only lesson is that the old rules no longer apply. IndeedFiona Hill, the policy analyst and adviser to the UK government on its imminent strategic defence review, argues the third world war has already started, if only we would recognise it. The fear of a world in which no one, due to science or globalisation, is any longer in control is hardly new: the concept was the title of two Reith lectures, one in 1967 by the social anthropologist Edmund Leach and another in 1999 by the political philosopher Anthony Giddens. But rarely has been it so clear that the rules-based world order created in 1945 is in headlong retreat. The former Labour foreign secretary David Miliband put it well this week at Chatham House, saying: “I know that people always say the world is changing, but this feels like a moment of genuine geopolitical flux, at least as significant as 1989-90 when the world transitioned from the cold war to a unipolar moment, and for me theTrump administrationis both symptom and cause of the changes under way. “The problem is that it’s much more clear what we are inflecting from – a world in which the US was the anchor of the global system – but it’s not clear what we’re inflecting to. I know there’s a lot of talk about the idea of a multipolar world reflecting a redistribution of the balance of power, but I find that concept conveying too much stability, too much security.” His one-time mentor Tony Blair, in a talk in California, argued: “Everyone has been shaken out of their comfort zone. The noise you are hearing from the political undergrowth is the frantic foraging for options. People are rethinking their position in the world and their relationships. There is no doubt at all this is a major shock. This is the most significant geostrategic event I can remember in terms of America and the world.” For the former US secretary of state Antony Blinken, Donald Trump’s indifference to alienating allies is an act of vandalism. He said diplomats around the world were asking: “What the fuck is going on?” Blinken said America had spent 80 years building up trust, strong economic partnerships and military and political alliances, and if that was then taken down in a matter of 100 days it would be incredibly hard to rebuild. “It means countries look for ways to work around us, to work together but without the US,” he said. “The possibility that what will be said today will be reversed tomorrow, and will be reversed again, means they simply cannot count on us. Joe Biden used to say it is never a good idea to bet against America. The problem we now have is people are no longer betting on America.” The doleful consequences of America’s withdrawal have been visible all week. It may or may not be a world war but it is a world at war. In Gaza the world has watched as a blockade on food, aid and medical supplies, in defiance of binding orders by the international court of justice (ICJ), has now entered into its third month. Israel, in search of security, has in the past month bombed Yemen, Lebanon, Syria and Gaza. It is daily urging the US to be given permission to bomb Iran. Trump can hardly complain when Bezalel Smotrich, Israel’s ultra-right finance minister,shared his visionfor the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, predicting that within half a year the population of the territory would be confined to just a narrow swathe of land, with the remainder “totally destroyed”. Smotrich was only repeating a version of Trump’s plan to empty Gaza of Palestinians, a plan totally at odds with the ceasefire terms his envoy had negotiated. In remarks at a “settlements conference”, Smotrich also declared that Israel would “apply sovereignty” in the West Bank within the lifetime of the current government, which is due to expire in October 2026 unless elections are called earlier. “Within a few months, we will be able to declare that we have won. Gaza will be totally destroyed,” Smotrich said. “In another six months, Hamas won’t exist as a functioning entity.” With Trump silent, it was left toEuropeto respond. “It is time for the European Union and the entire international community to wake up,” said the Belgian foreign minister, Maxime Prévot. He denounced the blockade as “an absolute disgrace … It is not acceptable; deliberately cutting off all humanitarian aid, all access to food, healthcare, electricity and water, as a war strategy, is totally unacceptable.” The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “If we condemnRussiafor violating Ukrainian sovereignty, we cannot remain silent when it happens in Gaza. Hamas must be fought, yes, but not at the cost of trampling on all the rules.” He called for a united response by Europe, yet at a foreign affairs meeting in Poland the 27 ministers could not even agree on a joint statement, let alone joint action to suspend its free trade agreement with Israel, a Dutch proposal. Meanwhile in PortSudan, the conduit for humanitarian aid into Sudan, Rapid Support Forces drones destroyed infrastructure, just as Israeli bombs have sought to do this week in Hodeidah, the chief entry point for aid into Yemen. On Monday an effort by the Sudanese government to hold the United Arab Emirates accountable at the ICJ for directing arms to the RSFended in failure. The UAE, like many other nations, is a signatory to the genocide convention, but it has entered a reservation insisting its compliance with the convention is not subject to ICJ proceedings. The ICJ meekly concluded there was a manifest lack of jurisdiction. Only one judge, Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf from Somali, objected. So the UAE gains kudos of signing the convention without needing to be judged on meeting its obligations. It has been left to the UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, to make a valiant effort to coax the parties to a ceasefire, but so far it has foundered. The US, by contrast, labels RSF leaders as genocidal but does nothing in practical diplomatic terms. In Kashmir, wheretwo nuclear-armed statesare firing rockets at one another’s aircraft, there is a conspicuous absence of American interest. The US has no ambassador in India or Pakistan and no senior state department official appointed. The conflict is not making waves in US media, and Trump’s initial response was “it’s a shame” and that “if you think about it they have been fighting for many, many decades, and centuries, actually”. In previous disputes between India andPakistanit took a decisive US intervention to help calm both sides. In July 1999 in Washington, Bill Clinton personally browbeat Pakistan’s then leader, Nawaz Sharif, into retreat in what one official called the most important meeting with a foreign leader of Clinton’s presidency. The former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo revealed in his memoirhow closethe two sides came in February 2019 to a nuclear conflagration, something he frantically helped stop from a secure hotel room on a visit to Hanoi. Unnervingly, India is no longer framing the issue as terrorism but as a state-on-state dispute by saying the underlying issue is Pakistan acting as a shield for terrorism. These conflicts may be disconnected save the common thread of absent US leadership and permanent upheaval. But inUkrainethe structural elements of the world war come together, Hill argues. The scale of the death toll may be different to the second world war, but according to the UK military this week Russia has suffered 900,000 casualties, far in excess of its losses during previous wars in Chechyna and Afghanistan. Moreover, the wars are now, in her words, “system-changing conflicts with multivector loads of countries involved”. Chinese-flagged trawlers with Russians onboard rupturing undersea cables in the Baltic Sea is only one part of Vladimir Putin’s global war. China, North Korea and Iran are all supporting Russia, some in more material ways such as building drone factories or supplying soldiers. A host of other countries have been happy to keep Russia economically afloat in ways that make their neutrality contestable. India, with which the UK has completed afree trade dealthis week, has bought €112bn of oil from Russia since the war started, and also bought Russian arms. The conflict has been presented by Russia and its allies as a war about American hegemony. Trump clearly had a plan to extricate the US from the line of fire and to put relations with Russia on a different footing, a desire he has nursed since the 1980s. Trump sees the world in similar terms to Putin – a handful of sovereign powers dividing up land into spheres of influence. His dream is to re-enact Yalta 1945 alongside Putin and possibly Xi Jinping, with Europe an onlooker and Ukraine dismembered. But organising a decent betrayal has provedmore difficult than expected. In the White House, Trump famously told Volodymyr Zelenskyy: “You have to be thankful. You don’t have the cards.” But Trump overplayed the cards he had, throwing many of them away with his self-destructive tariff war. And it emerged that Zelenskyy did in fact have a few cards left, deploying them skilfully by offering a 30-day ceasefire, aminerals dealwith the US, and focusing on Ukraine’s military value to western security. The intimate photo of Trump and Zelenskyy in conclave at the funeral of the pope (a picture taken by Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak) reeked of reconciliation yet flattered Trump’s ego. A change in mood in Washington is now discernible. Even JD Vance, the vice-president, once agitator-in-chief against Zelenskyy, this week admitted Russia was“asking for too much”and said Europe and the US were “on the same team”. Europe’s leaders would dearly welcome that, but there is now a clarity across Europe, and not just in Paris, that regardless of Vance’s reassurance, Europe has to have the capability to operate autonomously of the US. Trump is self-evidently not reliable, and his benign assessment of Putin’s intentions is not shared. Planning for a European reassurance force in Ukraine is under way, as is planning for a potential Russian attack on Europe. Since February, France and the UK, through a combined joint expeditionary force, have formed the nucleus of that planning, but this has broadened, with new political leadership increasingly coming from four members of the Weimar+ group: Poland, France, Germany and the UK. In a speech marking VE Day, the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, explained the double necessity for Europe to be prepared for war. Russia’s war of aggression had shattered the European security order, with the imperial delusion that the war in Ukraine could be conflated with the great patriotic war. Then he added: “The fact that now even the United States, who did so much to create and shape this order, is turning its back on it is a shock on an entirely new scale. That is why I speak of a double epochal shift – Russia’s war of aggression and the US break with its values – that is what marks the end of this long 20th century.” Europe, he insisted, must decide what comes next.",

    "title": "Five fishermen lost at sea for 55 days rescued by Ecuadorian tuna boat",
    "article_text": "Five fishers who spent 55 days adrift at sea arrived on Saturday at a port in the Galápagos after being rescued by a tuna boat, the Ecuadorian navy said on X. The three Peruvians and two Colombians had been missing since mid-March and were found on 7 May by an Ecuadorian boat called Aldo. The fishers had reported damage to the boat’s alternator two days after setting sail from Pucusana Bay, to the south of Peru’s capital Lima, the navy said in a separate post on Friday. The failure caused communication and navigation tools to malfunction, Ecuadorian navy frigate captain María Fares told the Associated Press, adding that they had no power on the boat. “They had no starter, lights and everything that a battery generates,” she said. To survive, they had to “take rusted water out of the engine [and] when a fish passed by, they caught it and parboiled it to eat”. They also drank rain and sea water to survive, Fares added. The men are in stable condition and the navy said it was coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries. Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisher, 61-year-old Máximo Napa,spent 95 days at sea alone. He was also rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel and returned to Lima in mid-March to be reunited with his family.",

    "title": "Koalas face death, attacks and starvation as blue gums chopped down in Victoria",
    "article_text": "Thousands of koalas are being displaced each year as blue gum plantations are cut down inVictoria, worsening overcrowding in nearby forests and exacerbating the risk of injury and death during bushfires. An estimated 42,500koalas live in blue gum plantationsin south-west Victoria, data shows. Between 8,000 and 10,000hectares of plantation are harvestedeach year, making thousands of koalas homeless. Scientists said the displaced animals crossed roads used by logging trucks. They moved into trees along road reserves, on neighbouring properties and nearby forests, which they soon strip bare. Some migrated into adjacent plantations, only to be evicted again the following year. “It’s a pretty stressful situation for koalas,” said Dr Desley Whisson a Deakin University ecologist who specialises in koala management. “The blue gum plantations get cut down, and those koalas have to find somewhere to go.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Each year thousands of koalas were likely displaced by plantation harvests, she said, based on their density in plantations and the scale of the logging. Koalas are listed as endangered in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory, but in south-west Victoria and South Australia there are not enough trees to sustain the koala populations. The CSIROestimates the national koala populationis between 224,000 and 524,000. Whisson said koalas displaced from blue gum plantations were adding to already high densities in nearby trees and forests and contributing to the decline of nearby native vegetation, like manna gum. Overabundance, particularly combined with drought or fire, could ultimately lead to welfare issues – mass starvation and death – with land managers and wildlife carers left to deal with the consequences. One licensed koala shelter operator in the south-west, who asked not be named, said she helped up to 450 sick or injured animals a year. She said displaced animals were sometimes still up in trees that were felled and ended up with broken bones, or were orphaned babies left behind. Others were attacked by cows or dogs. She said some koalas froze in the lights of logging trucks while crossing roads. “The amount of road kill is just horrendous,” the carer said. “They’ve been in a huge, big forest all their life. And then all of a sudden it’s ripped down around them.” A 2023study of reported wild koala deathsin south-east Queensland found vehicles were responsible for about half (1,431) of all fatalities. The Victorian government released its koala strategy in May 2023. It detailed koala welfare problems associated with plantations but did not focus on long-term solutions. “There are currently no cost-effective management techniques available that would be acceptable to the community, or clear objectives for the management of koalas in blue gum plantations,” the strategy said. Victoria’s environment department said it was working with animal welfare groups and experts to ensure the sustainability of koala populations and had invested $3.3m in koala management and research. “Victoria is fortunate to have a large koala population, but it does face threats such as disease, climate change and poor genetic diversity in some of the populations,” a spokesperson told Guardian Australia. Sign up toBreaking News Australia Get the most important news as it breaks after newsletter promotion Dr Kita Ashman, an ecologist for WWF Australia, said the plantations had changed the landscape profoundly since being established in the 1990s and 2000s. She said the blue gum leaves provided a nutritious source of food that enabled the animals to reach much higher numbers than normal, but no one had properly dealt with the ramifications. The plantation industry was required to obtain a permit before it disturbed koalas, to engage koala spotters and to retain a minimum of nine trees around any animal observed during harvesting, but there was little onus on it to consider the fate of displaced animals, she said. “We’re basically planting up this smorgasbord of plantations that koalas then move into, feed on, breed in,” she said. But Ashman said the answer should not be to get rid of plantations, as they were an important alternative to the native forest logging industry. Whisson said it was a “wicked problem” that was likely to get worse. But she said there were solutions at the landscape scale that could improve the situation. They included the blue gum industry leaving a portion of each plantation for koalas to stay in or contributing to restoring permanent habitat. They could also provide support for wildlife carers and animal hospitals dealing with the fallout. She said that in the longer term the industry could consider growing an alternative tree species that was less palatable to koalas than blue gum. Dr Rolf Schlagloth, a koala ecologist from Central Queensland University, said providing somewhere for the koalas to go was a “solvable problem”. “The real issue is the lack of connectivity [of nature] and failing to properly manage koala habitat,” he said. Schlagloth said all stakeholders needed to be involved in finding solutions and that state and federal governments needed to acknowledge mistakes – and it would take significant effort, and funding, to fix them. “We need open, honest discussion,” he said, “to make sure that our koalas – which are a flagship species – are saved.”",

    "title": "NSW forestry agency should be shut down for repeatedly breaking law, critics argue",
    "article_text": "A former magistrate and one of Australia’s most experienced scientists have launched an extraordinary attack on theNew South Walesgovernment’s logging agency, describing it as effectively a “criminal organisation” that should be shut down after a string of court convictions. Prof David Heilpern, a NSW magistrate between 1998 and 2020 and now the dean of law at Southern Cross University, said the state’s Forestry Corporation should be “disbanded” as it was was no longer fit for purpose. The corporation has been convicted of more than a dozen environmental offences, including a judgment in the land and environment court last year that found the agency was likely to reoffend and had poor prospects of rehabilitation. “If they were a bikie group they would be a criminal organisation. Anyone with that number of convictions the vernacular is to call them a criminal organisation,” Heilpern said. “Are they a criminal organisation within the meaning of the legislation? The answer is no. However, it’s clear that it’s unprecedented for any statutory organisation to have that number of serious offences over matters of environmental importance.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email A NSW Forestry Corporation spokesperson said Heilpern’s suggestion that the corporation be compared to a bikie gang was “ridiculous”. “Forestry Corporation will not respond to this analogy,” they said. “Where breaches have occurred, they have been unintentional and without malice. Forestry Corporation deeply regrets any breaches and has heavily invested in its compliance systems and processes to minimise the room for human or technological errors.” Heilpern’s comments follow a judgment in the NSW land and environment court last year that fined the Forestry Corporation $360,000 after it failed to accurately map two environmentally significant areas in the Yambulla state forest. The court found the forest agency had logged 53 eucalyptus trees in one of these areas, causing actual harm to the trees and affecting the refuge of native fauna and flora species after the black summer bushfires. The judgment also found the logging of the trees had caused potential harm to three threatened bird species that lived in the forest. In her judgment, Justice Rachel Pepper noted the Forestry Corporation’s “lengthy record of prior convictions for environmental offences” including polluting a forest waterway, inadequate threatened species surveys, unlawful harvesting of hollow-bearing trees, and harvesting in koala and rainforest habitat exclusion zones. Pepper accepted submissions from the state’s Environment Protection Authority that the forest agency was likely to reoffend and did not have good prospects of rehabilitation. Heilpern said this demonstrated the Forestry Corporation “are not fit for purpose which is to lawfully and in an environmentally sound way manage our forests”. “They aren’t offences involving failing to cross a t or dot an i. They are offences involving illegal logging of state forest without appropriate levels of environmental protection. It’s completely unprecedented,” he said. “Whether or not you declare them a criminal organisation, they’re clearly not fit for purpose to manage our forests. They should be disbanded.” Sign up toClear Air Australia Adam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisis after newsletter promotion The Minns government has been under pressure over the future of native forest logging, having committed to establishing a “Great Koala national park” in the state’s north before the 2023 election. Areas of the park have continued to be logged while community groups and conservationists wait for a decision from the government about the park’s boundaries. The native hardwood forest division of Forestry Corporation has disclosed losses of$72m since 2020-21, including $29m in 2023-24. The scientist David Lindenmayer, a distinguished professor of ecology and conservation biology at the Australian National University, said: “NSW Forestry Corporation has been prosecuted in the land and environment court repeatedly – what does that tell us about the organisation? “From any perspective you look at it, this really is a criminal organisation in terms of crimes against the environment, crimes against biodiversity but also crimes against the state’s finances. Because when this organisation conducts these crimes it actually loses money for the state.” The Forestry Corporation’s spokesperson said logging operations produced 4m tonnes of timber each year and “as you would expect, the vast majority of these operations are fully compliant with the law”. They said the agency often “protects more trees in its operations than required by the regulation”. A spokesperson for the NSW agriculture minister, Tara Moriarty, said “there are comprehensive regulations in place and the minister expects Forestry Corporation of NSW to comply with them”. The Greens MLC Sue Higginson criticised the state government for “allowing and defending” the agency to continue to operate. “For the Forestry Corporation, breaking the law and harming the environment and wildlife has become like a game of charades played under the protection of the state,” she said. “They get caught, investigated, prosecuted, a criminal conviction, a fine – which the public pays – and they carry on and do it all again. “There is just no integrity, accountability or justice in this model of operation.”",

    "title": "Vladimir Putin rejects ceasefire ultimatum proposed by European leaders",
    "article_text": "Vladimir Putin has rejected an ultimatum by European leaders to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine or face increased sanctions, but has proposed holding direct negotiations with Kyiv this week. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland told the Russian president either to sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers toUkraine. “All of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he’s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now,” said UK prime minister,Keir Starmer, at a joint press conference of the five leaders in Kyiv. Starmer said the leaders were demanding “an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and [are] clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions, and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressureRussiaback to the table.” Starmer,Emmanuel Macronand Friedrich Merz arrived in the Ukrainian capital on the same train on Saturday morning, while Donald Tusk travelled on a separate train. The leaders met Zelenskyy for talks in central Kyiv. It is Macron’s first visit to Kyiv since summer 2022, and the first visit for Merz as chancellor, having only taken office this week. “All five leaders had a fruitful call with @POTUS focused on peace efforts,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha,wroteon X, adding a picture of the five men gathered around a mobile phone on speaker mode. Sybiha added: “Ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday. If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.” Russia’s response to the ultimatum came in a press briefing for Russian media and western television networks, held in the Kremlin close to 2am local time on Sunday morning. Putin rejected the calls for a ceasefire, but said he was ready for direct negotiations with Ukraine. He suggested delegations from the two countries could meet in Istanbul this Thursday to begin talks. “We don’t exclude that during these negotiations we will be able to agree on new ceasefires,” said Putin. Ukraine and European capitals have previously demanded a full ceasefire as a precondition to starting negotiations. Putin left the briefing, for which journalists had been kept waiting for up to seven hours, without answering any questions. There was no immediate readout from the White House on the call, or on whether Trump had made specific commitments if Putin rejects the ceasefire. Trump and the US administration have said a 30-day ceasefire could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement such a ceasefire, but Russia has so far refused, saying it would only do so if all western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were halted. In an early sign that Russia may not be receptive to the latest ultimatum, the hawkish former president, Dmitry Medvedev,wroteon X: “Macron, Merz, Starmer, and Tusk were supposed to discuss peace in Kyiv. Instead, they are blurting out threats against Russia … You think that’s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses.” Instead, Moscow unilaterallydeclared a three-day ceasefire beginning on 8 May, which Kyiv said was designed to avoid Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia during celebrations of 80 years of the Soviet victory in the second world war, held in Moscow on Friday. Thousands of troops marched through Red Square for the annual Victory Day parade, with numerous world leaders in attendance, most notably China’s Xi Jinping, and the Brazilian president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Robert Fico and Aleksandar Vučić, the prime minister of EU member Slovakia and the president of EU hopeful Serbia, respectively,also attended the parade, drawing irritation from other European leaders. Fighting has continued along the frontlines during the supposed ceasefire, both sides have said, but Russia has largely refrained from drone and missile attacks on Ukraine. “Putin didn’t need conditions when he wanted a ceasefire to have a parade, and he doesn’t need them now. Ukraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again, but again and again Putin has refused,” said Starmer. Starmer said Putin had drawn the wrong lessons from the second world war. “We understand the lessons of history, the lesson that any veteran of Normandy or north Africa or of any other campaign will tell you, but that Putin has not yet grasped. There is no glory in aggression and conquest, glory comes from fighting for your country, defending the people, and winning the peace,” he said. Macron also referenced VE Day, and said that “the defence of the principles on which our continent and, more generally, the international order is based” was at stake in the war in Ukraine. The four European leaders visited Kyiv’s Maidan on Saturday morning with Zelenskyy and his wife, Olena Zelenska. Thousands of flags have been erected in the central square to remember those killed in the war with Russia. The leaders paid their respects and had a moment of silence, before heading to the talks with Zelenskyy. The five then had a virtual meeting with other leaders on progress being made for a so-called “air, land, maritime and regeneration force” that is planned to be part of a peace deal. Trump has yet to comment publicly on his conversation with the group of leaders. On Friday, he was asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he had a message for Putin. “I have a message for both parties: get this war ended,” he said, adding: “Get this stupid war finished. That’s my message for both of them.” The Trump administration has so far appeared to be much tougher on Kyiv than Moscow, but there are some small signals that the mood in Washington might be changing, after a positive meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy in the Vatican on the sidelines of the pope’s funeral. Even the vice-president, JD Vance, seen as the most sceptical of voices on support for Ukraine,has criticised Moscow’s stancein recent days. “Right now, the Russians are asking for a certain set of requirements, a certain set of concessions in order to end the conflict. We think they’re asking for too much,” he said this week. The US embassy in Kyiv put out a public warning late on Friday night that it had received intelligence of a “potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days”. It did not give further details, but it later emerged that Russia will close its airspace over the Kapustin Yar missile testing range on Monday and Tuesday, which could indicate the potential launch of ballistic missiles.",

    "title": "Operation to recover Mike Lynch’s superyacht suspended after diver dies",
    "article_text": "Recovery operations toraise the late tech tycoon Mike Lynch’ssuperyacht Bayesian from the seabed off Sicily have been suspended after a diver died during underwater work. Rob Cornelis Maria Huijben, a 39-year-old Dutch diver,died on Friday while doing preparation workto cut the ship’s mainmast. He was employed by the maritime company Hebo, whose barge arrived last week in Porticello, a fishing port near Palermo. The luxury vessel was anchored just off Porticello when it wasstruck shortly before dawn by a violent stormon 19 August 2024. It sank within seconds, killing seven people, including Lynch and his daughter Hannah. Police said the cause of the diver’s death was unknown and an investigation was launched. “This pause in activity is necessary for the investigations to be completed and to allow all salvage and associated teams to mourn the tragic loss of a highly respected salvage diver during yesterday’s underwater work,” read a statement from the British-based consultancy TMC Marine, which will oversee a consortium of salvage specialists undertaking the project. A preliminary examination of the diver’s body revealed no visible injuries or burns. Investigators believe he may have suffered a medical problem while submerged. An alternative line of inquiry is that after divers used a blowtorch to cut the vessel’s boom, Huijben was struck by dislodged debris – possibly a piece of metal. Footage captured by underwater cameras cut off shortly before the incident. Marcus Cave, head of naval architecture and a director of TMC Marine, said Friday’s tragedy “has been felt by all involved in this project, and the priority right now is the family of this expert, specialist diver, who was well liked and indeed loved by all involved in the project. This pause in operations will enable thorough investigations to be completed into this tragic accident. It will also help us to mourn and regroup. “Our thoughts are with everyone affected. Salvage operations at sea always carry an element of risk,” he added. “The salvage team is providing full cooperation to the authorities in their investigations.” A further project update will be issued after the weekend. Investigators hope the yacht will yield vital clues: whether a series of human errors led to the sinking, as initially suspected, or if other factors were at play. Once it is ashore, an examination will determine if one of the hatches remained open and whether the keel was improperly raised. Lynch, who in June last year wascleared of fraud chargesin the US relating to the sale of his company, Autonomy, to Hewlett-Packard in 2011,was enjoying a lavish voyage around Sicilyto celebrate his acquittal alongside 18-year-old Hannah and his wife, Angela Bacares, whose company owned the Bayesian. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Among those on board were Lynch’s attorney from Clifford Chance, Chris Morvillo, his wife, the jewellery designer Neda Morvillo, Morgan Stanley International’s chair, Jonathan Bloomer, and his wife, Judy Bloomer, a former psychotherapist. All four died in the incident. The yacht’s chef, Recaldo Thomas, was the seventh person who died. Fifteen people survived, including Bacares. The wreck sits at a depth of 50 metres in the bay of Porticello, which is under surveillance by Italian authorities. Insurers estimate the salvage will cost about $30m (£23m), a bill the Bayesian’s underwriters will pick up.",

    "article_text": "Spanish authorities have told more than 160,000 people near Barcelona to stay indoors after a fire at an industrial warehouse released a toxic cloud of chlorine over a wide area. The blaze, in the coastal city of Vilanova i la Geltrú, south of Barcelona, started at dawn on Saturday in a warehouse storing pool cleaning products, the regional fire service said. “If you are in the zone that is affected do not leave your home or your place of work,” the Civil Protection Service said on social media. It advised people to keep doors and windows closed in the at-risk area, which stretched across five local districts along the coast, from Vilanova i la Geltrú to the village of Calafell, near Tarragona. No casualties had been reported so far, the fire service said on X, adding that it had deployed a large number of units to bring the fire under control. It said it was “monitoring the column [of gas] caused by the blaze for changes and for its toxic levels”. The authorities closed roads in the area and shut train stations to prevent people approaching the affected area. “It is very difficult for chlorine to catch fire but when it does so it is very hard to put it out,” the warehouse owner Jorge Vinuales Alonso told local radio station Rac1.

The mayor of Vilanova, Juan Luis Ruiz López, told the public TV station TVE that now the fire had been extinguished the authorities expected “this toxic cloud will start to dissipate and we can lift the measures currently imposed”.",

    "title": "European leaders tell Putin to agree to unconditional ceasefire by Monday or face ‘massive’ sanctions – as it happened",
    "article_text": "This blog is now closed, you canread our full report on this story here It is approaching 6pm inKyivandMoscow. This blog will be closing shortly, but you can find all the Guardian’sRussia-UkrainecoveragehereandShaun Walker’s latest report from Kyiv below: Here is a summary of the day’s developments: European leaders on a joint visit to Kyiv have issued an ultimatum to Vladimir Putin: sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday, or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers toUkraine.The leaders of the UK, France, Germany and Poland, together with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a joint phone call to Donald Trump prior to making the announcement. It was the first time the leaders of the four European nations hadmade a joint visit to Ukraine. “We are clear the bloodshed must end.Russiamust stop its illegal invasion,” the leaders said in a joint statement. Zelenskyy told reporters at the news conference after their talks that the ceasefire should cover air, sea and land, and said that if Moscow refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors.Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Friday thatRussiasupported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of “nuances”. The Kremlin accused European countries on Saturday of making contradictory and confrontational statements, Interfax news agency reported, after European leaders backed a US plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraineand threatened Russia with “massive” sanctions if it failed to comply.“We hear many contradictory statements fromEurope. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying. In an earlier interview with ABC News, Peskov said Russia would require a halt to US and European arms supplies to Ukraine during any potential ceasefire.“Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine. Ukraine will continue their total mobilisation, bringing new troops to [the] frontline,” Peskov said. Keir Starmer has said there is “absolute unity” of countries around the world on Ukraine. Speaking from Kyiv on Saturday, the prime minister was asked if he believed Vladimir Putin wanted peace and why he thought the threat of sanctions would work. Starmer replied: “There’s only one country that stands between peace, and that’s Russia.” Starmer said “all of us here, together with US, are calling Putin out”, adding that if the Russian president was “serious” about peace then “he has a chance to show it now by extending the VE Day pause into a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire”. Starmer also said UK experts and European partners were working to “boost Ukraine’s economy” in an attempt to support the invaded country’s stability long-term. Speaking at the ‘coalition of the willing’ meeting in Kyiv on Saturday, the UK prime minister said “securing Ukraine’s future for the longer term” had been discussed, with measures including the resumption of flights to Ukraine. French president Emmanuel Macron called on Saturday for “direct talks” between Ukraine and Russia in the event of a ceasefirein Moscow’s three-year invasion.If there is a 30-day truce, as western countries have floated, “we will look to direct talks between Ukraine andRussia, we are ready to help,” Macron said in an interview with French news outlets TF1 and LCI while travelling to Kyiv to meet European leaders. German chancellor Friedrich Merz warned Russia would face harder sanctions if it refused a 30-day ceasefire demanded by the west, in an interview published on Saturday by the Bild daily.If Putin does not agree to the truce, “there will be a massive hardening of sanctions and the massive aid toUkrainewill continue – politically, of course, but also financially and militarily,” said Merz. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday backed a proposed unconditional 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine and said that the EU is ready to impose further “biting” sanctions on Russia in the event of a breach of a ceasefire.“The ball is now in Russia’s court. We stand ready to maintain strong pressure onRussia,” said von der Leyen. Nato secretary general Mark Rutte said on Saturday after joining a ‘coalition of the willing’ call with Kyiv’s partners that it was clear the group is committedand continues to stand with Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that Ukrainian forces had made four more attempts in the past 24 hours to break across the border into Russia’s Kursk and Belgorod regions, although Reuters could not independently verify the assertion.Ukraine says Russia has continued to attack it and has called the ceasefire a “farce”. On Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day had killed three residents and injured four more.Another civilian man died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional governor Oleksandr Prokudin. An Associated Press tally, based on reports from Ukrainian authorities, found at least 117 civilians had been killed and more than 1,000 injured in Russian aerial attacks sinceUkraineannounced on 11 March its willingness for a ceasefire. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said North Korea’s involvement in the Russia-Ukraine war was justified, calling it an exercise of sovereign rights in defence of a “brother nation,” state media KCNA reported on Saturday. He also said Pyongyang would not hesitate to authorise the use of military force if the United States persisted in military provocations againstRussia. Away fromUkrainefor a moment,Valdimir Putinhas attended a working lunch with the leader ofVietman’s Communist party,Tô Lâm, inMoscowtoday: Keir Starmerhas said that he andEuropeanallies “together with the US” are “calling Putin out”, reports the PA news agency. Speaking fromKyiv, he said the five leaders in theUkrainiancapital on Saturday had agreed on the need for an “unconditional ceasefire”. The prime minister said “all of us here, together with US, are calling Putin out”. He said that if the Russian president is “serious” about peace then “he has a chance to show it now by extending the VE Day pause into a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire”. Starmer added: No more ifs and buts, no more conditions and delays. He also said: Ukraine has shown the willingness to engage again and again, but again and again, Putin has refused. So we are clear, all five leaders here – all the leaders of the meeting we just had with the coalition of the willing – an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond. Working with President Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressure Russia back to the table. Keir Starmerhas saidUKexperts andEuropeanpartners are working to “boostUkraine’s economy” in an attempt to support the invaded country’s stability long-term, reports the PA news agency. Speaking at the‘coalition of the willing’meeting inKyivon Saturday, the UK prime minister said “securing Ukraine’s future for the longer term” had been discussed, with measures including the resumption of flights to Ukraine. Starmer said: We want to help Ukraine look to the future with confidence. So we’re working to boost Ukraine’s economy and, as a vital step, I’m pleased that UK experts have been on the ground leading work to support the resumption of flights into Ukraine. He added: Once a ceasefire is achieved it will take time but this will be a huge moment in reconnecting Ukraine’s economy, boosting investor confidence, and helping to reunite families separated by this war. Ukraine secure and thriving: that is what we all want to see. With our 100-year partnership, the critical minerals deal with the US, and our coalition of the willing, we are building the framework for peace in Ukraine to support a better future for the Ukrainian people, and to pledge once again in all our interests and on this anniversary, that aggression will never prevail on our continent. The KremlinaccusedEuropeancountries on Saturday of making contradictory and confrontational statements, Interfax news agency reported, after European leaders backed aUSplan for a 30-day ceasefire inUkraineand threatenedRussiawith “massive” sanctions if it failed to comply. “We hear many contradictory statements fromEurope. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,” Kremlin spokespersonDmitry Peskovwas quoted as saying. Keir Starmerhas said there is “absolute unity” of countries around the world onUkraine, reports the PA news agency. The prime minister said it “must beRussiathat now comes forward and accepts this 30-day unconditional ceasefire”. Speaking fromKyivon Saturday, the prime minister was asked if he believesVladimir Putinwants peace and why he thinks the threat of sanctions would work. Starmer replied: There’s only one country that stands between peace, and that’s Russia. He added: The position we’ve now got to today is absolute unity across a whole range of countries around the world. Starmer also said the leaders were “clear absolutely there must be an unconditional ceasefire for 30 days. Clear that that means it must be without conditions”. InKyiv,UKprime ministerKeir StarmeraddressedUkrainianpresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaying: Volodymyr and the Ukrainian people, we stood with you in resisting Putin’s aggression but we must now stand with you in the fight for peace. Putin has, in the last few hours, sought to put conditions on a ceasefire. It’s really important that we make clear, an unconditional ceasefire is a ceasefire without conditions. We reject the imposition of conditions, and we need to be really clear about that. It is for Russia to come to the table for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, and there must be clear sanctions if he fails to do so. There is real unity on that. We need to be clear that that is one of the main outcomes we want from this meeting of the coalition of the willing, here this morning. Volodymyr, you have our support in the fight that you have, you have our support in the fight for peace, as we go forward. UKprime ministerKeir Starmersaid “one country started this illegal conflict” and “only one country stands in the way of resolving it peacefully” during a meeting of members of the “coalition of the willing” aimed at end theRussianinvasion ofUkraine, reports the PA news agency. Speaking fromKyiv, Starmer said: It is an important moment because, as Volodymyr [Zelenskyy] has just said, there is this ceasefire-for-30-days proposal that is very clearly now on the table. Volodymyr, I think you first – with courage – put forward this proposal probably two months ago now, as the way forward? Emmanuel [Macron] and I have been discussing it intensively, including this week, and pushing the case of 30 days. Other allies in Europe have joined that, and of course the US position is now absolutely clear. So we have unity in relation to the proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire. That is a really important moment of this conflict that we should focus on in this meeting of the coalition of the willing, and remind ourselves that only one country started this illegal conflict, and that was Russia and Putin, and only one country stands in the way of resolving it peacefully, and that is Russia and Putin. British prime minister Keir Starmer said in a meeting in the Ukrainian capital with European leaders that the so-called “coalition of the willing” shows “the strength of our unity”. Sitting alongside Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, French president Emmanuel Macron, German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk, Starmer said: “It’s really good that we are hosting this meeting – the coalition of the willing – from Kyiv. “It is a very important symbolic meeting showing the strength of our unity. “And it’s timely because this awful conflict has been going on now for over three years, and this week we have been celebrating 80 years since the end of the second world war, VE Day has been celebrated across Europe. “What the war was about were the values of freedom and democracy and the right of countries to make their own decisions, their sovereign right to do so. “Those are the same values that we are addressing here today, and so it is timely, it is important and I pay tribute to the courage and resilience of the Ukrainians that have fought this conflict for three long years.” European leaders on a joint visit Kyiv have issued an ultimatum to Vladimir Putin: sign up to an unconditional ceasefire by Monday, or face increased sanctions and weapons transfers toUkraine. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Poland, together with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, made a joint phone call to Donald Trump prior to making the announcement. “All of us here, together with the US, are calling Putin out. If he’s serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it now,” said prime minister Keir Starmer at a joint press conference of the five leaders in Kyiv. Starmer said the leaders were demanding “an unconditional ceasefire, rejecting Putin’s conditions, and [are] clear that if he turns his back on peace, we will respond, working with president Trump, with all our partners, we will ramp up sanctions, and increase our military aid for Ukraine’s defence to pressureRussiaback to the table”. Starmer, Emmanuel Macron and Friedrich Merz arrived in the Ukrainian capital on the same train on Saturday morning, while Donald Tusk travelled on a separate train. The leaders met with Zelenskyy for talks in central Kyiv. It is Macron’s first visit to Kyiv since summer 2022, and the first visit for Merz as chancellor for Germany, having only taken office this week. “All five leaders had a fruitful call with @POTUS focused on peace efforts,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha,wroteon X, adding a picture of the five men gathered around a mobile phone on speaker mode. Sybiha added: “Ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land, air, and at sea for at least 30 days starting already on Monday. If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations.” Trump and the US administration have said a 30-day ceasefire could be the first step on the way to a sustainable peace deal. Ukraine has said it is ready to implement such a ceasefire but Russia has so far refused, saying it would only do so if all western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were halted. In an early sign that Russia may not be receptive to the latest ultimatum, the hawkish former president, Dmitry Medvedev,wroteon X: “Macron, Merz, Starmer, and Tusk were supposed to discuss peace in Kiev (sic). Instead, they are blurting out threats against Russia … You think that’s smart, eh? Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses.” French president Emmanuel Macron warned on Saturday that Russia would face “massive” coordinated European and US sanctions if it broke a 30-day ceasefire inUkraineproposed by Kyiv’s western allies. “In the event of a violation of this ceasefire, we have agreed that massive sanctions will be prepared and coordinated between Europeans and Americans,” Macron told a press conference in Kyiv. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters at the news conference after their talks that he and the visiting leaders “agreed on Monday, 12 May there must start an unconditional ceasefire”. He added that it should cover air, sea and land, and said that if Moscow refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors, Reuters reported. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying on Friday thatRussiasupported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of “nuances”. In remarks to ABC that were aired on Saturday, Peskov suggested that western military assistance forUkrainewould have to stop in order for a temporary ceasefire to happen. “Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine,” he said. Ukraine and European leaders agreed on Saturday to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire from 12 May with the backing of US president Donald Trump, threatening president Vladimir Putin with new “massive” sanctions if he failed to comply. The announcement was made by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Ukraine after a meeting in Kyiv, during which they held a phone call with Trump. The symbolic show ofEuropeanunity came a day afterRussianpresidentVladimir Putinstruck a defiant tone at aMoscowparade marking 80 years since victory in the second world war, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). In an interview with theUSnews channel ABC on Saturday, theKremlinspokesperson,Dmitry Peskov, said arms deliveries fromUkraine’s allies would have to stop before Russia would agree to a ceasefire. A truce would otherwise be an “advantage for Ukraine“ at a time when “Russian troops are advancing … in quite a confident way” on the front, Peskov said, adding that Ukraine was “not ready for immediate negotiations”. Putin ordered a unilateral three-day truce from Thursday through Saturday. But a Ukrainian army brigade operating in the east told AFP earlier the intensity of fighting had remained “pretty much the same”. Europe and Ukraine argue more pressure is needed on Russia to respond. After meetingDonald TuskinFranceon Friday,Emmanuel Macroncalled for the speedy drafting of aUS-Europe planfor the 30-day truce that would be backed by “massive economic sanctions” if one side “betrays it”.",

    "title": "Britons increasingly swapping Med’s busy hotspots for ‘destination dupes’",
    "article_text": "It will take more than a TikTok trend to break Britons’ love affair with Mediterranean beaches. But latest figures show travellers are increasingly swapping Málaga forNorth Macedoniaand Benidorm for the Balkans as part of a social media craze for “destination dupes”. Flights from the UK toBosnia and Herzegovinasoared by 284% in 2024 compared with the previous year, while trips to Montenegro increased by 164%. Getaways to Albania – billed by some as “the new Croatia” – rose by 61%, according to an analysis of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) data. Experts say the appetite for lesser-known destinations is being driven by influencers promoting holiday “dupes” – locations that offer the same Insta-friendly scenery for a smaller budget. The travel blogger Tara Tadlock, who has nearly 15,000 followers on Instagram, said the trend was inspired by a post-Covid burst of adventure as well as the cost of living crisis, as holidaymakers hunt for bargains. “In the summer months accommodation prices spike … some restaurants will change their menus and charge extra,” she said. “The cost of living is a huge driver. I also think people are looking to get away from the crowds because there’s so many places now that are so congested with tourists.” The CAA data, analysed by Manchester Airports Group, also revealed that the number of flights to Azerbaijan had more than doubled between 2023 and 2024. Four African countries – Tunisia, Rwanda, Morocco and Ghana – also made the top 10 largest increases in flights from the UK over the same period. OnTikTok, influencers with tens of thousands of followers promote trips to the slopes of Bansko, Bulgaria, instead of the costly French Alps, or a city break in the capital of Podgorica over crowded Athens and Budapest. The term “destination dupes” was coined by the travel firm Expedia in 2023. Experts spotted that influencers were sharing “duplicate destinations” in a similar way to imitations of designer clothing, another TikTok trend. It is not just gen Z travellers broadening their horizons, however. The CAA figures showed that millennials and their parents made up the bulk of the passengers heading to the Balkans. Under-25s comprised one in five of those arriving in Albania and 13% of those flying toMontenegro. The increased demand for lesser-known destinations is also explained by Covid-19, which experts believe changed how many people travel. While visits to tourist hotspots have bounced back – in part driven by an urge to tick off bucket list locations – other holidaymakers are avoiding the crowds. Research by Expedia found that 76% of boomers – born between 1946 and 1964 – prioritise quieter places compared with gen Z (40%). However, the younger generation tend to be much more inspired by online influencers (41% v 5%) in the search for adventures. Tadlock said she expected Albania to become “the new Croatia” as it has the stunning scenery without Croatia’s overtourism problem. “The experience I think is a little dampened when you have to wait in line for two hours,” she said. “I do also think that consumers are thinking more about sustainability and the effects of tourism or like just the impact of travel in general.” Andrew Macmillan, the chief strategy officer at Manchester Airports Group, which also operates London Stansted and East Midlands airports, said social media was increasingly driving the flights it offers. “We have undoubtedly seen the true power of social media when it comes to influencing where people choose to travel to,” he said. “Since 2019, the rise in popularity of platforms like TikTok has resulted in hidden gem destinations becoming not so hidden, which in turn has driven a surge in trips to these places.” Yet while some Britons were ready to roam, old habits die hard. Tenerife remained the most popular holiday destination from the UK in 2024, with 3 million passengers, followed by Málaga, Mallorca and Alicante. Bosnia and Herzegovina, in comparison, had 80,000 visits after an almost threefold increase, while Albania received just under a million passengers and Montenegro had more than 220,000. ByMary Novakovich If British tourists are bypassing Benidorm in favour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they’re evidently in search of something well beyond the average beach holiday. For a start, Bosnia’s 12-mile sliver of the Adriatic coast at Neum – rather like that of Benidorm – is a concrete strip of sprawling resort hotels and crowded pebbly beaches. But you don’t come to Bosnia for the beaches – why would you when you have the jaw-dropping beauty of the Dinaric Alps, towering waterfalls, dramatic river canyons and some of Europe’s most captivating cities? Rather than join the crowds in Neum, head inland about 25 miles to the sereneHutovo Blatonature reserve, one of the most important wetlands in south-eastern Europe. Take a boat ride through the waterways and marshes of the reserve, keeping an eye out for the broad range of birdlife – herons, shrikes, cormorants, buntings, terns – before cooling off with a swim in Svitavsko Lake. From here, it’s about a 40-minute drive to one of the Herzegovina region’s greatest natural wonders,Kravicawaterfalls, whose cascades thunder through rich greenery into the River Trebižat. Swim near the foot of the waterfall, or check out other river swimming spots including the clear waters of Božjak. If you haven’t brought a picnic, the waterside restaurants serving grilled meat and fish will keep you well fed at ridiculously affordable prices. This sets the stage for the sheer drama ofUnanationalpark, the largest in Bosnia, and most of which runs alongside the natural border formed by the River Una with Croatia. The Una has an almost magical hold on the hearts of people on both sides of the border, and over the course of 76 sq miles it dips and falls and crashes through thickly wooded slopes and fertile green plains. One of the park’s stars isŠtrbački Buk, a towering waterfall where fearless tour guides on white-water rafting trips jump from the top and survive to tell the tale. There’s more to come further south at Martin Brod, the biggest collection of waterfalls in the park. Bosnia’s cities are just as compelling.Sarajevo, the capital, is endlessly fascinating, especially when you stand on pedestrianised Ferhadija street, with 19th-century Habsburg architecture to your left and the 16th-century Ottoman quarter to your right. Squeezed into this old Turkish Baščaršija quarter are cobbled lanes of coppersmiths, silversmiths, restaurants, courtyard gardens, an old caravanserai and Bosnia’s largest mosque, Gazi Husrev-beg. As the city marks 30 years since the end of the 1992-95 war, it’s an apt time to visit the Museum of Crimes Against Humanity and Genocide and the Siege of Sarajevo Museum. Herzegovina’s chief city,Mostar, is a popular – often too popular – destination for day-trippers from Dubrovnik. But it’s hard to resist the magnificence of its reconstructed 16th-century Ottoman bridge, Stari Most, the emblem of the city. Once the crowds are gone, you can amble through the old Ottoman quarter at a more relaxed pace. From here it’s less than a half-hour drive to the extraordinary sight of the 16th-century Sufi lodgeBlagaj Tekke, which was ingeniously built into a limestone gorge by the source of the River Buna. You won’t find that in Benidorm.",

    "title": "Slovenia to vote in referendum on artist pension that has fostered culture war",
    "article_text": "Slovenia’s populist opposition has mounted a campaign against “degenerate” artists as it seeks to topple government plans for special pension top-ups for award-winning artists in a referendum on Sunday. Voters in the central European country will cast their verdict on a government bill that details the conditions and terms under which certain artists can claim an allowance to be added to their pensions. For the referendum law to be rejected, at least one-fifth of all eligible voters among Slovenia’s population of 2.12 million must vote “no”. The number of “no” votes must also represent more than half of all votes cast. The bill, which passed parliament in January, has been prepared by the culture ministry that is held by the leader of the eco-socialist Left party, Asta Vrečko. The government – comprised of a coalition of the Freedom Movement, Social Democrats and Left parties – says it is enacting an overdue reform of special pension provisions for persons of merit that dates back to 1974, when Slovenia was one of the republics of Yugoslavia, by tying them to stricter criteria rather than leaving them at the mercy of the personal tastes of whichever politician holds the culture ministry. Leading in the polls a year before national elections, however, the conservative Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS) has found in the relatively technical tweak to a 50-year-old law a rich seam for a culture war against perceived cultural elites. The referendum was initiated by the party, which is led by Janez Janša, a former prime minister. Janša, an admirer of Donald Trump who has led the SDS since 1993,said in Marchthat classical art was “being replaced by all sorts of degenerate, unhinged models that claim to be ‘modern’” – his choice of the adjectiveizrojenechoing the term used by the German Nazi party to denounce modern art,entarteteor “degenerate”. Posters and billboards hung across Slovenian towns across the country since February have featured an image of the Slovenian artist Maja Smrekar breastfeeding a dog, alongside the slogan: “Change for the people, prestige for the elite.” Smrekar, 47, said the image is being used without her permission and wrenches out of context a single picture from a larger project, called K-9 Topology,which explores the bonds between humans and canines. “Ever since the four weeks of signature collection for the referendum, I have received numerous threats and highly offensive messages via various communication channels,” she told the Guardian. “When politics decides what is art and what isn’t, that’s when democracy breaks down.” Over the course of a four-month residency at Berlin’s Freies Museum in 2015-2016, the Brežice-born artist underwent psycho-endocrinological training to induce lactation and breastfed a sheepdog puppy, as “a form of interspecies solidarity and care”. In 2017, Smrekar’s K-9 Topology won the Golden Nica trophy at Austria’s Prix Ars Electronica, one of the world’s oldest media art competitions, followed by Slovenia’s prestigious Prešeren Foundation award in 2018. Under the new criteria proposed by the government, the combination of these awards would entitle Smrekar to a pension top-up equalling 50% of the difference between her existing pension and the highest one calculated from the pension base for 40 years of service. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion Janša’s SDS, which has governed Slovenia for almost nine of the last 20 years andhanded out seven “special pensions” for cultural merit in 2022, says the proposed new rules would lead to an increasing share of public funds being allocated to “privileged” individuals, including those “who have contributed very little, if anything, to the pension fund”. An SDS spokesperson said: “Meanwhile, more than half of all pensioners live below the poverty line.” The divisive referendum campaign is taking place against the backdrop of a broader pension reform embarked on by the government of Robert Golob, the prime minister,at the urging of the European Commission, which will lead to a rise in the retirement age from 60 years to 62 for those who have worked 40 years. The government says that while its bill would initially lead to a surge of special pensions for artists on a waiting list, the overall burden on taxpayers would eventually stabilise at a lower cost than under the old law. Of the 83 artists receiving special pensions for artists in Slovenia, 33 are next-of-kin who inherited it from the original recipient under the rules of original 1974 law. The revised bill would scrap the inheritance rule. Slovenia’s national electoral commission has calculated the cost of the referendum on the bill could amount to about €6.6m. “The referendum is being abused as an election campaign, and a very costly one at that”, Vrečko, the culture minister, told the Guardian. Golob – who was a newcomer at the 2022 elections – has urged the voters to boycott the vote, earning stark rebukes from the opposition. At Slovenian elections in 2022, his Freedom Movementemerged as a surprise winner, bucking an electoral trend towards rightwing populist rule in central and eastern European states such as Hungary and Serbia.",

    "title": "UK Lawyers for Israel condemned over claim war may reduce obesity in Gaza",
    "article_text": "A UK-based advocacy group forIsraelhas been criticised for suggesting a reduction in obesity resulting from the war in Gaza may increase life expectancy there. The comments by UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI), which cameamid warnings of impending famine in Gaza, were condemned as “sickening” by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign (PSC). UKLFI’s patrons include the former supreme court judge John Dyson, the former Conservative leader Michael Howard andDavid Pannick KC, who has represented Boris Johnsonand the late queen. The remarks were made by Jonathan Turner, the chief executive of UKLFI, in response to a motion due to be debated at the Co-operative Group’s annual general meeting calling for the retailer to stop selling Israeli produce. Urging the Co-operative council to withdraw the motion, Turner criticised the fact that it refers to an estimated death toll of 186,000. In a letter to the Co-operative Group secretary, Turner wrote that it was “totally false and misleading” to cite the figure froma letter published by the Lancet last year, which was a projected figure including indirect casualties. He adds: “The [Lancet] letter also ignored factors that may increase average life expectancy inGaza, bearing in mind that one of the biggest health issues in Gaza prior to the current war was obesity.” The death toll since Israel began its assault on Gaza after the7 October 2023 attacksby Hamas on southern Israel stands at more than 52,000, according to the territory’s health authority. A separate study in the Lancetfoundlife expectancy in Gaza decreased by 34.9 years during the first 12 months of the war, about half (-46.3%) the prewar level of 75.5 years. Ben Jamal, the director of the PSC, said: “As children in the Gaza Strip face the growing risk of starvation, illness and death, the suggestion by the head of UK Lawyers for Israel that they might benefit from weight loss is utterly sickening. These repulsive comments illustrate exactly what it means to be ‘for Israel’ and how low its apologists are prepared to sink in their attempts to justify genocide in Gaza.” Chris Doyle, the director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding (Caabu), wrote on X that the comments represented “atrocious views”. He said: “How very kind of Israel to put 2.3 million Palestinians on an enforced diet to improve their obesity levels.” A complaint by UKLFI led Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London toremove a display of artwork by Palestinian childrenin 2023 after the group claimed that it made Jewish patients feel “vulnerable, harassed and victimised”. It has also threatened the UK government with legal action over its decision to suspend about30 licences for the export of arms to Israel. Turner said: “We first pointed out thatthe letter published in the Lanceton 20 July 2024, to which the motion evidently referred, did not claim that 186,000 Gazans had died in the current war. It did, however, claim – without foundation – that 186,000 Gaza would be likely to die eventually as a result of the war. “So we pointed out, secondly, that this claim was based on entirely unfounded speculation, which also ignored factors that might result in lengthening the lives of Gazans, given the public health situation existing in Gaza prior to the war, including the extent of obesity. These factors include the possible reduction in the availability of confectionery and cigarettes. “In the context in which they were made, our statements were accurate and objective.”",

    "title": "Bangladeshi interim cabinet bans all ousted Awami League party activities",
    "article_text": "The interim government in Bangladesh has banned all activities of the former ruling Awami League party headed by former influential prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who wasousted last year in a mass uprising. Asif Nazrul, the country’s law affairs adviser, said on Saturday the interim cabinet headed by the Nobel peace prize laureate Muhammad Yunus decided to ban the party’s activities online and elsewhere under the country’s Anti-Terrorism Act. The ban would stay in place until a special tribunal completes a trial of the party and its leaders over the deaths of hundreds of students and other protesters during an anti-government uprising in July and August last year. “This decision is aimed at ensuring national security and sovereignty, protection of activists of the July movement, and plaintiffs and witnesses involved in the tribunal proceedings,” Nazrul told reporters after a special cabinet meeting. Nazrul said the meeting on Saturday also expanded scope for trying any political parties involving charges of killing during the anti-Hasina protest being handled by the international crimes tribunal. He said a government notification regarding the ban would be published soon with details. Hasina and many of her senior party colleagues have been accused of murder in many cases after her ouster last year. She has been in exile in India since 5 August as her official residence was stormed by protesters soon after she left the country. The UNs human rights office said in a report in February that up to 1,400 people may have been killed during three weeks of anti-Hasina protest. Saturday night’s dramatic decision came after thousands of protesters, including supporters of a newly formed political party by students, took to the streets in Dhaka and issued an ultimatum to ban the Awami League party by Saturday night. The members of the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami party also prominently took part in the protest. There was no immediate reaction from Hasina or her party, but the chief of the Jatiya Nagorik or National Citizen party, Nahid Islam, who is also a student leader, applauded the Yunus-led government for its decision. The student-led uprising ended Hasina’s 15 years of rule, and three days after her fall Yunus took office as interim leader.",

    "article_text": "This liveblog is now closed. Read our full report on the ceasefire agreementhere Reuters is reporting Indian foreign secretary saying that Indian armed forces are responding to reported ceasefire violations. On Saturday night, just hours after a ceasefire deal was announced, Reuters reported secretary Vikram Misri saying: “Pakistan has violated the ceasefire agreed today,” adding: “We call onPakistanto halt the violation.” Misri also said that Indian armed forces have been given instructions to “strongly deal with violations along the border,” Reuters reports as witnesses in Jammu and Srinagar heard and saw blasts and projectiles across the sky. Here’s a look at the day’s key events: The Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, has addressed the nation, thanking countries including Saudi Arabia and China for their mediation efforts in reaching the ceasefire, and blamed India for spreading false information, destroying mosques and killing civilians acrossPakistan.Sharif also said: “We are a very responsible country and we have displayed this. We want peace. We are a peaceful nation… We have made this agreement of ceasefire and we have been very positive about it.” Sharif’s address came on Saturday night, just hours after a ceasefire deal was announced, Reuters had reported Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri saying: “Pakistan has violated the ceasefire agreed today,” adding: “We call onPakistanto halt the violation.”Misri also said that Indian armed forces have been given instructions to “strongly deal with violations along the border,” Reuters reports as witnesses in Jammu and Srinagar heard and saw blasts and projectiles across the sky. Amid reports of renewed skirmishes between India andPakistanon Saturday night, UK prime minister Keir Starmer said that the ceasefire between the two countries must be “lasting.”He added that the UK has been “engaged” in the ceasefire talks for “some days,” the BBCreports. The US president, Donald Trump, announced the ceasefire agreementbetween India and Pakistan after deadly attacks between the nuclear-armed rivals. The ceasefire came after a “a long night of talks mediated by the United States”, Trump said. The announcement, confirmed by both countries, came after India and Pakistan fired volleys of missiles across their borders on Saturdayas the escalated their worst fighting in nearly three decades. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the agreement came after extensive negotiationsby him and the US vice-president, JD Vance, with the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers, Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, and other top officials.Both sides had earlier said they would be willing to de-escalate the conflict if the other side was willing to do the same. Earlier on Saturday, Pakistan military officials told state-run media it had launched a retaliatory operation,targeting several bases including a missile storage site in northern India.Officials said the attack was called Operation Bunyan Ul Marsoos, an Arabic phrase meaning “wall of lead”. Pakistan’s offensive came shortly after it said India had fired missiles from fighter jets at three airbases earlier on Saturday,including one close to the capital, Islamabad. Pakistan said its air defences had intercepted most of them. Pakistan has saidit “remains committed” to the trucewith India following Indian claims of ceasefire violations,AFP reports. On Saturday night, just hours after a ceasefire deal was announced, Reuters reported Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri saying: Pakistan has violated the ceasefire agreed today. We call on Pakistan to halt the violation. The Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, later said: We are a very responsible country and we have displayed this. We want peace. We are a peaceful nation … We have made this agreement of ceasefire and we have been very positive about it. Residents in Jammu reported drone attacks and projectiles in the sky just hours after a ceasefire was announced. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said Saturday that Beijing supported India and Pakistan’s efforts to reach a ceasefire, and remains “willing to continue playing a constructive role” in the process, state news agency Xinhua reported. Agence France-Presse reports: Wang made the comment during telephone talks with Pakistan Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, adding that Beijing remained concerned about any escalation in the conflict, given that it shares borders with both countries. In a separate call with India’s National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, Wang said he hoped both sides would “remain calm and restrained... and avoid escalating the situation,” after reported violations of the ceasefire agreement reached Saturday. “China supports and expects India and Pakistan to achieve a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire through consultation,” Xinhia quoted Wang as saying to Doval. ThePakistani prime minister,Shehbaz Sharif, has addressed the nation, thanking countries including Saudi Arabia and China for their mediation efforts in reaching the ceasefire, and blamed India for spreading false information, destroying mosques and killing civilians acrossPakistan. Sharif also said: We are a very responsible country and we have displayed this. We want peace. We are a peaceful nation… We have made this agreement of ceasefire and we have been very positive about it. He added that the ceasefire agreement was made “for the benefit of everybody.” He went on to say: We will not be sitting in peace until Pakistan gets its lost integrity back and by God’s grace that time is not far away. Pakistan’s information minister Attaullah Tarar denied Indian claims thatPakistanhad violated the ceasefire, he said in an interview with Geo News. Tarar said all such reports by the Indian media are baseless. “Pakistan cannot do any ceasefire violation, nor has it thought about this. It is a moment of celebration and the Pakistani nation is celebrating their victory today,” said Tarar. Here are some images coming through the newswires: Reuters is reporting Indian foreign secretary saying that Indian armed forces are responding to reported ceasefire violations. On Saturday night, just hours after a ceasefire deal was announced, Reuters reported secretary Vikram Misri saying: “Pakistan has violated the ceasefire agreed today,” adding: “We call onPakistanto halt the violation.” Misri also said that Indian armed forces have been given instructions to “strongly deal with violations along the border,” Reuters reports as witnesses in Jammu and Srinagar heard and saw blasts and projectiles across the sky.

Earlier today, Pakistani foreign minister Ishaq Darsaidthat UK foreign secretary David Lammy “played a key role in this process,” adding that several countries were involved in the ceasefire process, “most notably the United Kingdom.” Pakistan’s Kashmir education minister said skirmishes are continuing along the de-facto border with India, Reuters reports. Earlier, residents in Jammu reported drone attacks as well as projectiles in the sky, just hours after a ceasefire was announced. Military officials from India andPakistanhave yet to respond to the blasts heard above Srinagar and Jammu on Saturday night. Meanwhile, Donald Trump took to social media to write: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.” Similarly, Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the UN secretary-general said: “The secretary-general welcomes the ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan as a positive step toward ending current hostilities and easing tensions. He hopes the agreement will contribute to lasting peace and foster an environment conducive to addressing broader, longstanding issues between the two countries.”",

    "title": "‘We share a history and the future’: diaspora communities in UK decry Kashmir conflict",
    "article_text": "People around the world held their breath this week as India andPakistanappeared to edge closer and closer towards war. For diaspora communities with family in the region, especially inKashmirand along the border between the two countries, recent days in particular have been filled with fear and anxiety. On Saturday, a US-mediated ceasefire offered some reprieve, though the news was undercut bycross-border shelling and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmirhours after it was announced. While the longevity of the ceasefire remains in doubt, the initial news provided some relief for members of the UK’s south Asian community, who had gathered in Parliament Square in central London to call for de-escalation. “We cried a little, it was absolute joy,” said Raman, 26. “I come fromIndiaand I’m pretty close to the border. It was a constant worry about what was going to happen.” “I’ve haven’t sleep for three nights. We are constantly checking our phones. Today is the longest I’ve stayed without checking my phone in four days.” Nasreen Rehman, 74, was similarly relieved by the announcement. “Thank goodness, we’ve averted something which could have been catastrophic but already a lot of lives have been lost.” After 26 people were killed inan attack at a popular local tourist destination in Kashmir, India paused the vital Indus waters treaty which governs the distribution and use of waters from the Indus River between the two countries. Rehman is concerned about the suspension of this longstanding agreement. “At the end of the day, we are human beings. We share a history and we share the future. Now we have threats of stopping water? What does that mean?” While a ceasefire pulls both nations back from the brink of all-out war, there are still concerns about how robust it will be. “How many times in the past year have we heard the word ceasefire? We’ve heard that far too many times in the context of Israel-Palestine and it has meant nothing,” said Rajiv Sinah, 27. “Our demonstration, which was called a few days ago, is no less relevant today despite the news of a supposed ceasefire because now we need to advocate for a way forward. “The people of India, the people of Pakistan and the people of Kashmir want nothing more than peace and to be able to live their own lives and instead they are losing their lives, their livelihoods, their families at the behest of governments that do not represent their people,” Sinah added. Tarun Gidwani, 36, is similarly apprehensive. “It was a huge relief but even though there’s a ceasefire, there isn’t the de-escalation. Tensions are still quite high and there’s no real roadmap to stability, especially in Kashmir region.” Before the announcement of the ceasefire, he described feeling “really worried”. “It’s two nuclear powers engaged in aerial attack in the most densely populated region on the planet. Back home in India, there were mock drills in schools and offices. It was a tense atmosphere.” Shakuntala Banaji is hopeful that the ceasefire might hold. “I think that the national interests of both India and Pakistan lie in sustaining this ceasefire,” she said. She called on government, “particularly Labour and the prime minister, to stop playing division politics between Hindus and Muslims and between people who come from India and Pakistan by favouring one country over the other”. This week, on the same daya trade-deal described as “landmark” by Keir Starmer was announced between the UK and India, the Home Office announcedrestrictions on Pakistani nationals applying for work or study visas. Last year, Starmer caused anger after singling out the Bangladeshi community in a debate hosted by the Sun about immigration, saying: “At the moment people coming from countries like Bangladesh are not being removed.” Banaji said: “They need to think very carefully about emboldening a nuclear power when they have no support here in the diaspora for that kind of politics.” Summing up the mood of many who attended the demonstration, she said: “Our shared humanity across the India-Pakistan border and in Kashmir should trump all the other considerations of race and religion in the region. If we are to move forward we would have to move forward together.”",

    "title": "India and Pakistan agree Kashmir ceasefire but accuse each other of breaches",
    "article_text": "India andPakistanhave agreed to a US-mediated ceasefire with immediate effect, though its longevity was thrown into question after reports of cross-border shelling and explosions in Indian-administered Kashmir just hours after it was announced. The ceasefire – which was hoped to end days of escalating clashes between the two nuclear-armed countries–was first declared by the US president,Donald Trump, on Saturday afternoon, after 48 hours of diplomacy between India and Pakistan, apparently brokered by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and vice-president, JD Vance. Trump, in a post on his Truth Social platform, said: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce thatIndiaand Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” The ceasefire was later confirmed in a post on X by the Pakistani deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, who said the ceasefire would come in “with immediate effect”. The Indian foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, said the heads of military operations from both countries had spoken on Saturday afternoon. “It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea. Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.” The top military officials would speak again on 12 May, Misri added. However, the agreement was thrown into question after cross-border shelling restarted between the Indian and Pakistan armies on Saturday night. Srinagar, the main city in Indian-administeredKashmir, was also rocked by heavy explosions from projectiles that soared across the border. On Saturday night, Misri said India’s armed forces had been given instructions to “deal strongly” with the violations. An Indian government source told AFP that Pakistan had violated the ceasefire. A senior Pakistani security source said it was India that had started the ceasefire violations. The Pakistani foreign ministry said in the early hours of Sunday that it “remains committed to faithful implementation” of the ceasefire it has agreed to with India. Accusing India of committing its own violations, the Pakistani foreign ministry said its forces were “handling the situation with responsibility and restraint”. It continued: “We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. The troops on ground should also exercise restraint.” Rubio said the ceasefire agreement had come after extensive negotiations by him and Vance with the Indian and Pakistani prime ministers,Narendra Modiand Shehbaz Sharif, and other top officials. “I am pleased to announce the governments of India and Pakistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site,” Rubio said on X. “We commend prime ministers Modi and Sharif on their wisdom, prudence, and statesmanship in choosing the path of peace,” he added. News of the ceasefire was greeted with celebrations across India and Pakistan, particularly in Kashmir, the disputed region divided between the two countries that had been at the forefront of hostilities, with dozens killed in shelling over the border – known as the Line of Control (LoC) – in the past week. In Uri, near the border in Indian-administered Kashmir, one of the worst-hit towns in the recent cross-border violence, Tanveer Chalko, 30, described scenes of jubilation. “When news of the ceasefire broke, displaced families in camps began dancing with joy,” he said. “This is a great step towards peace and the welfare of the people. As a resident of a frontier area, I cannot put into words what this announcement means for us. Now everyone is preparing to return home.” But Lal Din, 55, a resident of Poonch, a border town in Indian-administered Kashmir where many were killed and injured in this week’s violence along the LoC, said the news of the ceasefire was bittersweet. His home was destroyed in cross-border shelling and two of his relatives were killed. “We’ve been here before – temporary ceasefires brokered by global powers. But until India and Pakistan seriously settle their disputes, we must brace for even greater conflicts,” he said. However, those who gathered in the streets to celebrate were then driven indoors as explosions began to boom out over parts of Indian-Kashmir on Saturday night. Historically, the US has played an important role as a mediator between India and Pakistan when hostilities have flared up. The Trump administration’s proactive role in brokering peace was, however, a notable reversal ofVance’s position 48 hours earlier, when he said the US would not intervene in the India-Pakistan conflict as it was “none of our business”. The ceasefire appeared to give both sides the opportunity to walk away claiming victory. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” said India’s foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. In Pakistan it was met with a chorus of approval. “Congratulations to the civil and military leadership for emerging out of the war with dignity, professionalism and national resolve unequivocally intact,” said the Pakistani senator Sherry Rehman. The ceasefire came after India and Pakistan accused each other of cross-border missile strikes against significant military targets on Saturday, with many fearful it would escalate into all-out war. India and Pakistan have fought four wars, most recently in 1999. The fighting this week was first inflamed on Wednesday afterIndian missiles struck nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people. India has said those strikes were in response to an attack in Indian-administered Kashmir late last month, in whichmilitants killed 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which it blamed on Pakistani-backed extremists. The situation escalated further after India accused Pakistan of two consecutive nights of drone attacks. India claimed to have intercepted more than 400 drones targeting cities, military bases and places of worship across the north of the country on Thursday. In retaliation, India said it had launched four drone strikes on Pakistan, directly targeting military defence infrastructure. By Saturday morning, India had accused Pakistan of launching strikes on dozens of airbases and military headquarters across north India, using long-range weapons, drones and fighter aircraft. The accusations came a few hours after Pakistan said India had fired six surface-to-air missiles targeting three of Pakistan’s most important military bases early on Saturday morning.Both accused the other of firing cross-border missiles first.

    "title": "If India and Pakistan’s ceasefire holds, the coming weeks will see a new battle: of narratives",
    "article_text": "Just over 26 years ago, thousands of Pakistani soldiers quietly made their way on to high, rocky ridges on the Indian side of the de facto border that divides the former princely state of Kashmir. The war that this rash operation triggered lasted much of the summer of 1999. Reporting onthe conflictwas a bizarre experience. In high mountain valleys, at altitudes more suited to mountaineers than soldiers, howitzers hurled massive shells across icy, rocky peaks and infantry readied for bayonet assaults. A Pakistani artillery officer read memoirs of English cricket stars and the Qur’an in his bunker. As spent shrapnel and rock splinters thrown up by incoming Indian shells rattled against the walls of the canvas mess tent, his commander spoke of Pakistan’s “historic national and religious duty” to free Kashmir, partitioned 50 years before, and waited for servants to bring dessert. The war of 1999 was the fourth between Pakistan and India and the third to have been triggered by Kashmir. If, over the decades, technology and regional politics have evolved dramatically, recent days have made clear that the animosity generated by the dispute over the region, said to be the most beautiful in south Asia, has not. Even if theceasefire agreed on Saturdayhas silenced the guns for now, there is little doubt that they will speak again. For Pakistan, Kashmir’s Muslim majority means the region’s division is not just a historic injustice but an injury to the country’s original founding purpose as a home for the subcontinent’s Muslims. Just after the news of the ceasefire broke, Ishaq Dar, Pakistan’s foreign minister,posted on Xthat “Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region” but carefully stressed that it had done so “without compromising on its … territorial integrity!” Kashmir means much more to India than a stunning backdrop for Bollywood movies. Many Indians would see losing the region, with its powerful historical and cultural significance, as an amputation of a vital part of their vast and diverse nation. India’s first post-independence leaders, secular and often left-leaning, made a point of fighting forKashmir. The last weeks have shown that the country’s current leaders, rightwing religious nationalists, will do so too. If this ceasefire holds, then coming weeks will see a new battle: of narratives. India has claimed thatLashkar-e-Taiba, the extremist group thatcarried out the massacrethree weeks ago of 25 tourists and a guide in Indian-controlled Kashmir that started the conflict, is merely a proxy for Islamabad. Pakistan has denied this. Maintaining a state of conflict in Kashmir, undermining Delhi’s control there and internationalising the conflict have been strategic goals of Pakistan’s hugely powerful military for decades. Islamic militant groups, some based in Kashmir, others recruited and based elsewhere, have been a key tool to achieve this. That no one in Pakistan’s security establishment had any prior idea of April’s attack seems implausible. Pakistani officials seek to highlight underlying causes of violence: ongoing repression in Kashmir, the revocation by Delhiof the region’s autonomous statusin 2019 and multiple other grievances. Back in 1999, like now, rhetoric from leaders in Delhi and Islamabad was sufficiently heated to prompt genuine international worries about an all-out war between the two nuclear-armed powers. Then, again like now, the sheer horror of what that might entail, even if the conflict remained conventional, sobered decision-makers on both sides. Twenty years ago, a combination of Indian military success and US pressure brought about a shaky peace that survived a round of skirmishes a decade later until being broken again. In this new confrontation too, Washington’s influence appears to have been key in bringing about de-escalation. This will not please Russia and China, both manoeuvring for greater influence in the region, even if the reported involvement of Turkey and Saudi Arabia is a useful reminder that the unipolar days of the late 1990s are long gone. Casualties this time around have been mercifully low, and economic damage limited. The latter rather than the former may have weighed most heavily in the decision to call a halt to hostilities. Neither nation can afford the kind of destruction and disruption that moving to the next level of war might have entailed. There are ties that bind, as well as much that divides. Observers noted that though Delhi effectively suspendeda crucial treaty governing water access, it was not definitively broken. As in previous conflicts, that of 1999 included, leaders in both India and Pakistan have stepped back from the brink, showing what Trump described in his inimitable way on Saturday as “Common Sense and Great Intelligence”. All know how much they have to lose.",

    "title": "Rubio offers US help to secure peace in escalating India-Pakistan conflict",
    "article_text": "US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has offered US assistance in starting “constructive talks” to end the conflict between India and Pakistan, as thetwo states traded heavy missile fire on Saturday, prompting concerns over wider military escalation. Rubio has been engaged in back-and-forth diplomacy between the two countries in recent days, calling for de-escalation as India andPakistanhave been engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday. The US’s top diplomat “continued to urge both parties to find ways to de-escalate and offered US assistance in starting constructive talks to avoid future conflicts,” state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement on Saturday. Fighting between India and Pakistan started on Wednesday after Indian missiles hit nine sites in Pakistan, killing 31 people and triggering a cycle of tit-for-tat attacks between the two countries. India said Wednesday’s missile strikes were in retaliation for an attack in Indian-administeredKashmirin late April, which saw militants kill 25 Hindu tourists and a guide, which India blamed on Pakistan. Clashes peaked on Saturday, as both countries launched missile strikes deep in each other’s territories, using long-range weapons, drone swarms and fighter jets. Both Indian and Pakistani officials have said that they did not wish to see further escalation. At a press briefing on Saturday, Indian military officers said: “Indian armed forces reiterated their commitment to non-escalation, provided the Pakistan side reciprocates.” Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, said while they had no “issue to de-escalate,” that he did not trust India’s statements. There has been a flurry of international diplomacy to head off conflict, as despite both India and Pakistan stating that they do not want escalation, there has been a steady uptick in intensity during the week of clashes. The deepening hostilities have raised widespread international concern, with the two nuclear powers closer to war than they have been in decades. US efforts to try to mediate between India and Pakistan have been spearheaded by Rubio, who has been in regular contact with both Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, since the Kashmir attack. India has been a key US ally in the region in recent years, seen as a counter to China’s rising influence – a top policy concern of the Trump administration. The US, in turn, is India’s largest trading partner, and Reutersreportsthat it has offered preferential trading terms to the Americans in order to secure a stronger partnership with its ally. Nonetheless, the US had earlier seemed reluctant to get involved in the India-Pakistan row, with US president, Donald Trump, calling the tit-for-tat strikes “a shame” earlier in the week. The vice-president, JD Vance, said an India-Pakistan war would be “fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it”. Sign up toFirst Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The US currently does not have an ambassador in India nor Pakistan, as the Trump administration has yet to fill the vacancies. Other countries, such as China and Saudi Arabia, have stepped in to try to defuse the situation. China, which supplies much of Pakistan’s military hardware, also said that it would be willing to “play a constructive role” to find a solution to fighting. Pakistan’s defence minister said on Saturday that Saudi Arabia was playing a key role as interlocutor and that the Saudi foreign minister had sent a representative to Pakistan. UK foreign secretary, David Lammy, joined G7 ministers in calling for calm, with the G7 issuing a statement on Saturday urging “maximum restraint” from both India and Pakistan.“We call for immediate de-escalation and encourage both countries to engage in direct dialogue towards a peaceful outcome,” the statement read.",

    "title": "UK to time limit visas for roles below graduate level under new migration plan",
    "article_text": "Visas for skilled overseas workers will be time-limited for those not taking a graduate-level job, theHome Officehas announced. The measure comes as part of a preview of wider plans being unveiled this week that are designed to reduce net migration to the UK. Under the proposals, alreadyrevealed in partby the Guardian, the standard skilled visa threshold will only apply to jobs gauged at six on the regulated qualifications framework (RQF), which is equivalent to a degree, rather than the current three, roughly the standard of A-level. According to details set out by the Home Office, for anyone filling a job deemed as below RQF 6, they will only be allowed into the country for a limited period, and if there is “strong evidence of shortages which are critical to the industrial strategy”. Additionally, for this to happen, employers in the sector bringing in the overseas staff must show they have plans to increase domestic recruitment and skills. Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, hailed the plan as “decisive action to restore control and order to the immigration system, raise domestic training and skills, and bring down net migration while promoting economic growth”. On Monday, she will present a government white paper – a document which sets out plans for future legislation – intended to notably curb net migration, as ministers try to respond to the local election success of Reform UK, with its vehement anti-migration message. While skilled visa numbers have already significantly reduced in the last few years, further hurdles to overseas recruitment could cause problems for industries such as care and hospitality, with one care organisation warning that without coherent government action to attract UK staff, more care providers could go out of business. The other policy set out seeks to address this in part, with the establishment of what is called the Labour Market Evidence Group. Made up of officials from industry and skills bodies, as well as government and the Migration Advisory Council (MAC) quango, it will, the Home Office said, “inform understanding of where sectors are overly reliant on overseas labour and reverse underinvestment in domestic skills”. Cooper is under significant pressure to further reduce net migration, particularly with the rise of Reform. As well as winning control of 10 councils on 1 May, Nigel Farage’s party, which is promising an effective freeze on most migration, is topping most polls of national voter preference. Announcing the skilled visa changes, Cooper reiterated the government’s blame on previous Conservative administrations for, she said, having “replaced free movement [in the EU] with a free market experiment”.

This has undermined public confidence, distorted our labour market, and been really damaging for both our immigration system and our economy.” It remains to be seen how much of an impact the changes to skilled visas will make in absolute numbers. MACdata showsthat the number of skilled workers entering the UK for jobs with skill levels below RQF six had already dropped in the last few years, while the numbers with degree level skills have stayed constant at about 75,000 annually. Nadra Ahmed, executive chair of the National Care Association, said that while her group would have to examine the proposals in detail, she was worried about the potential “accidental consequences” for a sector where about 70,000 staff are from overseas, and which has an estimated 120,000 vacancies. “Making it even more difficult for the sector seems strange because the statistics are clear – at the moment we can’t attract the domestic workforce, because we haven’t sorted out fair pay for them,” she said. “And if this isn’t funded, then the gap in the social care sector economy will only grow. That will drive providers out of the sector, which will have a direct impact on the ability to help people who need support today.”",

    "title": "Danny Dyer says Harold Pinter’s death sent him into ‘spiral of madness’",
    "article_text": "The actor Danny Dyer said the death of his mentor, the Nobel prize-winning playwrightHarold Pinter, triggered a “spiral of madness” in his life. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Dyer reflected on how he had stayed at Pinter’s home while performing inhis play Celebration. The play opened at London’s Almeida theatre in 2000, before transferring to the Lincoln Center in New York. Dyer, 47, opened up about how during one performance he forgot his lines and suffered an anxiety attack, having been out the night before. Devastated at the thought of disappointing Pinter, he remembered the playwright’s kindness. “He put his arm around me,” he said, “and made me feel better about it.” Reflecting on his death in 2008, he added: “I hadn’t spoke to him in a while. I did go off the rails for many years and I found out by looking on the front of a newspaper. “Again, I’d been on a bender and I was coming home and I was going, I think I was going to buy cigarettes at the petrol garage, and I see it in the paper: ‘Pinter dead’. “This really sent me on a spiral of madness, really. The guilt of not being around him any more and just being lost, I was a bit of a lost soul, and again, angry at the world.” In April, Deadline reported that Dyer was developing an idea for a play about his relationship with Pinter, whom he referred to as his “mentor”. Dyer, who had his breakthrough in the 1999 film Human Traffic, also reflected on some of the documentaries he had made earlier in his career. In the 00s, the actor presented the TV series Danny Dyer’s Real Football Factories andDanny Dyer’s Deadliest Men. “I’d made a few films and I just wasn’t getting paid any money, and I was desperate to get on to the property ladder”, he said. “I was still living in a council estate at Custom House, living with my daughter [Dani] and [wife] Jo, and it’s like, well, I’m famous, but I’m still living on a council estate. “And so then my house became a bit like Stonehenge, my little flat, and people would just stand outside waiting for me.” He continued: “So I got offered to do a documentary with a real football veteran and I couldn’t believe the money they was offering me, I thought, ‘Oh, wow’,” he said. “Now I hated it, because I didn’t have a script, it was me on my own interviewing people, and interviewing dangerous people, by the way, but it got me on the property ladder.” Dyer’s episode ofDesert Island Discswill air at 10am on Sunday on BBC Radio 4.",

    "title": "Weight-loss jabs may be good for mental health, research shows",
    "article_text": "Weight loss jabs may be good for people’s mental health as well as helping curb their appetite, according to research. Astudyby scientists from the University of Bern in Switzerland has found that appetite-suppressing injections also improve mood, wellbeing and quality of life more than insulin and other antidiabetic drugs. Originally developed for diabetes patients, the medicines have transformed how obesity is treated and there is growingevidence of wider health benefits. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that about13-15% of working-age peoplein England and Wales have a long-term mental health or behavioural condition, with 2 million people in contact with NHS mental health services in December 2024. The research, presented at the European Congress onObesityin Malaga, Spain also found that weight loss jabs were safe and effective for adults taking antipsychotics or antidepressants for severe mental illness. The drugs belong to a group known as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which slow digestion and reduce appetite. The authors found that treatment with the medicines, which include semaglutide (sold as Ozempic or Wegovy) were not associated with worse mental health, nor greater risk of new mental illness or psychiatric admissions. Five studies found that they actually improved mental wellbeing and quality of life in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, major depressive disorder and bipolar effective disorder. For adults without mental illness, the weight loss injections had a greater beneficial effect on mental health than insulin and other antidiabetic drugs. Lead author Dr Sigrid Breit, from the University of Bern, said: “GLP-1 RAs [receptor agonists] may have antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects, potentially due to their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties, which can also help reduce neuroinflammation.” “These results are particularly important for people with severe mental disorders, who are three times more likely to be living with obesity than the general population.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Mental health experts welcomed the findings. Dr Ed Beveridge, the presidential lead for physical health at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “We know that, for a variety of reasons, many people with mental illness will have weight management issues. Therefore, where clinically assessed as suitable, it is crucial that they are regarded as a priority group for access to semaglutide medication, with appropriate monitoring arrangements in place following prescribing.” Rachel Hastings-Caplan, the clinical research policy manager at Rethink Mental Illness, said: “The physical health of people severely affected by mental illness is often overlooked, and they tragically die on average 20 years earlier than the rest of the population, often due to preventable conditions such as diabetes. “They face the difficult choice of taking medications such as antipsychotics which, while potentially reducing symptoms of mental illness and helping them manage in day-to-day life, can worsen physical health through their side effects. “While this study into weight loss jabs is important and promising, we believe such medications are only a short-term solution. We need to see more investment into finding treatments, whether that’s new medications or other forms of clinical support, which improve mental illness without troubling side-effects. “Weight loss injections should only be used on prescription and in conjunction with medical advice, and particular consideration must be given around people at risk of eating disorders.”",

    "title": "Police given second week to question four Iranian men in custody",
    "article_text": "Four Iranian men who were arrested on suspicion of preparing a terrorist attack in London can be detained and questioned in custody for another week, police said on Saturday. Five men were arrested last week, with armed police and in at least one instance special forces soldiers sent in to detain them, with reports suggesting the alleged target was the Israeli embassy in Kensington. The men arrested include a 29-year-old from Swindon in Wiltshire, a 46-year-old from west London, a 29-year-old from Stockport in Greater Manchester, a 40-year-old from Rochdale, and a 24-year-old from Manchester. The suspects, all Iranian nationals, were arrested on 3 May on suspicion of preparing a terrorist act, the Metropolitan police said. Four of the men, who were detained under the Terrorism Act, can be held until 17 May after warrants of further detention were granted on Saturday, the force added. The fifth suspect was detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and was released on conditional bail to a date in May. The Israeli embassy in west London is understood to have been the target of the alleged plot, according to The Times and other press outlets, but police have declined to share further details. Cmdr Dominic Murphy, head of the Met’s counter-terrorism command, said: “Our officers and staff continue to progress what is a significant and highly complex investigation. “We are working incredibly hard with public safety at the forefront of our ongoing efforts. “I would like to ask people to not speculate or share information that has not been confirmed by counter-terrorism policing. “We have clear and critical reasons for not providing further details at this time. “As soon as we can, we will look to share further information with the public.” Murphy said the Met is working closely with local police forces as searches are being carried out at a number of addresses in the Greater Manchester, London and Swindon areas. He added: “As always, I would ask the public to remain vigilant and if they see or hear anything that concerns them, then to contact us.” In a separate counter-terrorism investigation conducted by the Met, three Iranian men were arrested in north London last weekend under the National Security Act 2023. Another Iranian man suspected of “foreign power threat activity” was arrested in north London on Friday as part of the same investigation.",

    "title": "House of Commons speaker has kept almost 300 gifts over past four years",
    "article_text": "Lindsay Hoyle, the speaker of theHouse of Commons, has kept almost 300 gifts over the last four years including dozens of bottles of alcohol, hampers, ties, cufflinks and chocolates, his declarations show. The speaker received a large volume of presents from foreign dignitaries such as ambassadors, MPs and sometimes companies and chose to keep hundreds of them rather than donating them to Speaker’s House – his residence and office – or parliament. The list, voluntarily declared by the speaker, includes about 80 bottles of alcohol, such as wine, champagne, whisky, rum and other spirits, since 2021. Other items retained by the speaker include 26 ties and cufflinks, skincare sets sent to him by Korean diplomats, books, drinking glasses, presents for his pets, a rug, pictures and decorative ornaments. At Christmas last year, he received hampers from Bahrain and Qatar, plus one from Anguilla containing champagne and two bottles of wine as well as foodstuffs. Priti Patel, the Conservative MP and shadow foreign secretary, has sent him a Christmas pudding at least three years in a row. On some occasions, the speaker passed on or shared free gifts with his office. When the North Macedonian ambassador gave him food and drink in November last year, he kept a bottle of Smidgin gin and and a bottle of wine and gave four herbal teas and three pots of Ajvar (a red pepper sauce) to his office. The register gives a glimpse of some of the free gifts offered to politicians, who are only required to declare those worth more than £300, while ministers must declare those worth more than £150. Tom Brake, the director of the Unlock Democracy campaign group and a former deputy leader of the House of Commons, said: “The speaker’s voluntary declaration of the gifts he receives shines a light on the potential scale of freebies accepted but undeclared by MPs. “The very generous £300 declaration threshold for MPs needs to be brought in line with the rules that commonly apply in the public and the private sector, where only nominal gifts can be accepted.” Keir Starmer, the prime minister, previously declared thousands of pounds worth offree clothingand pairs of glasses donated to him by the Labour donor Lord Alli. After a public furore, he and other senior cabinet ministers have said they will not accept freebies while in government. A spokesperson for the Speaker’s Office said: “As is common practice across the world, the speaker gives and receives gifts when hosting dignitaries as a token of friendship and relationship-building between nations and parliaments. All items are declared proactively – regardless of the £300 threshold applied by the MPs’ register of interests – to ensure transparency and to avoid conflicts of interest. “In consultation with parliamentary officials,a decision is made as to whether a gift would make a meaningful addition to the Speaker’s House historic collection, and if it should go on display. If the item does not meet those criteria, for example perishable goods, it is either retained personally by the speaker or his office. “As part of his welcome to visiting dignitaries and to cement friendships, many of the gifted ties and cufflinks are worn by the speaker – and decorative heritage items relating to that country are put on display.” Hoyle has recently defended himself in relation to spending on oversees trips that amounts to about £250,000 since 2019 on 19 foreign trips. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The figure includes more than £180,000 on first- and business-class flights, while his stays included hotels in luxury resorts and dining in high-end restaurants. In his first interviewsince the revelations, Hoyle told the Sunday Times last month that it was his duty to represent the House at home and abroad. “People see the prime minister going off to the G20 and G7 but, of course, there’s the speaker’s equivalent of that in the same way that the secretaries of state also have their international conferences,” he said. “Now, there’s two ways we could do it. Leave an empty chair without the UK attending.What does that sayabout the UK’s standing in the world — especially with global events at the moment? But also it’s about using my power and influence in that sense to speak out, because it is about speaking truth to power to the Chinese and to Russia. “For example, when I go to these conferences, it’s about standing up and leading the rest of the room to tellRussiait had no right to invade the sovereign territory of Ukraine and [that it has] no right to continue that war.” Hoyle is paid about £160,000 a year and has use of a grace and favour flat in Speaker’s House within the Palace of Westminster.",

    "article_text": "Speaking out after his arrest on Tuesday, the Newark mayor Ras Baraka said his city would continue its fight in court against the company that runs an immigration detention facility inNew Jersey. “I know there are some protests that other people are planning, and if I feel obligated to be there, I will,” Baraka told theRev Al Sharptonon MSNBC Saturday afternoon. “This doesn’t stop the city’s contention with the Geo Group, and we’re going to continue in court with them.” Baraka was arrested Tuesday morning after joining three members of Congress at a protest and press conference outside a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention facility located in Newark known as Delaney Hall. He was arrested by homeland security agents and taken into custody at a separate facility in Newark. The mayor was released about five hours later and charged with trespassing. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlintoldCNN Saturday morning that “there will be more arrests coming” after the protest at the facility, saying that the arrests of the three Democratic members of Congress who were there – Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez and LaMonica McIver – are “on the table”. McLoughlin told CNN that the lawmakers “put law enforcement at risk, this actually put the detainees as well at risk” and said that DHS have “body-camera footage of some of these members of Congress assaulting our Ice enforcement officers”. Newark suedGeo Groupafter the company won a 15-year $1bncontractwith Ice to run Delaney Hall,sayingthat the company was renovating the facility without proper permits and that city inspectors had been barred from entering the center. Federal officials and representatives from Geo Group denied the allegations and told theNew York Timesthat the company had the proper permits, saying that Baraka’s arrest was a “publicity stunt by the mayor”, who is also running in the state’s gubernatorial race. “The mayor has been informed that he is more than welcome to enter the facility, as long as he follows security protocols like everyone else,” McLoughlin told the Times. At the protest Tuesday, Baraka joined Coleman, Menendez and McIver, who were allowed into the facility as part of an oversight visit. In a video reviewed by the New York Times, a homeland security agenttoldBaraka he could not enter the facility like the Congress members, or he would be arrested. Baraka, who was in a crowd of people, told Sharpton that he left the entry gates “several times”, and he was ultimately arrested outside the facility gates. Baraka insists that he “didn’t do anything wrong”. Baraka told Sharpton that DHS was “treating us just like a regular case”. “I was put in the cell, I was given a mug shot, fingerprinted, charged with a federal crime of trespassing,” Baraka said, adding that the police were “treating [him] pretty good”. Baraka emphasized that the federal government wasn’t sharing information about who was being kept in the detention facility. “We don’t know what’s going on in there, we don’t know who’s in there. They don’t allow inspectors. They’re not complying with local laws,” Baraka said. “They feel like they don’t have to go to court.”",

    "article_text": "The daughter of actorsMaggie GyllenhaalandPeter Sarsgaardwas among those arrested at the latest Columbia University protests, marking the latest development in the anti-war demonstrations that also led to the temporary suspension of student journalists. On Friday, the New York Postreportedthat 18-year-old Ramona Sarsgaard, a Columbia freshman, was arrested during Wednesday’s campus protests where students demonstrated against Israel’s deadly war in Gaza. Sarsgaard was given a desk appearance ticket for criminal trespassing, the outlet reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The university did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Post’s report. The arrest of Sarsgaard, along with dozens of others, came after anti-war student activists occupied part of the main Butler library building onColumbia Universityfor several hours in a show of solidarity with Palestinian liberation. Renaming the space the Basel al-Araj People’s University, the studentshung a signthat read “Strike for Gaza” while others distributed pamphlets calling on the university to divest from funds and businesses involved in Israel’s war there. Videos posted on social media showed students also locking arms and chanting: “We have nothing to lose but our chains!” In response, university officials called in the police, leading to many students being forcefully arrested. A statement on Wednesday from the university’s acting president, Claire Shipman,said: “Disruptions to our academic activities will not be tolerated and are violations of our rules and policies; this is especially unacceptable while our students study and prepare for final exams.” Meanwhile, a separate statement on social media from student activistssaid: “We are facing one of the largest militarized police forces in the world. Deputized public safety officers have choked and beaten us, but we have not wavered … We will not be useless intellectuals. Palestine is our compass, and we stand strong in the face of violent repression.” After the protests, Columbia University and its sister school Barnard College issued temporary suspensions to four student journalists who reported on the demonstrations at the library for Columbia Spectator and WKCR. The Columbia Spectatorreportedthat the students identified themselves as press to public safety officers. According to the outlet, the students received email notices of their temporary suspensions on Thursday afternoon from rules administrator Gregory Wawro and Barnard dean Leslie Grinage. In his email to one of the student reporters, Wawro said the student may have “participated in a disruptive protest in 301 Butler Library”. Grinage wrote to the three other student reporters saying that their “alleged actions at Butler Library pose an ongoing threat of disruption of, or interference with, normal operations at both Barnard and Columbia”.

He also alleged the company tracked users’ location even when they thought they had disabled the feature and misled users about Incognito mode, which is meant to provide private browsing.

    "article_text": "A 4.1-magnitude earthquake inTennesseewoke up families and rattled homes as far away as Atlanta as it spread tremors across portions of the southern US on Saturday morning. No injuries or major damage were immediately reported. The website for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) said theearthquakeoriginated shortly after 9am EDT about 12 miles (20km) from Greenback, Tennessee, which is about 30 miles (48km) south of Knoxville. More than 23,000 reports from the public were received by USGS in the first hour after the earthquake, USGS spokesperson Ayesha Davis told the Associated Press in an email. Meteorologists at television news stations serving Georgia and North Carolina reported feeling the tremors as well. There is a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the next week, according to USGS. Gabriela Reilly was making waffles with her husband when they felt their entire home shake in Braselton, Georgia, which is north-east of Atlanta. “Our ceiling fan started shaking for about 10 seconds,” she said. “I thought a giant aircraft had flown low right over the neighborhood, but my husband said: ‘No, that was definitely an earthquake.’” Jason Pack was still in bed at his home outside Knoxville when he felt the walls shaking and heard a rumbling that was loud enough to wake up his family and for the dog to start barking. “In eastTennessee, you’re used to tornadoes and floods, that kind of thing,” Pack said. “It’s unusual to have an earthquake.” Pack has experienced tremors before, although this one is probably the strongest he’s felt in Tennessee. “Even though this one was small, it’s a good reminder – if it had been a big quake, would you know what to do? Drop, cover and hold on if you’re inside,” said Pack, a retired FBI agent who now works in crisis communications. “Stay clear of buildings if you’re outside.” Damage does not usually occur from earthquakes until they reach a magnitude of somewhere above 4 or 5, according to USGS, although it depends on variables such as building construction, soil and distance from the epicenter. The south-eastern US carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid seismic zone to the west and in the Eastern Tennessee seismic zone, which is where Saturday’s earthquake occurred, said Davis. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion Since 1950, 15 other earthquakes of magnitude 4 or larger have occurred within 155 miles (250km) of Saturday’s earthquake, Davis said. The largest of those was a magnitude 4.7 earthquake near Knoxville in November 1973. More recently, two tremors struck the seismic zone in December 2018. One was a 4.4-magnitude earthquake centered in Decatur, Tennessee, which is south of Knoxville. It shook homes as far away as Atlanta. Another earthquake struck a few days later with a magnitude of 3.0. Its epicenter was about 2 miles (4km) south-east of Mascot, near Knoxville. It was also felt in parts of Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina. Seismic waves from earthquakes spread more efficiently in the eastern US compared with the west because of the region’s geology, Davis said. “Earthquakes in the east are felt over a much larger distance and by more people,” she said.",

    "title": "After $1bn settlement, doctor’s sexual assault victims question Columbia University’s inaction",
    "article_text": "It was a shocking scandal involving the betrayal of one of the most sacred bonds in medicine, as one ofNew York’s top doctors abused hundreds of women under his care. Now, after a fresh settlement agreement last week fromColumbia Universityand NewYork-Presbyterian hospital, the compensation for the crimes of Robert Hadden has approached almost a billion dollars and raised further questions as to how he was able to carry out his crimes for so long. The latest $750m deal coveredsexual assaultsby the gynecologist for more than two decades at New York hospitals. His victims hadalready received more than $200mfrom his former employers, who were accused of knowing about his behavior and allowing him to continue practicing medicine. “It’s a clear message that we’re going to hold institutions accountable,” Laurie Maldonado, who spent about 10 years as one of Hadden’s patients and was sexually assaulted by him, said of the settlement. “Don’t protect a serial predator; protect your patients.” In 2023, Haddenwas convictedand sentenced to 20 years in prison for luring patients to travel across state lines so that he could sexually abuse them. From 1987 until 2012, Hadden sexually assaulted and abused female patients during appointments and deliveries at Columbia University Irving medical center and NewYork-Presbyterian hospital, according to federal prosecutors. His victims even included some of New York City’s most prominent women, includingEvelyn Yang, wife of former presidential candidate and New York mayoral hopeful Andrew Yang. Hadden conducted an emergency delivery for Eva Santos Veloz in 2008 and checked her without gloves, using significant force and almost his entire fist, she said. “It was a really traumatic experience,” said Santos Veloz, who was then 18 years old and scared to disclose the sexual assault because of her immigration status. Maldonado, who teaches and studies single-parent families and policy, said she saw Hadden from 2003 until 2012, during which time he engaged in grooming behavior by finding ways to get her to undress and asking inappropriate questions about her sex life. “He really used his knowledge to make it seem like he was the only doctor for you,” said Maldonado, who had a miscarriage. In 2011, two days before she gave birth to her son, Hadden did a dilation check during which he examined her cervix with enough force to make her cry out in pain. “It’s supposed to be the happiest, joyful time of being a mother, and you feel like that moment was taken away from you,” Maldonado said. “I feel like the harm and the trauma is still in my body.” In 2012, New York police arrested Hadden after receiving a call from a patient who said he licked her during an exam. Despite that allegation, a Columbia administrator allowed him to continue practicing medicine as long as he had a chaperone with him while examining patients and complied with university and hospital policies,ProPublica reported. He continued to sexually assault patients for five weeks before Columbia suspended him, and he later retired. In 2013, the university informed Hadden’s patients that he had closed his practice but did not provide a reason,according to a letterin the ProPublica report. In 2016, prosecutorsagreed to a dealin which Hadden would plead guilty to a felony and misdemeanor, register as a sex offender and surrender his medical license but not serve time in prison. After more women abused by Haddencame forwardin 2020, federal prosecutorsfiled new charges, which resulted in the conviction and 20-year-prison sentence. Columbia Universitydid not apologizeuntil ProPublica published its report in 2023, according to the news organization. Before the settlement this week, the hospitalsagreed to pay$71m to 79 patients in 2021 and$165mto 147 patients in 2022. The new deal provides $750m to 576 patients. Sign up toFirst Thing Our US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “This has been 13 years in the making, and I’m grateful for all my clients who have come forward to hold not just Hadden accountable, but more importantly, his enablers atColumbia Universityand NewYork-Presbyterian hospital,” said Anthony T DiPietro, an attorney for the plaintiffs. A Columbia spokesperson responded to an interview request with a statement that the university was “implementing a multi-pronged plan, including an external investigation, a survivors’ settlement fund” and new “patient safety policies and programs to address the abuses of Robert Hadden”. “We deeply regret the pain that his patients suffered, and this settlement is another step forward in our ongoing work and commitment to repair harm and support survivors. We commend the survivors for their bravery in coming forward,” the statement continued. A NewYork-Presbyterian spokesperson responded to the request by stating that Columbia would be “issuing all statements on this issue”. Santos Veloz, who now has three children, called the most recent huge settlement “a big win”. “No matter how much they wanted to cover it up, we were able to work together to hold [Columbia] accountable in some way,” said Santos Veloz, who hopes to become an immigration attorney. Still, Santos Veloz said, she was waiting to see whether Columbia would follow through with its plan to better protect patients. “We could get all the money in the world, but if this continues to happen, it means nothing,” she said. Meanwhile, DiPietro, the plaintiffs’ attorney, now represents hundreds of women in lawsuits againstDr Barry Brock, a gynecologist at Cedars-Sinai medical center in Los Angeles,who allegedly sexually abusedpatients, and against NewYork-Presbyterian, Weill Cornell medical center and Northwell Health, which employed Darius Paduch, a urologist sentenced to life in prison for sexually abusing patients, including minors. “The Haddens of the world are not the problem; they are just a symptom,” DiPietro. “The problem is the toxic culture at these medical institutions that lie, cover up and expose more patients to known serial sexual predators.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

    "title": "‘From all sides’: universities in red states face attacks from DC and at home",
    "article_text": "Days after the University of Michigan president, Santa Ono, announced that he was leaving his post to lead the University of Florida, his name was quietly removed on Wednesday from a letter signed by more than600 university presidentsdenouncing theTrump administration’s “unprecedented government overreach and political interference” with academic institutions. As Ono is set to become the highest-paid public university president in the country, in a state that has often been at the forefront of the rightwing battle against higher education, the reversal, firstreportedon by Talking Points Memo, underscored the challenges of standing up against the government’s sweeping attacks on education in solidly red states. Many private colleges and universities havebegun to push backagainstDonald Trump’s federal funding cuts, bans on diversity initiatives, and targeting of foreign students, while faculty atmore than 30universities, most of them public, have passed resolutions calling for a “mutual defence compact” – a largely symbolic pledge to support one another in the face of the government’s repressive measures. But in conservative states, where local attacks on higher education were in vogue before the US president took office, faculty trying to fight back find themselves fighting on multiple fronts: against state legislators as well as against Trump. Some have persevered, although for now that resistance has been limited to statements and resolutions calling on the universities themselves to put up a more muscular response. The faculty senate at Indiana University, Bloomington,voted in favorof a defence compact last month, days beforeRepublicanlegislators passed asweeping overhaulof the state school’s governance. In Georgia,Kennesaw State Universitybecame the first – and so far only – school in the US south to join the call for the solidarity pact, in part to protest the state scrapping a decades-oldinitiativeto increase the college enrollment of Black men, which was pulled as part of the broader Trump-led crackdown on diversity initiatives. This week, faculty at the University of Miami in Ohio and at theUniversity of Arizona– both states with Republican-majority legislatures – also passed resolutions in favor of mutual alliances among universities. The resolutions are nonbinding, as faculty senates play an advisory role at most universities, and so far no administrations have responded to the call. But the idea, those behind it say, is to send a message. “All universities in all states are under threat,” said Jim Sherman, a retired psychology professor atIndianaUniversity, Bloomington, who proposed the resolution passed by faculty there. “If we don’t stand together and talk about what each of us is experiencing, how we’re dealing with it, and what the options are, then we’re standing alone, and that’s much more difficult.” Paul Boxer, a psychology professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, first came up with the plan to organize faculty in the “Big Ten” conference, a group of 18 large, mostly public universities, to put up a united front against the Trump administration. But schools outside the conference showed an interest, and the solidarity effort quickly outgrew the consortium to include other, mostly public colleges and universities across the country. Boxer also praised other collective initiatives that have since emerged, including by a group of “elite” universitiesquietly strategizingto counter the Trump administration policies, but called on more universities to publicly unite in their resistance. “A lot of the attention has been on Harvard, and the Ivy Leagues, and the universities that Trump has name-dropped, and I’m glad that Harvard did what they did, obviously, but they’re sitting on a $50bn endowment, and they can do things that we can’t in a public university,” Boxer said, referring to the university’s publicdefianceof Trump’s demands and alawsuitit filed against the administration. Large state universities – particularly those in blue states with sympathetic legislators – had other advantages, Boxer noted, including strong connections to alumni in local government and the broader community. That is a harder case to make in Republican-controlled states – some of which, like Florida, Texas, Iowa and Utah – had essentially drawn upa blueprintfor attacking diversity initiatives and academic freedom in the years leading up to Trump’s election. In Indiana, the recently passed measures, which legislators attached to a budget bill at the last minute, would establish “productivity” quotas for tenured faculty and end alumnis’ ability to vote for the university’s board of trustees, which would fall under the full control of the state’s governor, Mike Braun. “There is a lot of anxiety,” said Sherman. “If Indiana is any indication, red states might even be more under threat from their state legislatures than they are from the federal government.” Taking a public stance in a climate of growing repression is not easy, faculty say. In Florida, where Ono is headed, the state’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, was an early champion of the battle against diversity initiatives and said this week that he expects the incoming president to abide by the state’s mission to “reject woke indoctrination”. In Georgia, at a statewide faculty leadership meeting this week, scholars from across the state’s universities debated how to defend programmes supporting Black students, help international students facing visa revocations, and prepare to fight proposedstate legislationthat would impose further restrictions on diversity initiatives and criminalize the distribution of some library materials. “Faculty want to do something, they want to respond, but they also see the inevitability of their university system and their lawmakers doing it. There’s no stopping that train here inGeorgia,” said Matthew Boedy, a professor at the University of North Georgia who also leads the state’s American Association of University Professors conference. “There are state-level attacks, there are federal attacks,” he said. “We are taking it from all sides.”",

    "title": "Israeli protesters in Tel Aviv demand an end to war on Gaza",
    "article_text": "Thousands of Israelis rallied in central Tel Aviv, calling on the government to end thewar on Gazaand secure the immediate release of Israeli captives held in the besieged Palestinian enclave. The Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that in Tel Aviv, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, an Israeli campaign group, held itsweekly rallySaturday in “Hostages Square”, while another demonstration by families of captives is taking place outside the Israeli military headquarters. A separate antigovernment protest also occurred at Habima Square in Tel Aviv. The Times of Israel reported that Shai Mozes, whose parents were held captive and released in separate exchange deals, told the crowd at the protest in Habima Square that Israel’s “real enemy is not Hamas, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is destroying Israel as a Jewish and democratic state”. Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, said that “family members of Israeli captives still held in Gaza say that Netanyahu is still prolonging the war for personal and political gain, and that he’s the one who’s not willing to compromise when it comes to any sort of cease fire deal”. “There are still 59 captives held in Gaza, 35 of whom Israeli officials say are confirmed dead, and 21 that are presumed alive, and three whose fate is still unknown”, she said. “Israeli officials say that they are going to be expanding their operations in Gaza and not heading toward any sort of ceasefire deal just yet, saying that the best way to bring about the release of those captives is through military means, something that the family members of captives and the larger portion of Israeli society do not agree with” she said. After Netanyahu announced an expanded offensive in the Gaza Strip on Monday, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum criticised the move in a statement, saying the plan is “sacrificing” those still held in the Palestinian territory. Haaretz also reported that protests were planned in other cities, including Jerusalem, Haifa, andBeersheba, as well as at dozens of other sites and intersections across Israel. Hamas’s armed wing released a video on Saturday showing two Israeli captives alive in the Gaza Strip, with one of the two men calling to end the 19-month-long war. Israeli media identified the pair in the undated video as Elkana Bohbot and Yosef Haim Ohana. The three-minute video released by Hamas’s Qassam Brigades shows one of the captives, identified by media as 36-year-old Bohbot, visibly weak and lying on the floor wrapped in a blanket. Ohana, 24, speaks in Hebrew in the video, urging the Israeli government to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of all remaining captives. Bohbot and Ohana were both abducted by Palestinian fighters from the site of a music festival during Hamas’s attack on southern Israel on October 7 2023.",

    "article_text": "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka has denied trespassing at a new United States federal immigration detention centre following his arrest and release. Baraka, who has been protesting the centre’s opening this week, denied his trespassing charge on Saturday, a day after he spent several hours in police custody. The mayor, who is seeking the Democratic party’s nomination for governor,  has gone head-to-head with the Trump administration overundocumented immigration, pushing back against the opening of the Delaney Hall Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 1,000-bed detention facility, arguing that it should not be allowed to open because of building permit issues. Officials accused Baraka of trespassing and ignoring warnings to leave the Delaney Hall facility in Newark, New Jersey. “I’m shocked by all the lies that were told here,” he said, adding he had been invited there for a news conference. “No one else [was] arrested, I was invited in, then they arrested me on the sidewalk.” In an interview Saturday with MSNBC, Baraka recounted being put in a cell, having his fingerprints taken and being the subject of a mug shot. He said he would continue to try to gain entry to the detention facility. “We don’t know what’s going on in there,” said Baraka. He has a court date scheduled for Thursday. Alina Habba, interim US Attorney for New Jersey, said on the social media platform X that Baraka trespassed at the detention facility, which is run by private prison operator Geo Group. Habba said Baraka had “chosen to disregard the law”. Tricia McLaughlin, an assistant secretary for public affairs with the US Department of Homeland Security, said in an interview with CNN on Saturday that the investigation was ongoing and that more video from the scene would soon be released. She also accused Baraka of playing “political games”. Baraka was taken into custody by the ICE agents in a scuffle at the facility. He had joined several lawmakers at the detention centre for a demonstration on Friday. Video of the incident showed that Baraka was arrested after returning to the public side of the gate to the facility. Local elected officials swiftly condemned the federal agents’ actions, with the state’s governor, Phil Murphy, writing on X that he was “outraged by the unjust arrest”.",

    "title": "Barcelona vs Real Madrid: Ancelotti coy on future as Alonso link grows",
    "article_text": "Carlo Ancelotti says Xabi Alonso has “all the doors open” for a move to a big club, with speculation building that the former Real Madrid midfielder is set to replace the Italian coach at the helm of the Spanish powerhouse. Ancelotti gave his routine pre-game news conference on Saturday, a day after Alonso announced he was leaving Bayer Leverkusen. He praised the work of Alonso, who has been widely linked to an eventual move back to Madrid after leading the German club to the Bundesliga title last season. “I read that Xabi is leaving Bayer Leverkusen, where he did a fantastic job,” Ancelotti said beforeSunday’s trip to Barcelona. “He has all the doors open because he has shown that he is one of the best coaches in the world.” Ancelotti again refused to speak about his future, especially before a decisive Clasico in LaLiga. Madrid trail Barcelona by four points and need to win to keep alive their chances of winning a trophy this campaign. But he did speak movingly about what Madrid means — and will mean — for the most successful manager in European football. For Ancelotti, his relationship with the club he has spent six seasons at in two stints is an everlasting “honeymoon”. “The honeymoon with this club never ends, it continues forever,” he said. “I think that Real Madrid, like Milan before, are the teams that stay with me, given the time I have spent here. At the beginning, there is passion, and when that fades, other feelings emerge, a sense of tender care. My honeymoon with Real Madrid will last for as long as I live.” The 65-year-old coach is under contract through the next campaign but is widely expected to leave after an underwhelming season in which the team played worse despite adding Kylian Mbappe to its squad. Brazil have been courting Ancelotti for over a year, and it appears talks are still ongoing with the veteran manager. With only four games remaining of the LaLiga season, only a win will realistically keep Real’s hopes of retaining the title, and for Ancelotti, they will need to get everything right to have a chance on Sunday. “In this type of game, you have to do things well. Barcelona are used to keeping the opponent in their own area, but no team is perfect,” he said. “It’s a game where there’s a lot at stake, and to win, you have to manage everything well, defend well, attack well. We have to play a complete game.” With so much at stake against their great rivals, Ancelotti will have little trouble getting his players fired up. “It’s not difficult to motivate the players because it’s the type of match for which the players already come out motivated and with a lot of confidence,” he said. “Playing with Barcelona is special. It will be the last ‘El Clasico’ of the season because Barca are not in the Club World Cup.” Who's scoring in#ELCLÁSICO? 🤍pic.twitter.com/Tgx1X8cVuA — LALIGA English (@LaLigaEN)May 8, 2025 Barcelona’s players have discussedlast week’s Champions League eliminationand are ready to put their disappointment behind them against rivals Real Madrid, manager Hansi Flick said in his news conference on Saturday. Barca suffered a 4-3 Champions League semifinal defeat by Inter Milan on Tuesday. A home win on Sunday would move Flick’s side one victory away from their 28th Spanish league title. “We’re doing well. After the defeat in Milan, everyone knows it’s not easy … but we’re doing things right. We’ve talked about what we want to do in these two weeks,” Flick told reporters. “There are four more games to go. El Clasico is important, we have to show how well we can play. We have to show confidence. The players are doing very well … We’ve been talking about what they are thinking, what they are feeling. “We had to talk about it as a group. Everyone knows that in a Clasico, you have to give 100 percent. You have to be active, intense, dominant. Real Madrid is a very good team, and we need the fans.” Translated as “The Classic” in English, El Clasico is the name given to any football match between rival clubs Barcelona and Real Madrid. The special matchup between these football sides was born out of a more-than-a-century-old political-historical dimension between an increasingly distinct Catalan national identity, with FC Barcelona representing Catalonia, pitched against the centralised power structures of Spain’s capital city, Madrid, and by extension, its most famous football club, Real Madrid. The first match between the two Spanish mega clubs was played on May 13, 1902. In total, 260 matches have been played. Real Madrid lead in head-to-head results with 105 wins to Barcelona’s 103, with 52 draws.

    "title": "Explosions, violations reported after India and Pakistan agree ceasefire",
    "article_text": "India and Pakistan have agreed to animmediate ceasefireafter days of military escalation, deadly cross-border attacks, accusations and counter accusations, had raised acute concerns that the two nuclear-armed neighbours would engage in anall-out warfor the fifth time since 1947. But violations of the truce were reported later on Saturday as explosions rang out across parts of Indian-administered Kashmir. India’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a briefing: “For the last few hours, there have been repeated violations of the understanding arrived at earlier this evening between the director generals of military operations of India and Pakistan” “This is a breach of an understanding arrived at earlier today … We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation,” he said. Misri added that India’s military has been given instructions to “deal strongly” with any violations. However, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry released a statement early Sunday responding to Misri’s comments, saying the country “remains committed to a faithful implementation of the ceasefire” announced with India earlier amid accusations of violations along the Line of Control (LoC). In the statement, Pakistan accused India of committing breaches of the truce “in some areas”. “Notwithstanding the violations being committed by India in some areas, our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint,” it said. “We believe that any issues in smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. The troops on the ground should also exercise restraint,” the statement added. Pakistan’s Information Minister Attaullah Tarar also told Geo News that there have been no violations of the agreement. Speaking to Al Jazeera, Sahar Khan, a security analyst based in Washington, says the reported truce violations underscore just how tenuous peace along the LoC is. She noted the most recent fighting broke a ceasefire agreement reached in 2021, the most substantial since 2003. “This is still a very delicate and fragile ceasefire, but I think most people on the ground are relieved to see it,” Khan said. “The ceasefire agreement negotiated in 2021, which came into effect in 2023, was still really fragile. So I think while this is good news, I do expect to see some back and forth on this”, she added. Earlier Saturday, military officials from both countries had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 17:00 Indian time (11:30 GMT) on Saturday, bringing ahalt to all firing and operationsby land, air, and sea. This followed heavy overnight exchanges Friday into Saturday. Misri said earlier that the two military chiefs would speak to each other again on May 12. Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said later on Saturday he believes the long-running dispute over Kashmir and water-sharing with India will be resolved. “For the benefit of everybody, we have made this agreement of ceasefire and we have been very positive about it,” he said in a televised address. Sharif accused India of killing civilians and targeting mosques with drone and missile attacks in recent weeks, calling claims against Pakistan “baseless”. “If anyone challenges Pakistan’s independence,” Sharif warned. “We will do anything to defend it,” he added. The ceasefire announcement met relief and joyous scenes from residents in both countries and in the areas of disputed Kashmir that each administers. But just hours after the ceasefire was announced, explosions were heard across the city of Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir, according to Omar Abdullah, chief minister of the federal territory. “What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar,” Abdullah posted on X. Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Lahore, Pakistan, said, “People are welcoming the ceasefire, but we are also reminded how precarious it is; ceasefire violations are already happening across the Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir region.” “We’ve been hearing from local sources that there has been an exchange of fire in multiple locations in the Kashmir region, and there are some projectiles that have entered the Pakistani airspace, as well”, he said. “We’re also hearing the loud explosions in Srinagar, similar to what was heard early Saturday and in the afternoon. Air sirens are all across, and there’s a power shutdown,” journalist Umar Mehraj told Al Jazeera from Srinagar. “I can see projectiles flying, projectiles in the sky. It’s very unclear if they are missiles or air defence intercepting these attacks. Similar reports of the explosions are being heard in Baramulla and Jammu,” said Mehraj. Electricity was cut off across multiple localities, adding to the confusion. With no official clarification on the nature of the blasts, some residents described feeling “abandoned and unprepared”. “One of the blasts was so powerful it made the walls tremble. Authorities are not clarifying what is going on; we do not have any shelters, nor did we hear any sirens. We do not know what to do. There is only fear,” one Srinagar resident told Al Jazeera. The ceasefire appears to have been mediated by international actors, but there are conflicting reports as to which countries played a crucial role. US President Donald Trump claims it was the US – he was first to declare it on Truth Social post: “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE”. “Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,” he wrote. Al Jazeera’s Mike Hanna, reporting from Washington, DC, noted, “There are questions about why the US did announce first. What sort of leverage does it have over India and Pakistan? We do know that it was a multilateral attempt to get a ceasefire. We do know, as well, that the United Kingdom has just signed a major trade deal with India, so it would also have great sway in this. Still, the US appears to be taking it further.” However, Dar told broadcaster Geo News that Pakistan and India had agreed to a “full-fledged” and “not partial” ceasefire, adding that three dozen countries were involved in the diplomacy that secured it. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the agreement also includes plans for broader talks at a neutral venue, which conflicts with a statement published on social media by India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting that says, “There is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.” Amid the cessation of hostilities, India and Pakistan have also agreed to a broader dialogue on various issues. Two government sources told the news agency Reuters that all measures taken by India against Pakistan after April 22, including on trade and visas, remain in place. Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javaid, reporting from Lahore, Pakistan, said that for the Pakistani side, the water issue is crucial “because India has suspended its related treaty with Pakistan, which affects the livelihood and agriculture in this country”. Four government sources told Reuters that the Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan, remains suspended. The treaty regulates the sharing of water from the Indus River and its tributaries between the South Asian nations. India pulled out of it last month. It is crucial to agriculture in both nations. “There are real fundamental political issues that need to be addressed so we don’t find ourselves again in a militarised crisis,” Elizabeth Threlkeld, director of the South Asia programme at the Stimson Centre, told Al Jazeera. “The timing is significant since there is significant water flow between India and Pakistan because of the season at the moment. But in a few months’ time, that will start to dry up,” she said. India does not necessarily have the infrastructure to meaningfully divert water right now, but it will gain that capacity when there’s less flow. So, that will have to be on the agenda of the talks if the two sides are to come together,” she added. Following the announcement of a ceasefire, residents on both sides of the Line of Control in Kashmir expressed a sense of relief, with many praying for a lasting solution to the Kashmir conflict. “I was extremely anxious about what was happening,” 25-year-old Rumaisa Jan, a resident of Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir who has her wedding scheduled next week, told Al Jazeera. “This is the wisest decision taken after so many lives have been lost. We want peace and an end to all these hostilities.” Firdous Ahmad Sheikh, who runs a travel agency in the city, said he was frustrated by Kashmir being turned into a “battleground” by the two countries. “My only fear is that things could escalate again in future. These countries must sit together and find a political solution to Kashmir once and for all. I pray our children don’t have to witness such times again. “God has been kind to us for now.” In Muzaffarabad, capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, residents welcomed the ceasefire, saying they hope it will bring long-awaited relief to a region that has borne the brunt of recurring conflict. “For us, peace means survival,” said Zulfikar Ali, a resident. “We’ve suffered enough. I’m glad that both Pakistan and India have made a sensible decision.”",

    "title": "At least 33 people killed in suspected RSF attacks in Sudan",
    "article_text": "At least 33 people have been killed in Sudan in attacks suspected to have been carried out by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) as the brutaltwo-year warclaims its latest victims. AnRSFstrike on a prison on Saturday in el-Obeid killed at least 19 people, while on Friday evening, at least 14 members of the same family were killed in an air attack in Darfur, local sources said. The attacks – part of the RSF’s ongoing war with the military-led government’s Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) since 2023 – came after six straight days of the paramilitary group’s drone attacks on the army-led government’s wartime capital ofPort Sudan. These attacks damaged key infrastructure, including a power grid and the country’s last operational civilian airport, which was a key gateway for aid into the war-ravaged nation. The war has left tens of thousands dead, displaced 13 million people and triggered what the United Nations calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. The attack on the prison on Saturday also wounded 45 people, a medical source told the AFP news agency. The source said the jail in the army-controlled city in the North Kordofan state capital was hit by an RSF drone. The night before, 14 people were killed at the Abu Shouk displacement camp near el-Fasher in Darfur, a rescue group said, blaming the paramilitary. The camp “was the target of intense bombardment by the Rapid Support Forces on Friday evening”, said the group of volunteer aid workers. The camp near el-Fasher, the last state capital in Darfur still out of the RSF’s control, is plagued by famine, according to the UN. It is home to tens of thousands of people who fled the violence of successive conflicts in Darfur and the conflict that has been ripping Africa’s third-largest country asunder since 2023. The RSF has shelled the camp several times in recent weeks. Abu Shouk is located near the Zamzam camp, which the RSF seized in April after a devastating offensive that virtually emptied it. Elsewhere on Saturday, SAF warplanes struck RSF positions in the Darfur cities of Nyala and el-Geneina, destroying arms depots and military equipment, a military source told AFP. The RSF has recently said it had taken the strategic town of al-Nahud in West Kordofan, a key army supply line to Darfur. The RSF’s escalation in Port Sudan earlier this month came after the military struck the Nyala airport in South Darfur, where the RSF receives foreign military assistance, including drones. Local media stated that dozens of RSF officers were killed in the attack. Sudan’s army-aligned authoritiesaccusethe United Arab Emirates ofsupplying those drones to the RSF,which has no air force of its own. The war began as a power struggle between SAF chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his former deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. It has effectively divided the country into two, with the army controlling the north, east and centre, while the RSF and its allies dominate nearly all of Darfur in the west and parts of the south. Both sides have been accused of committing war crimes.",

    "title": "India and Pakistan agree ceasefire: What does it mean?",
    "article_text": "India and Pakistan have reached aceasefireagreement following a brief period of hostilities over the past few days, United States President Donald Trump announced on Saturday. Earlier on Saturday, the two neighbours targeted each other’s military sites as Pakistan launched “Operation Bunyan Marsoos” after three of its own airbases were hit by India’s air-to-surface missiles. Both sides claimed to have intercepted most projectiles, but also admitted that some strikes caused damage. More than 60 people have been reported killed sinceIndia launched missilesunder “Operation Sindoor” on Wednesday, which it said targeted “terrorist camps” in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan has confirmed the killing of 13 people on its side of the Line of Control (LoC), the de facto border between the two countries dividing the disputed Kashmir region. The strikes had raisedfears of a wider conflictbetween the two nuclear-armed neighbours. While international mediation has resolved disputes between India and Pakistan before, it remains to be seen if this ceasefire will hold and whether people will be able to relax. “After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Saturday. “Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!” Multiple countries are understood to have been involved in these talks. Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri confirmed the ceasefire shortly after. “It was agreed between them that both sides would stop all fighting and military action on land, air and sea with effect from 17:00 Indian Standard Time today [11:30 GMT],” Misri said in a short statement. “Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding. The directors general of military operations will talk again on May 12 at 12:00.” India and Pakistan have also activated military channels and hotlines following the deal, according to Dar. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio alsosaidIndia and Pakistan had agreed to start talks on a “broad set of issues at a neutral site”. However, in a statement on social media, India’s Ministry of Information and Broadcasting partially denied this, stating: “There is no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place.” Subir Sinha, director of the South Asian Institute at SOAS University of London, told Al Jazeera that broader bilateral talks would be a very challenging process as India had previously rejected such a development. “One of the arguments about this so-called robust policy towards Pakistan that Modi’s government had adopted was that it was no longer possible to sit down and discuss a broad and long-term commitment to resolve issues,” Sinha said. Therefore, this would mark a reversal of the Indian government’s position and could play out poorly with the right wing in India, whose members have been calling for an attack on Pakistan. Sinha said both theIndus Waters Treaty,which India suspended its participation of and theSimla Agreement, which Pakistan threatened to pull out of, will need to be fully resumed and “to be looked [at] perhaps as bases for moving forward”. Officially, no. Despite intense military exchanges, including missile strikes, drone attacks, and artillery shelling, neither government made an official declaration of war. India and Pakistan instead characterised their military actions as specific coordinated “military operations”. Pakistan on Saturday launched a retaliatory assault it named “Bunyan Marsoos”, Arabic for “Wall of Lead”, just days after India initiated “Operation Sindoor“, responding to adeadly attack on touristsin Pahalgam on April 22, which it blamed on Pakistan-based armed groups. However, that is not unusual for these two countries. They have not officially declared war inprevious major conflicts, even as thousands of soldiers and civilians died. Yes. Third-party mediationhas resolved disputessince 1947, when the subcontinent split through partition and India and Pakistan fought their first war. After a yearlong war over ownership of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, a United Nations-brokered ceasefire effectively split Kashmir between Indian- and Pakistan-administered regions in 1948. The 1965 Indo-Pakistani War ended with the Tashkent Declaration in January 1966, following mediation by the erstwhile Soviet Union. The accord saw Indian Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri and Pakistani President Ayub Khan agree to pull back to pre-war positions and restore diplomatic and economic ties. During the 1999Kargil War, Pakistani troops crossed the LoC and seized Indian positions. Then-US President Bill Clinton convinced Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw, warning of international isolation. In 2002, then-US Secretary of State Colin Powell claimed he and his team had mediated the end of a tense stand-off along the LoC following an attack on the Indian Parliament in December 2001. The following June, Powell said that through negotiations, he had received assurances from President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan that “infiltration activity” across the LoC would cease and that armed groups would be dismantled on Pakistani territory. There is no single definition. International humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Conventions, uses the term “international armed conflict” instead of “war”, defining it more broadly as any use of armed forces between states, regardless of whether either side calls it a “war”. In modern international law, all uses of force are categorised as “armed conflict” regardless of justifications such as self-defence, according to Ahmer Bilal Soofi, an advocate in the Supreme Court of Pakistan who also specialises in international law. The suspension of a treaty can also signal the start of war, he added. India suspended its participation in the landmark Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan on April 23, a move Pakistan described as a “hostile act”. “Political scientists normally say a war only exists after fighting becomes quite intense – normally 1,000 battle deaths,” said Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany. “For governments, though, wars exist whenever they say so.” Experts argue the recent escalation in military actions by India and Pakistan was as much about signalling strength as they were about military objectives, and was also part of a broader effort to manage domestic and international perception. Sean Bell, a United Kingdom-based military analyst, said much of the current rhetoric from both India and Pakistan is deliberately aimed at domestic audiences. Each side is “trying to make clear to their own populations that there is a robust military response, and that they’re retaliating for any actions”, he told Al Jazeera. But this tit-for-tat dynamic, Bell warned, risks becoming difficult to stop once it starts. Following the adoption of the UN Charter in 1945, “no country claims ‘war’ or declares ‘war’ as, legally speaking, it is viewed as unlawful use of force”, Soofi told Al Jazeera. Officially, being in a state of armed conflict triggers international legal obligations, such as following the rules of armed conflict and being accountable for war crimes. In the latest India-Pakistan standoff, both sides portrayed the other as the aggressor, insisting it should be the one to de-escalate. The absence of a formal, universally accepted definition of war means countries can engage in sustained military operations without ever officially declaring war. Ambiguity also allows governments to frame military actions in ways that suit their political or diplomatic goals. For example, Russia has consistently described its 2022 invasion of Ukraine as a “special military operation”, despite large-scale troop deployments, air strikes and territorial occupation. Similarly, the US referred to the Korean War in the 1950s as a “police action” and framed its long-term activities in Afghanistan and Iraq as “counterterrorism operations”. Israel also often uses terms like “military campaign” or “operation” for cross-border offensives, such as “Operation Protective Edge” during its 2014 war in Gaza.",

    "title": "Iran’s FM visits Saudi Arabia, Qatar before nuclear talks with US in Oman",
    "article_text": "Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has visited Saudi Arabia and Qatar for consultations in the run-up to the fourth round of indirectnuclear talkswith the United States, which will take place in Oman on Sunday. The future direction of Iran’s nuclear programme, its enrichment of uranium, and sanctions relief remain the key issues. Speaking later Saturday in Doha, Araghchi said that if the US’s goal is to deprive Iran of its nuclear rights, Tehran will not back down from “any of our rights”. Iran insists its programme is for civilian purposes and it has no intention to pursue a nuclear weapon. Araghchi told Al Jazeera in Doha, “I have always said that if the… purpose of a deal is to …ensure that Iran would never have [a] nuclear weapon that is already granted… and a deal would be at our reach”. “But if there are unrealistic…demands by the other side, then we are going to have problems”, he said. In an interview with Breitbart News on Friday, President Donald Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, who will attend the talks in Oman, said the US would “take [Iran] at their word” that they do not want nuclear weapons, but set out specific conditions for verifying such a position.” “If that’s how they feel, then their enrichment facilities have to be dismantled. They cannot have centrifuges. They have to downblend all of their fuel that they have there and send it to a faraway place — and they have to convert to a civil programme if they want to run a civil programme,” he said. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has raised the possibility of Iran importing enriched uranium for any civilian energy. Araqhchi’s Gulf tour on Saturday came after Tehran confirmed the latest round Friday: “The negotiations are moving forward, and naturally, the further we go, the more consultations and reviews are needed,” Araghchi said in remarks carried by Iranian state media. Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said on Friday that, after “coordination with both Iran and the US”, the delayed talks would go ahead in Muscat. The fourth round, initially scheduled for May 3 in Rome, waspostponedfor what Oman described as “logistical reasons”. The talks come against the backdrop of a long-running dispute over Iran’s nuclear ambitions. The meeting is the latest effort to revive diplomacy after years of rising tensions. Successive US administrations have sought to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. A sustained effort by world powers during the Barack Obama administration culminated in a 2015 agreement called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The multilateral agreement created a framework for Iran to receive much-needed relief from international sanctions, in exchange for reducing its uranium enrichment and submitting to inspections of its nuclear facilities. But when Trump succeeded Obama as US president, he unilaterally withdrew the US from the nuclear agreement in 2018, causing the deal to crumble. Some Western countries argue that Iran’s programme, accelerated after the US walkout from the 2015 accord, is aimed at developing weapons. Tehran maintains that its nuclear activity is entirely civilian. Trump himself has acknowledged tensions in his policy on Iran, saying at the start of his second term that hawkish advisors were pushing him to step up pressure reluctantly. In an interview on Thursday, Trump said he wanted “total verification” that Iran’s contested nuclear work is shut down, but through diplomacy. “I’d much rather make a deal” than see military action, Trump told the conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt. “There are only two alternatives – blow ’em up nicely or blow ’em up viciously,” Trump said. Araqchi’s trips to Saudi Arabia and Qatar on Saturday are part of what he describes as “continuous consultations” with neighbouring states. He said the visits aimed to address “concerns and mutual interests” regarding the nuclear issue. Araghchi told Al Jazeera on Saturday that Iran is regularly in contact with Saudi Arabia, but the purpose of this visit was “to consult with our Saudi colleagues, especially on Iran-US talks”. “We want to make sure that you know everybody’s on board, and there would be no concern …So I hope that when we come to a deal”, he said. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei confirmed the presence of a technical delegation in the talks in Oman on Saturday. In an interview with Mehr News, Baghaei stated that the Iranian delegation is comprised of experts and specialists relevant to the current phase of the negotiations. He did not comment on the US team.",

    "title": "Pope Leo identifies AI as main challenge in first meeting with cardinals",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV has held his first meeting with the world’s cardinals since his election as the head of the Catholic Church, identifyingartificial intelligence(AI) as one of the most crucial issues facing humanity. Leo, the first American pope, laid out a vision of his papacy at the Vatican on Saturday, telling the cardinals who elected him that AI poses challenges to defending “human dignity, justice and labour” – a view shared with his predecessor, the latePope Francis. Explaining his choice of name, the pontiff said he identified with the late Leo XIII, who had defended workers’ rights during his 1878-1903 papacy at the dawn of the industrial age, adding that “social teaching” was now needed in response to the modern-day revolution brought by AI. The late Pope Francis, who died last month, warned that AI risked turning human relations into mere algorithms and called for an international treaty to regulate it. Francis warned the Group of Seven industrialised nations last year that AI must remain human-centric, so that decisions about when to use weapons or even less-lethal tools would not fall to machines. In his speech, delivered in Italian, Pope Leo made repeated references to Francis and the mourning over his death, saying the late pontiff left a “precious legacy” and signalling that he would continue with his vision. Later on Saturday, Pope Leo made a surprise visit to a sanctuary south of Rome that is dedicated to the Madonna and of significance to his Augustinian order. People gathered in the town of Genazzano, in the square outside the main church housing the Madre del Buon Consiglio sanctuary, waiting for Leo to emerge. The pontiff shook hands and offered blessings to a few people in the crowd before entering the shrine. Leo previously visited the sanctuary, which is managed by Augustinian friars, last year, when he was a cardinal. It has been a place of pilgrimage since the 15th century. Francis was pope for 12 years and often garnered criticism from conservative cardinals, who said he was watering down the Church’s doctrine on issues such as the inclusion of LGBTQ Catholics and women’s leadership. Leo, the former US Cardinal Robert Prevost, was a relative unknown on the global stage, before he was elected pontiff, who spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru before serving as a senior Vatican official. Saturday’s meeting took place in the same small Vatican auditorium where the cardinals had been gathering in the days before the conclave to discuss who should be the next pope. Czech Cardinal Dominik Duka was cited by the Reuters news agency as saying the situation of Catholics in communist China had been raised as an issue. The Vatican and China in 2018 signed a controversial deal on the appointment of bishops in the country, which gives Beijing some input into their selection. Conservatives have attacked the still-secret deal as a sellout, but Duka told Reuters it was necessary to keep dialogue open in places where the Church is oppressed.",

    "article_text": "Who:Liverpool vs ArsenalWhat:English Premier LeagueWhere:Anfield, Liverpool, United KingdomWhen:Sunday at 4:30pm local time (15:30 GMT) FollowAl Jazeera Sport‘s live text and photo commentary stream. Liverpool werecrowned Premier League championsin front of their fans two weeks ago when Arne Slot’s side thrashed Tottenham Hotspur 5-1. Now they face an Arsenal side wounded by not only their third consecutive second-place finish in the English top-flight but also their elimination from the Champions League on Tuesday. Manager Mikel Arteta has come out fighting with regards to what the Gunners need to do to take the next step in their hunt for silverware – and that starts with their visit to face the Reds. Arteta has urged Arsenal to use the frustration of having to give champions Liverpool a guard of honour on Sunday as fuel to win the Premier League title next season after admitting they have gone “backwards” this term. “Something has to drive you, motivate you, and pain for this is a good one to use when you really want to do something. It’s the right thing to do, usually as a motivation for next season,” Arteta said of Arsenal’s guard of honour for the champions. “They’ve been the best team, they’ve been the most consistent, and what Slot and the coaching staff have done has been fascinating, it’s been really good. “They fully deserve it, and that’s the sport. If somebody is better, you have to accept it and try to reach that level.” The Gunners were beaten 2-1 by Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday to end their bid to win the tournament for the first time. It was a painful loss for Arsenal, who created a host of chances in the early stages of the second leg but could not find a way past inspired PSG keeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. After finishing as runners-up to Manchester City for the previous two seasons, the north Londoners remain without a title since 2004. Liverpool are in cruise control in the Premier League with a 15-point gap to Arsenal in second. The Gunners themselves are only six points from slipping out of the Champions League qualification positions. Mathematically, the Gunners could finish as low as seventh, which would also mean they finish outside the Europa League qualification spots. “Both teams look forward to playing this game. Difficult to predict,” Reds boss Slot said when asked what kind of game he expects. “There is a little bit at stake for Arsenal, as I presume they would rather finish second than third or fourth. Difficult to predict if it will be edgy, but it is a game to look forward to.” A month to remember ❤️ Alexis Mac Allister is April’s@EASPORTSFCPlayer of the Month 💪#PLAwardspic.twitter.com/32PsArRp6D — Premier League (@premierleague)May 9, 2025 The sides shared a 2-2 draw at Emirates Stadium in October. Bukayo Saka and Mikel Merino twice gave the Gunners the lead, with Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah coming up with the equalisers. Arsenal’s failure to sign a striker in the January transfer window was a big blow in a season marred by long injury absences for Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka at various stages. “In January, it was clear or not? I made a very clear statement, and the statement continues the same. I want the best team, the best players. If we have three goal scorers over 25, bring them in, we’re going to be a much better team, yes,” Arteta said. “We are there, we are providing the numbers that win you titles. We have to be a little bit luckier, but still do better to make sure that nobody has a season better than you.” Arsenal have not won at Anfield since 2012 – a match that Arteta played in for the Gunners. The north Londoners are, however, on a five-match unbeaten run against the Reds, winning two of those. Right-back Conor Bradley will start the match, as revealed by Slot inhis pre-match news conference. Trent Alexander-Arnold, who has announced he will leave the club this summer, is set to be named among the subs as a result. Joe Gomez is the only other major absentee for the Reds. Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel Magalhaes, Takehiro Tomiyasu and Kai Havertz all remain sidelined for the Gunners. However, midfielder Jorginho has returned to the match day squad following an injury.",

    "title": "China, US hold talks on tariffs in first bid to de-escalate trade war",
    "article_text": "China’s trade envoy He Lifeng met United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland for talks aimed at easing atrade warbetween the superpowers that is roiling global markets. The talks ended late on Saturday and will continue on Sunday, according to a source familiar with the talks, the Reuters news agency reported. The first official engagement, since the US slapped a 145 percent tariff on Chinese goods, prompting a retaliatory 125 percent duty from China, began earlier Saturday at an undisclosed location in Geneva, Switzerland, according to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua. A motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in the suburb of Cologny, The Associated Press news agency reported. A diplomatic source, speaking to AP on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon. The talks then continued into the evening. The trade dispute, which effectively amounts to a mutual boycott of products, was prompted by US PresidentDonald Trumplast month when he announced sweeping duties on almost every country in the world, which are now subject to a 90-day reprieve while negotiations take place. Experts believeChinamay be looking for the same 90-day waiver as well as a reduction of the 145 percent tariff – Trump suggested that it could be reduced to 80 percent, saying in a Truth Social post on Friday that the amount “seems right”. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said on Friday that the US would not lower tariffs unilaterally, adding that China would need to make concessions as well. Bessent has said the meetings in Switzerland would focus on “de-escalation”. “The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the … tariffs at the same time,” said Sun Yun, director of the China programme at the Washington, DC-based Stimson Center, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. “It cannot just be words,” she said. Trump has justified the punitive tariff by citing unfair trade practices and accusing Beijing of failing to curb the export of chemicals used to produce fentanyl, a lethal synthetic opioid. China, for its part, says it will not bow to “imperialists” and bullies. With distrust running high, both sides have been keen not to appear weak, and economic analysts have low expectations of a breakthrough. Trump has suggested the discussions were initiated by China. Beijing said the US requested the discussions and that China’s policy of opposing US tariffs had not changed. Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin met both parties in Geneva on Friday and said the fact that the talks were taking place was already a success. “If a roadmap can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions,” he told reporters on Friday.",

    "title": "My nephew asks if he will eat meat only in heaven. I struggle to answer",
    "article_text": "When on March 2, we heard all crossings into Gaza were closed, we thought it would not last more than two weeks. We really wanted a normal Ramadan where we could invite our surviving relatives for iftar and not worry about what food we could find to break our fast. But it did not turn out this way. We spent the holy month breaking our fast with canned food. My family, like most families in Gaza, had not stocked up on food or essentials, as no one expected the crossings to close again, or the famine – or even the war – to return. In the days after the closure, food and other basic goods disappeared from the markets, and prices skyrocketed. A kilogramme of any vegetable jumped to $8 or more, sugar $22 and baby formula $11. A sack of flour previously costing $8, went up to $50; within two months, it reached $300. Most people in Gaza could not afford these prices. As a result, families, including my own, began reducing the number of meals they eat, limiting themselves to just breakfast and dinner, and shrinking each person’s portion – half a loaf of bread for breakfast a whole one for dinner. Men, women, elderly people and children would stand in front of bakeries and charity kitchens for hours, in shame and sorrow, just to get a few loaves of bread or a small plate of food. For some families, this would be their only food for the day. All the residents of central Gaza, where I live, relied on only three bakeries: two in Nuseirat and one in Deir el-Balah. The crowds at these bakeries were overwhelming, blocking roads and halting movement in the area. Every day, there were cases of fainting and suffocation due to the pushing and shoving. In the end, only a small number of those who waited since morning would get bread. My father would go to the bakery before sunrise to line up, instead of using what’s left of our flour, because we did not know how long this situation would last. But he would find the line already long, dozens having slept outside the bakery. He would stay until noon, then send my brother to take his place in the line. In the end, they would return with nothing. On March 31, the World Food Programme announced the closure of all of its bakeries, including the three we could access, due to the depletion of flour and the lack of gas needed to run the ovens. This marked the start of true famine. Soon, charity kitchens started closing as well because they ran out of food stock. Dozens of them shuttered in the past week alone. People grew even more desperate, many taking to local groups on Facebook or Telegram to beg for anyone to sell them a bag of flour at a reasonable price. We live in a “lucky” neighbourhood where the kitchen still functions. My niece Dana, who is eight years old, lines up in front of it every day with her friends, waiting for her turn as if it were a game. If she receives a single scoop of food, she comes back running, feeling very proud of herself. And if her turn doesn’t come before the food runs out, she returns in tears, complaining about how unfair this world is. One day during Ramadan, a boy, displaced with his family to the al-Mufti School near our home, was so desperately trying to get food that he fell into the pot of hot food the charity kitchen was cooking. He suffered severe burns and later died from them. The signs of famine began becoming apparent everywhere about a month and a half after the closure of the crossings. We see them in every aspect of our lives – sleeping on an empty stomach, rapid weight loss within, pale faces, weak bodies. Climbing stairs now takes us twice the effort. It has become easier to get sick and more difficult to recover. My nephews, 18-month-old Musab and two-year-old Mohammed, developed high fever and flu-like symptoms during Ramadan. It took them a whole month to get better because of the lack of food and medicine. My mother has been suffering from severe vision loss due to complications after eye surgery she had in late February. The malnutrition and the lack of eye drops she needed to recover have made her condition much worse. I myself have been unwell. I donated blood to al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat just days before the border was closed and this seriously affected my physical health. Now, I suffer from extreme weakness in my body, weight loss and difficulty focusing. When I went to the doctor, he told me to stop eating canned food and to eat more fruit and meat. He knew that what he was saying was impossible to do, but what else could he say? Perhaps the most difficult part about this situation is having to explain famine to little children. My nieces and nephews cannot stop asking for things to eat that we simply cannot provide. We struggle to convince them that we are not punishing them by hiding food, but that we simply do not have it. Five-year-old Khaled keeps asking for meat every day while looking at food pictures on his mother’s phone. He stares at the images and asks whether his martyred father gets to eat all this in heaven. Then he asks when his own turn will come, to join his father and eat with him. We struggle to answer. We tell him to be patient and that his patience will be rewarded. I feel helpless seeing daily scenes of famine and desperation. I ask myself, how can the world stay silent while seeing children’s bodies go thin and fragile and the sick and injured die slowly? The occupation uses every method to kill us – by bombing, starvation, or disease. We have been reduced to begging for a piece of bread. The entire world watches and pretends that it cannot even give us that. The views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.",

    "title": "US to fast-track investments from Middle East before Trump trip: Report",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump’s administration has reportedly discussed the possibility of expediting investments by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar before his trip to the region next week. The early-stage talks were reported first by Bloomberg News. Any such development would require the US government to reform the Committee for Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), an interagency organisation led by the US Department of the Treasury, and which also includes representatives from the Departments of Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security and State that review foreign real-estate investments to evaluate if any prose a national security risk. While it is not clear what a reform would entail, the goal would be to fast-track investments from these countries, with whom Trump had fostered a close working relationship during his first term, and bring in billions of dollars into the US economy. The president might announce more information about the status of the changes and what it entails during his visit, which begins May 13. Five of the top 10 most active wealth funds come from these three countries. Three of those five funds are in the UAE. In March, UAE National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed met the president and later committed $1.4 trillion in investments to the US over a 10-year period. The commitment includes investments in sectors such as artificial intelligence, energy, and aluminium manufacturing, including the first new aluminium smelter in the US in 35 years. It also includes a $1.2bn mining partnership with Abu Dhabi-based ADQ, a sovereign wealth fund, and the New York City-based investment firm Orion Resource Partners to mine for “critical minerals” in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The largest segment of the proposed investment is in artificial intelligence. An Abu Dhabi-based investment fund called MGX has promised to invest $100bn in a data centre and energy infrastructure to support AI development in the United States. In January, in less than a week of Trump taking office, Saudi Arabia pledged to spend $600bn in the US over the next four years. Trump later said at the World Economic Forum in Davos in Switzerland, that he pushed the country to invest $1 trillion in the economy. Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have a close relationship, which the two developed during Trump’s first term in office. Qatar already had a strong investment relationship with the US. In 2015, the Qatar Investment Authority pledged a $35bn investment and opened offices in New York and Washington to facilitate the investments. QIA later committed $45bn in 2019. Some of QIA’s most notable investments include $200m in EatJust, an alternative meat and egg brand, and major real-estate investments in New York City, including a 10 percent stake in the Empire State Building. Despite no direct involvement of the Trump Organization — the private company housing the Trump family-owned brands, including Trump Hotels and Golf Resorts – Trump’s upcoming trip and the proposed fast-tracking of investments have raised concerns of conflict of interest. A month after winning the US election, the Trump Organization announced it had leased its brand to two new real estate projects in Saudi Arabia. The president’s company also has projects and developments in all three of the countries he is set to visit, and that might receive fast-track status for investments. “This trip, where Trumpwill meet with foreign officials who have the ability to make decisions affecting his company and business partners, poses enormous conflicts of interest for Trump, whose company is engaged in significantly more foreign business than during his first term”, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington wrote in a note published on Thursday. On April 30, the Trump Organization, whose real-estate development arm is led by his son Eric, announced a new luxury golf resort in Qatar. Unlike in the first Trump administration, the Trump Organization said in advance of Trump’s inauguration in January that it would not shy away from foreign property investments.",

    "title": "Children among 21 killed in Israel’s attacks on Gaza amid aid blockade",
    "article_text": "At least 21 people, including several children, have been killed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip since dawn amid a months-long Israeli blockade that has deepenedthe humanitarian crisisin the war-torn coastal enclave. Four Palestinians were killed and others were wounded Saturday evening after an Israeli airstrike targeted a tent sheltering displaced families in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip. Earlier, Palestinian news agency Wafa said Israeli warplanes bombed a tent in the Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City on Saturday morning, killing five members of the Tlaib family. “Three children, their mother and her husband were sleeping inside a tent and were bombed by an [Israeli] occupation aircraft,” family member Omar Abu al-Kass told the AFP news agency. The strikes came “without warning and without having done anything wrong”, added Abu al-Kass, who said he was the children’s maternal grandfather. In parallel, a drone attack on Gaza City’s Tuffah neighbourhood left six people dead and one more in the Sheikh Radwan area of the city where Israel bombed an apartment belonging to the Zaqout family. Further south, Wafa said Israeli gunboats opened “heavy fire” on the shores of Rafah, killing a man identified as Mohammed Saeed al-Bardawil. Two more civilians were injured in an attack on the al-Mawasi humanitarian zone, west of Rafah. In the past 24 hours, at least 23 Palestinians have been killed and 124 others injured in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip, according to the enclave’s Health Ministry. The attacks came amid Israel’s continuing refusal to allow vital supplies into Gaza since March 2, leaving the enclave’s 2.3 million residents dependent on a dwindling number of charity kitchens, which have been shutting down in recent days as food runs out. Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary said: “There’s barely food … We’re talking about bakeries not operating, we’re talking about zero distribution points and we’re talking about only a few hot meal kitchens still operating.” Khoudary said people queueing for hours would often leave empty-handed, with remaining kitchens stretching out food that would previously have fed 100 to serve up to 2,000 people. “We’re seeing more people dying, we’re seeing more children dying due to malnutrition and the lack of food. But it’s not only the lack of food, it’s also the lack of medical supplies, it’s the lack of fuel, cooking gas and it’s the lack of everything,” she said. Among the charities shuttering operations, the United States-basedWorld Central Kitchensaid on Wednesday that it had been forced to close down because it no longer had supplies to bake bread or cook meals. The United Nations’ Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for the blockade to be lifted. “Children are starving, and dying. Community kitchens are shutting down. Clean water is running out,” it said on Friday in a post on X. The blockade is also having a devastating effect on people with chronic illnesses, depriving Palestinians who suffer from diabetes, cancer and rare conditions, of life-saving medication. Reporting from Gaza City, Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud said: “Doctors here say the tragedy is not in what’s happening, but in what is preventable.” “These diseases have a treatment, but people of Gaza no longer have access to them, and they say that this is not just a failure of logistics, but of humanity,” he added. Mahmoud spoke to the father of a 10-year-old boy suffering from diabetes, who said insulin was not available across northern Gaza. “I spend entire days searching pharmacies, hoping to find it. Sometimes we hear that individuals might have it, so I go to their homes to barter,” he said. Said al-Soudy, head of emergency in the oncology department of Gaza City’s Al Helou International Hospital, told Al Jazeera: “A large part of patients are struggling to find their essential medications. Without them, their health conditions deteriorate and may become life-threatening.” Pharmacist Rana Alsamak told Al Jazeera that Palestinians were unable to obtain medication for “multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis, chronic illnesses and … immune-related diseases”. “These conditions now go largely untreated,” she said. On Friday, the United States said it was establishing theGaza Humanitarian Foundationto coordinate aid deliveries into Gaza, with Israel providing military security for operations. The United Nations rejected the move, saying it would weaponise aid, violate principles of neutrality and cause mass displacement.",

    "title": "Qatar leads Syria search for bodies of US hostages killed by ISIL: Report",
    "article_text": "A Qatari mission has begun searching for the remains of United States hostages killed by the ISIL (ISIS) armed group in Syria about 10 years ago, according to the Reuters news agency, citing two sources briefed on the mission. Qatar’s International Search and Rescue Group began the search on Wednesday, with the help of several US nationals who wished to remain anonymous, the news agency reported. So far, three unidentified bodies have been found by the group, according to the sources. The mission’s focus was on locating the body of aid worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded by ISIL in 2014 in Dabiq, northern Syria, a Syrian security source told Reuters. US aid worker Kayla Mueller as well as US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were among other Western hostages killed by ISIL. Foley and Sotloff were confirmed killed in 2014. Mueller’s killing was confirmed in 2015. “We’re grateful for anyone taking on this task and risking their lives in some circumstances to try and find the bodies of Jim and the other hostages,” said Diane Foley, James Foley’s mother. “We thank all those involved in this effort.” The Qatari mission is getting under way as US President Donald Trump prepares to visit Doha and other Gulf Arab capitals next week and as Syria’s new government seeks relief from sanctions imposed by the US. Washington, along with some other Western governments, has said it will wait to see how the new authorities exercise their power and ensure human rights before lifting any sanctions. The United Kingdom last monthremoved its sanctionson 12 Syrian government entities, including the Ministries of Defence and Interior and the General Intelligence Directorate. ISIL once controlled vast swaths of Syria and Iraq, ruling over millions of people. At the peak of its power from 2014-2017, it beheaded numerous people in captivity, including Western hostages, and released videos of the killings. A coalition of more than 80 countries, led by the US, was formed to fight ISIL in September 2014. The war against the group officially ended in March 2019, when US-backed and Kurdish-led fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces captured the eastern Syrian town of Baghouz, the last sliver of land ISIL controlled. Plans for the Qatari mission were discussed during a visit to Washington in April by Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani and State Minister Mohammed Al Khulaifi – a trip also designed to prepare for Trump’s visit to Qatar, one of the sources told Reuters. Another person familiar with the issue said there had been a longstanding commitment by successive US administrations to find the remains of the murdered US nationals, and that there had been multiple previous “efforts with US government officials on the ground in Syria to search very specific areas”. The person did not elaborate, the report said. But the US has had hundreds of soldiers deployed in northeastern Syria that have continued pursuing ISIL’s remnants. The person said the remains of Kassig, Sotloff and Foley were most likely located in this part of the country. Mueller’s case was different as she was in the custody of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the person added. Two ISIL members, both former UK citizens who were part of a cell dubbed the “Beatles” that beheaded US hostages, are serving life prison sentences in the US.",

    "title": "Pakistan launches Operation Bunyan Marsoos: What we know so far",
    "article_text": "Islamabad, Pakistan –India and Pakistan fired missiles at each other’s military bases on Saturday morning, the latest escalation in their rapid drift towards an all-out war. Pakistan accused India of carrying out attacks inside its territory for the fourth consecutive night, launching ballistic missile strikes on at least three air bases. Islamabad said that in response, it launched a major military campaign, “Operation Bunyan Marsoos” (Arabic for “a structure made of lead”) targeting at least six Indian military bases. India, in turn, accused Pakistan of being the aggressor. Indian military officials claimed Pakistan had targeted several Indian military bases and that its missiles into Pakistani territory were in response. Yet, regardless of who hit the other first on May 10, the very fact that India and Pakistan had struck each other’s military bases over such a wide swath of territory, well beyond Kashmir – the disputed region that they each partly control – means that the conflict has now veered into almost unknown territory. Never have the South Asian rivals attacked each other on this scale outside the four wars they have fought. Here is what we know so far about India’s attacks, Pakistan’s response, what both countries and global powers like the United States are saying, and the background to this intensifying conflict. Pakistan said that India launched a salvo of drones into Pakistan, followed by ballistic missile strikes on at least three major airbases. The Pakistani bases India targeted are: Pakistan said that in response, it launched aerial attacks against multiple Indian military bases. The bases known to have been targeted are: At a media briefing, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri accused Pakistan of provocations and escalations, claiming that New Delhi was only responding to its neighbour’s actions. He was joined by Colonel Sofia Qureshi of the Indian Army and Wing Commander Vyomika Singh of the Indian Air Force, who shared New Delhi’s version of events. Pakistan, Qureshi said, used “drones, long-range weapons, loitering munitions and fighter aircrafts to target civilian areas and military infrastructure”. “Pakistan military also resorted to air intrusions using drones and firing of heavy calibre weapons along the Line of Control,” she said. Loitering munitions, also known as suicide drones, are remote-controlled and designed to crash into their targets. The Line of Control is the de facto border between Indian and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. While India said it had shot down most incoming missiles and drones, Qureshi and Singh conceded that the air force bases in Udhampur, Pathankot, Adampur and Bhuj did suffer “limited damage”. India, however, rejected suggestions that any bases had suffered any significant damage, with the military releasing time-stamped photos of the facilities in support of its assertion. Pakistan’s military had on Thursday claimed that the Udhampur and Pathankot bases had been “destroyed.” Indian officials said at least five people had been killed by Pakistani missile fire on Saturday. As the neighbours traded missile fire and allegations, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with General Syed Asim Munir, Pakistan’s army chief and widely regarded as the country’s most powerful figure, as well as with the Indian foreign minister, S Jaishankar. According to the US State Department, Rubio urged both parties to seek ways to “deescalate” and offered American assistance in launching constructive dialogue to avoid further conflict. Pakistan’s military response on Thursday followed four days of consecutive Indian attacks inside its territory and came two weeks after a deadly assault on tourists in the scenic town of Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir on April 22. The attack killed 26 men, all civilians. India blamed armed groups it alleges are backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad has denied, calling instead for an “impartial, transparent” investigation that New Delhi has rejected. Multiple witness accounts suggest the gunmen segregated the men from the women, then selected and killed non-Muslims. India initiated strikes on May 7, targeting areas inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. It claimed to have destroyed “terrorist infrastructure” and eliminated at least “100 terrorists”. It called its attacks Operation Sindoor, a reference to the vermilion – sindoor in Hindi – the red pigment many married Hindu women apply to their foreheads. The mission’s name was an allusion to the manner in which gunmen killed tourists in Pahalgam. Pakistan reported that the Indian strikes killed 33 people, including several children, and injured more than 50. It denied that any of the dead were fighters, as India claimed. As the attacks unfolded, Pakistan deployed its air force in response, engaging in a battle with the Indian Air Force (IAF). Pakistan’s military claimed it downed five Indian jets, including three Rafales, the French-made aircraft considered the IAF’s most advanced assets. India has neither confirmed nor denied the losses. India responded by deploying drones and loitering munitions on May 9 and 10, hitting at least a dozen targets across Pakistan, including major urban centres such as Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi. India said the drone strikes were in response to Pakistan’s use of drones, a claim Islamabad continues to reject. “There is no credence to their claims. They continue to lie. Their allegation is false. Otherwise, where is their evidence?” Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, Pakistan’s military spokesperson, told Al Jazeera during a news briefing in Rawalpindi on Friday. He added that Pakistan’s response to “Indian aggression” would come at a “time, method, and place of our choosing”. That time came on the morning of May 10. Pakistan’s operation is titled Bunyan Marsoos, an Arabic phrase that translates as “a structure made of lead”. The phrase originates from the Quran: “Truly God loves those who fight in His cause in battle array, as if they were a solid cemented structure.” In its Quranic context, the phrase symbolises unity and strength among believers fighting for a righteous cause. Experts have repeatedly warned of the need for immediate de-escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours before the situation becomes “irreversible”. India said on May 10 that it was willing to stop the cycle of escalation if Pakistan reciprocated. But Kamran Bokhari, senior director at the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said Indian strikes on Pakistani airbases had dramatically escalated the conflict. “With Pindi being hit and other airbases such as the one in Sargodha, the war has taken a turn for the worse,” he told Al Jazeera. “We are now looking at a much bigger-scale war.” Muhammad Faisal, a South Asia security analyst at the University of Technology Sydney, said Pakistan was left with little choice but to respond forcefully. “Pakistan can employ its latest jets in standoff mode or launch long-range missile strikes on Indian airbases that bypass air defences. During the last three days, both sides have significantly mapped each other’s air defences, and now the next round of escalation is here,” he told Al Jazeera.",

    "article_text": "The Pakistan Cricket Board has postponed its Pakistan Super League T20 cricket tournament following rising military tensions between India and Pakistan. The PCB said it acted on advice from Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “Cricket, while being a unifying force and a source of joy, must take a respectful pause,” the PCB said in a statement on Friday evening. The PCB had earlier confirmed that it would relocate the eight remaining PSL matches to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, citing growing concerns among overseas players and the need to prioritise their safety. The latest announcement, however, said the PSL was being postponed and gave no indication of whether this year’s edition would resume. The cities of Rawalpindi, Multan and Lahore had been scheduled to host the remaining PSL games. On Thursday, an Indian drone fell inside the complex of the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium hours before the start of a PSL game in which several cricketers from New Zealand, Australia, the West Indies, South Africa and England were due to compete. PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the interior minister in the Pakistan government, held meetings with foreign cricketers and six franchise owners of the PSL before initially saying the tournament was being moved to Dubai. England cricketer Sam Billings, New Zealand’s Colin Munro, South African Rilee Rossouw and Jason Holder of the West Indies were among 43 foreign cricketers competing in the PSL. “We have sincere regard for the mental well-being of participating players and the sentiments of our foreign players, and we respect the concerns of their families who want to see them back home,” the PCB statement said. The PSL, in its 10th edition, started in the UAE in 2016. The UAE hosted the first two editions of the PSL, except for the final in 2017, and also some of the games in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Munro’s Islamabad United are the defending champions in the six-team league. Rossouw’s Quetta Gladiators lead the points table and have already qualified for the playoff stage while Multan Sultans, led by Pakistan’s Mohammad Rizwan, were eliminated after losing eight of their nine league games. The three other teams are Peshawar Zalmi, captained by Babar Azam; Karachi Kings, skippered by Australian David Warner and Lahore Qalandars. TheIndian Premier League was suspended for a week, the Board of Control for Cricket in India said on Friday, in a similar move amid the current tensions in the region.",

    "article_text": "Jamal Murray scored 27 points, and the host Denver Nuggets dominated in overtime to beat the Oklahoma City Thunder 113-104 in Game 3 of their Western Conference second-round playoff series. Nikola Jokic missed all 10 of his 3-point attempts in Friday’s matchup and finished 8-for-25 from the field but ended the night with 20 points and 16 rebounds for the Nuggets, who lead the best-of-seven series 2-1. Game 4 is on Sunday afternoon in Denver. Aaron Gordon scored 22 points, including a tying bucket in the final minute of regulation, and Michael Porter Jr went 5-for-6 from deep and finished with 21 points for the Nuggets, who finished 39-for-85 from the field (45.9 percent). “We’ve been in this situation before, we stayed poised,” Porter said about Denver’s ability to win close games. “[Aaron Gordon] hit that big 3 to send it to overtime, like he’s done all playoffs. Huge win.” Jalen Williams scored 32 points for Oklahoma City, who were 1-for-7 from the field in overtime with two turnovers. Chet Holmgren had 18 points and 16 rebounds, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Isaiah Hartenstein had 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder, who were 40-for-104 (38.5 percent) from the field. “One thing that it takes to be a great team is you get taken to the limit in the playoffs, and you’ve got to rise to the challenges that you’re confronted with,” Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault said. “This team’s made a habit of doing that repeatedly. I have full confidence we’ll continue to do that, but we have to embrace what this is.” Jokic opened overtime with a layup, and Porter drained a 3-pointer to make it 107-102. Williams missed a floater and had a turnover, which led to Murray’s layup with 3:02 left. Holmgren’s dunk with 1:56 left was Oklahoma City’s only basket in overtime, and the Nuggets closed it out. “I think, late in the games, you can rely on what you’ve seen and felt and done,” Nuggets head coach David Adelman said about the team’s playoff experience. “You can feel a game that maybe you played a couple of years ago.” Gilgeous-Alexander went 7-for-22 from the field but put the Thunder ahead 93-92 with his first 3-pointer of the night with 7:33 left in the fourth. Oklahoma City led 95-93 after Murray split a pair of free throws with 5:58 left, and both teams went cold from the field. Gilgeous-Alexander missed three straight shots, and Denver tied it on Gordon’s two free throws with 4:26 remaining. Williams hit a layup, and Murray tied it at 97 with two free throws and put Denver ahead with a 17-footer with 2:17 left. Luguentz Dort gave Oklahoma City back in front with a 3-pointer – his only points of the night – Murray was called for a travel with 1:31 remaining, and Williams made a pair of free throws to make it 102-99. Gordon’s 3-pointer tied it with 27.5 seconds left, Gilgeous-Alexander missed a floater, and Jokic’s 20-footer at the buzzer was off, sending it to overtime. In an earlier playoff matchup on Friday, Donovan Mitchell scored 43 points to lift the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 126-104 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series in Indianapolis. The top-seeded Cavaliers outscored Indiana by a 34-13 margin in the second quarter en route to cutting their deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Game 4 is on Sunday in Indianapolis. Mitchell, who added nine rebounds, made 14 of 29 shots from the floor and 10 of 14 from the free throw line. The six-time All-Star drained five 3-pointers on 13 attempts after entering the contest just 2-for-18 from beyond the arc. Cleveland’s Max Strus collected 20 points and seven rebounds, Jarrett Allen had 19 and 12, and reigning Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley added 18 and 13, respectively, in his return from a one-game absence caused by a sprained left ankle. Darius Garland finished with just 10 points while being plagued by foul trouble. He was playing his first game since April 23, having recovered from a toe injury. “[We were] down 2-0,” Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said. “It’s kind of now or never. You’re banged up and you’re hurting … They had to test it today. They showed a lot of fortitude. We have one day of recovery here, so it’s a quick turnaround, and they can turn it around and be ready to go.” Cleveland held a decisive 56-37 edge in rebounds, including an 18-4 advantage on the offensive end. Indiana’s Bennedict Mathurin scored 23 points off the bench, and Pascal Siakam added 18. Star Tyrese Haliburton was limited to just four points on 2-of-8 shooting for the fourth-seeded Pacers. Cleveland will try to level the series when the Pacers host Game 4 on Sunday.",

    "title": "European leaders in Ukraine’s Kyiv press Russia for 30-day ceasefire",
    "article_text": "European leaders have have held talks in Ukraine with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in an attempt to put pressure on Russia to agree to a 30-day ceasefire as a step to end the three-year conflict, threatening Moscow with “massive sanctions” if it refuses. French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer arrived in Kyiv together by train from neighbouring Poland on Saturday. Later, they were joined by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The demand was announced by the visiting leaders in a joint news conference with Zelenskyy. A “coalition of the willing”, a group of more than 30 countries, have pledged to buttress Ukraine to fend off Russian aggression and occupation. The proposed ceasefire, to begin on Monday, would include a halt to fighting on land, sea and in the air. The European leaders threatened to ratchet up sanctions, including on Russia’s energy and banking sectors, if Russian President Vladimir Putin did not comply. A force comprised of foreign troops could also be deployed as an added “reassurance” measure, Macron said. He added that the United States would take the lead in monitoring a proposed cease-fire, with support from European countries. Starmer said, “only one country started this illegal conflict, and that was Russia and Putin, and only one country stands in the way of resolving it peacefully, and that is Russia and Putin”. The Kremlin then accused those European countries of making confrontational statements in Kyiv, the Russian Interfax news agency reported. “We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying. Later Saturday, Russia said it will consider the proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, while Moscow has its own position, the TASS news agency said, citing Peskov. United States President Donald Trump has proposed a 30-day unconditional ceasefire as a step to end the conflict. But Putin has resisted so far. Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said earlier Saturday that his country and its allies are ready for a “full, unconditional ceasefire” with Russia for at least 30 days starting on Monday. It is the first time the leaders of the four European nations have made a joint visit to Ukraine. “There is a lot of work to do, a lot of topics to discuss. We must end this war with a just peace. We must force Moscow to agree to a ceasefire,” said Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, posting photographs welcoming the leaders off the train. More than three years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the hugely symbolic show of European unity comes a day after Putin struck a defiant tone at a Moscow parade marking 80 years since victory in World War II. Reporting from Kyiv, Al Jazeera’s Zein Basravi said the quartet’s visit was “symbolic”, practical meetings were taking place, and the leaders were trying to “keep the US on side moving forward with any sort of talks”. After the meeting, Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the five leaders held a phone call with Trump to discuss their peace efforts. “If Russia agrees and effective monitoring is ensured, a durable ceasefire and confidence-building measures can pave the way to peace negotiations,” Sybiha said on X. Following the Coalition of the Willing meeting in Kyiv, all five leaders@ZelenskyyUa@EmmanuelMacron@bundeskanzler@donaldtusk@Keir_Starmerhad a fruitful call with@POTUSfocused on peace efforts. Ukraine and all allies are ready for a full unconditional ceasefire on land,…pic.twitter.com/MEfbtjtE4m — Andrii Sybiha 🇺🇦 (@andrii_sybiha)May 10, 2025 “Alongside the US, we call on Russia to agree [to] a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to create the space for talks on a just and lasting peace,” the leaders said in a statement in advance of the visit. “We are ready to support peace talks as soon as possible, to discuss technical implementation of the ceasefire, and prepare for a full peace deal,” they added. The statement said: “The bloodshed must end, Russia must stop its illegal invasion, and Ukraine must be able to prosper as a safe, secure and sovereign nation within its internationally recognised borders for generations to come.” The leaders promised to continue to increase their support for Ukraine, saying, “Until Russia agrees to an enduring ceasefire, we will ratchet up pressure on Russia’s war machine.” Peskov said in an interview with the ABC News channel on Saturday that arms deliveries from Ukraine’s allies must stop for Russia to agree to a ceasefire. A truce would otherwise be an “advantage for Ukraine” at a time when “Russian troops are advancing … in quite a confident way” on the front, Peskov said, adding that Ukraine was “not ready for immediate negotiations”. Russia has occupied about a fifth of Ukrainian territory and has yet to respond to the pressure for an enduring ceasefire. Trump has also said Ukraine will have to consider giving up territory, such as the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula, but has expressed growing impatience with Russia’s refusal to halt the fighting.",

    "title": "Netanyahu’s war choices fuel discord in Israel over captives’ fate in Gaza",
    "article_text": "To prioritise the release of the captives in Gaza, or to continue fighting what critics are calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “forever war” – that is the question increasingly dividing Israel. Israel’s government, laser-focused on the idea of a total victory against Hamas in Gaza, appears to be opting for the latter. And that is only increasing the criticism Netanyahu has received since October 2023, firstly for his government’s failure to stop the October 7 attack, and then for failing to end a now 19-month war, or provide a clear vision for what the “day after” in Gaza will look like. Netanyahu’s decision in March to unilaterally end a ceasefire instead of continuing with an agreement that would have brought home the remaining captives has widened the cracks within Israeli society, as opponents realised that the likelihood of the captives leaving Gaza alive was becoming more remote. In recent weeks, a wave of open letter writing from within military units has emerged protesting the government’s priorities. The discontent has also gained traction with the public.Earlier this month, thousands of Israelis gatheredoutside the Ministry of Defence in Tel Aviv to protest against Netanyahu’s decision to call up a further 60,000 reservists as part of his escalation against the bombed out and besieged Palestinian enclave of Gaza, where his forces have already killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children. In mid-April, current and former members of the air force, considered one of Israel’s elite units, also released a letter, claiming the war served the “political and personal interests” of Netanyahu, “and not security ones”. Prompted by the air force, similar protests came from members of the navy, elite units within the military and Israel’s foreign security agency, Mossad. Political and personal interests Accusations that Netanyahu is manipulating the war for his own personal ends predate the breaking of the ceasefire. In the minds of his critics, the longer the war continues, the longer Netanyahu feels he can defend himself against the numerous threats to his position and even his freedom. In addition to facing trial on numerous counts ofcorruption dating back to 2019, he also faces calls to hold an inquiry into the government’s political failings before the October 7 attack. Netanyahu also faces accusations that members of his office have allegedly been taking payment from Qatar – the Gulf state has previously dismissed the allegations as a “smear campaign” intended to hinder efforts to mediate an end to the conflict. The continuation of the war allows Netanyahu to distract from those issues, while maintaining a coalition with far-right parties who have made it clear that any end to the war without total victory – which increasingly appears to include the ethnic cleansing of Gaza – would result in their departure from government, and Netanyahu’s likely fall. And so there are questions about whether Netanyahu’s announcement of a further escalation in Gaza, including the occupation of territory and displacement of its population, will mark an end to the conflict, or simply bog Israel down in the kind of forever war that has so far been to Netanyahu’s benefit. ‘I don’t know if they’re capable of occupying the territory,” former US Special Forces commander, Colonel Seth Krummrich of international security firm Global Guardian told Al Jazeera, “Gaza is just going to soak up people, and that’s before you even think about guarding northern Israel, confronting Iran or guarding the Israeli street,” he said, warning of the potential shortfall in reservists. “It’s also competing with a tide of growing [domestic] toxicity. When soldiers don’t return home, or don’t go, that’s going to tear at the fabric of Israeli society. It plays out at every dinner table.” Staying at home Israeli media reports suggest that part of that toxicity is playing out in the number of reservists simply not showing up for duty. The majority of those refusing service are thought to be “grey refusers”. That is, reservists with no ideological objection to the mass killings in Gaza, but rather ones exhausted by repeated tours, away from their families and jobs to support a war with no clear end. Official numbers of reservists refusing duty are unknown. However, in mid-March, the Israeli national broadcaster, Kan, ran a report disputing official numbers, which claimed that more than 80 percent of those called up for duty had attended, suggesting that the actual figure was closer to 60 percent. “There has been a steady increase in refusal among reservists,” a spokesperson for the organisation New Profile, which supports people refusing enlistment, said. “However, we often see sharp spikes in response to specific shifts in Israeli government policy, such as the violation of the most recent ceasefire or public statements by officials indicating that the primary objective of the military campaign is no longer the return of hostages and ‘destruction of Hamas’, as initially claimed, but rather the occupation of Gaza, and its ethnic cleansing.” Also unaddressed is growing public discontent over the ultra-religious Haredi community, whose eight-decade exemption frommilitary service was deemed illegalby the Supreme Court in June of last year. Despite the shortfall in reservists reporting for duty and others having experienced repeated deployments, in April, the Supreme Court requested an explanation from Netanyahu – who relies upon Haredi support to maintain his coalition – as to why its ruling had not been fully implemented or enforced. Throughout the war, Netanyahu’s escalations, while often resisted by the captives’ families and their allies, have been cheered on and encouraged by his allies among the far-right, many of whom claim a biblical right to the homes and land of Palestinians. The apparent conflict between the welfare of the captives and the “total victory” promised by Netanyahu has run almost as long as the conflict itself, with each moment of division seemingly strengthening the prime minister’s position through the critical support of the ultranationalist elements of his cabinet. Netanyahu’s position has led to conflict with politicians, including his own former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant. While Gallant wasn’t opposed to the war in principle – his active support for Netanyahu eventually led to him joining Netanyahu in facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for war crimes – his prioritisation of the captives put him at odds with the prime minister. The divide over priorities has meant that civility between the government and the captives’ families has increasingly gone out the window, with Netanyahu generally avoiding meeting families with loved ones still captive in Gaza, and far-right politicians engaging in shouting matches with them during meetings in parliament. Division within Israeli society was not new, Professor Yossi Mekelberg of Chatham House told Al Jazeera, “but wars and conflicts deepen them”. “Now we have a situation where some people have served anywhere up to 400 days in the army [as reservists], while others are refusing to serve at all and exploiting their political power within the coalition to do so,” Mekelberg added. “Elsewhere, there are ministers on the extreme right talking about ‘sacrificing’ the hostages for military gain,” something Mekelberg said many regarded as running counter to much of the founding principles of the country and the Jewish faith. “There’s such toxicity in public discourse,” Mekelberg continued, “We see toxicity against anyone who criticises the war or the prime minister, division between the secular and the religious, and then even divisions within the religious movements.”",

    "title": "After Israel’s bombs, Nabatieh’s Monday Market revives itself once again",
    "article_text": "Nabatieh, Lebanon –It is a bitterly cold February morning, and Sanaa Khreiss tugs her cardigan tighter as she begins unloading her van. The sharp bite of early spring has kept most people away from the Nabatieh souk, but not Sanaa and her husband, Youssef. The market is quiet as the sun breaks through the grey clouds, except for a few vendors setting up. Sanaa, who has sold at this spot for the past four years, moves with the calm precision of someone who has perfected her craft over time. She arranges the lingerie she sells, piece by piece, carefully lining them up, each addition bringing a touch of colour and vibrancy to her stall. The soft murmur of voices grows as more vendors arrive, helping each other set up canopies to shield their stalls from potential rain. The task is far from easy. The wind tugs at the fabric, and some canopies still hold water from the recent rainfall. But they press on, and slowly, the white shapes pop up, and Nabatieh’s Monday Market has started. Sanaa smiles at the occasional passer-by, her warmth never fading. She has come to know many by name and can anticipate their requests. Her voice is quiet but inviting. “I choose the Monday Market because there’s always a lot of movement, and it’s a historic, popular spot in the south,” Sanaa tells Al Jazeera, her fingers brushing over lace and satin as she unpacks more items from the van. In the stall next door, her husband Youssef works in silence. His movements are precise, almost meditative, but there is a hint of tension in how he arranges the containers and cookware. Youssef has never imagined himself here; he used to be a driver for the Khiam municipality, but lost his job when the municipality ceased operations after the outbreak of theIsraeli war on Lebanonin 2023, which particularly devastated Lebanon’s south, including Nabatieh, one of the region’s biggest cities. Since then, Youssef has quietly adapted to the life of a vendor beside Sanaa. Youssef is quiet and reserved, a stark contrast to Sanaa’s extroverted warmth. He focuses intently on his tasks, but when approached by a customer, his blue eyes shine with welcome, and his voice is friendly. At first glance, no one would guess the weight those eyes carry – war, displacement, losing his livelihood and their home in Khiam. But at the market, it is business as usual. Shoes, toys, spices, clothing, books, food, electronics, and accessories – the Monday Market sells all that and more. The Monday Market in Nabatieh has its roots in the late Mamluk era (1250–1517 AD) and continued to thrive under Ottoman rule. Along with the Souk of Bint Jbeil and the Khan Market in Hasbaiyya, it is one of the oldest weekly markets in south Lebanon, established as part of efforts to extend trade routes across the region. Back then, traders moved between Palestine and Lebanon, transporting goods by mule and donkey over rough, slow roads. Nabatieh’s location made it a natural stop – a bustling centre where merchants from nearby villages would gather to buy, sell and rest before continuing their journeys. The market also sat along a wider network of internal pilgrimage routes, connecting Jerusalem to Damascus, Mecca and Najaf. Nabatieh Mayor Khodor Kodeih recounts that merchants travelling between Palestine and Lebanon would stop at a “khan” – an inn that also served as a trading centre – on the site of the current market. A khan typically featured a square courtyard surrounded by rooms on two levels, with open arcades. Merchants would rest, trade and display their goods there, gradually transforming the site into the bustling Monday Market. Over time, the market has become more than just a place to buy and sell – it is a ritual that stitches together the social and economic fabric of southern Lebanon. The area around the old khans expanded into a larger open-air souk. Israeli air strikes during the last war destroyed the original khans, but traces of the market’s past still remain. Today, the Monday Market spans three to four city blocks in central Nabatieh, surrounded by remnants of Ottoman-era architecture. While shops remain open throughout the week, the market itself is made up of temporary stalls and stands that operate only on Mondays. Before Israel’s recent war on Lebanon, the market filled the streets, framed by Ottoman-era buildings with wooden shutters and iron balconies. Merchants packed the narrow alleys with vibrant goods, their calls for business filling the air. But on November 13, 2024, Israeli air strikes reduced the historic market to rubble. Stone arches crumbled, shopfronts burned, and what was once a bustling hub was left in ruins. Arriving at Sultan Square, the usual site of the old market, one is left confused. All that remains is a vast, empty space at the heart of the city. The famous Al-Sultan sweet shop, after which the square was named, is gone. Nearby, other sweet shops – including al-Dimassi, established in 1949 and central to Nabatieh’s culinary identity and reputation – are also missing. They once sold staples of Lebanese dessert culture: baklava, nammoura, maamoul, and during Ramadan, seasonal treats like kallaj and an all-time favourite, halawet el-jibn. Every market morning, merchants sweep the streets, using only brooms to push the debris to the sides and clear space for their stalls. Even as the wind blows rubble back towards their stand, they keep sweeping, determined to maintain a neat and orderly market. Sanaa remembers the high-end lingerie shops that once competed with her; they’re gone too, reduced to debris amid which vendors have set up their tents as they wait for the municipality to clear the area. There should be more vendors on that cold morning, but the rain and war have changed things. “The good thing about rainy days,” Sanaa jokes, “is that there are fewer merchants, so customers have limited options.” Before the war, she sold in bulk – new brides buying trousseaus, women stocking up. Now, purchases are small and careful – with homes and livelihoods lost, shopping is for necessity, not luxuries or impulse buys. On a typical Monday, the market runs from 5am to 5pm. Merchants arrive early, making their way to their designated spots, some on the pavement, others against a backdrop of a collapsed building. Vegetable vendors lay their produce out in large sacks and plastic crates. Normally, the market is so crowded with people that cars can’t pass and visitors have to squeeze past each other from one stall to the next. Though profits aren’t what they used to be, Sanaa is just happy to be back. She’s kept her prices the same, hoping the market will rebound. “This is the most important market in the south,” she says. “And we need to follow the source of our livelihood.” Next to Sanaa’s stall is Jihad Abdallah’s, where he has rigged up several racks to hang his collection of women’s sports clothes. Yesterday’s snow is melting as the sun comes out, but Jihad keeps his hoodie up, still feeling the lingering cold. Customers have started trickling over, but it isn’t enough to shake the frustrated, tired look on his face. Jihad, from the border village of Bint Jbeil, spends his week travelling between different town markets in southern Lebanon to make ends meet. He was among the first to set up in Bint Jbeil’s Thursday Market as soon as theceasefire with Israelwas announced on November 27, 2024. Jihad didn’t have many options. Bint Jbeil was the market he knew best – he memorised the rhythms, understood customer demands, and recognised how to turn profit. Still, business was slow. “In Bint Jbeil, the market needs time to recover because many residents from nearby villages, like Blida, Aitaroun and Maroun al-Ras, haven’t returned yet,” Abdallah tells Al Jazeera. “However, in Nabatieh, nearby towns have seen more returnees.” Jihad was also among the first to return to the Nabatieh market, joining the very first band of merchants in clearing as much debris as they could manage. “The Israelis want to make this land unliveable, but we’re here. We’re staying,” Jihad says. “They destroyed everything out of spite, but they can’t take our will.” Further down the road, Abbas Sbeity has set up his stand of clothes for the day, a collection of children’s winter clothes he couldn’t sell because of the war. “I had to empty my van to make room for mattresses for my kids to sleep on when we first escaped Qaaqaait al-Jisr [a village near Nabatieh],” he tells Al Jazeera, pointing to the van behind him, now packed with clothes. Abbas is trying to make a profit, however small, from clothes that were meant to be sold when children returned to school last fall. He’s been coming to the Monday Market for 30 years, a job passed down from his father, who inherited it from his grandfather. “My grandfather used to bring me here on a mule!” he says with a nostalgic smile. For a moment, he stares off, lost in thought. His smile stays, but his voice holds a trace of sadness. “There’s a deep love story with the Monday Market,” he adds. “But now, there’s a sadness in the air. People’s spirits are still heavy, and the destruction around us really affects their morale.” Abbas remembers how people came not only to buy but to hang out for a weekly outing they could count on for fun, no matter the weather. Even if they didn’t buy anything, they’d enjoy the crowds or grab a bite, whether from the small shops selling manouches, shawarma, kaak or falafel sandwiches, or from a restaurant nearby, from local favourites like Al-Bohsasa to Western chains. Many would also stop by Al-Sultan and Al-Dimassi, which were the closest to the market, to enjoy a sweet treat, a perfect way to top off their visit. By noon, the rain had stopped, leaving behind a gloomy day as the sun struggled to break through the clouds, casting a faint light over the market. People haggled over prices, searched for specific sizes, and despite the changes brought by war, the Monday Market pressed on, determined to hold on to its place. At one end of the Sultan Square, near the upper right corner, a half-destroyed building still stands where vendors used to set up shop before the war. Now, produce vendors arrange their stalls beneath it as if nothing had changed. The remnants of the structure loom above them – fragments of walls hanging precariously, held together by stray wires that look ready to snap. Yet the vendors paid no mind, too absorbed in tending to customers. The building’s arched openings and ornate details, though battered, still hinted at the city’s rich past. Its verandas, standing like silent witnesses to the souk below, bore testament to both the scars of war and a culture that refused to disappear. At the far end of the market, by the main road leading out of Nabatieh to nearby villages, one cart stands alone, piled high with nuts and dried fruits. Its owner adds more, making the stacks look like they might spill over at any second. Roasted corn, chickpeas, and almonds sit next to raw almonds, hazelnuts, cashews and walnuts. Dried fruits are displayed front and centre, dates and apricots taking the spotlight. At the back of the cart, Rachid Dennawi arranges candies – gummy bears and marshmallows in all shapes and flavours. It’s his first day back at the Monday Market since the war began. Abir Badran, a customer dressed in a dark cardigan and a long black scarf that gently frames her face, is the first to reach Rachid’s cart while he’s still setting up. Her face lights up as she leans in to examine the dates, carefully picking through them. “Finally, you’re back!” she says, reaching for the dates – they’re bigger and better than what she can find at other places, she says. Rachid, originally from Tripoli in Lebanon’s north, makes the three-hour journey to Nabatieh because he believes the market is livelier, has more customers. Over time, Rachid has built a loyal clientele, and people like Abir swear by his dried fruit and nut mix. “The people here are different,” he tells Al Jazeera, handing Abir a handful of almonds to taste. “They don’t just buy from you – they welcome you and want you to succeed.” But Abir didn’t just come to stock up – she is there because the Monday Market has become an act of resistance. “The Israelis want to sever our ties to this land,” Abir tells Al Jazeera. “But we won’t let them.” While the optimism is clear, the reality on the ground is tough. Merchants and residents are doing what they can with what they have. Some have relocated their shops or started new businesses, but some are stuck in limbo. Mayor Kodeih estimates it will take at least two years to rebuild the market and is critical of the Lebanese government’s support. “We will restore the market,” he says. “It won’t be the same, but we’ll bring it back.” The mayor was injured in the Israeli strike on the municipality in mid-October, which killed 16 people; he is one of the two survivors. It is not easy to leave the market behind – or Nabatieh. Despite the destruction, the city hums with life: Shops are open, cafes are busy, and people lean in doorways, greeting passers-by with warm smiles and easy conversation. The gravity of war has left its mark. The destruction is visible at every turn – a bookshop reduced to rubble, shops flattened to the ground – but it has not stripped away the city’s kindness or its sense of humour. In front of a lot with nothing more than a gaping hole in it, a playful banner by the shop that used to stand there reads: “We’ll be back soon … we’re just redecorating.” One of the paths out of the Sultan Square leads visitors northeast, into a quieter neighbourhood of cobbled streets, where cafes and small shops line the way. Here, people sip coffee and linger by storefronts, seemingly untouched by the devastation only steps away. Turning back at the boundary between the two, the destruction that has decimated the market is more apparent, as is the loss to Nabatieh and southern Lebanon. The market’s heyday will live on only in the memories of those who experienced it, younger generations will never have that same experience.",

    "article_text": "Companies now have until July 14th to make it as easy to cancel subscriptions as it is to sign up for them. Companies now have until July 14th to make it as easy to cancel subscriptions as it is to sign up for them. byWes Davis The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was set to start enforcing the remaining provisions of its “click-to-cancel” rule on May 14th, requiring that subscriptions be as easy to cancel as to start. Now,the agency saysit won’t enforce the rule until July 14th, asTechCrunchreports. Also known as the Negative Option Rule, the big component of click-to-cancel is that it forbids companies from making customers jump through hoops that differ from the process to sign up for an account. If you can sign up online, you must be able to cancel online, too. As the FTC points out, the original May 14th deadline was already a deferral for that and related provisions. The agency says it chose to push enforcement back even further after “a fresh assessment of the burdens that forcing compliance by this date would impose.” The FTC voted 3-0 for the delay, but asTechCrunchnotes, two of a typical five commissioners were absent from the vote. That’s because they wereillegally fired by Donald Trumpin March. Perhaps on the bright side for consumers, the FTC says that starting on the new deadline, “regulated entities must be in compliance with the whole of the Rule because the Commission will begin enforcing it.” However, it doesn’t rule out changing any of the regulation’s provisions, writing that it’s “open to amending the Rule” if enforcing it “exposes any problems.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

The new pope suggests AI poses similar challenges as the industrial revolution during which Pope Leo XIII served. byWes Davis As Pope Leo XIVlaid out his vision for the papacyin an address to the College of Cardinals, he also explained why he picked his papal name. Incredibly, artificial intelligence played a big part. In the Vatican’s translation of his speech, Pope Leo XIV explained that his name references Pope Leo XII, who presided over the church at the dawn of the industrial revolution. …I chose to take the name Leo XIV. There are different reasons for this, but mainly because Pope Leo XIII in his historic EncyclicalRerum Novarumaddressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution. In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour. Below is more of the excerpt, published by theCatholic News Service. The Catholic Church has taken a keen interest in the development of AI in recent years. In a Januarydocument published by the Vaticanand translated to English, the church reflected on AI, its limitations, its relationship with the truth, and the ethics of developing and using the technology. The document also references awarning issued a year priorby Pope Francis about AI’s potential to create “partially or completely false narratives, believed and broadcast as if they were true.” But if Pope Francis set up how the Catholic Church feels about AI, Pope Leo XIV citing it as a main reason for his name hints that it will be an even bigger part of the church’s focus during his papacy.

    "article_text": "Whoop now says it will give free upgrades to users with more than 12 months left on their subscription. Whoop now says it will give free upgrades to users with more than 12 months left on their subscription. byWes Davis Whoop is in damage control mode. After debuting itsWhoop 5.0 fitness tracker, users were angered to find it had reneged on a promise of free hardware upgrades. In anew Reddit post, the company now says users who have been members for over 12 months can get the Whoop 5.0 for free. Part of the outrage was prompted by Whoop’s confusing messaging. Early yesterday morning, my colleagueVictoria Song reportedthat to get a Whoop 5.0 band, users would need to extend their existing membership by an additional 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee. However, until at least March 28th of this year, Whoop’s websitehad a blog postthat said users would only need to have been a member for at least six months to get a free upgrade to next-gen hardware. After the backlash, Whoop is now changing its tune — somewhat. Those with “more than 12 months remaining” are “eligible for a free upgrade to WHOOP 5.0 on Peak,” one of its new subscription offerings. Those with less than 12 months left, still have to either extend their membership another 12 months or pay a one-time upgrade fee, the company says. The same information is reflected in anupdate on its membership pricing page. The company addresses the earlier blog post, writing that “a previous blog article incorrectly stated that anyone who had been a member for just 6 months would receive a free upgrade. This was never our policy and should never have been posted.” Whoop goes on: As noted above, our policy for upgrades from WHOOP 3.0 to WHOOP 4.0 was that members with 6 months or more remaining on their membership were eligible for a free upgrade to WHOOP 4.0. We removed that blog article when it came to our attention and updated WHOOP Coach with the proper information. We’re sorry for any confusion this may have caused. That seems to line up with aForbesinterviewthata Reddit user found, in which Whoop CEO Will Ahmed told the outlet that members with a Whoop 3.0 band could upgrade to the 4.0 model, so long as they had “at least 6 months of membership left on their account.” The company used similar language in a2021 blog postabout the Whoop 4.0 band. Still, Redditors aren’t responding well to the company’s response, with some complaining about the need to extend their subscriptioneven if they have 11 months left, orthreatening to cancel their subscription. Even some who are more accepting of the change have criticisms.One person writesthat while they’re “pleased with the change,” they don’t buy that the blog post was made in error. “They should just own that they changed their mind/policy rather than claim it was a false posting to begin with.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "title": "SoundCloud says it isn&#8217;t using your music to train generative AI tools",
    "article_text": "The company says it’ll let users opt out if it decides to train AI on their content in the future. The company says it’ll let users opt out if it decides to train AI on their content in the future. byWes Davis The music-sharing platform SoundCloud quietly updated its terms of use in February last year, adding language that lets it train AI models on its users’ content, asTechCrunchreported. And while the company says it hasn’t used user-created content for model training, it doesn’t rule out the possibility that it will in the future. Marni Greenberg, SVP and head of communications at SoundCloud, provided the following in a statement emailed toThe Verge. SoundCloud has never used artist content to train AI models, nor do we develop AI tools or allow third parties to scrape or use SoundCloud content from our platform for AI training purposes. In fact, we implemented technical safeguards, including a “no AI” tag on our site to explicitly prohibit unauthorized use. Greenberg went on to say that SoundCloud’s terms of service update “was intended to clarify how content may interact with AI technologies within SoundCloud’s own platform.” She said the company uses AI for things like personalized recommendations and fraud detection, and suggests its plans for future uses of AI on its platform fall along similar lines. When we asked about letting users opt out of having their music used for generative AI development, here’s what Greenberg had to say: The TOS explicitly prohibits the use of licensed content, such as music from major labels, for training any AI models, including generative AI. For other types of content uploaded to SoundCloud, the TOS allows for the possibility of AI-related use.

    "title": "The enduring cool of skateboarding games",
    "article_text": "2025 looks to continue the great run. byJay Peters 2025 looks to continue the great run. byJay Peters More than 25 years after the firstTony Hawk’s Pro Skaterput skateboarding games on the map, developers are still finding new ways to explore skating in video games, especially in 2025. Skateboarding fans are about to have some promising new games to play, with Activision’sTony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4remakereleasing in July and EA is set to launch its online-only,free-to-playSkaterevivalthis year. In 2022, my colleague Andrew Webster wrote thatwe’re in a golden age for skateboarding games, and things haven’t really slowed down. So what is it that makes skateboarding so good for video games, and allows so many different expressions of the sport from different studios? “I think skateboarding is one of those things that’s just always cool,”THPS 3 + 4game director Kurt Tillmanns tellsThe Verge. “It’s an evergreen fantasy, in both real life and games. Being a skateboarder is a sign of what and who is cool.” He says “there’s a reason that we’re all in awe of what these people can do.” Part of what makes skateboarding cool is the music, fashion, and art, and video games let people experience that skateboarding culture, too, Tillmanns says. Also, “it’s safer,” jokes Andrew Schimmel, a senior producer at Snowman, the creators of theSkate Cityseries. He says there’s a lot of people that would probably love to try skateboarding but don’t want to risk breaking a bone. “Being able to dive into a fantasy world where you can act that out and see the gnarly consequences and not have to suffer from them is like immediately appealing.” It helps that games take so many different approaches to skateboarding. “The skate community is so diverse, so it makes sense that there’s an appetite for all different types of games — some more realistic, some more arcade, some more casual,” saysSkateexecutive producer Mike McCartney. For the newSkate, “it’s all about re-creating a skateboarding experience that reflects the freedom of exploration, discovery, and expression you see in skate culture. We really wanted to respect the roots of the franchise, while bringing the game forward.” Tony Hawk’s Pro Skatergames will always have what’s in the title: “They’ve got Tony Hawk, and they’ve got pro skaters,” Tillmanns says. That includes things like their styles and their personalities — even the special tricks for the skaters are a representation of their style in real life. Tony Hawk is very involved, too, even with the3 + 4remakes. Hawk “is where the culture comes from” and he has a “real eye for detail” about what goes in the games. “He knows that this game is the lexicon for skaters for the next few years,” according to Tillmanns. TheTHPSseries also strikes a nice mix of an arcade-y experience and a skateboarding simulation. It has generally realistic physics and locations, but also lets you pull off outlandish tricks, strive for video game-y goals (S-K-A-T-E, anyone?), and play as somenot-real charactersinwacky places. For theSkate Citygames, the Snowman team had to think a lot about how to make skateboarding work on mobile. The first launched as an Apple Arcade exclusive, andSkate City: New Yorkis currently an exclusive there, too, so the Snowman team had to figure out a mobile control scheme that “feels novel and fits the sport” that’s also approachable enough to serve a wide audience, Schimmel says. Your two thumbs represent your front and back foot, and you flick your thumbs to emulate flick tricks with skateboarding. Developers I spoke with think there’s still a lot of ways skateboarding games can grow, too. “Skateboarding never stops evolving and neither will our game,”Skate’s head of creative, Jeff Seamster, says. “The creativity of skaters consistently blows my mind. The spots they find, the tricks they’re (still) inventing, the vibrant style… we couldn’t have imagined today’s scene from where we were standing 15, 10, or even five years ago. So, who knows what we’ll see tomorrow?” “Multiplayer and online can always be the next frontier,” Tillmanns says.THPS 3+4will have crossplay, and the team is excited about “increasing that pool of online players to something that we’ve never seen before in aTony Hawkgame.” Schimmel points to games likeOlliOlli World(a cartoony, side-scrolling skateboarding adventure) andSkate Story(a psychedelic-looking skateboarding game set to launch this year) that are highlighting skateboarding in different ways. “In terms of what hasn’t been done, I think there’s probably lots to explore,” he says.

    "title": "Can Donald Trump really put a tariff on films?",
    "article_text": "Trump’s plan to put a 100 percent tariff on movies shot in foreign countries is still on. Trump’s plan to put a 100 percent tariff on movies shot in foreign countries is still on. byEmma Roth After slamming everything from clothing to avocados with tariffs, now President Donald Trump has taken aim at films. “The Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death,” Trumpproclaimed on Truth Sociallast week, while floating a 100 percent tariff on movies “produced in Foreign Lands.” The news stirred up confusion across Hollywood, as it would seemingly apply to a broad range of films, maybe even US films with scenes shot abroad. Though Trump has already begun to reel his original statement back in,as he told CNBCthat he’s “not looking to hurt the industry,” it doesn’t seem likehe’s given up on the idea completely. But like many of Trump’s plans, he’s relying on presidential powers that are stretched to a breaking point. “A car has a value when it arrives at a US port that they can slap a tariff on,” says Mark Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University. “But because of the way the film industry works, it’d be much tougher to determine what proportion of the film you would actually apply a tariff to.” Trump’s tariff plan appears to have spun out ofa meeting with actor Jon Voight, a fervent Trump supporterwho has been appointeda “special ambassador” to “make Hollywood great again.” The plan, which has since beenpublished in full byDeadline, mentions offering more tax incentives for producers, but also proposes tariffs. Voight’s plan says that if a film “could have been produced in the U.S. but the producer elects to produce in a foreign country and receives a production tax incentive,” then the government should impose a tariff “equal to 120% of the value of the foreign incentive received.” Typically, Congress is in charge of imposing tariffs, but Trump has become an expert at pulling emergency levers to unilaterally stick fees on imported goods. His past few months of sweeping tariffs leverage the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977, a law that grants the president the power to implement tariffs in response to an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to national security or the economy. As pointed out bythe Brennan Center for Justice— and themany states suing Trump— the current global trade situation doesn’t call for a national emergency. “By no stretch of the imagination can long-standing trade relationships be considered an unforeseen emergency,” a writeup from the Brennan Center for Justice says. “If Trump believes that global tariffs could benefit the United States, he needs to make his case to Congress.” Trump hasn’t said what law he’d use to tax movies. If it’s the IEEPA, then even by his usual standards, that’s a stretch. The rule includes a specific carveout to protect the exchange of “informational materials,” such as publications, films, posters, photographs, CDs, and artwork. That language suggests even under his emergency powers, Trump shouldn’t have the authority to impose tariffs on movies. We saw the “informational material” rules come into play during Trump’s first term, when afederal judge blocked his initial ban on TikTok in 2020. The judge ruled the president doesn’t have the “authority to regulate or prohibit” the import of informational materials and “personal communications, which do not involve a transfer of anything of value.” But there’s a different rule Trump could use to impose tariffs on films:Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. This law allows the president to impose or adjust tariffs if the US Secretary of Commerce finds that a particular import can “threaten or impair the national security.” In his post proposing a tariff on films, Trump called thefilm incentives offered by foreign countriesa “concerted effort” to take away films from the US, making it a “National Security Threat.” Even if that dubious logic holds, collecting the money would raise more problems. Films can cross our borders in many different ways that would allow them to avoid going through customs and facing tariffs — whether they’re uploaded to a cloud storage service, beamed through a streaming service like Netflix, or even transferred to movie theaters using hard drives. “If it was going to happen, it wouldn’t look at all like a tariff.“ “The laws that the President can rely upon to hit imported goods aren’t laws that provide him authority to do that in respect of audio-visual content that doesn’t clear customs or is already here,” John Magnus, president of Tradewins LLC, a DC-based trade consultancy, toldThe Verge. “So most likely, if it was going to happen, it wouldn’t look at all like a tariff.” It might be possible to collect something like an excise tax, which is placed on goods purchased in the country, like cigarettes, alcohol, soda, and gas. But this would likely be out of Trump’s control, as, again, only Congress typically has the authority to impose taxes — and unlike tariffs, there’s no emergency power for excise taxes.. IfCongresstook up the cause of an excise tax, it would likely beapplied to the distributorof a foreign film, which would then be passed onto consumers, likely raising the price of everything from movie tickets to streaming services. “Prices are already much higher than they used to be,” Christopher Meissner, a professor of economics at the University of California Davis, tellsThe Verge. “It’ll limit the range of movies we can watch.” Like many of the things Trump espouses, the specifics surrounding film tariffs are nonexistent, and the plan may never come to fruition. “We spend a lot of time and energy discussing things and analyzing things that, at the end of the day, are going to lead to nothing, because he [Trump] has no real intention,” Jones says. “It may be that he has an intention now, but moving forward, they’re never going to amount to anything.” That said, a lot of people never thought Trump could blow up US-China trade either — and we’re all seeing how that turned out.

    "title": "How to turn on Lockdown Mode for your iPhone and Mac",
    "article_text": "There are security protections, and then there are strong security protections. There are security protections, and then there are strong security protections. byDavid Nield Apple is known forprioritizing privacy and security, but there are additional measures you can turn to if you feel you need them. iPhones, iPads, and Macs have what’s known as a Lockdown Mode that takes protecting your data to a whole new level. It’s clear that this isn’t for everyone:Apple describes itas being for those who feel they might be attacked by “the most sophisticated threats.” Think journalists working in dangerous regions, activists under threat from surveillance or censorship, or politicians with access totop secret information. Anyone can turn it on and off as needed — you don’t need any special status or any particular kind of Apple account. It only takes a few taps or clicks, and you’ll have the highest level of security protection that Apple offers. It’s worth bearing in mind that there are some tradeoffs when using Lockdown Mode. The software you use will be limited in some of its functionality to give would-be hackers fewer ways to get at you and your data. You’ll find most attachments in Messages blocked, while FaceTime calls are only permitted with people you’ve had contact with in the last month. In Photos, you can’t create or even see shared albums, and Focus modes are disabled, too. New device connections are only allowed if your iPhone, iPad, or Mac is unlocked when the connection is made. Certain parts of Safari get disabled, too, with many web technologies (that may be used to launch an attack) turned off. You’ll see missing images and fonts that don’t look right, and certain websites might load slowly or not work at all. You won’t be able to install new configuration profiles (for testing apps, for example), and there’s no support for unsecured Wi-Fi networks. You’ll also lose the ability to access Game Center — sorry, gamers. Lockdown Mode is enabled on a device-by-device basis, so enabling it on your Mac won’t automatically enable it on your iPhone. You will get a prompt across all the devices associated with your Apple account once you’ve turned the mode on for one device. Considering how dramatic Lockdown Mode is in terms of the changes it makes to your devices, it’s surprisingly easy to enable. On an iPhone or iPad: You’ll need to enter your phone or tablet passcode, and then your device will reboot. When you get back into the software, Lockdown Mode will be enabled. On a Mac: You’ll need to enter the password associated with your Mac account, and then the computer will reboot, enabling Lockdown Mode along the way. There aren’t many ways to customize Lockdown Mode, but you can exclude certain websites from its restrictions in Safari, if you want to. When you’re on a page in Safari on an iPhone or iPad, tap the menu button (to the left of the web URL), then the three dots, then disableLockdown Mode. You can review and edit your website exclusion list, too. If you’re starting to feel safer (or just inconvenienced by the restrictions), getting out of Lockdown Mode is just as easy as enabling it: simply retrace your original steps to find the option. Again, you’ll need to have your passcode or password to hand and restart your device, and then you’ll be back to normal.

    "title": "Despelote is a picture-perfect portrait of childhood obsession",
    "article_text": "﻿A short, dreamlike game about soccer and memories. ﻿A short, dreamlike game about soccer and memories. byAndrew Webster For a kid with an obsession, it’s impossible to think about anything else. When I was really into skateboarding, every piece of architecture was filled with a potential for tricks that I could never actually pull off. When I was on a quest to completeSuper Mario Bros. 3on my own, any piece of paper became a sketch of a new level. For eight-year-old Julián in the new gameDespelote, that obsession is soccer, and it becomes the backdrop for a sweet, and short, slice-of-life drama about passion and memory. Despeloteis set in Quito in 2001, just as Ecuador is on the verge of qualifying for the men’s World Cup for the first time in its history. The story follows Julián through the qualifying stages, as he goes about his life — or tries to, at least. There’s a lot going on at the time, as the country is still dealing with the effects ofan economic crisis. Soccer becomes something of a relief valve, a hopeful story to follow during difficult times. The game plays out from a first-person perspective and takes place across several days, during each of which Ecuador has an important match. The scenes are small but surprisingly open, often forcing young Julián – and also the player – to decide where to focus. He might be playing a 16-bit soccer game while his mom tries to lecture him, or staring out the window idly watching people kick a ball around while he’s supposed to be listening to a lesson. Sometimes he has a goal to complete, like getting home in time for dinner or keeping an eye on his little sister in the park. But there’s always a distraction. And it’s almost always a soccer ball. Most of the time, Julián has a ball at his feet, either kicking it around with friends, or by himself while everyone else parties. When there isn’t a ball, he makes do, kicking around anything from a glass bottle to a copy ofShrekon DVD. There’s a real specificity toDespelotein terms of its place and time, but it also evokes a very universal feeling of being a kid. Those choices between what Julián wants to do and what he is supposed to do are tough, and often his mom will let him have it when he messes up. At one point, while playing hide-and-seek, I lost his sister, and became petrified of the reaction I’d get if I didn’t find her in time. There are also moments where control is pulled away from you, and Julián’s mom will drag him by the hand wherever he’s supposed to be. The interactivity of these moments really puts you in Julián’s shoes, and there were key scenes that brought me back to my own childhood. (Especially having a younger sibling distract you while you’re playing a video game.) It’s all rendered with dreamy, oversaturated backdrops and comic book-like characters. It feels like you’re in a memory, which is amplified by adult Julián — the game was developed by designer Julián Cordero and animator and musician Sebastián Valbuena — setting the scene through narration at the beginning of each chapter. All the while, tension is building as Ecuador inches closer to qualification. (At most points in the game you can find your way to a TV to check the score in the current match.) It all culminates in a beautiful fourth-wall-breaking moment that puts this autobiographical story into a larger perspective. Despeloteonly lasts around two hours, and most of that time is spent kicking a ball around. And yet it manages to capture so many feelings of childhood and the all-consuming infatuations that come with being a kid. Despeloteis available now on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, with a Switch version also in the works.

    "article_text": "Climacool are surprisingly comfortable, predictably polarizing. If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. byThomas Ricker If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. A shoe engineered to be made entirely from additive manufacturing will be polarizing in the first quarter of the 21st century. That’s certainly been my experience wearing Adidas’ new 3D-printed Climacool sneakers on the beach, trail, or in the city. I felt more eyes on my footwear than normal, with a determined flick upward to see who was brave enough, dumb enough, or fantastic enough to wear such a shoe. I’ve been a fan of Adidas’ 3D-printed kicks ever since I purchased a pair of its4D running shoesa few years ago. But those are traditional multi-material sneakers with 3D printing limited to the midsoles. Adidas is taking things to the next level with Climacool — a single-piece shoe that’s 100 percent 3D printed. They were teased late last year with a limited drop, but now anyone can buy them.The rubbery lattice structure varies in density from the sole (where it’s high) to the upper (low) to provide the right balance of cushion and flex. Adidas calls the shoe lightweight, but at 416 grams, it’s heavier and more rigid than I expected from the photos and marketing pitch. It can be folded in half, toe to heel, but these are not the shoes I’d pack for recovery after a long hike or bike ride, for example. They “mold seamlessly around the foot” as advertised for an extremely comfortable fit. If you’ve ever worn neoprene water shoes, you’ll know the feeling, although those lack Adidas’ surprisingly soft and responsive integrated insole. The gaps in the 3D-printed latticework allow for water and air to easily circulate around the foot. While theycouldbe worn for water sports like stand-up paddleboarding, the thick, spongy sole unfortunately dampens any board feel. Putting on the snug, slip-on shoe can be a struggle, snagging socks and sweaty feet alike. And going sockless can result in sand and debris getting trapped between the shoe and your skin. I had to turn around on a gritty trail after about 1km (half a mile) due to the first signs of blistering on the back of my bare heels. Fortunately, the dirty shoes can be immersed in a sink of soapy water and easily scrubbed clean. A toothpick makes quick work of dislodging pebbles that inevitably embed themselves into the gaps, especially along the bottom. Adidas’ 3D-printed shoes feel most at home worn casually around the city. It’s here, among other appreciative sneakerheads, that the Adidas Climacool sneaker lives up to its tagline: “Made like nothing, feels like nothing, looks like nothing.” They’re only available in a single off-white colorway, but they’re comfortable, durable, and make a compelling entry onto the streetwear scene. More importantly, they bring us to the precipice of being able to upload a 3D foot scan for made-to-order shoes printed exactly to our specifications, and I’m here for it. The $140 Climacool sneakers are available to buy via theAdidas Confirmed app, and through select Adidas stores.

    "title": "Ukraine's allies push for 30-day ceasefire, but Putin wants direct talks",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 10, 2025 / 7:59 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Ukraine and its allies are ready for a \"full, unconditional ceasefire\" with Russia for at least 30 days starting on Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Saturday, but Russian President Vladimir Putin is pushing for direct talks next week. Their remarks came as the leaders of four major European countries visited Kyiv, putting pressure on Moscow to agree to a truce and launch peace talks on ending the nearly three-year conflict. They followed what Sybiha said was a \"constructive\" phone call between the leaders of France, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom,President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the group had \"spoken to President Trump together. We agreed on our common view of our further actions.\" At a news conference on Saturday, Putin said Moscow has repeatedly put forward ceasefire initiatives, and claimed Kyiv has sabotaged them. He also proposed resuming direct talks without preconditions next Thursday, May 15, in Istanbul. Putin said direct talks would \"eliminate the root causes of the conflict\" and \"to achieve the restoration of a long-term, lasting peace,\" according toReuters. Meanwhile, Saturday marked the last day of a unilateral three-day ceasefire declared by Russia that Ukraine says the Kremlin's forces have repeatedly violated. In March, the United States proposed an immediate, limited30-day truce, which Ukraine accepted, but the Kremlin has held out for terms more to its liking. The leaders of France, Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom arrived together at the train station in Kyiv, and met Zelenskyy shortly after to join a ceremony at Kyiv's Independence Square marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. They lit candles at a makeshift flag memorial for fallen Ukrainian soldiers and civilians. The visit marked the first time the leaders of the four countries have traveled together to Ukraine, while Friedrich Merz is making his first visit to Ukraine as Germany's new chancellor. Sybiha on Thursday called the Russian truce a \"farce,\" accusing Russian forces of violating it over 700 times less than a day after it formally came into effect. Both sides also said attacks on their troops had continued on Thursday. \"We reiterate our backing for President Trump's calls for a peace deal and call on Russia to stop obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace,\" the leaders said in a joint statement. \"Alongside the U.S., we call on Russia to agree to a full and unconditional 30-day ceasefire to create the space for talks on a just and lasting peace.\" Mr. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to a conflict-ending agreement, but while Zelenskyy agreed to an American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, Russia has not signed on. Instead, it has kept up attacks along the roughly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) front line, including deadly strikes on residential areas with no obvious military targets. On Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine's northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day killed three residents and wounded four more. Another civilian man died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin. Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, French President Emmanuel Macron said: \"What's happening with Poland, Germany and Great Britain is a historic moment for European defense and toward a greater independence for our security. Obviously, for Ukraine, but for all of us. It's a new era. It's a Europe that sees itself as a power.\" Mr. Trump said last week that he doubts Russia's Putin wants to end his fight in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon, and hinted at further sanctions against Russia. Progress on resolving the conflict has seemed elusive in the months since Mr. Trump returned to the White House, and his previous claims of imminent breakthroughs have failed to come to fruition. Mr. Trump has previously pushed Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the conflict,threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult. Ukraine's European allies view the fight as fundamental to the continent's security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily — regardless of whether Mr. Trump pulls out. Ukrainian presidential aide Andrii Yermak, who met the European leaders at Kyiv's main train station, wrote on Telegram earlier on Saturday: \"There is a lot of work, a lot of topics to discuss. We need to end this war with a just peace. We need to force Moscow to agree to a ceasefire.\" Later in the day, the leaders began hosting a virtual meeting alongside Zelenskyy to update other leaders on the progress being made for a future so-called \"coalition of the willing\" that would help Ukraine's armed forces after a peace deal and potentially deploy troops to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 10, 2025 / 7:42 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Sensitivetalks between U.S. and Chinese delegationsover tariffs that threaten to upend the global economy ended after a day of prolonged negotiations and will resume Sunday, a source briefed on the meetings confirmed to CBS News. President Trumpposted on his social mediaSaturday evening after the meetings concluded, saying \"great progress\" was made. \"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Many things discussed, much agreed to. A total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner. We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business.\" There initially was no immediate indication whether any progress was made Saturday during the more than 10-hour meeting between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland. The talks, which could help stabilize world markets roiled by the U.S.-China standoff, have been shrouded in secrecy and neither side made comments to reporters on the way out. Based on Bessent'sinterview with Fox Newslast week, initial discussions were likely about \"de-escalation, not about the big trade deal.\" The Treasury secretary said the U.S. and China have \"shared interests\" because the sky-high tariffs imposed by both countries last month are not \"sustainable.\" U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is also in Switzerland alongside Bessent for the talks. Several convoys of black vehicles left the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, which hosted the talks aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks took place. The talks were taking place in the sumptuous 18th-century \"Villa Saladin\" overlooking Lake Geneva. The former estate was bequeathed to the Swiss state in 1973, according to the Geneva government. The hope is that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes — tariffs — they've slapped on each other's goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade. In an interview withNBC Newslast week, Mr. Trump claimed Chinese officials \"want to make a deal very badly. We'll see how that all turns out, but it's got to be a fair deal.\" The president also said he expected to lower tariffs on China \"at some point.\" Meanwhile, Chinese officials have said they are open to negotiating with the U.S. on trade, butpushed theTrump administrationto drop its \"unilateral\" tariffs first. Mr. Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on Chinato a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries' boycotting each other's products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion. Even before the talks began, Mr. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \"80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.″ Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results. \"The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\" she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \"It cannot just be words.\" Since returning to the White House in January, Mr. Trump has aggressively used tariffs ashis favorite economic weapon. He has, for example,imposed a 10% tax on importsfrom almost every country in the world. But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%. During Mr. Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that claimed China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These The allegations include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies. Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues — such as China's subsidies — were left for future negotiations. But China didn't come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced. The fight over China's tech policy now resumes. Mr. Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year. In Switzerland on Friday, Bessent and Greer also met with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Mr. Trump last monthsuspended plansto slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but warned he could raise them again. The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate. \"An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland's interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\" the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \"is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\" On Saturday, Bessent said trade talks with Switzerland were \"very productive,\" and he was \"optimistic about the speed of these negotiations,\" citing Mr. Trump'strade deal with the U.K.that's still being finalized. \"I am glad that we have agreed on accelerated trade talks, and we expect that a detailed Swiss proposal will be submitted to Ambassador Greer by next week,\" Bessent wrote on social media. \"Swiss companies have indicated their interest in investing CHF 150-200 billion in new U.S. investments thanks to President Trump's policies, and we look forward to our continued talks.\" The U.S. is Switzerland's second-biggest trading partner after the European Union – the 27-member country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said. The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV's New Orleans Creole lineage has city buzzing with excitement",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 10, 2025 / 7:21 PM EDT/ CBS News America's most European city is buzzing over the news that the Catholic Church'snew popeis not only from the U.S. but also has Haitian and Creole ancestors from New Orleans. WhilePope Leo XIVwas born in Chicago, Illinois, records show that his family lineage has deep roots in Louisiana. When his maternal great-grandmother was just a baby, she was baptized in 1840 at the city's iconic St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square, the New Orleans Archdiocese said. A couple of decades later, the pope's maternal great-grandparents — Ferdinand D. Baquie and Eugenie Grambois — married on Sept. 19, 1864, in New Orleans' St. Mary's Church on Chartres Street, according to the New Orleans Archdiocese's sacramental records. According to records from the Vital Records Collection at the Louisiana State Archives, Leo's great-grandparents' death certificates show they died in Louisiana, as well. A marriage certificate from the Louisiana State Archives shows Leo's maternal grandparents — Joseph N. Martinez and Louise Baquie — married in New Orleans on Sept. 17, 1887. Historians say the pope's grandparents moved to Chicago in the early 1900s and they remained married for over 50 years. Jari Honora, family Historian with the Historic New Orleans Collection, was the first to discover the pontiff's family ties. \"I was just thrilled and almost in disbelief that the pope would have a New Orleans connection,\" Honora said. Louisiana State Archives records also show the pope's maternal grandmother identified as being from New Orleans and his grandfather identified as being a native of Haiti. He says the pontiff's maternal grandfather, Joseph Martinez, was later listed as being from the Dominican Republic. However, in the earliest census records in which he appears, Martinez and his entire household were listed as being from Louisiana. \"It causes you to wonder, maybe there was sort of a conscious memory of some Haitian ancestry that he was speaking to, or maybe he really thought that he had been born in Haiti, or maybe there was even early on, an attempt to sort of obfuscate the true origins of the family,\" Honora said. \"I can tell you that by the time they get to Chicago, there's one census where he's listed as Maltese, which is not correct.\" Honora — a Creole Catholic himself — said the choice of such a multi-cultural pontiff is a special moment for the city of New Orleans and for Creole culture. \"It highlights the role that Catholics of color, that Black Catholics have always played, in the church since the very beginning,\" Honora said. \"We sort of take for granted here on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana in particular, that there are Catholics of color, there are Black Catholics in the church.\" Honora said he's still researching whether the new highest leader of the Catholic Church has ancestors who were once enslaved. \"I'm quite confident that we will get there on at least one line, and I say only one line... documenting enslaved ancestors is a totally different experience than some of the more contemporary research, say, 20th century or late 19th century research, where you have widespread adherence to vital records laws,\" Honora said. \"Prior to the 1870 census, after the Civil War, enslaved people are not listed in the census by name at all — there are only tick marks, check marks on slave schedules.\" Honora noted thatPope Leo'slove of cooking, and that of his mother, is likely something passed down from their Creole roots. \"That was one of the things that I read in interviews that the Holy Father did long before he was even a candidate for the papacy is that he was open to a vocation, because the neighborhood priests from the surrounding parishes, they were always in his home, because they loved his mother's cooking, and now we know why: because she was a New Orleans cook,\" Honora said. People in the Big Easy said it's exciting to see a pope with Louisiana Creole roots. \"I think if there was going to be a first American pope, this is a very good person to take on that role, it feels like a good representation, but also, he seems like someone that it seems like is going to represent the interests of a lot of Americans, more so than other cardinals might have,\" said Emmaline Kelly, a native of New Orleans who attended Catholic school in the city and now works at a local business in the French Quarter. She says she hopesPope Leowill schedule a visit back to see his Creole roots very soon, and in the meantime, \"hopefully follow in Francis's footsteps, and open the Catholic Church's arms to LGBT people... providing vocal support for refugees.\" Kati Weis is a Murrow Award-winning reporter for CBS News based in New Orleans, covering the Southeast.

    "title": "Kentucky Derby-winning jockey suspended for excessive riding crop use during race",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 10, 2025 / 5:35 PM EDT/ CBS News The jockey whorode Sovereignty to victoryat last weekend's Kentucky Derby has been issued a fine and suspension for striking the 3-year-old colt with his riding crop an excessive amount during the race. Jockey Junior Alvarado was given a $62,000 fine and suspended two upcoming racing days at Churchill Downsfor violating the rulesof the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority, a nationwide organization that regulates the sport. In a ruling handed down Friday, the Kentucky Board of Stewards, which oversees horseracing in Kentucky, determined that Alvarado struck Sovereignty eight times with his riding crop, \"which is more than the permitted amount\" under HISA rules, HISA spokesperson Mandy Minger told CBS News in a statement Saturday. Underthe HISA rule, a crop can only be used a maximum of six times during a race. The fine for such a violation is 10% of the jockey's portion of the $3.1 million purse. Alvarado pocketed $310,000 for the win, meaning he would get a $31,000 fine. However, this marked the second time in the past 180 days in which Alvarado had violated the rule while racing in Kentucky, which led to stewards doubling the fine under an \"escalating penalty structure,\" Minger explained, resulting in the $62,000 number, along with the two-day suspension that will be served at the end of May. All jockey crop fines go towards a jockey mental health program, HISA said. Sovereignty is owned by Godolphin —the name of the racing stable of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum — and trained by William Mott. Sovereignty entered the 151st Kentucky Derby at 5-1 odds, but edged out the heavy favorite, Journalism, in a thrilling finish in muddy, sloppy conditions. Itwas announced earlier this weekthat Sovereignty will not run in Preakness Stakes on May 17, ending his chances of a Triple Crown, a feat which has not been achieved since Justify did it in 2018. However, Mott told reporters that Sovereignty is still expected to run in the Belmont Stakes on June 7, the final race of the Triple Crown. Prior to the May 3 Derby, Sovereignty had finished second in March's Florida Derby and won the Fountain of Youth Stakes earlier that month, as well as the Street Sense Stakes last October.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 10, 2025 / 5:29 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Five fishermen who spent 55 days adrift at sea arrived Saturday at a port in the Galapagos Islands after being rescued by a tuna boat, the Ecuadorian navysaidon X. The three Peruvians and two Colombians had been missing since mid-March and were found on May 7 by anEcuadorianboat called Aldo. Vladimir González, 32,  José Albines , 52,  José Gabriel Albines, 31, and Jhonny García  Jorge Ugarte, 40, arrived at the San Cristobal Navy Base in the morning and their conditions were stable, the navy said. The fishermen had reported damage to the boat's alternator two days after setting sail from Pucusana Bay, to the south of Peru's capital Lima, the navy said in a separate post on Friday. The navy said it is coordinating with local and foreign authorities to ensure their safe return to their respective countries. Earlier this year, another Peruvian fisherman,61-year-old Máximo Napa,spent 95 days at sea alone. He was also rescued by an Ecuadorian vessel and returned to Lima mid-March to be reunited with his family. Napa told local media he survived the ordeal at sea by eating cockroaches, birds and turtles, according to Agence France-Presse. Several dramatic rescues have been made at sea. In October,Russian Mikhail Pichugin was rescuedafter spending more than two months adrift in a small inflatable boat, drinking rainwater in the Sea of Okhotsk, off the coast of Russia. His brother and nephew died while at sea and he tiedtheir bodiesto the boat to prevent them from being washed away. In 2023, Australian sailor Tim Shaddocksurvived more than two monthslost at sea with his dog, Bella. The pair were sailing from Mexico to French Polynesia, the 51-year-old said, when rough seas damaged their boat and its electronics system, leaving them adrift and cut off from the world. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "Sean 'Diddy' Combs, once the life of the party, has few A-list supporters",
    "article_text": "Sean “Diddy” Combs was once the life of the party. He was known for hosting lavish and exclusive gatherings in the Hamptons, having seemingly countless celebrity pals and toasting to the good life with powerful allies in the music industry. Yet a question remains as opening statements approach next week in his federal sex-trafficking trial: Why haven’t more of his famous friends come to his defense? “The music industry is fickle,” said Ramal “The Hometown Heat” Brown, a former hip-hop disc jockey at 105.3 KJAMZ in Tulsa, Oklahoma. “Everyone wants to be around when you’re on top.” But when a video of Combs beating his former girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura was aired by CNN last year, “nobody wanted to be around because it could tarnish their image and name,” he said. “Being around Diddy could get you implicated in the case.” After the videoaired, Combs apologized publicly, saying his behavior in it was “inexcusable” and that he took full responsibility for his actions. Combs is charged in a five-count indictment with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and faces 10 years to life in prison if convicted. Opening statements in the federal trial in Manhattan are expected to begin next week. The government’s case centers on allegations that Combs forced women to participate in drug-fueled sexual encounters with male sex workers that he directed and filmed. He called the sex parties “freak offs,” prosecutors said. In addition to the federal charges, Combs has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct in more than 50 civil lawsuits, including one filed by Ventura in 2023 that was privately settled within a day. His attorney said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing, and Combs has vehemently denied the allegations in the pending civil suits. The past year has seen a stark turn of events for the hitmaker, who has been nominated for 14 Grammy Awards over three decades while turning unknown musicians, such as Ma$e, Total and Carl Thomas, into platinum-selling recording artists. During jury selection last week, as the magnitude of the moment began to mount, Combs appeared to nervously look around the courtroom and asked U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian for a bathroom break. No celebrity supporters have shown up in court during jury selection. Being associated with Combs and his federal case is risky and can only tarnish the burnished images of A-list celebrities, music experts said. “People aren’t speaking out because they don’t want any level of implication,” said Gerrick Kennedy, a freelance journalist and culture critic based in Los Angeles. Madison Gray, a former website editor for Black Entertainment Television, said he thinks many of Combs’ associates have distanced themselves because of the heinous acts he’s accused of. “Celebrity friends and powerful friends scatter. Nobody wants to be attached,” said Gray, pointing to similar scenarios when Bill Cosby and R. Kelly faced legal battles. “When things are good, the parties are great, the liquor is flowing. But as soon as something goes wrong, friendships are fleeting.” Rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has been one of Combs’ staunchest celebrity supporters leading up to the trial, defending him online on multiple occasions and accusing Ventura, who was once signed to Combs’ record label, of attempting to pressure him for money. Ye accused Ventura of attempting to extort Combs in a since-deleted post on X on March 18. Ventura responded the next day by resharing a post from the culture website Shade Room showing a screenshot of rapper Playboi Carti telling Ye to shut up. Ventura’s attorney, Douglas Wigdor, declined to comment this week. Ye’s comments came amid controversy over aslew of postson X in which he made hate-filled remarks about the Jewish community and said “I love Hitler” and “I’m a Nazi.” Former in-house Bad Boy Records producer Stevie J has also expressed support for Combs, calling many of the civil lawsuits filed against his ex-boss “bogus” and saying he prays for Combs and his family every day. “I never knew of an instance where you’ll be guilty before you even go to f-----g court,” he told the entertainment YouTube channelVladTV. “I’m never going to stop being there for someone I consider to be a friend. I’m not going to turn my back. I’ve been scrutinized just by being a friend. I guess someone has never had a true friend before.” Singer Ray J has acknowledged attending Combs’ parties in multiple interviews but said he never saw any freak offs or orgies. “I can guarantee you most of the celebrities that went to Diddy’s parties never even heard of a freak off,” he toldNews Nationhost Chris Cuomo in November. “In the beginning it sounded really interesting and entertaining, I would say, but when you look back, where were the freak offs? From my knowledge, I’ve never seen a freak off.” Ventura is expected to take the stand once the trial begins, but a witness list has not been released. Potential jurors this week received a list of places and names that might be mentioned during the trial, including celebrities such as Michael B. Jordan, Mike Myers and Ye, none of whom are implicated in the case.",

    "title": "Business travel was making a post-Covid comeback — until the trade war diverted it",
    "article_text": "Business travel’s four-year crawl out the pandemic was on track to continue this year, but the U.S. trade war has scrambled that outlook. “The big word is uncertainty,” said Suzanne Neufang, CEO of the Global Business Travel Association, which hadforecast worldwide spending to surgeto $1.64 trillion in 2025, up from an expected $1.48 trillion in 2024. Last year’s estimated total, if preliminary data bears out, would mark the first time the sector surpassed its pre-Covid levels. But pessimism has risen sharply amid President Donald Trump’s deep cuts to the government workforce and a dizzying range of tariffs. Now, about 29% of U.S. corporate travel managers and an equal share abroad expect business travel to decline this year due to government actions, according to arecent GBTA survey. The expected pullbacks could dent business trips by as much as 22%, the group found. Industry experts caution that souring expectations so far haven’t translated to a collapse in bookings, despite signs of cooler demand. Business travel “hasn’t fallen off a cliff,” said Jonathan Kletzel, a travel, transportation and logistics leader at the consulting firm PwC. “It is definitely constrained right now, but will people stop traveling? Probably not. If you’re a sales-heavy organization and you’re not out in the market meeting with your clients, your competitors are.” Still, growing concerns around business travel coincide with corporate leaders’ warnings that U.S. trade policies have injected fresh uncertainty into an economy that just months agolooked on track to build on its strengths. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastiantold CNBClast month that the carrier has had to check its expectations for what was shaping up to be the “best financial year in our history.” Travel demand was growing about 10% at the start of the year but has since slowed, he said, partly due to companies rethinking business trips and cuts to the federal workforce. Other airlineshave flagged similar concerns, in some cases adjusting their growth plans or scaling back capacity. Hotel operators and booking platforms are feeling it, too. Expediasaid Fridaythat U.S. travel demand is cooling. Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton have each reduced their financial forecasts in recent weeks, with the first of those hospitality giants warning investors of “an expected continuation of declines in U.S. government demand.” Since retaking office,Trump has overseenmass firingsand spending reductionsacross the federal bureaucracy, with many of the changes led by multibillionaire adviser Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency project. While some of the cuts have been halted in court, travel bookers for government contractors have weathered a hectic few months. Global Travel Associates, a Washington, D.C.-area agency that mainly serves government contractors, said travel sales slid 20% in the first quarter. Several had funding tied to the U.S. Agency for International Development, whichthe Trump administration gutted this spring, and those accounts are down by 75%-90%, Managing Director Tom Ollinger estimated. Some of GTA’s clients switched to buying only refundable plane tickets; others canceled scheduled meetings or halted any new travel plans indefinitely, he said. In some cases, those with staffers on long-term assignments overseas were told to drop everything and head back to home base. “The organization provided them one-way tickets to return,” Ollinger said. “Government groups are not happening,” said Jan Freitag, national director for market analytics at the real estate data firm CoStar. But many business meetings are still taking place, and while individual business travel is a bit softer, “that could just be people not booking as much ahead,” he said. However, Freitag cautioned, “should [more] tariffs hit and corporations have less sense of where their costs are going, they’ll start looking to cut costs. And the easiest place to control costs is travel and training.” Navan, a corporate travel management service based in Palo Alto, California, said bookings were up in the first four months of the year from the same period in 2024, despite a slight slowdown in April. “There’s certainly this feeling of waiting for another shoe to drop,” said Rich Liu, Navan’s CEO of travel. While CEOs are telling him they’re “feeling the squeeze” from new import taxes and other policy moves, “they still have businesses to run,” Liu said. Individual business travelers seem to be getting anxious. The online travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth saw a 223% annual surge in searches for“cancel for work reasons” travel coveragelast month, with purchases of those policies jumping 53%. “That tells us that travelers are feeling uneasy,” said Squaremouth CEO Rupa Mehta. “In uncertain economic times, they want to understand the cost and value of flexible coverage before committing.” The current outlook is “a mixed bag,” said Lorraine Sileo, founder of Phocuswright, a global travel research firm. At the moment, “it looks like leisure travel will be impacted more than business travel,” she said, adding that “it will take longer for corporations to feel the pinch of an economic downturn” than it will for vacationers. “We need to take a wait-and-see approach” to see how business trips fare, Sileo said, “but there are indications that it will be a slow year for all types of travel for the U.S. market in 2025.”",

    "title": "Putin says Russia is 'committed' to restart talks with Kyiv, suggests  May 15 start",
    "article_text": "MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin of Russia said early Sunday that his country is committed to restart direct talks with Kyiv about ending their war, and suggested the next discussions begin May 15 in Turkey. He said he was scheduled to speak to Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, later Sunday with hopes of holding talks next week in Istanbul. There would be no preconditions on Russia's part, he said. Putin said Ukraine walked away from such talks in the past and broke ceasefire agreements, though both sides have been blamed for attacks during the last three ceasefires. He used language that expressed his desire for serious talks with long-term consequences, including long-lasting peace. Putin’s comments came on the last day ofthe three-day ceasefire declared by Russia, and almost immediately afterleaders from the United Kingdom, France, Poland and Germanythreatened to increase sanctions against the nation if he does not accept an unconditional, 30-day ceasefire starting Monday. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz made the demand for an unconditional ceasefire in a news briefing, which included over 30 countries that have pledged to strengthen Ukraine. They also joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the memorial of fallen Ukrainian soldiers at independence square in Kyiv, Ukraine, on Saturday. The leaders said the proposal to start the ceasefire Monday was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ceasefire aims to enforce a halt to fighting on land, sea and air. The world leaders’ show of force came amid mounting efforts to persuade Moscow to agree to a truce that would allow for peace talks on ending over three years of war. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's special envoy to Ukraine,said on Xon Saturday that such a ceasefire could \"start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.\" Kellogg enlisted a quote from Trump — \"stop the killing now\" — to bolster his own statement in support of a 30-day ceasefire. Putin has previously saidhe wants Ukraine to withdraw from four regions — Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — which Russia illegally annexed shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022. He has also insisted that Ukraine promise never to join NATO, accept restrictions on the size of its army, and protect Russian culture and language inside the country. Last week, Putin said Russia hadsufficient strengthand resources to take the war in Ukraine to its logical conclusion, though he hoped there would be no need to use nuclear weapons.",

    "title": "DHS spokesperson threatens arrests of House Democrats who were at N.J. ICE facility",
    "article_text": "A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security on Saturday suggested the Trump administration could pursue arrests of the House Democrats involved in an incident at a New Jersey Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility on Friday and accused them of assaulting ICE officers. “I think that we should let viewers know there will likely be more coming,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN on Saturday morning. “We actually have body camera footage of some of these members of Congress assaulting our ICE enforcement officers, including body-slamming a female ICE officer,” McLaughlin said. Her comments were in response to a question from CNN’s Victor Blackwell, who asked whether others were arrested Friday in addition to Newark Mayor Ras Baraka,who was charged with trespassing. Asked whether that meant a member of Congress could be arrested in connection with Friday’s events, McLaughlin told Blackwell, “This is an ongoing investigation, and that is definitely on the table.” She added that ICE was in possession of video evidence documenting the incident. Later on Saturday, McLaughlinposted a video on Xshowing chaos outside of the detention facility, writing, “We will not tolerate assault against our ICE law enforcement agents. By members of Congress or anyone else.” Her remarks came one day after three members of Congress — Reps. Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez and LaMonica McIver, all New Jersey Democrats — visited the Delaney Hall detention facility to conduct oversight, according to statements from two of the lawmakers. “As Members of Congress, we have a legal right to conduct oversight at any DHS facility without prior notice, as we have already done twice this year. Throughout every step of this visit, ICE attempted to intimidate everyone involved and impede our ability to conduct oversight,” Menendez said in a statement Friday. “This is like nothing I’ve ever seen before, and I am shocked and disturbed that something like this happened in our community.” And McIver said in a statement that the lawmakers were met with “contempt, disrespect, and aggression from ICE.” “From roughing up members of congress to arresting the mayor of our state’s largest city, there is no version of today that does not show the blatant abuses of power of the Trump administration,” she added. None of the three members of Congress mentioned seeing any kind of violence against ICE officers during their visit to the facility. And ina post on Xon Saturday, Watson Coleman denied McLaughlin’s allegations, writing, “The notion that I or any of my colleagues ‘body slammed’ armed federal officers is absurd. DHS is lying because they know their agents were out of line.” “They have to resort to lies because their conduct is indefensible on the merits. They can threaten us all they like, but their lies are still lies. We will not be intimidated,” the congresswoman added. A spokesperson for DHS referred NBC News to the U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey for comment. A spokesperson for the U.S. attorney, Alina Habba, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokespeople for Menendez and McIver also did not immediately respond to a request for comment about McLaughlin’s remarks. Baraka appeared on CNN directly after McLaughlin and called her allegations of assault “ridiculous.” “I’m waiting for them to show a video,” he added. Baraka pointed out that Watson Coleman, 80, is an older woman, “who probably couldn’t lift any of them.” “None of those people body-slammed any officer,” Baraka added. The Newark mayor also denied the charges that he was arrested on on Friday, telling Blackwell, “I was not trespassing at all. I mean, we’re in court, so we’ll argue that in the court.”",

    "title": "How Pope Leo became a beloved Peruvian figure",
    "article_text": "CHICLAYO, Peru — Walkiria Garcia was 14 years old when she made her confirmation in the Catholic Church, an already significant religious sacrament made even more unforgettable by the man officiating it, Robert Prevost, who a decade later wouldbecome Pope Leo XIV. To many Peruvians, however, Leo is more than the first pope from the U.S. He is also the first Peruvian pope. Pope Leo, born on the South Side of Chicago, first arrived in Peru in 1985as a missionary. For 10 years, he taught canon law in Trujillo, immersing himself in the local culture and community. Though he returned to Chicago to lead the Augustinian order in the Midwest, he couldn’t stay away for too long. In 2014, he moved to Chiclayo, Peru, where he served as an apostolic administrator, bishop and later archbishop. He even became anaturalized Peruvian citizen in 2015. Now, Garcia has one message for the new pontiff: “Don’t change.” Garcia, now 24, recalls her first encounter with Leo at her Augustinian school, saying she felt like he was more of a friend than an authority figure. That’s because Leo was “fun,” and was frequently seen playing games with the students in addition to speaking to them about religious topics. Garcia said the former bishop shared messages of love and openness with the students, in line with their Augustinian beliefs. “We can always return and we can always change our life,” Garcia said. Leo’s deep bond with Peruvians is rooted in his embrace of their customs. Garcia fondly remembers seeing him at cultural festivals, serving food and participating in traditions. “He was Peruvian,” Garcia said. In hisfirst speech as pope, Leo expressed gratitude to the people of Chiclayo, highlighting the city’s influence on his journey. Garcia connected with Leo again in a chance encounter during a 2021 flight, where they reminisced about her confirmation and school days. Garcia hopes that Leo will “follow the Francis message,” continuing to “love all people” and embracing members of the LGBTQ community. She would like to see him continue his work with children and young adults, just as he did in Chiclayo. “He is our first Peruvian pope,” Garcia said. Stephanie Gosk reported from Chiclayo, Peru,and Viola Flowers reported from New York City.",

    "article_text": "The jockey who rode Sovereignty to victory at theKentucky Derbylast week has been fined over $60,000 for striking the horse with his riding crop too many times during the race, according to the Horseracing Integrity and Safety Authority. Junior Alvarado was found to have struck the horse with his riding crop “more than the permitted amount” during last week’s race, violating the authority’s rules, it said in a statement Saturday. A penalty was imposed against Alvarado on Friday for committing the Class 3 violation and he was hit with a fine equating to 10% of his $310,000 winnings, the statement said. The fine was then doubled “pursuant to an escalating penalty structure for repeat riding crop violations within the previous 180 days,” resulting in a$62,000 fine, according to HISA. Alvarado was found to have struck Sovereignty eight times during the Kentucky Derby, which was his second offense in 180 days, per a HISA ruling. HISA protocol allows jockeys to strike horses a maximum of six times during a race. The jockey was also suspended for two Kentucky racing days, May 29 and 30, as a result of the violation. According to HISA, riding crop penalties can be appealed via hearing before the Internal Adjudication Panel. Alvarado did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Alvarado now has 30 days to pay the fine. The jockey and Sovereignty won the 151st running of the Kentucky Derby last Saturday at Churchill Downs. Following the race, Alvarado, who grew up in Venezuela, said winning the Derby was a dream of his since he was a child. The jockey suffered a shoulder injury and a fall ahead of the race, but went on to win despite the odds.",

    "article_text": "Just days aftermaking history as the first American Pope, Illinois native Pope Leo XIV is preparing for a reunion with his siblings in Rome, where his brother John Prevost will join him to celebrate thisunprecedented moment for the Catholic Church and Chicago alike. Pope Leo was elected following the 2025 papal conclave on Thursday, with the Dolton native becoming the first-ever American-born pope in the church’s history. The unexpected travel to Rome marks the fifth time Prevost has traveled to the Italian capital. Two of those trips were with his brother, who is now the global leader of the Catholic Church. Prevost told NBC Chicago he informed his brother about the trip in a brief phone call. “I told him we were coming. He said, ‘Oh, okay,’” Prevost said. Prevost reflected on the pride tied to his brother's historic achievement, while acknowledging the challenges. He noted that his parents would be “happy and ecstatic” about Pope Leo's role. \"That's the thing...look at the 'first' that we are here. First from the United States, first from Chicago,\" Prevost said.\" He's kind of young. Tremendous responsibility. The world will be watching his every step.\" As for his plans during the visit, Prevost said much remains up in the air. “We’re waiting to see, we’re supposed to have lunch, we’re supposed to go somewhere. We get to travel with the Pope to some special place and we’ll just figure it out. Because we’re only here until Tuesday,” Prevost said. Prevost said he does not plan to stay for Pope Leo’s installation.",

    "title": "Saints QB Derek Carr is retiring because of ‘significant degenerative changes’ to his right shoulder",
    "article_text": "NEW ORLEANS — New Orleans Saints veteran starting quarterback Derek Carr has decided to retire because of a labral tear in his right shoulder and “significant degenerative changes” to his rotator cuff, the team announced Saturday. Carr, 34, has played for 11 pro seasons since being selected out of Fresno State by the then-Oakland Raiders in the second round of the 2014 NFL draft. He was acquired by the Saints as a free agent in 2023 but had mixed results in New Orleans, going 14-13 as a starter while struggling through oblique, hand and head injuries that caused him to miss seven games last season. Carr, who was entering the third year of a four-year, $150 million contract, experienced unexpected pain in his throwing shoulder when he began to ramp up training this offseason, which led to his diagnosis that now has cut short his career. “Surgery was an option, jeopardizing the entire 2025 season, yet there was no guarantee Derek would return to the level of strength, function and performance of play to which he was accustomed,” the Saints said in a written announcement. The Saints did not acknowledge Carr’s injury until the day before the draft. Carr did not speak publicly about the injury until a few days later, when hedelivered a guest sermon at a Las Vegas church. In that sermon, Carr said his critics were “lying” about him when they questioned the unusual timing of the injury, as well as both the team’s and Carr’s initial reticence to address it openly or answer questions about it. Carr has career passing totals of 41,245 yards, 257 touchdowns and 112 interceptions. He retires with a 77-92 regular-season record as a starter and without having won a playoff game. Carr said he made the decision in consultation with his wife, Heather, and “upon reflection of prayer.” “For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience,” Carr said. “It’s difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials and especially the fans who made this journey so special.” The decision also comes after New Orleans used a highsecond-round draft choice to select Louisville’s Tyler Shoughas a potential future starting quarterback — although it remains to be seen how quickly he can be ready for that role. Other QBs on the Saints’ roster include second-year pro Spencer Rattler and third-year player Jake Haener, who did post a victory between them in seven games last season, six of which Rattler started.",

    "article_text": "Notorious California serial killerRandy Krafthas been identified as the suspect in the murder of a man almost 45 years ago, police said Friday. Larry Eugene Parks, 30, was found dead along Interstate 5 on the morning of July 18, 1980, in Oregon, according to the Oregon State Police. An investigation into his death was opened, but Parks remained a John Doe until just last month, after an investigator from the sheriff’s department in Orange County, California, offered to help identify him using forensic genealogy in 2024. Kraft, who remains incarcerated at San Quentin Rehabilitation Center, was convicted of brutalizing and killing 16 men during a decadelong series of slayings in Orange County, California, that ended with his arrest. The convicted murderer is also suspected of committing over 60 murders across the West Coast and Michigan, police said. To identify Parks as another potential victim, a genetic profile was created using a sample of his blood, which helped investigators find and contact possible family members. They submitted DNA, leading to his identification. Parks was a Vietnam veteran and had lost contact with his family a year before his death. “Until his identification last month, the circumstances of his disappearance were unknown to the Parks family,” police said. Police believe Kraft, who was arrested in Orange County, California, in 1983, is responsible for Parks’ death. Evidence from the murder, along with the murder of another man who was also found on I-5 the day before Parks, was transferred to the Orange County District Attorney’s Office to be used in court, but remained in the county until 2024, when the investigator set out to identify the 30-year-old, according to police. “With Parks’ identity confirmed, investigators are now working to bring resolution to the 45-year-old case,” police said. In 2023, anIowa teenbelieved to have been one of Kraft’s earliest victims was also identified using genealogy.",

    "title": "Celtics vs. Knicks: Can New York actually keep this up?",
    "article_text": "The most surprising series of the second round of the NBA playoffs so far is the one between the Boston Celtics and the New York Knicks. After the Celtics won the four games between the two teams in the regular season — with an average margin of victory of 16.3 points — the Knicks have raced out to a 2-0 lead in their postseason matchup. Not only did New York win two games on the road to start the series, the Knicks came back from 20-point deficits in the second halves of both games. How is all this happening? NBC News’ Andrew Greif and Rohan Nadkarni break down the series so far, and what to expect moving forward. Nadkarni:The real answer is it is a combination of both. At the same time, if we’re splitting up the accountability pie, the Celtics deserve more scorn for blowing the first two games. Simply put, Boston has made only 25 of its 100 3-point attempts this series. If the Celtics were shooting only 30% — which would still be far below their regular-season average and by far the worst of any team in the NBA — they are probably up 2-0 in this series. I don’t want to get too reductive and say “make shots”... but also, make some shots! Greif:This is Boston’s undoing, because while the Knicks have played with an undeniable resolve all postseason — multiple comebacks secured their first-round victory against Detroit, too — they’ve also been undeniably flawed. Game 2 was New York’sworst offensive gameof its season, as measured by points scored per possession, and it wasn’t exactly a shock for a team that is scoring 10 fewer points per 100 possessions in the playoffs than during the regular season. That’s a big drop, even when accounting for the seemingly annual trend of scoring dropping in the playoffs. Yet the Knicks have handed Boston two losses in a series for the first time since 2023, anyway. Greif:Shoddy late-game execution that is shouldered by everyone. Boston has given up 11 more field goals, made just 15 percent of its 3-pointers, and registered a meager 6-to-5 assist-to-turnover ratio in the fourth quarter. With 18 seconds left in Game 2, Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla designed a smart play to free star Jayson Tatum for a full sprint that turned into an easy dunk and 90-89 lead. But needing another go-ahead basket on the game’s final possession, Mazzulla went to the exact same play and the Knicks weren’t fooled. Tatum is shooting just 1-for-12 in the fourth quarter this series, while his co-star Jaylen Brown is 1-for-7. Nadkarni:The buck has to stop with Boston’s best players, Tatum and Brown. Tatum is shooting under 30% from the field this series, and Brown isn’t doing much better, shooting under 40%. They have been inefficient, too 3-point happy, and aren’t making good decisions in crunch time. Tatum especially needs to step up. Not because he’s not great, not because he has to prove he’s a superstar, but because he’s shown all these things already. Tatum is an incredibly accomplished playoff performer, and he’s had some big games in incredibly high-stakes moments. You wouldn’t know that from watching this series. Nadkarni:Almost definitely not, but they also don’t have to. There’s no rule that you have to win every game in a four-game series the same way. Even if the Celtics start hitting 3s, that doesn’t mean the Knicks can’t win this series. I don’t expect New York to keep winning in the fashion it did in the first two games. It would be irresponsible to assume any team can keep creating 20-point deficits in the playoffs and come back to win every time. So I don’t believe the Knicks’ formula from the first two games is repeatable (even though they somehow repeated it after Game 1!), but that doesn’t mean they don’t have other ways to win. Greif:This is fundamentally a question of what you trust more. Is it a two-game sample size that has seen the Knicks turn into a crunch-time monster — in fourth quarters this series, New York has made nine 3-pointers while Boston has made nineshots total— or their season-long body of evidence, which saw New York rank only around league average in “clutch” scenarios? And do you view the Knicks, who are now 6-2 in the postseason against the 44-38 Pistons and 61-21 Celtics, as finally equipped to beat good teams, or the squad that went just 15-23 against teams with winning records during the regular season? They’ve captured lighting in a bottle and yet it still feels like the Celtics have a larger margin for error. Greif:Regression to the mean. Boston’s strategy of shooting many, many 3-pointers is nothing new, but rarely have they been this bad at it. When Celtics radio broadcaster Sean Grande dug into the numbers, hefoundthat Games 1 and 2 marked just the second time in the last sixyearsthat the team had gone consecutive games shooting 25% or worse from 3. Will that level of shooting really sustain an entire series? The other trend worth watching is that Boston has a .709 winning percentage on the road versus .589 at home during their last four postseasons. Playing in New York this weekend, then, might actually be a good thing. Nadkarni:The Celtics’ path is to do what they’ve done for most of this series and pretty much all of the regular season: Overwhelm teams with their shooting talent while being stout at every position defensively. What the fourth-quarter comebacks obfuscate is that Boston has to build a 20-point lead in the first place! The Celtics have been able to dominate large portions of this series despite not shooting well at all. Boston does not need to reinvent the wheel. It doesn’t even need to radically change its strategy, even if its frustrating watching 3s not fall after possessions with very minimal passing. But the Celtics are literally a couple shots a way from winning a series in which they’ve lost by four points combined over two games. The Cs need to stick to who they’ve been. Nadkarni:Outside of the 3-point shooting, it’s what happening in the frontcourt. Knicks center Mitchell Robinson has been a huge plus this series, to the point Boston was desperately trying to intentionally foul him off the court in Game 2. Meanwhile, Celtics’ center Kristaps Porzingis is dealing with a mysterious illness, and it’s made Boston much more reliant on Al Horford than it wants to be. Horford has been a steady pro for years, but he is not the offensive threat Porzingis is. Even if the center battle may not ultimately determine what happens in this series, it’s an important subplot under what’s transpired so far. Greif:The eye test and the numbers suggest it’s Knicks big man Robinson. The Knicks have a 2-0 lead because of their defense, and when Robinson has been on the floor this series New York’s defense is 16 points better than when he sits. But the Celtics' Porzingis, who has played only 27 minutes because of a respiratory illness through two games, is my pick. He was a floor-raising catalyst during last year’s Celtics NBA championship but has been a shell of himself in this series, with nearly as many turnovers (two) as field goals (three). Porzingis tried to express confidence while saying that going down 0-2 “kind of takes all the pressure off of us,” but history doesn’t bear that out. Of the 463 playoff series in NBA history to start 2-0,only 34trailing teams have eventually come back to win.",

    "title": "Ye song glorifying Hitler gets millions of views on X while other platforms struggle to remove it",
    "article_text": "Spotify, SoundCloud and other tech platforms have worked to remove a new song from Ye that praises Adolf Hitler, but the song and its video have continued to proliferate online including across X, where it has racked up millions of views. On various mainstream and alternative tech platforms this week, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has been able to share his latest song, titled “Heil Hitler,” along with its companion title, “WW3,” which similarly glorifies Hitler, the architect of the Holocaust. While some platforms have taken steps to attempt to pull down the song, others have seemingly let it spread freely. The continued spread of the song and the varying approaches to moderation exemplify an increasingly fractured environment online and on social media, where some platforms have pulled back on their moderation practices in recent years, while others have tried to maintain higher standards when it comes to hate speech. Elon Musk’s Xis where the song has found its biggest audience. On Thursday, Ye uploaded a video for the song on X, where it remained up as of Friday evening and received more than 6.5 million views. At least 12,000 users and a handful of right-wing influencers quickly shared the clip on their pages. Ye’s most recent repost is of a video mixing historical clips of Hitler together with his song as a backing track. He also shared a video on X of influencer Andrew Tate — a self-described misogynist — playing the song in his car. That video has been viewed over 3 million times. Ye’s account is verified as an organization on X, meaning it could be eligible for monetization and ads. It’s not clear if Ye’s account uses those features. The proliferation of the song, despite its invocation of Hitler, is the latest illustration of the power that social media platforms have handed over to some highly followed celebrities and influencers, and their inability or unwillingness to control the spread of some content after it’s been published. While Ye did not appear to attempt to upload the song to other social media platforms, other people have reposted the video. On Reddit, users on several subreddits devoted to Ye and other rappers uploaded versions of the song to the platform. On r/Kanye, which has 1.1 million members, some users bemoaned Ye’s continued invocation of Hitler and Nazis, while others celebrated the song, posting memes and TikTok videos about it. A Reddit spokesperson said the platform would remove uploads of the song and posts celebrating its message: \"Hate and antisemitism have absolutely no place on Reddit. We have strict rules against hateful content, including antisemitic content. Our internal safety teams proactively enforce these policies across the platform through automated tooling and human review. In line with our sitewide rules, we are removing the song and any celebration of its message.\" On Facebook, NBC News found over a dozen reuploads of the “Heil Hitler” music video, and on YouTube half a dozen reuploads of the song that had been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. On TikTok, a handful of reuploads had been posted using the hashtag #hh. X, Meta, TikTok and YouTube all have hate speech or hateful conduct policies that generally forbid speech targeting a specific group for their race, or hateful invocations of genocide. X and Meta did not respond to requests for comment. A YouTube spokesperson said, “We removed the content and will continue to take down reuploads,” noting that accounts associated with Ye are ineligible for monetization. Ye was briefly able to upload the song to the popular music streaming services Spotify and SoundCloud. The presence of the song on Spotify prompted a petition campaign from theAnti-Defamation Leaguecalling for its removal. In a statement, Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at the ADL, said: “Spotify has been mostly radio silent to outreach from ADL for the majority of 2025, so we felt it was important to activate our volunteer base to pressure them to act on the platform’s stated policies.” Kelley said Spotify didn’t respond to their outreach, but appears to have removed the song. “WW3,” which contains lyrics glorifying Nazis, is still up on the platform. But some users have circumvented Spotify’s removal of the song, uploading it to Spotify’s podcast section or uploading re-recorded cover versions of the song. SoundCloud appeared to remove versions of the song linked to by Ye on his X account, but NBC News located 27 reuploads or remixed versions of the song on the platform. Spotify and SoundCloud did not respond to requests for comment. On Friday, Ye posted on X that he had found a new music streaming hub for his song called Scrybe — linking to a website with links to download pages for the app on Google’s and Apple’s app stores. The small music streaming app bills itself as catering to indie musicians, with the tagline, “More Money for the Artist, Less Money for the Fan.” On the app, Ye’s songs are all labeled as trending. Scrybe did not respond to a request for comment. Update May 10, 2025 8:39 PM: This article was updated to include a statement from Reddit.",

    "title": "A Tennessee earthquake rattles homes as far away as Atlanta with 4.1 magnitude",
    "article_text": "ATLANTA — A 4.1-magnitude earthquake in Tennessee woke up families and rattled homes as far away as Atlanta as it spread tremors across portions of the southern U.S. on Saturday morning. No injuries or major damage were immediately reported. The website for USGS said the earthquake originated shortly after 9 a.m. EDT about 12 miles from Greenback, Tennessee, which is about 30 miles south of Knoxville. More than 23,000 reports from the public were received by USGS in the first hour after the earthquake, USGS spokeswoman Ayesha Davis told The Associated Press in an email. Meteorologists at television news stations serving Georgia and North Carolina reported feeling the tremors as well. There is a 5% chance of a magnitude 4 or larger aftershock in the next week, according to USGS. Gabriela Reilly was making waffles with her husband when they felt their entire home shake in Braselton, Georgia, which is northeast of Atlanta. “Our ceiling fan started shaking for about 10 seconds,” she said. “I thought a giant aircraft had flown low right over the neighborhood, but my husband said, ‘No, that was definitely an earthquake!’” Jason Pack was still in bed at his home outside Knoxville when he felt the walls shaking and heard a rumbling that was loud enough to wake up his family and for the dog to start barking. “In east Tennessee, you’re used to tornadoes and floods, that kind of thing,” Pack said. “It’s unusual to have an earthquake.” Pack has experienced tremors before, although this one is probably the strongest he’s felt in Tennessee. “Even though this one was small, it’s a good reminder — if it had been a big quake, would you know what to do? Drop, cover, and hold on if you’re inside,” said Pack, a retired FBI agent who now works in crisis communications. “Stay clear of buildings if you’re outside.” Damage does not usually occur from earthquakes until they reach a magnitude of somewhere above 4 or 5, according to USGS, although it depends on variables such as building construction, soil and distance from the epicenter. The southeastern U.S. carries a significant earthquake risk, particularly around the New Madrid Seismic Zone to the west and in the East Tennessee Seismic Zone, which is where Saturday’s earthquake occurred, said Davis. Since 1950, 15 other earthquakes of magnitude 4 or larger have occurred within 155 miles (250 kilometers) of Saturday’s earthquake, Davis said. The largest of those was a magnitude 4.7 earthquake near Knoxville in November 1973. More recently, two tremors struck the seismic zone in December 2018. One was a 4.4 magnitude earthquake that was centered in Decatur, Tennessee, which is south of Knoxville. It shook homes as far away as Atlanta. Another earthquake struck a few days later with a magnitude of 3.0. Its epicenter was about two miles (four kilometers) southeast of Mascot, near Knoxville. It also was felt in parts of Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina. Seismic waves from earthquakes spread more efficiently in the Eastern U.S. compared to the West because of the region’s geology, Davis said. “Earthquakes in the East are felt over a much larger distance and by more people,” she said.",

    "title": "India accuses Pakistan of violating ceasefire deal hours after it was announced",
    "article_text": "India's government is accusing Pakistan of violating a ceasefire agreement that was reached earlier Saturday. In a statement, India's foreign secretary said that the ceasefire \"is being violated by Pakistan. The Indian Army is retaliating and dealing with this border intrusion.\" \"This intrusion is extremely condemnable and Pakistan is responsible for it. We believe that Pakistan should understand this situation properly and take appropriate action immediately to stop this intrusion,\" Vikram Misri, the Indian foreign secretary, added. The remarks from Misri come hours after President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced early Saturday that the U.S. had mediated a ceasefire deal between the two South Asian nations after days of fighting in and around the disputed Kashmir region. \"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,\" Trumpwrotein a post on Truth Social, shortly after Rubio issued a statement announcing that the two nations \"have agreed to an immediate ceasefire and to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.\" Shortly after the ceasefire was announced, Tammy Bruce, a spokesperson for the State Department, said in a statement that Rubio \"offered U.S. assistance in starting constructive talks in order to avoid future conflicts,\" but did not indicate when those talks would begin or where they would take place. The foreign ministers of India and Pakistan confirmed the ceasefire agreement, with Pakistan's foreign minister, Ishaq Dar,writingin a post on X: \"Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect. Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!\" In a press conference, India's Misri told reporters: \"Both sides would stop all firing and military action on land and in the air and sea with effect from 1700 hours Indian Standard Time today. Instructions have been given on both sides to give effect to this understanding.\" Later Saturday, though, Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir,wrote on Xthat he heard explosions in Kashmir after the announcement of the ceasefire. The cause of the explosions was not immediately clear. \"What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!\" he wrote. India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on Saturday minimized the United States' role in mediating a ceasefire,saying in a post on X, \"Stoppage of firing and military action between India and Pakistan was worked out directly between the two countries.\" In a separate tweet, however, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump and the U.S. for \"facilitating this outcome,\" further sowing confusion about the Trump administration's role in the ceasefire. \"We thank President Trump for his leadership and proactive role for peace in the region. Pakistan appreciates the United States for facilitating this outcome, which we have accepted in the interest of regional peace and stability,\" Sharif wrote. He added, \"We also thank Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio for their valuable contributions for peace in South Asia.\" In its statement, the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting also said that there was \"no decision to hold talks on any other issue at any other place,\" despite the U.S. State Department's claim that the two nations had decided \"to start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.\" The news comes just days after Pakistanbegan shelling across the borderin the disputed region. India said at least 16 civilians had been killed since the attacks began, and Pakistan said at least 31 people died afterIndia launched airstrikesThursday in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Tensions between the two nuclear powers escalated afteran April 22 terrorist attackin Indian-administered Kashmir that killed 26 people. Indian officials said the militant groups responsible for that attack have ties to Pakistan, which denied any involvement.",

    "title": "Ukraine and its allies push for a 30-day ceasefire starting Monday",
    "article_text": "KYIV, Ukraine — In a show of unity in Kyiv on Saturday, leaders from four major European countries threatened toratchet up pressure if Russian President Vladimir Putindoes not accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. The leaders, from France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland, said the proposal to start the ceasefire on Monday was supported by U.S. President Donald Trump, whom they had briefed over the phone earlier in the day. Their statement came amid mounting efforts to persuade Moscow to agree to a truce that would allow for peace talks on ending over three years of full-scale war. The demand was announced in a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and countries leading the so-called “coalition of the willing”: a group of over 30 countries who have pledged to strengthen Ukraine to deter Russian aggression. They included French President Emmanuel Macron, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who on Saturday traveled to Ukraine together for the first time. The ceasefire would include a halt to fighting on land, sea and in the air. The leaders threatened to ratchet up sanctions, including on Russia’s energy and banking sectors, if Putin did not comply. Earlier that day, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Kyiv and its allies are ready for a “full, unconditional ceasefire” with Russia for “at least 30 days” starting Monday. He added the four visiting leaders and Zelenskyy had had a “constructive” phone call with Trump. Saturday marked the last day of a unilateral three-day ceasefire declared by Russia that Ukraine says the Kremlin’s forces have repeatedly violated. In March, the United States proposed an immediate, limited 30-day truce, which Ukraine accepted, but the Kremlin has held out forterms more to its liking. Building up Ukraine’s military capabilities will be a key deterrent against Russia, the European leaders said Saturday. This will require supplying Ukraine with robust quantities of arms to deter future attacks and investing in its defense sector. A force comprised of foreign troops could also be deployed as an added “reassurance” measure, Macron said. The French president added that the United States will take the lead in monitoring a proposed cease-fire, with support from European countries, and threatened “massive sanctions ... prepared and coordinated between Europeans and Americans,” should Russia violate the truce. But he said details about potential European deployments to Ukraine were still being fine-tuned. No mention was made of NATO membership, still Kyiv’s top choice for a security guarantee. The priority is to make the war too costly for Russia to keep fighting, Ukraine’s Sybiha told reporters on the sidelines of the event. Retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, said Saturday that a “comprehensive” 30-day ceasefire, covering attacks from the air, land, sea and on infrastructure, “will start the process for ending the largest and longest war in Europe since World War II.” Earlier on Saturday, the European leaders joined a ceremony at Kyiv’s Independence Square marking the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. They lit candles alongside Zelenskyy at amakeshift flag memorialfor fallen Ukrainian soldiers and civilians slain since Russia’s invasion. Trump has pressed both sides to quickly come to an agreement to end the war, but while Zelenskyy agreed to the American plan for an initial 30-day halt to hostilities, Russia has not signed on. Instead, it has kept up attacks along the roughly 1,000-mile (1,600-kilometer) front line,including deadly strikes on residential areas with no obvious military targets. On Saturday morning, local officials in Ukraine’s northern Sumy region said Russian shelling over the past day killed three residents and wounded four more. Another civilian man died on the spot on Saturday as a Russian drone struck the southern city of Kherson, according to regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin. Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, French President Emmanuel Macron said: “What’s happening with Poland, Germany and Great Britain is a historic moment for European defense and toward a greater independence for our security. Obviously, for Ukraine and all of us. It’s a new era. It’s a Europe that sees itself as a power.” Trump said last week that he doubts Putin wants to end hiswar in Ukraine, expressing new skepticism that a peace deal can be reached soon, andhinted at further sanctions against Russia. Progress on ending the war has seemed elusive in the months since Trump returned to the White House, and his previous claims of imminent breakthroughs have failed to come to fruition. Trump has previously pushed Ukraine to cede territory to Russia to end the war,threatening to walk away if a deal becomes too difficult. Ukraine’s European allies view its fate as fundamental to the continent’s security, and pressure is now mounting to find ways to support Kyiv militarily, regardless of whether Trump pulls out.",

    "title": "U.S.-China tariff talks begin as the world looks for signs of hope",
    "article_text": "GENEVA — The U.S. treasury secretary and America’s top trade negotiator began talks with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland Saturday aiming tode-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off tradebetween the world’s two biggest economies and damage the global economy. China’s Xinhua News Agency saysTreasury Secretary Scott BessentandU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greerhave begun meetings in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng. Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks have begun but spoke anonymously and the exact location of the talks wasn’t made public. However, a motorcade of black cars and vans was seen leaving the home of the Swiss Ambassador to the United Nations in the wealthy Swiss city, and a diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the meeting, said the sides met for about two hours before departing for a previously arranged luncheon. Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back themassive taxes — tariffs — they’ve slapped on each other’s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade. U.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries’ boycotting each other’s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion. Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that “ 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.” Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. She doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results. “The best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,” she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. “It cannot just be words.” Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world. But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump’s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed 145%. During Trump’s first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies. Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues — such as China’s subsidies — were left for future negotiations. But China didn’t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced. The fight over China’s tech policy now resumes. Trump is also agitated by America’s massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year. In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter. Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he’s reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again. The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate. “An increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland’s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,” the government said last week, adding that the executive branch “is therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.” The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday. The United States is Switzerland’s second-biggest trading partner after the EU — a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said. The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",

    "title": "Trump administration halts research to help babies with heart defects",
    "article_text": "For James Antaki, a biomedical engineering professor at Cornell University, the $6.7 million government grant meant babies would be saved. Awarded by the Department of Defense on March 30, it would allow his team at Cornell to ramp up production and testing ofPediaFlow,a device that boosts blood flow in infants with heart defects. A week later, that all changed. The Defense Department sent Antaki a stop-work order on April 8 informing him that his team wouldn’t get the money, intended to be distributed over four years. Three decades of research is now at risk, and Antaki said he has no idea why the government cut off funding. “I feel that it’s my calling in life to complete this project,” he said Friday, in his first news interview since losing funding. “Once a week, I go through this mental process of, ‘Is it time to give up?’ But it is not my prerogative to give up.” Neither the Defense Department nor the White House press office responded to requests for comment. Antaki is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of academics nationwide who’ve lost funding in a variety of fields since President Donald Trump came to office, due to a mix of new executive orders limiting whatgovernment money can supportand thesweeping grant cancellationsordered by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency. One in 100 babies in the U.S. are born with heart defects, and about a quarter of them need surgery or other procedures in their first year to survive,according tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Worldwide, it’sestimated that240,000 babies die within their first 28 days due to congenital birth defects. An infant’s heart is about the size of a large walnut. When a baby is born with a hole between the chambers of the heart, it can be a life-threatening condition. Antaki’s creation is a AA battery-sized device that uses a rotating propeller on magnets to increase blood flow, helping them to survive surgery or live at home with their family until a donor heart is available, if needed. The new round of funding Antaki expected would have supported further testing of the prototype, including placement in an animal to ensure it won’t harm humans, and completion of the mountain of paperwork needed to move through the Food and Drug Administration’s regulatory process. The device has received several grants over the years from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense without issue, Antaki said. Antaki began work on the technology in 2003. He was already developing a similar technology for adults at the University of Pittsburgh when the National Institutes of Health issued a call for proposals on a pediatric heart assist system. He had already been trying, without success, to interest private companies in a pediatric device. They may have declined, he speculates, because themarket is smallerfor children’s medical devices than for adult ones. After Antaki arrived at Cornell in 2018, hesecured research fundingfrom the Defense Department to keep the project moving forward. He submitted a 300-page proposal last June for the next cash infusion he needed, and the Defense Department notified his team in March that it was approved, before reversing course in April, he said. A copy of the stop-work order, reviewed by NBC News, does not specify a reason why the government canceled the grant beyond that it was “at the direction of the Administration.” Dr. Evan Zahn, a pediatric interventional cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who is not involved with PediaFlow, said cutting funding for Antaki’s research is a step backward for children’s health care because there are few commercially available solutions for babies with heart defects. “Technology specifically designed for our children, particularly babies across the board, is desperately needed, so losing funding for something like that is a real loss,” Zahn said. If funding isn’t restored within 90 days, Antaki said, he and his team will need to begin laying off lab staff and Ph.D. students will have to change their research focus. In the grand scheme of what the government funds, he said, “it’s a small amount of money that could do so much good for so many people, and it’s just the right thing to do. It just it kind of speaks for itself.”",

The site, a dusty hill about a two hour’s drive from the city of Aleppo, looks like an archeological dig, with dozens of investigators wielding shovels, ground-penetrating radar, pickaxes and paintbrushes for the delicate work of brushing away sand as they search for bones, clothing and any evidence that ISIS terrorists may haveburied their victimshere. It has taken years of intelligence work to reach this point, including satellite imagery analysis, debriefs with surviving ISIS hostages and jailhouse interviews withISIS leaders. So far, the team is optimistic. They are finding human remains in shallow graves, and, critically, they are finding them where they were expected to be. The investigation is led by an intelligence and security company called the Soufan Group, founded by former FBI counterterrorism officer Ali Soufan. His team, mainly composed of former FBI and counterterrorism colleagues, has been working the case on behalf of the American victims’ families. They work in coordination with, but are independent from, the FBI. “We’ve been working with the families for a long period of time, trying to figure out what happened to their loved ones.

    "title": "Trump's dismantling of Education Dept. gives states 'green light' to pursue voucher programs",
    "article_text": "A growing number of red states have expanded their school voucher programs in recent years, a trend that is likely to only spike further amid a pushled by President Donald Trump’s administrationto return education “back to the states.” Conservative education activists have long lauded such programs as a way to give greater control to parents and families. But public education advocates warn that the expansion of these voucher programs presents further risk to the broader school system as itfaces perilfrom Trump’sdismantling of the Department of Education. “Many states came into this administration with a track record of trying to privatize education, and I think they see this move to dismantle and defund the Department of Ed and President Trump’s support of school privatization as a green light to be more expansive in their approach moving forward,” said Hilary Wething, an economistat the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute who closely studies the impact of voucher programs on public education. Just last week, Texasenacted a statewide private school voucher program, becoming the 16th state to offer some form of a universal school choice program. In private school voucher programs, families can receive a certain amount of public money to use toward private K-12 school tuition or school supplies. In some states, such programs have previously come with limitations, including narrow eligibility, such as private schools that can accommodate families with children who have special needs or families that are below certain income levels. Proponents of the program in Texas and others like it dub it a “universal voucher” program because it has no restrictions on who is eligible. Under the program, any family in the state may receive about $10,000 to pay for their children’s K-12 private school education. Texas’ program will launch in the 2026-27 school year. Statewide voucher programs are far from a new phenomenon. But they have exploded in recent years amid a growing political effort by conservatives at the local, state and federal levels to boost “school choice” — the notion that parents should have far more options than only their neighborhood public schools. Sixteen states offer at least one voucher program that has universal eligibility, while another 14 offer voucher programs with eligibility requirements, according to the Education Law Center, a public education advocacy group that is critical of voucher programs. At least three states, Texas, Idaho and Tennessee, have enacted their universal programs this year, while in another eight states, attempts by conservative lawmakers to create new voucher programs or expand existing ones stalled or failed, according to the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union. “Even though this is not a new explosion of voucher laws, this year continues the explosion of vouchers … and even though the USDOE [dismantling] isn’t necessarily the one driving force, it’s definitely connected,” said Jessica Levin, the litigation director at the Education Law Center, which is assisting with lawsuits challenging Trump’s moves to dismantle the Department of Education. “The bottom line is that this is a concerted strategy on the part of those who want to defund and dismantle public schools and privatize public education.” The most prominent argument made by critics of voucher programs is that they take public money that would have otherwise been allocated to help fund public schools and deliver it to private schools. Private schools, they note, do not face most of the accountability requirements that public schools do under federal laws. For example, private schools retain the ability to refuse admission to students, are not required to provide individualized education plans to children with learning disabilities and arenot required under law to provide disabledstudents or students facing disciplinary measures certain protections or due process rights. At the same time, funding formulas for public schools are predominantly based on enrollment numbers. So, as students flee public schools — even if in just small numbers — overall funding decreases. “The students who remain in public schools lose resources,” Levin said, while “voucher students lose rights.” Meanwhile, Levin explained, voucher-driven pupil departures from public school means “you’re now concentrating higher-need, higher-cost kids in public schools that now have less funding.” Those situations are now compounded by Trump’s moves to wind down the Education Department, which expertshave said will further upendcivil rights enforcement in schools as well as the distribution of billions of dollars to help impoverishedand disabled students. U.S. Department of Education spokesperson Savannah Newhouse said in an email to NBC News that “President Trump and Secretary [Linda] McMahon believe that our nation’s students will thrive when parents are given the freedom to choose a school setting that best fits their child’s academic needs.” Newhouse added that the administration “will provide states with best practices on how they can expand educational opportunities and empower local leaders to implement customized policy that will benefit their communities the most.” While some states have had voucher-like programs allowing families to use public money for parochial education dating back more than 100 years, modern voucher programs have been around for about 30 years, having launched in large part in the 1990s amid a grassroots conservative movement to increase options for parents unhappy with their local public schools. But the Covid-19 pandemic emerged as a flashpoint for conservative education activists, who utilized widespread anger among parents unhappy with school closings and remote learning as a launchpad for new and expanded voucher programs across the nation. School voucher proponents say the programsmaximize choice for parents, who can use the funds to subsidize the cost of expensive private schools, which, they argue, deliver better outcomes for students. Supporters have alsotoutedthe programs as offering a market-based approach that helpspromote the best schoolsand have argued that they have the potential to benefit low-income families or families with uniquely few options for public school. Tommy Schultz, the CEO of the American Federation for Children, a conservative group that advocates for school voucher programs,told Fox News this weekthat universal voucher programs like the one enacted in Texas give parents “education freedom.” He praised a similar program that Florida expanded in 2023, claiming it had caused the state’s public schools to “have gotten better.” Schultz denied that Texas’ program, or ones like it, would result in fewer resources for public schools, calling that “the same argument for 30 years” by public education advocates. Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, said in an email that the Republican “made education freedom a priority because no one knows the needs of their child better than a parent.” “When it comes to education, parents matter, and families deserve the ability to choose the best education opportunities for their children,” Mahaleris added. “The Governor signing school choice into law is an unprecedented victory for Texas families, students, and the future of our great state.” But critics point to examples showing that universal school voucher programs aredisproportionatelyusedby wealthy familieswhosechildren are already enrolled in private schools, or that children in rural areas with few schools have limited options to put the money to use. They also point tostudies that refute the claim that private schools deliver better outcomes for students. In addition, enrollment in private schools, even with a voucher to help cover the cost, can still be prohibitively expensive for low-income families, they said. Wething, of the EPI, saidanalyses have shownthatbetween 60%and90% of studentswho take advantage of universal-eligibility voucher programs across the U.S. werealreadyenrolled in private school when they participated in the programs. She warned of the harms she said programs like the one in Texas posed. “As soon as you get rid of income limits or carveouts for, say, only low-income families or only students with disabilities, you basically open the gates for students who are already attending private school, or who already have enough income to attend private school, to now use state funding to subsidize their private school,” she said. “It’s kind of the next step in what we think of as this voucher evolution.”",

Instead, he pursued his college diploma when many are busy enjoying retirement. On Friday, Riddick graduated from South Carolina State University in Orangeburg, S.C., two days before his 80th birthday, the school said in a news release. He came out of retirement to get his college education. After his military service, the Vietnam War veteranopened his own business selling souvenirs for three decades, and retired at age 72. But soon after, heoverheard aconversation while passing through SC State thatinspired him to enroll at the college. \"I heard some men talk about the Orangeburg Massacre,\" he told Sam Watson, SC State's director of university relations, whowrote a postaboutRiddick's achievement. The Orangeburg Massacre is a1968 eventwhen police shot into a crowd of SC State students who were protesting segregation, injuring more than two dozen of them and killing three. All nine officers involved wereacquitted, according to The Civil Rights Trail website. Riddick said it was only after learning about that history that he decided, \"I'm going to have to come here, put my name on this institutional wall because of the sacrifice of these three men.\" At Friday'scommencement, Riddick was honored even before crossing the stage. SC State President Alexander Conyers briefly paused the ceremonyto recognize himin the back row of the school's concert choir, with which he's performed for years. \"Mr. Riddick, you inspire us all,\" Conyers said, also noting that the 79-year-olddrove an hour every day from his home in Summerville, S.C.,to Orangeburg to attend classes. Later, the crowd gave Riddick a rousing ovation as he accepted his diploma. He earned a bachelor's degree in music industry. Riddick said college helped him stay sharp. \"Your mind, your body, your soul and spirit — they must be utilized,\" he told Watson. Now, he said, he hopes to be an inspiration for others, and a mentor for younger students. \"If I can do it, you can do it,\" he said. \"It's not impossible if you try.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "India and Pakistan accuse each other of violating ceasefire hours after reaching deal",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press India's Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri addresses a press briefing in New Delhi on Saturday.Karma Bhutia/APhide caption ISLAMABAD — India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire Saturday after U.S.-led talks to end the most serious military confrontation between the nuclear-armed rivals in decades but accused each other of violating the deal just hours later. The ceasefire had been expected to bring a swift end to weeks of escalating clashes, including missile and drone strikes, triggered by the massacre of tourists by gunmen last month that India blames on Pakistan, which denies the charge. But multiple explosions were heard in two large cities of Indian-controlled Kashmir hours after the countries agreed to the deal. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said late Saturday that \"there had been repeated violations of the understanding arrived between the two countries\" and accused Pakistan of breaching the agreement. \"We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility,\" he said at a news conference in New Delhi. Misri said the Indian army was \"retaliating\" for what he called a \"border intrusion.\" In Islamabad, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry blamed Indian forces for initiating the ceasefire violation. The ministry said Pakistan remains committed to the agreement and its forces were handling the situation with responsibility and restraint. \"We believe that any issues in the smooth implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels,\" the ministry said. The first word of the truce came from U.S. President Donald Trump, who posted on his Truth Social platform that India and Pakistan had agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire: \"Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\" Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said in a speech Saturday that his country agreed to the ceasefire in the larger interest of peace in the region and hoped all the outstanding issues with India, including the long-running dispute over the Kashmir region, would be resolved through peaceful dialogue. Misri said the head of military operations from both countries spoke Saturday afternoon and agreed \"that both sides would stop all firing and military action on land, and in the air and sea.\" However, hours after the agreement, explosions heard by residents in Srinagar and Jammu in Indian-controlled Kashmir were followed by blackouts in the two cities. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Omar Abdullah, the region's top elected official, said in a post on social media: \"What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!\" Conflict between India and Pakistan is not rare, with the two countries having periodically engaged in wars, clashes and skirmishes since gaining independence from British India in 1947. The ceasefire in the latest hostilities came after the countries fired volleys of cross-border missile strikes Saturday, when India said it targeted Pakistani air bases after Islamabad fired several high-speed missiles at military and civilian infrastructure in Punjab state. Pakistan said it responded with retaliatory strikes. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with senior officials from both countries over the past 48 hours. They included Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sharif, India's External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and the Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir. Rubio said the two governments agreed to \"start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.\" Though Pakistanis had initially celebrated their army's retaliation, they were later jubilant about the truce, saying it was a moment of national pride and relief after days of tension. In Islamabad, Zubaida Bibi expressed her joy at the restoration of peace with India. \"War brings nothing but suffering,\" she said. \"We are happy that calm is returning. It feels like Eid to me. We have won.\" Tensions have soared since the attack at a popular tourist site in Indian-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, mostly Indian Hindu tourists, on April 22. Before the ceasefire was reached Saturday, India's military held a press briefing in New Delhi, saying Pakistan had targeted health facilities and schools at its three air bases in Kashmir. \"Befitting reply has been given to Pakistani actions,\" Indian Col. Sofiya Qureshi said. Indian missiles targeted Nur Khan air base in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, Murid air base in Chakwal city and Rafiqui air base in the Jhang district of eastern Punjab province, according to Pakistan's military spokesman. There were no immediate reports of the strike or its aftermath from residents in the densely populated Rawalpindi. Pakistan's military had said it used medium-range Fateh missiles to hit an Indian missile storage facility and air bases in the cities of Pathankot and Udhampur. Army spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif said the country's air force assets were safe after the Indian assault. The Associated Press could not independently verify all the actions attributed to Pakistan or India. After the announcement of Pakistani retaliation, residents in Indian-controlled Kashmir said they heard loud explosions at multiple places, including the large cities of Srinagar and Jammu and the garrison town of Udhampur. \"Explosions that we are hearing today are different from the ones we heard the last two nights during drone attacks,\" said Shesh Paul Vaid, the region's former top police official and Jammu resident. \"It looks like a war here.\" Vaid said explosions were heard from areas with military bases, adding it appeared that army sites were targeted. Residents living near Srinagar's airport, which is also an air base, said they were rattled by the explosions and booming sound of jets. \"I was already awake, but the explosions jolted my kids out of their sleep. They started crying,\" said Srinagar resident Mohammed Yasin. Omar Abdullah, Indian-controlled Kashmir's top elected official, welcomed the ceasefire. But he said had it happened two or three days earlier \"we might have avoided the bloodshed and the loss of precious lives.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Jennifer Ludden Women will be able to screen for cervical cancer at home using a wand by Teal Health.Teal Healthhide caption The Food and Drug administration has approved the U.S.'s first at-home alternative to the Pap smear, a procedure generations of women have dreaded and often found painful. The new device byTeal Healthwill offer a \"much preferred experience,\" the company said in its announcement, and also aims to increase screening rates by making the procedure more convenient. Traditionally, gynecologists have inserted a cold metal speculum deep into a woman's vagina to scrape cells from the cervix. The Teal Wand — \"built with empathy,\" the company said — uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample. Women will then mail the sample to a lab that will screen for HPV (human papillomavirus), the virus that causes nearly all cervical cancers. A growing body of research has foundHPV testingto be highly accurate. The FDA approval Friday follows aU.S.-based studythat found at-home screening was just as effective as that done in a doctor's office. The study also found women overwhelmingly preferred self–screening at home, and said they'd be more likely to stay up to date with cervical cancer screenings that way. Every year, about13,000 casesof cervical cancer are diagnosed, and more than 4,000 women die from the disease. Rates are down dramatically sinceDr. Georgios Papanicolaoupublished a 1943 paper on how to use the Pap smear for screening, and it then became common. But about aquarter of womenin the U.S. are behind on such screenings, and medical experts say reducing that is key to the ultimate goal of eliminating cervical cancer. There's also aracial gap, with Black and Native American women far more likely to die from cervical cancer than white women. TheHPV vaccinefor teen and preteen girls, introduced in 2007, has also led to a global push to tackle the disease that way. At-home cervical cancer screenings are already available in several other countries, includingAustraliaandSweden. Teal Health says its self-testing device will be available starting next month, in California first and then expanding. It will be by prescription, through a telehealth service, for women 25-65 years old who are \"at average risk.\" The company says it's working with insurance companies to provide coverage.

The meetings in a Swiss city known for its discretion and conflict resolution represent the first potential efforts to end a trade war that has frazzled financial markets in recent weeks, and caused billions of dollars' worth of import disruption across both the United States and China. The U.S. delegation is being led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, alongside Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and the only participant the Chinese have confirmed is the country's vice premier for economic affairs, He Lifeng. The talks are being held at a grand hilltop villa with sweeping views of Lake Geneva used by Switzerland's ambassador to the United Nations. Neither side has issued public statements since the talks began early Saturday. Just days before these discussions of seismic economic significance,the United Kingdombecame the first country to strike its own limited trade deal with the Trump administration — albeit one that left tariffs of 10% still in place on most British exports. Switzerland's Economy Minister Federal Councillor Guy Parmelin, left, shakes hands with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, right, next to Switzerland's President Karin Keller-Sutter, center, during a bilateral meeting between Switzerland and China, in Geneva, Switzerland, on Friday, May 9, 2025. (Martial Trezzini/Keystone via AP, Pool)Martial Trezzini/AP/POOL Keystonehide caption But for Bessent, China has been the \"missing piece,\" as he explained in arecent interview on Fox News— one of the only countries that until now has refused to enter discussions on trade. Bessent said he was originally only visiting Geneva to edge closer to a separate, updated trading arrangement with Swiss authorities. They told reporters in a news conference Friday that they hoped their own agreement with Washington could be struck within a few weeks. In the meantime, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter said, her country was happy to help facilitate dialogue between the two global economic superpowers, at a moment when the anticipated impacts of tariffs have weighed heavily on stock prices and economic forecasts alike. \"Now the chance has been taken by China and the U.S.,\" Keller-Sutter told NPR. \"We really hope that this platform we can offer will also lead to a result, because it would be in the interest of, I would say, the world economy and world commerce.\" When he arrived in Geneva on Friday, Bessent had met with senior Swiss officials including Keller-Sutter. She told him she hoped the Holy Spirit that had visited Rome this past week — during the election ofa new pope— might travel up to Geneva this weekend too, to help nudge things along. But a swift resolution seems unlikely, and this initial set of conversations could merely herald the start of a months-long marathon of negotiations, says Dmitry Grozoubinski, a former diplomat and trade negotiator for Australia. \"The two delegations will be feeling one another out — neither side particularly benefits from this current iteration of the trade war continuing,\" said Grozoubinski, now the executive director of the Geneva Trade Platform think tank. \"This is going to be the first steps in a dance where they try to feel out: 'OK, what would a win for you look like, and is that a price we're willing to pay,' while trying to communicate the same thing in the other direction,\" he said.

The ceasefire should last for 30 days to give diplomacy a real chance.\" Zelenskyy said the group had \"spoken to President Trump together. We agreed on our common view of our further actions.\" \"All of us here, together with the U.S., are calling Putin out,\" added British prime ministerKeir Starmer.\"If he's serious about peace then he has a chance to show it now.\" This ceasefire could start as early as Monday, if Russia agrees to it. That seems unlikely. Russian news agency Interfax quoted Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Saturday saying  \"We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more.\"  Putin also continues to press Kyiv to surrender large parts of eastern and southern Ukraine that Russian forces have failed to occupy. Starmer, along with the leaders of France, Germany and Poland, traveled together to Kyiv in their first joint appearance to take part in a virtual meeting of the \"coalition of the willing,\" which includes mostly European nations who would assist Ukraine if there is a durable ceasefire after more than three years of Russia's full-scale war. Those joining by video link included Italy's Giorgia Meloni, Canada's Mark Carney, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. This was the first visit to Ukraine by the new German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, a strong Ukraine advocate who assumed office on May 6.

    "article_text": "Scott Simon Pope Leo XIV greets followers for the first time after being elected pope.Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Yes, I cried when I heard thatPope Leo XIV is from Chicago. And I thought of St. Peter's Church in Chicago's Loop, where I used to go to Mass now and then. It was usually a 5:30 Mass. Many attending were cleaning and maintenance people, already in their work clothes. They stopped in to pray on their way into work, as suit-wearing office workers from the skyscrapers passed them, heading home. Marta, a cleaner in our office building, had told me about what was called \"the cleaning crew Mass.\" Marta was from Poland. When we all recited, along with the priest, \"I believe in God, the Father almighty, Creator of heaven and earth…\" you could hear accents around us from all over the world: Poland, Mexico, Italy, China, Lithuania, Ireland. It put a glimpse of the world into our words. The Masses were not large. And so they felt personal, and the faces became familiar. Most of us were on our own, like Marta, stopping in to pray before her worknight began, or like me, at the end of a workday. When we gave one another the sign of peace—that part of the Mass where people reach out to those around them, clasp their hands, and say, \"Peace be with you…\"—I sometimes wondered where else could you share such a poignant moment with people from all over the world? We might have all prayed for different things, but wished each other peace in our lives. I remember, too, the joy that Marta and others from Poland felt when Pope John Paul II, the first Polish pope, came on an official visit to Chicago, in 1979.  I put a rosary from Marta in my coat pocket when I covered the Mass in Grant Park, and when I returned it to her, she clutched it to her chest and said, \"I feel him here.\" When Pope Leo XIV came out to speak from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday, I thought of that other St. Peter's, in Chicago. The working people at those Masses today might see Pope Leo, once known on the South Side as Father Bob, and tell themselves, \"He has walked among us.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "Neda Ulaby Justin Hopkins, left, Nathan Granner, David Morgans, Markel Reed and Chaz'men Williams-Ali rehearse a scene for Detroit Opera's performances of Anthony Davis' operaThe Central Park Fiveon May 10, 16 and 18Austin T. Richey/Detroit Operahide caption At a rehearsal last month for the operaThe Central Park Five, singers wearing soft athletic pants and baseball caps warmed up by a piano. The opera is based on a real-life tragedy, about a group of Black and brown teenagers wrongly charged and imprisoned for the brutal attack on a female jogger in New York's Central Park in 1989. The Central Park Fivewon the Pulitzer Prizefor Music for composer Anthony Davis in 2020; it debuted the year before at the Long Beach Opera in California. The opera has also been staged at Oregon's Portland Opera. Now, the Detroit Opera is producing the work from May 10-18 in Michigan. \"I wanted the audience to empathize and to identify with the Five,\" Davis said of the young men, who were mostly only 14 and 15 years old at the time of their arrests. \"I thought that the story was a story of perseverance.\" Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, Korey Wise, and Yusef Salaam were all exonerated in 2002. Another real-life character in the opera is now the President of the United States. Back in 1989, Donald J. Trump was best known as a Manhattan real-estate developer and nightlife fixture. When the Central Park Five went on trial, Trump took outfull-page newspaper adsdemanding the death penalty \"for roving bands of wild criminals.\" \"That was the beginning of Donald Trump's political career, was the Central Park Five,\" Davis said. The Detroit Opera decided to program this work three years ago, he notes, long before the last presidential election. In the original production, Trump sings an aria while sitting on a golden toilet in his penthouse apartment. \"What kind of city is this?\" he sings. \"When decent people, decent people, cannot feel safe on the street! That ends right now! This ends right now! Support our police! Bring back the death penalty!\" The Detroit Opera is presenting the aria in a less incendiary manner. \"He's not on a golden toilet,\" Davis said. \"We didn't have the golden toilet because frankly, the focus should be on the Five and not on him. He's a character within the story and a necessary character because he's a big part of the story. You know,he's never apologized. He never apologized for his actions and his rush to judgment.\" (The Central Park Fivesued Trump for defamationfor statements he made during a presidential debate last year; that lawsuit is ongoing.) Nataki Garrett, director of the Detroit Opera's production, dismissed a suggestion that there might be pressure, self-imposed or otherwise, to tone the staging down. \"Not for me,\" she said. \"It was not me thinking I should tone it down. It was me making a decision that the central story is about these boys. Why center that, when you can actually speak to the lives of these young men who are now grown men, who have lives themselves and who have taken their journey through this trauma to really impact their communities in the most positive ways. That story is so much richer to me.\" \"This opera is a real reckoning,\" added Anthony Parnther. The conductor of this production ofThe Central Park Fiveis having a moment; he also conducted the score for the acclaimed movieSinners,in theaters now. He noted that both scores draw from a wide range of American musical idioms. \"Jazz, blues, bebop, R&B, soul, you know. But, [Anthony Davis'] music oftentimes is sort of like high modernist meets really complex jazz,\" he said. \"I can't think of an opera that is more technically daunting than this one because it really requires such an ear from every single singer,\" Panther continued. \"They basically have to physically memorize all of these very complex rhythms and these very difficult-to-predict pitches. But everything that he's written is utterly compelling, and in his own unique harmonic vocabulary that I've not seen replicated anywhere else.\" Garrett, the director, acknowledged that the opera is being produced in Detroit at a moment when stories that tell uncomfortable truths, especially about power and race, are being politicized, and sometimes even silenced. (NPRbroke the storyof how Garrett received threats of racial violence and death while she was directing the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2022.) \"You know, the stories that we tell as artists are not our own,\" she said. \"They belong to humanity. We are the reflectors. That's what we do. And so why do we know about most of the terrible things that have happened in history? Because somebody reflected it. And so that is our job. Exposing the truth helps us connect to our deeper humanity, helps us connect to our empathy, which is what the world needs more of, especially right now.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

A Trump official responsible for hiringraised Pirro's arm aloft and told the crowd, \"Very soon, we have a big announcement for another big hire!\" Pirro mouthed the words \"No, no,\" and soon issued a statement through Fox that she \"will not be joining the administration,\" though she helped to rally Trump's fans at the event. On Thursday night, Trump said he wasappointing Pirroto be the acting U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C. She's replacing Ed Martin, whose Senate confirmation ran into trouble with both Republicans and Democrats. In his announcement, Trump proudly cited Pirro's work for Fox.The Five, which she co-hosted, is \"one of the Highest Rated Shows on Television,\" he noted.

She did not respond to NPR's request for comment. The Fox News funnel keeps on pouring into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Even the network's stars — many of whom have advised the president off the air —have acknowledged the phenomenon is an unprecedented circumstance. In Trump's second administration — not even four months old — there are more people with \"Fox\" on their résumés than there were during all four years of his first term. A former Fox News personalityserves as the director of national intelligence. What about the administrator of theCenters of Medicare and Medicaid? Yup. Thedeputy director of the FBI? Check. And don't forget the former Trump national security adviser who was just shunted over torepresent the U.S. at the United Nations. The ambassador to Israel is a former Fox News host. So is the nominee to be the ambassador to Greece (who is also Don Jr.'s former fiancée). U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi was not a Fox News pundit. But she didguest hostThe Fiveseveral times while serving as Florida's attorney general. Two of the most prominent of these Fox-Trump administration officials are among its most telegenic: Defense Secretary and formerFox & Friends Weekendhost Pete Hegseth and Transportation Secretary and formerFox Businesshost Sean Duffy. Both men worked with their wives at Fox. Duffy's wife Rachel Campos-Duffy is a host on Hegseth's former Fox News show; the influence former Fox producer Jennifer Hegseth has wielded during the defense secretary's brief tenure has drawnunwantedpressscrutiny. It is not clear the two former talking heads talk to each other, however: After the fatal plane crash involving a military helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Duffy complained that the Defense Department was not sharing vital information. He lodged his complaint on — where else — Fox News. \"The DOD has promised radical transparency,\"Duffy told his former colleague Laura Ingraham. \"They should tell us who is qualified to take a helicopter out of the Pentagon. I don't know, but they have to tell us.\" Ingraham offered to call Hegseth right there, lifting up her smartphone. \"You call Pete. Dial in!\" Duffy responded, adding that he needed the information for safety purposes. Press aides to the two cabinet secretaries did not return NPR's requests for comment. Pirro was a county judge and district attorney in Westchester County, the suburb immediately north of New York City, but she's been out of office for nearly two decades. She has a longstanding friendship with Trump, who rose to prominence as a real estate developer in New York City. Trump contributed to Pirro's unsuccessful 2006 effort to seek the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate against then-incumbent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. (Trump wasalso a donorto Clinton.) After a nationally syndicated reality courtroom show on the CW network, Pirro was named by then-Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes to be a host of her own weekend program on Fox in 2011. She presented herself as tough on crime but became a tough talker more broadly. During Trump's first term, Pirro called for the jailing of FBI and Justice Department staffers, spoke on stage at a Trump campaign event, and ranrhetorical interferencefor him during his impeachment trials. In 2019,as Media Matters reported, Pirro acknowledged being suspended by Fox, which had rebuked her for suggesting that Rep. Ilhan Omar's hijab, reflecting her observance of Muslim practices, suggested an \"adherence to sharia law.\" Back in early November 2020, just after Joe Biden defeated Trump to win the White House, Pirro was among a slew of Fox News stars whoamplified the conspiracy theories— and later, outright lies — about the election being rigged. A senior executive at the network yanked her weekend show from the air the Saturday after the election, saying he couldn't trust she would be responsible. Two weeks later, Pirro's executive producer flagged that the introduction she proposed for her next show was \"rife with conspiracy theories and BS and yet another example why this woman should never be on live television.\" Pirro was one of four Fox hosts sued for defamation along with the network, by the election machine Dominion Voting Systems. Fox paid $787.5 million to settle the case on the eve of the jury trial, which would have focused on statements on Fox's programs spuriously giving credibility to false claims of election fraud in 2020. The network is in court again in a parallel suit filed by Smartmatic, a voting tech company. AsNPR has reported, after the election, Pirro was among the Fox News personalities who kept raising alarms about the importance of Jan. 6, 2021 — the date the U.S. Congress was to certify Biden's win. On Jan. 3, Jeanine Pirrocomparedthose gathering to protest at the foot of the U.S. Capitol to the American soldiers in the Revolutionary War, adding, \"Jan. 6 will tell us whether there are any in Congress willing to battle for America.\" After Trump addressed the crowd, hundreds of protesters laid siege to the Capitol to try to block the certification of the election. The U.S. Attorney's office would go on to prosecute more than 1,500 people for crimes in connection with the riot. More than 1,000 pleaded guilty; another 200 were found guilty. Upon taking office, Trump granted clemency to all the Jan. 6 insurrectionists and named Martin as acting U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C. Martin had previously advanced bogus claims about election fraud in swing states in 2020. He spoke at a raucous protest the day before the siege of the Capitol. And he represented several of the defendants in court. That record unraveled Martin's prospects for nomination.

    "title": "Industry groups are not happy about the imminent demise of Energy Star",
    "article_text": "The program has saved consumers billions of dollars since its inception. It’s a voluntary program launched during a Republican administration, endorsed by manufacturers and well-recognized by U.S. consumers, who have saved an estimated $500 billion over the past 33 years guided by its familiar blue label. But President Donald Trump’s administration has decided the Energy Star program has got to go. CNNandThe Washington Postfirst reported the plan to eliminate the program that certifies the most energy-efficient appliances and buildings with the Energy Star label. Knowledgeable sources have confirmed to Inside Climate News that Environmental Protection Agency staffers learned the details at an internal meeting earlier this week. The EPA press office, when asked about Energy Star, did not comment directly about the program, but notedthe reorganization of the agencythat EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced last Friday. “With this action, EPA is delivering organizational improvements to the personnel structure that will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,” EPA’s press office said in an email. Because Energy Star has had strong support across the political spectrum and from industry as well as environmentalists, some close observers are struggling to understand the Trump administration’s motivation for eliminating it. Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, thinks Energy Star simply had the misfortune to be located inside EPA’s Climate Protection Partnership Division, and that Zeldin is eliminating offices with the word “climate” in its name. “I’m not sure they totally thought it through,” Nadel said. But Joseph Goffman, who headed up air pollution programs at EPA under President Joe Biden, thinks the decision aligns with the Trump administration’s other actions—its regulatory rollbacks, its cuts in personnel and its clawing back of clean air and water grants. “What I think we’re looking at here is an absolute distillation of the ideology of this administration, which is a thoroughgoing hostility to anything that the government does that helps people,” Goffman said. “If you want to destroy the relationship between the public and government, you’re going to target the Energy Star program.” Energy Star was first established under President George H.W. Bush’s administration in 1992, the year of the Earth Summit in Rio, where nations around the world first joined in a framework convention to address climate change. That international treaty, at Bush’s urging, relied on voluntary action rather than targets and timetables for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Back at home, the Energy Star program, too, was a way to encourage, but not force, energy savings. “It was kind of one of his thousandpoints of light,” Nadel said. “He didn’t want to do serious things about climate change, but a voluntary program to provide information and let consumers decide fit very nicely into his mindset.” At first focused just on personal computers, monitors and printers, Energy Star expanded over the years to cover more than 50 home appliances, from heating and air conditioning systems to refrigerators, washers and dryers and lighting. Beginning in 1995, Energy Star certification expanded to include homes and commercial buildings. A Republican-controlled Congress wrote Energy Star into law ina sprawling 2005 energy billthat President George W. Bush signed. It is not clear that the Trump administration can eliminate the Energy Star program, which is administered by both EPA and the Department of Energy, without a new act of Congress. In a report to mark the 30th anniversary of Energy Star in 2022, the Biden administration estimated the program had achieved 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas reductions by helping consumers make energy-efficient choices. Nadel said the impact in the marketplace is visible, as companies increase the number of product choices that meet Energy Star standards whenever a new standard is adopted by EPA through a public notice and comment process. The nonprofit Alliance to Save Energy has estimated that the Energy Star program costs the government about $32 million per year, while saving families more than $40 billion in annual energy costs. Eliminating the program, Nadel said, “is million-wise and billion foolish.” Word of Energy Star’s potential demise began to circulate weeks ago. On March 20, a wide array of manufacturers and industry associations signed on to a letter to Zeldin, urging him to maintain the Energy Star program. The groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; the Air Conditioning, Heating, & Refrigeration Institute; and the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers released their letter publicly this week. It called Energy Star “an example of an effective non-regulatory program and partnership between the government and the private sector.” Companies that have invested in making more efficient products are faced with the loss of the Energy Star brand as a marketing tool. The Energy Star logo has helped them make the case, with the government’s support, that the initial higher cost of efficient appliances will be offset over time in reduced water and energy consumption. “Eliminating it will not serve the American people,” they wrote. “In fact, because the Energy Star brand is highly recognizable to consumers, it is likely that, should the program be eliminated, it will be supplanted by initiatives that drive results counter to the goals of this administration such as decreased features, functionality, performance, or increased costs.” The Energy Star program has weathered at least one high-profile controversy in recent years. The Biden administration briefly considered a plan to eliminate Energy Star certification for most natural gas appliances, in order to drive consumers toward greater use of electrified options. But the American Gas Association and other groups representing the natural gas industrysuccessfully foughtthat proposal. Over the years, the conservative Heritage Foundation, best known for its role in organizing the Project 2025 roadmap, has called for thegovernment to get out of public-private partnershipslike Energy Star. Heritage argued the role should be taken over by a nonprofit entity outside the government. But Goffman says he never encountered any serious constituency that was opposed to the Energy Star program in his time in government, which spanned the Obama administration as well as the Biden years. “The engine of the Energy Star program is the willing participation of businesses to participate in it,” he said. “Consumers, taxpayers and businesses are what make the Energy Star program real, by using the information it provides.” Nadel said that he doubts that a non-government efficiency labeling program would have the consumer trust Energy Star has built. A2022 surveyshowed the Energy Star brand is recognized and understood in 90 percent of U.S. households. This story originally appeared onInside Climate News.

Their mission? Take down the recently surfaced “Killuminati,” evil clones of Marvel’scollection of geniuses, and “usher in a revolutionary new era of Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.” Check out the villains in the variant covers below. “It’s a thrill and an honor to continue the grand New Avengers tradition of team dynamics that are as explosive as the threats,”Humphriessaid in a Marvel press release. This is the first iteration of the team since 2016, when Sunspot’s team was an extension of AIM, which he then owned and converted into Avengers Idea Mechanics. That team, which included Squirrel Girl, Cannonball, Hulkling, and Wiccan, was later rebranded into the U.S. Avengers.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Cloud storageis very convenient with instant access to your information wherever you are and automatic backup capabilities, but it can also rapidly become expensive (especially if you wish to store many terabytes of information). For the ultimate security and control over one’s data,there’s no substitute for having a physical external hard drive readily available, and one that can store enormous volumes of data at a cost cloud services just can’t compete with. That’s exactly why the WD 20TB external hard drive is one of the best deals going right now. What’s great: it’s now discounted on Amazon. While the drive itself typically retailsfor roughly $360 on Amazon (it was initially listed at $499), it is currently available for only $279. To put it into perspective, the 22TB model is currently selling for $409, and the 18TB model is selling for $309. The fact that you can buy it for under $280 makes you receive a real bargain, especially when you compute the price per gigabyte (approximately $0.01 per GB). See at Amazon The WD Elements 20TB HDD is designed for people who need a lot of storage (photographers, videographers, content creators, or basically if you have an enormous amounts of digital documents). It supports20TB capacity with an ability to store up to 2 million photos or about 2,500 hours of Full HD videoand therefore ideal for both business and personal use. It has a 3.5-inch HDD rotating at 7200 RPM and supports rapid read and write speed for the fast transfer of heavy data. Its USB 3.2 Gen 1 connectivity, or USB 3.0 as it’s also known, means you experiencetransfer speeds up to 5Gbps, ten times more performance than with the old USB 2.0 spec. This means copying massive files or backing up your whole computer in a matter of minutes. Maybe one of the best features of this drive is its plug-and-play convenience: It is pre-formatted for Windows, so just plug it in and get started right away-no fiddly setup or extra software. If you’re on a Mac, a quick reformat will have you up and running. The drive has an external power adapter and plugs in via a standard USB-A port and thus is supported by most desktop and laptop computers. Unlikecloud storage where youâre trustinga third party with your data,an external hard drive keeps your files physically in your possession. WD has a strong reputation for durability, and this drive is built with proven components to ensure your data stays safe. It also features a Kensington lock slot for added physical security and comes with a two-year limited warranty for peace of mind. Automatic backup features protect your files from computer failure, and transferring files off your main computer can even speed up your system by freeing up internal storage. If you need an extra large external HDD, this one is a great choice – especially at this price point.

    "title": "The New Pope Wants to Take on AI",
    "article_text": "The Catholic Church is not exactly known for being on the cutting edge of policyâit was still performing mass in Latin until the 1960s, after all. But the newly selected Pope Leo XIV, the Chicago-born Robert Prevost, has his eyes toward the future when it comes to artificial intelligence. In his first formal meeting with cardinals of the church, he pointed to the development of AI as one of the biggest challenges facing humanity,according to CNN. “In our own day, the church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice and labor,â hetold the senior clergy members. He also said he chose his name, Leo, as a signal of his intention to follow in the footsteps of Pope Leo XIII, who he said worked to addressÂ âthe social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution.â Pope Leo XIII, who served as the leader of the church from 1878 to 1903, is perhaps best known for an encyclical he issued in 1891 entitled “Rerum Novarum” or “Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor.” A landmark text on worker rights, the letter was a call to relieve “the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class” and issued support for, among other things, the unionization of labor. Leo XIV is also picking up the baton from his predecessor, Pope Francis, who also identified AI as a potential risk to humanity if not developed and deployed ethically and in a human-centered way. Francis issued âAntiqua et Nova,â the âNote on the relationship between artificial intelligence and human intelligence,â in which he insisted that any developments in the field of AI must “serve human dignity and not harm it.” Pope Francis also spoke publicly on AI at the2024 G7 Summit, where he described AI as the start of a “cognitive-industrial revolution” and warned that it posed the risk of causing “greater injustice between advanced and developing nations or between dominant and oppressed social classes.” He alsodelivered remarks at the World Economic Forumin Davos earlier this year before his passing, in which he warned that “human dignity and fraternity are frequently subordinated in the pursuit of efficiency” during the advancement of new technologies, and called on those involved with the development of AI to ensure it “promotes human dignity, the vocation of the human person, and the common good.” Artificial intelligencePope FrancisPope LeoPope Leo XIV Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Avengers: Age of Ultron Anniversary Vid Reminds You It Exists",
    "article_text": "Did you knowÂAvengers: Age of Ultronhad its 10th birthdayÂ last week? The occasion got overshadowed by the release ofThunderbolts*âsorry,ÂNew Avengersâbut it’s now a decade old, and Marvel’s got an anniversary video to celebrate. The five-minute compilation runs through a handful of the film’s key moments, including the team trying to lift Thor’s hammer, Thor birthing the Vision, and Tony using the Hulkbuster armor to bring down a mind-controlled Banner. It isn’t so much a highlight reel as it is a collection of fairly popular scenes meant to show the Avengers at the friendliest, messiest, and mightiest. Great, but it might also remind about the weird space this movie has occupied in the years since its release. Back whenÂAge of UltronÂfirst released on May 1, 2015, it was regarded as a solid, albeit disappointing sequel to the originalAvengers. By the time the credits rolled, folks left the theater feeling something was off, and it became the first real blow to Marvel’s fairly solid track record up to that point.Thor: The Dark WorldÂhad Loki to use as a shield, butUltronlacked the “wow” factor that ended up diminishing the appeal of another group outing for these characters. Save for maybe Hawkeye, it didn’t really do anyone here any favors, and the best thing you could say about it was how it served as a jumping off point for more interesting MCU developments down the line: without it, wouldCaptain America: Civil WarÂjust a year later feel like a more proper (and frankly better)AvengersÂmovie? DoesÂThor: RagnarokÂexist ifÂUltronÂdoesn’t take the god out of the film for anInfinity Stones-focuseddetour that felt wildly out of place at the time? Outside its own franchise,ÂUltronÂhelped lay the foundation for writer/directorJoss Whedon’screative future and subsequent ousting followingabuse allegationsfromÂBuffyÂstar Charisma Carpenter. Much of that can be laid at Whedon pairingBlack Widowwith Banner and revealing she’d had a forced hysterectomy during her upbringing in the Red Room, the former further exacerbated byChris Evans and Jeremy Rennercalling her a slut in an interview. The goodwill Whedon hadpreviously earnedthrough his handling of women in his prior work gradually came crashing down after theÂAvengersÂsequel, and the film’s mixed reception led to his time at Marvel being functionally over.Ultronlit the match, and the fire truly started when he directed the2017 cut ofJustice League. Its release and later details of hisalleged on-set conductÂ blew up his career and after exitingÂThe Nevers,Âwhich he created for HBO Max in 2021, there’s been no real word of him since. So yeah,ÂAge of Ultron,weird movie to watch, talk about, and generally exist as a piece of media.ÂWandaVision, Hawkye,andUltron’s returnin the Vision’s own upcoming series ensure it won’t be completely forgotten, but of the variousÂAvengersÂand Phase Two movies, it’s maybe the most “great, but this really could’ve just been an email” of the bunch.

    "title": "Trump Takes Aim at Efficiency Standards for Dishwashers and Washing Machines",
    "article_text": "You would think the administration that launched the Department of Government Efficiency (despite how ineffective it has been) would be a big fan of improved efficacy in all areas. But Donald Trump keeps trying to kill any law that sets efficiency requirements for water and energy usage. His latest effort came Friday, when he signed apresidential memorandumcalling the Department of Energy to âconsider using all lawful authority to rescindâ or weaken water and energy standards andsigned measuresto end Biden-era energy efficiency regulations. Trump signed four separate measures, approved as part of the Congressional Review Act, that set regulations on gas water heaters and walk-in coolers and freezers, commercial freezers, and other consumer appliances. Per the Department of Energy, those standardsreduced the energy usage of water heatersby 13% and saved consumers a cumulative $3.1 billion and saved commercial facilities$4.6 billion on utility billsfrom cooler and freezer usage. As for thememorandum, it’ll push the DOE to look for any “water pressure or related energy efficiency laws” that it believes should be eliminated, with the standard being that the government shouldn’t “impose or enforce regulations that make taxpayersâ lives worse.” That’s a pretty squishy guidance, but it’s clear in the eyes of the administration that additional water pressure is more important than cutting back on energy bills. It takesparticular aimat energy-efficient washing machines, which the administration claims cost “at least $100 more” than less efficient models, and dishwashers, which it claims that new regulations make cleaning cycles take twice as long as they did for pre-standards models. Thedocumentthe administration appears to rely on to back the claim that washing machines get more expensive with higher standards does say that there is a higher purchase price, but it also concludes that the lifetime savings of the machine are significantly more than that initial higher price tag. Trump has been on something of a roll when it comes to energy and water usage, which probably shouldn’t come as much of a surprise from a guy who seems to be obsessed with shower water pressure andtoilet flushes. Last month, hekilled a rule setting a maximum flow rate on shower heads. Earlier this week, he also announced that the EnergyStar program, which certifies energy-efficient appliances andsaves consumers $450 per year on average, will beshuttered.

    "title": "Magic: The Gathering‘s Final Fantasy Set Looks Like a Match Made in Seventh Heaven",
    "article_text": "Magic: The Gathering‘s crossover era has been a divisive one for longtime players. Although there’s stillplenty of original expansionsto the venerable card game, the rise of “Universes Beyond,” Wizards’ umbrella for what has become a swath of licensed crossovers with everything fromSpongeBob SquarePantstoÂLord of the Rings, has become increasingly prominentâand for as many intrigued fans of those other franchises it’s brought in, there’s pushback that Wizards has traded its original worldbuilding for the card game equivalent of aFortniteÂmatch. That dividing push and pull amongÂMagicfans and curious onlookers is on the precipice of facing its biggest test next month with the release ofMagic‘s 105th expansion:ÂFinal Fantasy. It’s arguably Wizards’ most ambitious crossover yet, a collaboration with a fantasy world as vast, as long-running, and as equally equipped with a voracious, opinionated fanbase asÂMagic‘s. The first Universes Beyond set to be made legal in the game’s standard constructed format, the barriers between what is a licensed crossover and what is “normal”Magicaren’t just thin, they’ve been sliced open with a buster sword. And it’s already proving to be popular: pre-orders for the set are now difficult to come by, as parent company Hasbro anticipates thatÂFinal Fantasycould be one of the game’smost lucrative setsever. But the pressure isn’t just coming fromÂMagicfans.ÂFinal Fantasyis one of the most famous video game series of all time,16 mainline games(and yet further myriad spinoffs, sequels,remakes, and re-imaginingsbeyond them) that have shaped the story of the roleplaying game genre for nearly 40 years.Â That legacy, of course, includes its own card game, but aÂMagiccrossover is like meeting tabletop royalty: what’s included and what isn’t, how and why this should all happen, and how muchFinal Fantasyshould be in it has been ahot topic of debateever since the set was first tentatively teasedback in 2023. But the story of the set has been in the works for much longer than that: Wizards of the Coast and Square Enix have been pondering aÂMagic/Final Fantasycrossover for five years, basically almost as long as knowledge of the Universes Beyond crossover formathas been public. “There were a couple of factors,” Zakeel Gordon,ÂMagicTabletop Product Architect at Wizards of the Coast, told press at a recent briefing ahead ofÂ theÂFinal Fantasyset’s first major public preview at PAX East this weekend. “One is that we built this set simultaneously in English and Japanese for our partners at Square Enixâthat included multiple trips over to them for play tests, worldbuilding workshops,Final FantasyÂmini-schools to figure out what was important to them. We would come up with design iterations, fly over, and they would say ‘we really like these things, we would prefer if you tweak this like this.'” “But this is also the second ever Universes Beyond tentpole release [afterLord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth]. We wanted to make sure we were doing everything correctly. We wanted to make sure that the final product met our expectation, and was done in a way that we really think would excite players… in order to do all of that right, it just takes some time.” Just as the pressure on theÂFinal Fantasyset to live up to expectations is coming fromÂMagicandÂFinal Fantasyfans alike, passion for the project is echoed across Wizards and Square Enix. “It’s so fun, any time we get to work with another game studio, many of them are also really passionate aboutÂMagic,” Gordon continued. “Our main producers [at Square] are also lifelongMagicplayers. We would finish up our meetings, and then we’d go play Commander, or they’d talk to us about Legacy and show us their collections.” The passion on both Square Enix and Wizards’ behalf doesn’t erase the fact that the new set faces a daunting prospect: encapsulating 16 mainline games (sorry,Tactics,ÂX-2, orÂDirge of Cerberusfans, there’s no spinoff representation here) across hundreds of cards, each one filled with famous story beats, locations, characters, spells, and creatures to draw inspiration from. “One of the challenges of balancing the slots in the setâwhat do we need to fill, what is the mechanical need for a card, what is the flavor reason that we need a cardâwas that we wanted to get a certain amount of cards per game in the set,” Dillon Deveney,Magicprinciple narrative designer, explained. “We started there, and then we decided ‘well, how much do we expect to see fromÂthisgame? How many fans ofÂthisgame, that are going to want to see X, Y, Z? How big isÂthisgame, right?'” Wizards modulated its approach for each game further beyond that into what it considered a kind of tier system. After consulting internally amongÂFinal Fantasyfans at Wizards’ own offices, and with Square Enix for insight from developers who worked across the series, theMagicteam broke down potential inclusions across three tiers of fandom. “Tier one was ‘we have to include this, it’s evergreen, it’s the baseline expectation,’ like Chocobos and Moogles,” Deveney said. “Tier two is for a fan of a specific game that would go ‘Oh yeah, I totally remember that’… these could be iconic minigames, sidequests and powerful weapons, or a super boss you remember struggling against. Tier three is the superfan, diehard Easter egg moment that’s like ‘no way, they gotthisin the game, that’s crazy!’ We wanted to use that as a system to make decisions and choices to figure out what from all the games would fit into our game.” That sorts out theÂFinal Fantasyelement of the set. But at the end of the day, this is still aÂMagic: The Gatheringexpansionâan important one too, as the first Universes Beyond set to be officially legal in the standard play format. The set doesn’t just have to execute on a referential standpoint, it has to pushMagicmechanically, and include a wide swath of card archetypes to make it appeal to regular players. Thankfully, it seems likeFinal Fantasywill deliver on that aspect too, from what was shown to press of the set so far. The set includes evolutions of certainÂMagicmechanics, like Job Select, a riff on For Mirrodin or Living Weapon that creates hero tokens that players will then attach equipment cards to inspired byÂFinal Fantasyjobs from the original game (and ones added down the line, like those included inFinal Fantasy XIV). There’s also Tiered, an entirely new mechanic that reflectsÂFinal Fantasy‘s own magic system, where spells grow in power across three levels of strength, letting players pay more mana to amplify the card’s damage. It includes clever uses ofÂMagicgame mechanics to retell flavorful plot beats from various games, like Kain, Traitorous Dragoon swapping player control on damage and creating treasure tokens, reflecting the moment inÂFinal Fantasy IVwhere he’s brainwashed by the villainous Golbez and turns on the party. Or, for fans ofÂFinal Fantasy VIIand generational trauma, Aerith Gainsborough’s card gaining counters whenever her player gains life… only to pass those counters around to other legendary creatures you control when she dies. The whole set is littered with details like this. A regular mechanic throughout the set is Transformâused to both show villainous transformations of iconic characters likeFFVI‘s Kefka,IX‘s Kuja, orÂXIV‘s Emet-Selch as they go from their primary forms to their final boss identities, but also to reflect a character’s long arc over the course of their respective games, likeFFIV‘s Cecil being able to switch from Dark Knight to Paladin, orÂFFVI‘s Terra being able to transform to her Esper form for a limited time. There’s also the use of the Saga card archetypeâa card that enters the battlefield, progresses through a series of “chapters” turn after turn, and then expiresâto represent the various Summons from across the franchise, like Bahamut or Valigarmanda. Not all of the references are just forÂFinal FantasyÂfans, either. Throughout the set, fan-favoriteMagiccards will be re-printed withÂ classic artwork from acrossÂFinal Fantasyto reflect the connection between the set’s source material and the games, likeÂFFIX‘s Zidane being used to re-flavor Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer;FFII‘s Firion re-flavoring Sram, Senior Edificer; orFFVII‘s Yuffie taking on the powerful Yuriko, the Tiger’s Shadow. And some are just plain goofy, like multicolored variants of the Traveling Chocobo card to reflect the rainbow of options seen inFinal Fantasy VII‘s Chocobo racing minigame, or the fact that there areÂ15 variantsof the Cid, Timeless Artificer card: all with the same rules (including one that lets you field as many versions of Cid in a deck as you’d want), but each with different artwork celebrating each version of the character that existed fromÂFinal Fantasy IIall the way through toÂXVI. Suffice to say, it’s clear looking at the cards Wizards have shown off so far that theÂMagicteam’s passion for the source material is shining through clearly, perhaps more than any of the Universes Beyond material we’ve seen from the game so far. “If there was something awesome we wanted to do [in the set], we got to do it,” Gavin Verhey,ÂMagic‘s principle game designer, said. “You’ll see all kinds of fun surprises as you go through the set, it’s really special.” “We recently got the first booster boxes in the offices, and we got to get the team together to do a draft, and after years of working on it, just sitting around a table the way all our players are going to do… every single card in this set is like a carefully handcrafted gift,” Verhey concluded. “We’ve put so much time, and energy, and research into it, and I just really hope that as you see the cards you see some of that come through.” “When it comes to Universes Beyond, there’s a lot of different sentiments among the player base about how they feel about certain cards, and certain sets,” Deveney added. “This one was made forÂyou: if you’re a fan, you want to get into the franchise, if you just really likeÂMagicsets… this was made for you, by people who really just want you to have a great Friday night with your friends… that’s kind of the ultimate goal, just to reconnect and have a great time.” Magic: The Gathering – Final Fantasyreleases June 13.

    "title": "How Hollywood is Trying to Handle Trump’s Potential Movie Tariffs",
    "article_text": "Earlier this week, the American movie industry was thrown out of whack when president Donald Trump revealed his tariffs forinternational film productions. Reactions to this news was met with negativity and concern from Hollywood and movie fans, even as the president himself argued this wouldgreatly benefitthe local industry. But without any real idea of how he intends to enforce or even enact this, Hollywood is taking matters into its own hands. According to a recentVarietystory, leaders of major studiosâUniversal Pictures, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery, to name a fewâgathered on a Zoom call with Motion Picture Association chief Charles Rivkin to find a “delicate way” of telling the White House how the film business works, and the difficulty of applying tariffs onto a movie. As many will tell you, films are a group endeavor. Most blockbusters are shot, financed, or made by teams outside the United States, often for tax credits or other financial benefits. The studio heads hope that when Trump eventually speaks with them, they can make clear the US film industry is “net positive,” and that his concerns about productions leaving the country mainly affect the state of California. Speaking of California, the state’s Attorney General Rob Bonta told theHollywood Reporterhe thinks these tariffs could mean “a First Amendment basis for action.” He argued president is intentionally went after “a blue state that doesn’t seem to be supportive of him.” Shortly after he announced the tariffs,Trumpdeemed state governor Gavin Newsom “a grossly incompetent man. [The industry] has been decimated by other countries taking them out…heâs just allowed it to be taken away from.” For his part, both thegovernorand theStay in LAorganization have separately proposed ideas to the public on how to keep productions in the state (and America more broadly), but the president has yet to meet with either about a potential solution. The second Trump administration has a history of going after groups they don’t like, or who push back against its orders, like the current disputeagainst Harvardwhen the university refused tocomply with its demands.Bonta said his office is exploring legal action on the basis of a First Amendment violation, and hopes to “defend our state and our people, including Hollywood.” It’s unclear if such an argument against the tariffs would hold up in court, but at the moment, this is (currently) the only play Bonta and his office has. As for the studio heads, many are keeping quiet to avoid any financial penalties. They’re also still unclear on what falls under tariff jurisdiction: does it only apply to Hollywood productions, or are TV shows and streaming films also caught up in this? It remains unclear, as does the response from international countries should the administration go through with its decision. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Study Uncovers the One Thing That Cuts Through Climate Apathy: Loss",
    "article_text": "For much of the 20th century, winter brought an annual ritual to Princeton, New Jersey. Lake Carnegie froze solid, and skaters flocked to its glossy surface. These days, the ice is rarely thick enough to support anybody wearing skates, since Princetonâs winters have warmed about4 degrees Fahrenheitsince 1970. Itâs a lost tradition that Grace Liu linked to the warming climate as an undergrad at Princeton University in 2020, interviewing longtime residents and digging through newspaper archives to create a record of the lakeâs ice conditions. âPeople definitely noticed that they were able to get out onto the lake less,â said Liu, whoâs now a Ph.D. student at Carnegie Mellon University. âHowever, they didnât necessarily connect this trend to climate change.â When the universityâs alumni magazine featured her research in the winter of 2021, thecomment sectionwas filled with wistful memories of skating under the moonlight, pushing past the crowds to play hockey, and drinking hot chocolate by the frozen lakeside. Liu began to wonder: Could this kind of direct, visceral loss make climate change feel more vivid to people? That question sparkedher study, recently published in the journal Nature Human Behavior, that came to a striking conclusion: Boiling down data into a binary â a stark this or that â can helpbreak through apathy about climate change. Liu worked with professors at Princeton to test how people responded to two different graphs. One showed winter temperatures of a fictional town gradually rising over time, while the other presented the same warming trend in a black-or-white manner: The lake either froze in any given year, or it didnât. People who saw the second chart perceived climate change as causing more abrupt changes. Both charts represent the same amount of winter warming, just presented differently. âWe are not hoodwinking people,â said Rachit Dubey, a co-author of the study whoâs now a professor of communications at the University of California, Los Angeles. âWe are literally showing them the same trend, just in different formats.â Both charts demonstrate the same warming trend, but the gradual temperature data is less striking than the binary lake data. The strong reaction to the black-or-white presentation held true over a series of experiments, even one where a trend line was placed over the scatter plot of temperatures to make the warming super clear. To ensure the results translated to the wider world, researchers also looked at how people reacted to actual data of lake freezing and temperature increases from towns in the U.S. and Europe and got the same results. âPsychology effects are sometimes fickle,â said Dubey, whoâs researched cognitive science for a decade. âThis is one of the cleanest effects weâve ever seen.â The findings suggest that if scientists want to increase public urgency around climate change, they should highlight clear, concrete shifts instead of slow-moving trends. That could include the loss of white Christmases or outdoor summer activities canceled because of wildfire smoke. The metaphor of the âboiling frogâ is sometimes used to describe how people fail to react to gradual changes in the climate. The idea is that if you put a frog in boiling water, itâll immediately jump out. But if you put it in room-temperature water and slowly turn up the heat, the frog wonât realize the danger and will be boiled alive. Although real frogs are actually smart enough to hop out when water gets dangerously hot, the metaphor fits humans when it comes to climate change: People mentally adjust to temperature increases âdisturbingly fast,â according to the study. Previous research has found that as the climate warms, people adjust their sense of what seems normal based on weather from thepast two to eight years, a phenomenon known as âshifting baselines.â Many scientists have held out hope that governments would finally act to cut fossil fuel emissions when a particularly devastating hurricane, heat wave, or flood made the effects of climate change undeniable. Last year, weather-related disasters causedmore than $180 billion in damagesin the United States, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Yet climate change still hasnât cracked into the ranks of what Americans say theyâre most concerned about. Ahead of the 2024 presidential election, a Gallup poll found that climate change ranked near the bottom of the list of22 issues, well below the economy, terrorism, or health care. âTragedies will keep on escalating in the background, but itâs not happening fast enough for us to think, âOK, this is it. We need to just decisively stop everything weâre doing,ââ Dubey said. âI think thatâs an even bigger danger that weâre facing with climate change â that it never becomestheproblem.â One graph about lake-freezing data isnât going to lead people to rank climate change as their top issue, of course. But Dubey thinks that if people see compelling visuals more often, it could help keep the problem of climate change from fading out of their minds. Dubeyâs study shows that thereâs a cognitive reason why binary data resonates with people: It creates a mental illusion that the situation has changed suddenly, when it has actually changed gradually. The importance of using data visualizations to get an idea across is often overlooked, according to Jennifer Marlon, a senior research scientist at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. âWe know that [data visuals] can be powerful tools for communication, but they often miss their mark, partly because most scientists arenât trained, despite the availability of many excellent resources,â Marlon said in an email. She said that binary visuals could be used to convey the urgency of addressing climate change, though using them tends to mean losing complexity and richness from the data. The studyâs findings donât just apply to freezing lakes â global temperatures can be communicated in more stark ways. The popularâclimate stripesâ visualdeveloped by Ed Hawkins, a professor at the University of Reading in the U.K., illustrates temperature changes with vertical bands of lines, where blue indicates cold years and red indicates warm ones. As the chart switches from deep blue to deep red, it communicates the warming trend on a more visceral level. The stripes simplify a gradual trend into a binary-style image that makes it easier to grasp. âOur study explains why the climate stripes is actually so popular and resonates with people,â Dubey said.

    "article_text": "On Sunday, May 4, Jeffy Yu took his own life on a live stream. On Wednesday, he was hanging out at his parents’ house, alive and well.The San Francisco Chronicle tracked down Yu, the founder of cryptocurrency token Zerebro, who had apparently faked his own death in dramatic fashion and fled in an apparent attempt to both get out of the crypto space and cash in on the attention that the story brought to his crypto projects. Yu’s staged death was captured on video, which appeared to show him holding a gun to his chin and seemingly pulling the trigger, causing the phone to fall. While it wasreported by CryptoSlatethat the video was a part of a live stream on the memecoin site Pump.fun, the sitedeniedthat such an event occurred on its platform. Shortly after his apparent death, an obituary for Yu appeared on Legacy.com calling him a âMartyr of Imagination and Creativity,â and describing his life as being “lived with intensity, brilliance, and a devotion to creation that he hoped would inspire others for eternity.â The obituary quickly disappeared from the site and is no longer available. In addition to the glowing, likely self-authored obituary, Yu also released another self-tribute: a memecoin dedicated to himself that was supposedly launched as a result of his apparent death. “If you’re reading this, it’s because my 72 hour deadmanâs switch triggered so i’m not here, at least physically,” the messageread. It accompanied the launch of $LLJEFFY, which Yu referred to in his launch message as “an eternal grave in cyberspace.” The coin quicklyclimbed in valueas crypto buyers jumped in. And then the suspicions started. There was a lot of oddness surrounding Yu’s death from the start, and some started calling into question whether the whole thing was an elaborate stunt. One X usernotedthat Yu appeared to buy ads on X for the memecoin to get more attention. Blockchain analysis organization BubbleMaps spotted money moving from wallets associated with Yuâfirst$100,000moved from his coin Zerebro to LLJEFFY, then another sell-off of$1.4 millionworth of Zerebro as the value of the coin started to climb from the attention brought by his death.Per Decrypt, LLJEFFY surged 2,115% after release, reaching a market cap of around $105 million. By Wednesday, the jig was fully up. TheSan Francisco Standard found Yuat his parents’ home in the city, and he freaked out. âIâve been doxxed. Iâve been harassed. If you can find me, other people can find me,â he told the paper. âNow I have to move my parents out of here this week.â Given how much he seemed to have cashed out during his brief time as a ghost, it seems like he should be able to find them someplace nice.

    "title": "Rogue Pulsar Snaps Galactic Bone in Milky Way’s Spine",
    "article_text": "A galactic filament that stretches across 230 light-years in the Milky Way has suffered from a strange kink that has distorted its magnetic field, appearing as a fracture in a massive bone. New X-ray images captured by the Chandra Observatory may have finally helped astronomers diagnose its ailment, naming a fast-spinning neutron star as the culprit. The center of the galaxy is marked by enormous, bone-like structures threaded with parallel magnetic fields and swirling, high-energy particles. Located roughly 26,000 light-years from Earth, G359.13âalso known as The Snakeâis the longest and brightest of these structures. Despite its size, the bone-like structure appears to have been struck by a fast-moving, rapidly spinning neutron star, or pulsar, causing a break in the otherwise continuous length of G359.13, according to a newpaperpublished in the May 2024 issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. Using images of the galactic bone captured by NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and radio data from the MeerKAT radio array in South Africa, the team behind the paper was able to examine the fracture up close to identify the culprit. The particles that make up the Snake, and other galactic filaments, emit radio waves, which can be detected by arrays such as MeerKAT. The images fittingly resemble medical X-rays of a long, thin bone with a fracture in the center. By examining the images, the astronomers discovered an X-ray and radio source at the location of the fracture, which may come from electrons and positrons (the antimatter counterparts to electrons) that have been accelerated to high energies due to a pulsar smashing into them. The pulsar can be seen in the image thanks to its X-ray emissions, which caused it to get caught red-handed in its hit and run. Pulsars are the chaotic remains of stars, forming in the aftermath of the collapse and supernova explosion of a massive star. These explosions often send the pulsar flying at high speeds while rapidly rotating and beaming electromagnetic radiation. There’s a lot going on here, and the pulsar isn’t exactly watching where it’s going. The researchers believe a speedy pulsar may have caused the fracture by smashing into G359.13 at speeds between one million and two million miles per hour. The likely collision distorted the magnetic field in the bone, which caused the radio signal to also become warped. The Milky Way is full of violent encounters like this, and the busted filament is just the latest sign of the galaxy’s ongoing chaos. With tools like Chandra and MeerKAT, astronomers are continuing to catch these cosmic troublemakers in the act.

    "article_text": "This article is part of Gizmodo Deals, produced separately from the editorial team.We may earn a commission when you buy through links on the site. Apple is famously brand-image-conscious and discounts are very rare (and even more so soon after they have been released). The company makes its retail partners adhere to rigid price regimes to maintainthe sense of the products being exclusive and high-end. But with its strong market power, Amazon is one of the few stores that can manage to penetrate that firewall and sell Apple’s new hardware at legitimate bargains. Less than two months after the release of the 2025 MacBook Air,Amazon has dropped the price of the 256GB/16GB model to an all-time low of $849, which is 15% off the normal $999. It’s a very surprising move, especially given how well the new MacBook Air has been selling at full price (with no discount at all). Even at full price, this laptop offers a value for money and great performance. See at Amazon The MacBook Air 2025 isone of Apple’s best-value laptops ever created. With Apple adding the M4 chip to the mix, Apple has leaped forward where performance and power efficiency are concerned. The M4 is built on next-generation N3E technology with a 10-core CPU that includes four high-performance cores and six efficiency cores, and a 10-core GPU which brings hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading to the Air lineup. The result is a computer that’s up to 25% faster at single-core tasks and up to 30% faster in multi-core performance than the previous M3 generation, with GPU speeds up to 21% faster. In day-to-day use, that means everything from web surfing and productivity tasks to photo editing and even light gaming feels more responsive and silky, smoother than ever. The standout feature is thenew 16-core Neural Engine, doubling AI and machine learning performance compared to the M3,and it allows Apple Intelligence features that let you work smarter and more securely. The13.6-inch Liquid Retina display is absolutely breathtaking, and it delivers sharp 2560-by-1664 resolution, 500 nits of brightness, and wide P3 gamut and True Tone technology support for a billion colors. This makes the MacBook Air a real joy to work on creative endeavors or just plain general browsing. It remains impossibly thin and light with a premium aluminum casing. Thin as it is, it still finds room for a four-speaker audio system, a 12MP Center Stage camera, Touch ID, and a large Force Touch touchpad. Battery life is excellent,easily lasting a day’s work or studying and fanless operationensures quietness even when under load. Not many laptops are both one of the most affordable in its class and one of the most potent, but the 2025 MacBook Air manages to strike the right balance. With Amazonâs current record-low price, youâre getting the best Apple silicon, a stunning display, and a premium build for less than many Windows ultrabooks.

    "title": "Why Are ADHD Rates So Much Higher in the U.S.?",
    "article_text": "Chances are, you know someone with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), or you might have it yourself. ADHD is a complex condition characterized by symptoms like a constant inability to pay attention, impulsiveness, trouble sleeping, and mood swings.Â According to the latest data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, anestimated 7 millionchildren in the U.S. (11.4% of all children) have been diagnosed with ADHD, along with 15.5 million U.S. adults (6% of the adult population)âhalf of whom were diagnosed as kids. These numbers aren’t fixed, however. The prevalence of diagnosed ADHD has steadily risen in the U.S. over time, and can differ significantly from state to state. Globally, ADHD rates tend to be lower than those seen in the U.S., though prevalence has been increasing insome parts of the world. The reasons for this increase in diagnosed ADHD, or the differing rates across states or countries, aren’t clear. It’s possible that much of this increase simply reflects doctors becoming better at recognizing ADHD in children and adults over time. But ADHD is also predominantly thought to be caused by a complicated mix of genetic and environmental factors, and it’s possible that some of these factors might be on the rise. In perhaps the weakest version of that theory, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Secretary of Health and Human Services,appeared to implyrecentlyâwithout any supporting evidenceâthat the rise in ADHD and other neurological conditions is being caused by food dyes or another supposed environmental toxin. People With ADHD Are Living Shorter Lives, Study Finds Some researchers have argued that at least part of the difference in ADHD rates can be attributed to cultural perceptions of the behaviors associated with itâparticularly in childrenâas well as other societal factors. For this Giz Asks, we reached out to psychologists, psychiatrists, and medical historians to get their take on why ADHD rates vary so widely from place to place. The following responses may have been lightly edited for clarity and grammar. Apsychologistspecializing in ADHD and other developmental conditions at Syracuse University. The prevalence of ADHD in children varies between 5% and 10% depending on the region of the world. ADHD prevalence rates are generally higher in the U.S. (closer to 10%) and lower in Europe and Asia (closer to 5%). Rather than biology, there are medical, social/cultural and educational explanations as to why ADHD is more common in the U.S. Medical:Children in the U.S. are more often screened for ADHD by primary care physicians than in some other places in the world. In addition, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is used to diagnose ADHD in the U.S. and has a wider diagnostic criteria for ADHD than the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) which is used in most other parts of the world. Finally, the U.S. is one of only two countries (New Zealand is the other) which allows direct-to-consumer advertising of medications. This increased awareness of treatment options likely contributes to higher diagnosis (and medication rates). All three of these medical explanations sets the stage for ADHD to be more often diagnosed in the U.S. Social/Cultural:In the U.S., ADHD is widely known and discussed. This increased awareness can lead to caregivers and teachers noticing inattentive and/or hyperactive- impulsive symptoms more frequently. These behaviors might then be quickly labeled as âdisorderedâ rather than considered as within the range of typical child development. In comparison to other places in the world (especially Asia), there is somewhat lower stigma regarding ADHD in the U.S. The relatively lower level of stigma can lead to more caregivers seeking and accepting ADHD treatment. Finally, K-12 U.S. schools often emphasize self-control in the classroom (e.g., stay seated for 6+ hours per day). This emphasis on self-control may make ADHD-like behaviors more noticeable in school. All three of these social/cultural explanations sets the stage for ADHD to be more often diagnosed in the U.S. Educational:In the U.S., an ADHD diagnosis can lead to the provision of school services, resources, and accommodations. This can lead to an inherent incentive to diagnose the condition. In my opinion, this is likely the greatest single influence on the higher ADHD prevalence rates that are commonly reported in the U.S. Professor of health history at the University of Strathclyde’s Center for the Social History of Health and Healthcare and author of the 2011 bookHyperactive: The Controversial History of ADHD. One of the reasons ADHD is most commonly diagnosed in the United States is that it is where it was first diagnosed. Whereas most countries began diagnosing ADHD in the 1980s and more often in the 1990s, American children were first diagnosed with what weâd recognize as ADHD in the late 1950s. That is when the term Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder was coined. Previously, hyperactive, impulsive children were only thought to be problematic when their behaviors were very severe or associated with underlying brain damage. Of more concern to child experts were shy, inactive, withdrawn, and nervous children. In contrast, Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder, coined in 1957, was depicted as common, occurring in most classrooms. Following the Soviet launch of Sputnik (also in 1957), Americans grew concerned about why they appeared to be lagging behind in the Space Race. The National Defense Education Act was passed in the next year, placing more focus on core subjects, encouraging students to stay in school or college for longer, and hiring guidance counsellors to identify under-achievers. Those singled out as not meeting expectations were often diagnosed with Hyperkinetic Impulse Disorder. At the same time, the manufacturer of the drug Ritalin was looking for a market. It was approved to treat hyperactive children in 1961, spurring an aggressive marketing campaign that promoted not only the drug, but the disorder it was meant to treat. While some of the tactics employed by drug companies were restricted in the 1970s, the advent of direct-to-consumer advertising in the 1980s and 1990s boosted the popularity of the disorder, now called ADHD, even further. Alongside these factors, we also have to consider the environmental factors thought to contribute to ADHD behaviors, ranging from synthetic food additives and exposure to atmospheric lead, to lack of exercise and time in nature. Many of these contributing factors have been and continue to be more significant in the U.S. than in other countries. Professor of psychiatry and co-directorof the Center for Mental Health Innovation at Oregon Health & Science University’s School of Medicine. The usual scientific opening and the boring answer: a combination of multiple secular [long-term, non-cyclical] factors. But we can name some of them. First, laws are different. For example, in the U.S., educational laws mean that a diagnosis ofÂ ADHDÂ can enable resources to be marshaled for children struggling in schoolâthus it really matters if a child has a diagnosis ofÂ ADHDÂ and when they struggle in school, this gets looked at much more quickly than in other countries. Second, treatment guidelines are different across countries. In some countries, medication is only rarely prescribed to children, but guidelines in other countries, including the U.S., encourage use of medication as a first line treatment due to its low cost, general efficacy, and limited availability of other options. Third, the quality of the health care system matters. The U.S. system is patchy at best, and so it is often not possible for a child to get the support they needâwhat appears as ADHD may be better seen as another issue, but the resources to identify and support other issues are insufficient, and ADHD becomes the âlow hanging fruitâ to address. Fourth, clinician ideas of how to diagnose ADHD, and at what threshold to do so, vary widely. Even within a single state in the U.S., we have seen that rates of identification of ADHD vary markedly from one county to another. The best studies I have seen indicate that cross-national differences in true prevalence (as distinct from case identification) are small (ranging from 2% to 4% or so), whereas case identification rates vary much more widely. Although genetic influences are extremely important in ADHD, environmental exposures also matter to etiology. (We have not seen any evidence so far that population genetic variation is sufficient to affect prevalence). Thus, although not well demonstrated, it is likely that regional differences in relevant risk factors (for example, air pollution, ambient lead exposure, poverty and resource availability for families, maternal health during gestation and perinatal health, rates of family trauma) also account for within-country regional variation, as well as partly influencing cross-national variation in both true prevalence and case identification of ADHD or ADHD-like problems. Distinguished professor of psychologyat the University of California, Berkeley and director of the Berkeley Girls with ADHD Longitudinal Study, the longest follow-up study of its kind. ADHD is the latest name for a constellation of problems and impairments that have been professionally recognized since the advent of compulsory education. It’s controversialâparticularly because, just as is the case with other mental and neurodevelopmental conditions there is no objective biological “marker” (as there is for coronary artery disease or cancer) to pinpoint its presence. Nonetheless, an individual with levels of attention dysregulation, impulse control problems, and difficulty organizing one’s life may well display, over time, impairments in academic performance, social interactions, job performance, and regulation of emotions. And for those who might think that ADHD is a convenient label for lax parenting or difficult schools, there is a ton of evidence that the later-life issues they experience too often include low self-image, either aggressive or depressive behaviors, high risk for accidental injuries, and especially for girls, high rates of unplanned pregnancies, exposure to intimate partner violence, and self-inflicted injury (including both non-suicidal self injury and actual suicidal behavior). Why some people have high levels of ADHD but most do not is related far more to genetic differences across individuals than to differences in family interactions or contexts. Thus, ADHD (via twin and adoption studies) is significantly heritable. Still, even if one has the genetic predisposition (spanning many genes, each operating to produce a small amount of risk), how one is parented and schooled can go a long way toward exacerbating or instead minimizing impact via building of strengths. International studies over the past 17 years have found, intriguingly, that in countries with compulsory education, the rates of diagnosed ADHD in children and teens are remarkably consistentâcomprising around 5 to 8% of the population of young people. This provides circumstantial evidence for the proposition that when youth with genetic propensities for an exploratory, impulsive style are made to go to compulsory education, a remarkably similar percentage have real difficulties with self-control. However, two countries with rates of diagnosed prevalence well above these international rates are the U.S. and Israelâboth of which have extreme levels of academic pressure to succeed. In fact, in a book I co-authored with the health economist Richard Scheffler,The ADHD Explosion,we found that the underlying major differences in ADHD diagnostic rates across U.S. states could be pinned to state-by-state differences in educational policies related to district-wide standardized test scores. That is, in states that suddenly mandated certain levels of academic performance in order to maintain state support for those districts, rates of ADHD diagnoses rose precipitously over the ensuing yearsâbecause of pressure to get such youth treated and because of policies at the time that excluded youth diagnosed with ADHD from being counted in the district’s test-score average (because these were now “special ed” kids). Overall, despite the psychobiological reality of ADHD, when carefully assessed, it may well be that social and cultural pressures to “perform” can falsely inflate rates of diagnosis (a) when there is pressure on public schools to produce better test scores at all costs and (b) given the tendencies for many non-specialist professionals to yield a quick diagnosis in absence of the needed time and effort to make a valid diagnosis. Finally, though you didn’t ask, there’s been a 100-year-long ignoring and discounting of the possibility that girls and women can “have” ADHD. A lot of work in my lab has shown this to be a myth: Boys ARE about twice as likely as girls to develop ADHD, but this is wildly different from the supposed 10:1 difference so often posited. Girls tend to show a less ornery and overt form of ADHD than boysâand professionals must catch up with the latest diagnostic standards.

    "title": "PC gaming remains undefeated: Nintendo now says it has the right to brick your Switch if it thinks you're pirating games or modifying the console",
    "article_text": "Citizen, we have detected installation of an unlicensed \"Bowsette\" software modification. Prepare for interdiction by a licensed Nintendo paramilitary subcontractor. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. First spotted byGame File(readers may encounter a paywall), Nintendo has recently changed its online user agreement in multiple consumer-unfriendly ways just before the launch of the Switch 2. Chief among them: Nintendo asserts the right to render your console \"permanently unusable\" if it determines you're in violation of the agreement. Nintendo's specific new phrasing, distinct from its prior EULA from 2021, is that \"You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Servicesand/or the applicable Nintendo device[emphasis mine] permanently unusable in whole or in part.\" The restrictions in question are that you may not: For context, the same section of the EULA used to read: \"You are not allowed to lease, rent, sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble all or any portion of the Nintendo Account Services without Nintendo's written consent, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law.\" The sections I most take issue with are the prohibitions on copying, modifying, or decompiling software—particularly as it no longer accounts for it being \"expressly permitted by applicable law\"—as well as hardware/software modifications \"that would cause the Nintendo Account Services to operate other than in accordance with its documentation and intended use.\" No game or hardware modding, no extracting ROMs⁠—something Nintendo continuously asserts we cannot do, even though it is a legally protected consumer right⁠—and no dual booting to another OS. There's also the very legitimate concern of the notoriously heavy-handed, litigious company acting on false positives. I don't know what means Nintendo has to detect such activity and kill a console, but I'm getting a clear message: You spent $450 on this hardware, but Nintendo does not think you own it. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to jailbreak or modify a console, or extract a ROM from a game you own: Many original Switch games run better via PC emulation than on the original console, and Nintendo is only just catching up to that capability with theSwitch 2's potentially compromised backwards-compatibility. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Even more pressing is the inevitable discontinuation of proprietary online services, like we saw recently with the3DS and Wii U. Just before that was finalized, Nintendo pushed an update to 3DS consoles whichmade them harder to jailbreak. This is also something that makes Nintendo's subscription-based access to its classic games library all the more galling to me, and in Nintendo's new EULA update, it now explicitly warns that it may discontinue its online services. In the face of such unreliability, user modification of a device to ensure it remains fully functional is a perfectly reasonable solution. Going beyond legitimate hardware modifications, I'm a firm believer that piracy is as much a question of service and convenience as finance, and Nintendo's moves to consolidate its own control of products people legitimately purchase are inconvenient, annoying impositions that will annoy fans and drive away customers. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Amid anongoing campaign against emulation, Nintendo continues to throw its muscle around, emboldened by the generation-defining sales success of the original Switch, but also clearly threatened by the rise of PC handhelds, emulators which run its own games better than the original hardware, and rumblings offuture XboxandPlayStation portables. I feel vindicated in my assessment thatthe Switch 2 is all stick and no carrot: Lacking truly exciting industrial design innovations (except theJoy Con mouse, which I actually quite like) or tech/hardware improvements to set the console apart from a more crowded handheld market, the Switch 2 can only rely on name recognition, customer inertia, and console-exclusive games to move units, much like its living room-bound rival, the PlayStation 5. All three console manufacturers have well and truly left behind the plug-and-play \"it just works\" convenience that used to set them apart from PCs. And there's even more in the EULA that's worth flagging, as pointed out by Game File. A change in the wording of the EULA for minors that places responsibility on their legal guardians seems designed to further head off embarrassing lawsuits like theinfamous Joy Con drift ones, ensuring such cases are forced into arbitration. Nintendo also joins in an unfortunate trend we can't even escape on PC: Explicitly spelling out thatwe do not own our games, and instead only \"license\" them. That last embarrassment aside, these odious impositions are a big part of why I'm largely a desktop and Steam Deck-exclusive gamer at this point. I want to understand, modify, and be able to use the hardware I purchase for as long as I see fit, not be beholden to the proprietary services of a notoriously consumer-unfriendly company. Sure, Microsoft keeps trying to push anew version of Clippythatliesandscreenshots your credit card information, but Linux gaming only keeps getting better thanks to SteamOS—if things get bad enough in the house that Bill built, I'll make the move. I still love the original Nintendo Switch, but everything I've learned about its follow-up makes me think the 2017 hybrid console was lightning in a bottle.

    "article_text": "Mortal Sin now has two art styles for the price of one. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The gorgeous first person action-roguelikeMortal Sinrecently went live with a surprising new update: Agraphical overhaulwith an arguably even more stunning riff on its pulp comic book art style. Fans of the original needn't fret, though: You can toggle between the OG palette and new hotness at any time. Mortal Sin's whole visual vibe is prog metal album art crossed with sword and sandals graphic novel, like a hipster Dark Horse adaptation of Conan the Barbarian or something. Its original look was stark and striking, with a deliberately limited palette⁠—everything rendered in bright red, deep blue, or shades of grey to black. The new rendering keeps the gnarliness and heavy line work, but injects the world with a lot more color. The \"Realistic Visuals Update\" is very much in keeping with the spirit of Mortal Sin, but it also practically looks like a brand new game. I really dig it, but I appreciate that developer Nikola Todorovic didn't throw out the baby with the bathwater: You can still swap back to Mortal Sin's original art style at any time from its graphics menu. In the gallery below, I've alternated between post-and pre-update images of the game. I absolutely loved Mortal Sinwhen I played it back at the beginning of early access in 2023. It has amazingly chunky, satisfying melee combat to go along with those singular visuals. There's a lot here for fans of brutal first person brawlers like Condemned and Vermintide, as well as those who prefer atmospheric dungeon crawlers likeLunacid. I stepped away from Mortal Sin after pressing at the limits of its initial early access content, but it looks like a ton has been added to the game since. That, plus the fresh graphics, have already gotten it reinstalled on my Steam Deck. Mortal Sin is still in early access, but is sitting at a coveted \"Overwhelmingly Positive\" user score with 3,000 reviews and counting onSteam. It also sells for the sweet spot, \"not bargain bin, but still perfectly sensible\" indie game price of $20.

    "article_text": "*Tips fedora* Milady. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As reported byEurogamer,Elden Ring's \"Tarnished Edition\" GOTY re-release and update won't just come with new weapons out in the world: It'll have two new starting classes added to the lineup, with both harkening back to Souls characters of the past, and one of them coming equipped with the Milady Light Greatsword, a killer weapon that used to be gated by an endgame boss. Famitsuattended a press event about the Tarnished Edition in Tokyo on May 6 where FromSoft shared images of the two new classes (follow the link to Famitsu to check them out). Their names may change in localization, but literally translate as \"Knight of Ides\" and \"Heavy Knight.\" The Knight of Ides iswhere it's atif you ask me. First, its armor set looks amazing, and strikes me as a clear riff on theFluted Armorfrom Demon's Souls, one of the coolest knight designs FromSoft has ever produced, and its very first box art, \"mascot\" set of Soulsborne armor. The Drip Souls is off the charts with the Knight of Ides. But that's not all: It comes equipped with Milady, the standard, most customizable version of the Light Greatsword weapon class introduced in the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. Though SotE introduced flashier options like theBackhand BladesandRakshasa's Great Katana, Milady was a standout addition, combining an elegant, duelist moveset with the power of a greatsword. The Knight of Ides could be a new favorite starter for Dexterity or Quality (Dex/Strength) build enjoyers. On the opposite end of the character archetype spectrum, the Heavy Knight is, as you might guess by the name, beef city. Similar to Ides' echo of the Fluted Armor, Heavy Knight screams Dark Souls 1'sIron Tarkus. They come equipped with that heavy black plate armor, no shield, and a brand new large sword. It's hard to tell, but if it's the same weapon that appears in later images shared by Famitsu, it seems like the Heavy Knight's default weapon is a curved greatsword, one that resembles a giant falchion. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Soulsborne classes are often more suggestions for how to build your character, but the addition of new armor, a new weapon, and early access to a killer late-game sword sweetens the deal. The Tarnished Edition is targetingNintendo's Switch 2, but its new classes and other additionswill also come to PC, hopefully day-and-date with the launch. Bandai Namco has not confirmed a release date, but I would be surprised if it's far off from the Switch 2's June 5 release.

    "article_text": "\"Time to play poacher peasant Henry simulator 9000.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Much as I loveKingdom Come Deliverance 2, one thing I didn't like, at least in the early game, was bed hunting. Sleeping is the main way you save and regenerate health in Warhorse Studios' marvellous medieval RPG, but in the game's first area beds are rarer than groschen and good steel. Rocking up to a campsite to discover a bunch of heavily armed bandits slumbering away was always a deflating experience, as was spending what few coins I'd earned on a bed in an inn just to save the game. Hence, it was with no small amount of relief that I discovered the existence of theKCD2 camping mod, which furnishes Henry with the ability to set up his own campsite anywhere in Bohemia. Created by modder djb and released just a few days ago, the mod \"enhances the roleplaying experience in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, allowing players to set up their own authentic personal campsites anywhere in the world.\" The camping mod basically lets you carry your own camping equipment around with you, then deploy it at will on any suitable terrain. A basic camp includes a campfire, a tent, and a bed which, according to djb \"conforms with the base game's cooking and sleeping systems.\" To be clear, the mod doesn't whisk you away to a separate camping areaBaldur's Gate 3style. It actually places your camp within the game world, dynamically aligning your tent, campfire etc with the underlying terrain. According to djb, getting this to work involved writing 1,500 lines of code. \"This turned out to be an extensive exercise in creative problem solving to get the game system to allow for dynamically placing interactive smart objects like fires and beds\", djb writes, adding that \"It does not like this black magic, and there will probably be bugs.\" Nonetheless, the mod will allow you to place a camp pretty much anywhere, and djb deliberately avoided placing any restrictions on the system for maximum flexibility. \"You can put your camp down in a corner of town, in someone's house, on the edge of a cliff, wherever you choose. It's up to you to use the mod how you want, realistically or otherwise.\" There are three tiers of camping equipment that Henry can deploy. The basic setup I've already mentioned, but there is also \"standard\" camping equipment and \"premium\" gear. Djb doesn't specify what the difference is. But they do mention players can also acquire a unique tent, should they be in possession of a rare, unnamed item. Djb notes the mod is designed for immersion purposes rather than players looking for \"more stat boosts\", though presumably sleeping in a deployed camp bed will at least heal you like it does in the base game. Certainly, djb says the mod will be particularly useful for players who like to venture out into the woods for a spot of poaching, stating. \"Time to play poacher peasant Henry simulator 9000.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "Project leader is \"opening up the floor\" for a replacement. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It would be unfair to callStarfielda terrible game, but by now it's safe to say that Bethesda's sci-fi RPG lacks the magic of its earlier games, particularly when compared to Skyrim and Oblivion. Indeed, the fervour aroundOblivion Remastereddemonstrates much of what Starfield lacks, like the ability to create a distinct, interesting character, and a world with the capacity to produce weird, interesting scenarios. You don't have to take my word for it either. Since launching in 2023, Starfield has slumped to a 'Mixed' rating of 58% positive reviews on Steam, and now, even its most dedicated fans are growing weary of its po-faced science fiction and bitty, nebulous galaxy. The creators of the Starfield Community Patch, who banded together more than a year before the game launched to unofficially support this latest Bethesda world, are at risk of the project collapsing entirely because its volunteers are fed up with the game. This was revealed on the Starfield ModdingDiscordby Community Patch modder Pickysaurus (viaGamesRadar), who recently announced the project is \"looking for new caretakers.\" Explaining why the Community Patch hasn't been updated since September 2024, Pickysaurus states that \"This is due to the core team members generally not having the time or motivation to curate the patch anymore.\" Pickysaurus explains his own reason for not tending to the project regularly is that he has adopted a new puppy, and as such he's \"only able to spend a few hours a week gaming\". But other volunteers have just kinda had enough of Starfield. \"Other members of the team have found themselves disenchanted with the game for various reasons—lack of replayability, the paid modding situation, moved on to playing new games, etc.\" As such, Pickysaurus says they're \"opening up the floor\" to anyone wishing to take over leading the project. The role involves bringing together bug fixes contributed by the community and making preparations for new patch releases such as writing the changelog. Pickysaurus says the role is \"a fair amount of work\" but if a replacement isn't forthcoming, it may spell the end of the Community Patch: \"If nobody comes forward, we may have to retire the project and direct users toArthmoor's patchgoing forward.\"Worth noting, however, that Arthmoor's Unofficial Starfield Patch doesn't look terribly active either: It was last updated in December 2024.

    "title": "After a decade of development, Roboquest's developer is calling time on its roguelite shooter: 'There's no way we can continue to provide content for players with over 1,000 hours of gameplay'",
    "article_text": "\"It was never meant to be what is called today 'a game as a service'\". When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. When I was a kid, post-launch support was a concept reserved mainly for NASA, and rarely the domain of video games. Sure, you might download the odd online patch on your 56k modem to fix particularly gnarly bugs. But that was more or less it. These days, it's expected that games will be supported for months and even yearsafter release. And this support isn't limited to fixing bugs: Developers are expected to add new, often free content to their games if they want to keep those Steam reviews in the blue. I often wonder about the effect this has upon developers, and if the words ofRoboquest's designers are anything to go by, it sounds like it's pretty exhausting. A bright and cheerful rogue-lite FPS about blasting robots through randomly generated environments, Roboquest launched into Steam early access in 2020, before formally releasing in 2023. Developer RyseUp Studio has continued to support the game since. Now though, after what the devs say is 10 years of work on the game, that support is coming to an end. \"2025 marks nearly a decade working on Roboquest, and it also marks the end of the journey for the game,\" write the devs in aSteam blog.\"We know many of you would have loved to see more updates, more content, more Roboquest. But that isn't something we are able to deliver.\" According to RyseUp, Roboquest was never intended to be a game with the kind of post-launch support it ultimately received. \"The initial experience was designed to be a 25/50 hours gameplay experience, there's no way we can continue to provide content for players with over 1000 hours of gameplay,\" they write. \"We tried something with the Endless Update, with some shortcomings, for sure. But the passion that burnt bright for so many years started to falter. Fatigue kicked in, and we realized we really needed to turn the page.\" Consequently, RyseUp says there won't be any more updates for Roboquest, and the only remaining releases related to the game are a PlayStation port coming at the end of May, and a standalone spinoff Roboquest VR. While this represents the end for Roboquest, it isn't the end for RyseUp. The developers are now focussed on a new project. \"With the experience we accumulated and all the errors we made along the way, we're aiming for a much, much more efficient development plan.\" This makes it sound a bit like RyseUp has made a mess of supporting Roboquest. But it's worth noting that the game is well liked on Steam, with an overwhelmingly positive overall rating out of more than 16,000 reviews. I suppose I find it concerning that developers feel the need to be so apologetic about ending support for a game they've worked on for a decade—one that was never intended to have such support in the first instance, for that matter. It speaks to how warped expectations have become regarding what developers should provide. If you're a colossal publisher making a shooter that costs $70, and you've already promised it will run for a decade, that's one thing. But if we're talking about a smaller dev charging a fraction of that price, I honestly don't expect them to try to run on the same hamster wheel until they collapse from exhaustion.

I am not typically one to celebrate Star Wars Day, partly because dedicating a day of the year to a fictional universe is the highest form of corporate nonsense, but also because being a Star Wars fan always comes with the risk of being blown up by the proton torpedo of disappointment. This year, though, even I must admit things are looking pretty great in that galaxy far, far away. The Andor TV show is preposterously good, to the point where I wonder what Star Wars did to deserve Tony Gilroy, while we recently saw the announcement ofStar Wars Zero Company, Bit Reactor's snazzy-looking Star Wars take on X-Com.

The highlight of these discounts is probably theStar Wars Jedi: Fallen Orderand its sequel,Jedi Survivor. Of the two, Fallen Order has the slightly better discount of the two, down 85% to$5.99(£5.24). Personally, I think Fallen Order is a bit of a muddled experience, but it has some great moments, like the opening level and that bit where you climb the AT-ATs in the swamps of Kashyyyk. In any case, it's well worth a fiver. Respawn vastly improved its work with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, which is currently 80% off at$13.99(£11.99). Yes, the whole beards in boxes thing remains extremely silly. But Survivor makes up for it with the best third-person action sequences this side of Uncharted 4. The middle act of this game is just gold standard Star Wars fare, from that bit with the giant drill to the amazing assault on a floating observatory. Unfortunately, many Steam reviews report that Survivor is still a choppy experience on PC, almost two years on since launch. So while the game is absolutely worth the price EA is currently asking for it, you should nonetheless proceed with caution. Elsewhere, EA's 2015 reboot of Star Wars: Battlefront is available for$4.99, though you're probably better off investing inBattlefront 2, a far superior game despite all the loot box chicanery that dogged its reputation on launch. There isn't a huge number of people playing it according to Steam charts, but still enough to get a decent game going. That's currently 83% off at$7.99(£6.99). Finally, a little nod to Star Wars: Squadrons, EA Motive's spiritual successor to the X-Wing and TIE Fighter games of old. Sadly, EA banked the game's success on a multiplayer mode that never really took off. But I think the single-player mode, which lets you play on both sides of the galactic conflict, is better than it gets credit for. And it's a treat in VR too, if you happen to own a headset. Certainly, worth trying out for$5.99(£5.24), which is an 85% discount. Although there are rumblings in the Steam reviews about issues surrounding EA account connectivity, so once again, tread carefully. All the above games are on sale until May 15. Despite EA cancelling a Respawn-made Star Wars FPS, the future of Star Wars gaming looks pretty bright, too. Alongside Zero Company, Respawn is hard at work on athird Jedi game. Star Wars Eclipseremains in development. The Kotor Remake is stillapparently ongoing, and there's anuntitled Star Wars gamein production at Skydance, supposedly with Amy Hennig's involvement.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's the weekend, and you deserve aWordlewin. Which is why we've prepared all the help you could possibly need so you can breeze through Saturday's game at whatever pace suits you best. Spend a while with today's hint if you like the sound of taking it slow and steady, or mull over our tips for a while instead. The May 10 (1421) answer will always be ready to turn things around in a snap, whenever you want it to. A win in two? For me, on a Saturday? What a treat. The only way my opening guess could have been better was if it was today's winning word. Now then, what's next now I have all this free time? Don't worry if your game isn't going as well as mine did—that's what our help's for. This teeny-tiny fungus is incredibly useful when making beers and breads of all shapes and sizes. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. One weekend win. The answer to the May 10 (1421) Wordle isYEAST. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "Cybercriminals have found a sneaky way of stealing tax accounts and even encrypted messages: here's what you need to know",
    "article_text": "Hackers use blob URIs to hide phishing pages inside the browser memory When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Security researchers have uncovered a series of phishing campaigns that use a rarely exploited technique to steal login credentials, even when those credentials are protected by encryption. New research fromCofensewarns the method relies on blob URIs, a browser feature designed to display temporary local content, and cybercriminals are now abusing this feature to deliver phishing pages. Blob URIs are created and accessed entirely within a user's browser, meaning the phishing content never exists on a public-facing server. This makes it extremely difficult for even the most advancedendpoint protectionsystems to detect. In these campaigns, the phishing process begins with an email that easily bypasses Secure Email Gateways (SEGs). These emails typically contain a link to what appears to be a legitimate page, often hosted on trusted domains such asMicrosoft’s OneDrive. However, this initial page doesn’t host the phishing content directly. Instead, it acts as an intermediary, silently loading a threat-actor-controlled HTML file that decodes into a blob URI. The result is a fake login page rendered within the victim’s browser, designed to closely mimic Microsoft’s sign-in portal. To the victim, nothing seems out of place - no strange URLs or obvious signs of fraud - just a prompt to log in to view a secure message or access a document. Once they click ‘Sign in,’ the page redirects to another attacker-controlled HTML file, which generates a local blob URI that displays the spoofed login page. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Because blob URIs operate entirely within the browser’s memory and are inaccessible from outside the session, traditional security tools are unable to scan or block the content. “This method makes detection and analysis especially tricky,” said Jacob Malimban of the Cofense Intelligence Team. “The phishing page is created and rendered locally using a blob URI. It’s not hosted online, so it can’t be scanned or blocked in the usual way.” Credentials entered on the spoofed page are silently exfiltrated to a remote threat actor endpoint, leaving the victim unaware. AI-based security filters also struggle to catch these attacks, as blob URIs are rarely used maliciously and may not be well-represented in training data. Researchers warn that unless detection methods evolve, this technique is likely to gain traction among attackers. To defend against such threats, organizations are urged to adopt advanced Firewall-as-a-Service (FWAAS) and Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) solutions that can help secure access and flag suspicious login activity.

    "title": "AI is making phishing emails far more convincing with fewer typos and better formatting: Here's how to stay safe",
    "article_text": "AI is helping attackers scale better and outsmart outdated defenses When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We’ve said it before, and we’ll say it again.Artificial Intelligence is changing the face of cybercrime, and phishing is one area where it's hitting the hardest. New data from security firm Cofense has warned AI-powered phishing campaigns are not only more frequent but also far more convincing than ever before. These emails are cleaner, more polished, and tailored to fool even more cautious users, and with generative AI tools now accessible to nearly anyone, threat actors are scaling their operations at a rate that many businesses simply can’t keep up with. In its latest threat intelligence report,The Rise of AI - A New Era of Phishing Threats, Cofense details how phishing tactics are evolving at a phenomenal rate. In 2024, the Cofense Phishing Defense Center detected one malicious email every 42 seconds, many of which slipped through legacy perimeter defenses. Email-based scams jumped 70% year-over-year, fueled by AI’s ability to mimic tone, spoof internal emails, and personalize messages with impressive accuracy. Messages now feature perfect grammar, accurate formatting, and realistic sender addresses. They often also impersonate C-suite executives, reply within existing email threads, and use lookalike domains such as “@consultant.com.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! This shift toward business email compromise (BEC) has become a major threat. AI-generated content lacks the telltale signs that previously gave phishers away, such as typos, spelling mistakes and awkward phrasing, often clues that suggest English might not be the sender’s first language. Polymorphic phishing campaigns are another area of concern, according to Cofense. These constantly-changing attacks modify their content in real time to evade signature-based security tools. Subject lines, sender details, and text all shift dynamically, which makes detection with traditional filters all but impossible. Malware embedded in these emails has also evolved, Cofense reports, with over 40% of samples in 2024 being newly observed threats, many of them Remote Access Trojans (RATs). Scrutinize email content carefully:Be skeptical of emails involving financial actions, urgent requests, or out-of-place language, even if the formatting looks perfect. Verify internal requests:If an email claims to be from a coworker or executive, double-check using known contact methods before taking action. Don’t rely on appearance:AI-generated emails often look flawless, so focus on context, timing, and content rather than how “professional” it looks. Avoid clicking on links without verification:Hover over links to check their destination and avoid downloading files from unfamiliar or unexpected messages. Use security tools that go beyond the perimeter:Look for solutions that offer post-delivery analysis and threat response based on behavior, not just signatures.

    "article_text": "Galaxy AI brain it When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If the rumors are to be believed, we are creeping closer to the launch of theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, likely happening in July once we get past the launch of theGalaxy S25 Edge,which is very likely to make an appearance ata Galaxy Unpacked event on May 12. As is the case with a lot of thebest phonesthese days, the changes expected for the next-generation Galaxy foldable phone are set to be somewhat incremental: a specs boost, an improved main camera, potentially improved battery life, and maybe a few nips and tucks to the design. Not a bad suite of upgrades, but it’s almost certainly the classic story of evolution over revolution. Now this isn't necessarily bad news. I’ve used a couple of generations of Galaxy Fold phones and rather like what they offer. I currently have aGalaxy Z Fold 4on my desk as I write this, and genuinely enjoy using it as a secondary phone; afraid I’m still aniPhone 16 Pro Maxuser despitehow boringly good Apple’s phones areand me missing the quirks of Android. So there’s arguably not a lot to get excited about with the next-generation Fold; it’ll almost certainly be a contender for a high spot on ourbest foldable phoneslist, but it may not be a phone I’d lust after. Unless artificial intelligence is at its core. Now I’m not a 100% generative AI convert, so my flirtations withGalaxy AI,ChatGPT,Google Gemini,and so on have been sporadic. But I do appreciate how AI can make my smartphone life easier.However, outside of theGoogle Pixel 9series, I think AI hasn’t been well baked into smartphones;Apple Intelligencebeing a notably messy launch and integration, especially from a company that’s usually so good at slick software. As Senior Editor Philip Berne noted in hisSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review, Galaxy AI has improved over the past 12 months, but still has scope to better integrate into the overall phone experience. And while Galaxy AI is evolving, it still feels like it has some way to go to be genuinely useful on a daily basis. My hope is thatSamsungknows this and, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 andGalaxy Z Flip 7, the AI tools and experience are given an overhaul. I especially think this could be the key to getting more out of the extra screen space foldable phones offer. For example, when it comes to slick multitasking and having multiple apps and windows open on the display of a Fold phone, I find it a thoroughly awkward and borderline irritating experience to get everything sized correctly and neatly positioned. So I’d love for Galaxy AI to be integrated into One UI so that it can figure out how I want my multitasking display to look, or at least serve up options. I’d also like to see some form of AI upscaling or clever resizing of videos to better fit the esoteric aspect ratios of Fold main displays, to make what I’m watching on the screen without cropping in. In short, I don’t want to hear more about how Galaxy AI can totally rework photos or better organize the Photos app, but I do want to hear how AI can help me get more out of solid foldable phone hardware and let me do more at speed. Ultimately, I want AI on all sorts of phones to go this way, but I reckon the most potential is on the foldable front; what do you think? Let me know in the comments.

    "article_text": "Both companies stress humans still have a role to play - for now When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Many people worry the rise of AI and robotics could lead to job losses, as machines become increasingly capable of performing tasks faster, cheaper, and more accurately than humans, concerns have grown about the long-term impact on employment, wages, and job security. Even skilled professions, such as those in healthcare, finance, law, and technology, may not be immune. The growing capabilities of AI suggest that no sector is entirely safe from disruption. These concerns are no longer hypothetical, they're becoming reality for some IT workers, after CrowdStrike recently announced it is cutting 500 jobs, which equates to around 5% of its workforce. In amemo announcing the cuts, the security firm's CEO George Kurtz said, “CrowdStrike is defined by our mission to stop breaches, our disciplined execution, and our commitment to protecting customers.\" \"Today, our customers are facing an intensifying threat landscape and growing complexity. They trust us to help them move faster and operate more securely. To keep earning that trust, we are evolving how we operate.\" Explained the company would be \"realigning\" parts of the business \"to continue scaling with focus and discipline\" and explained that: “AI has always been foundational to how we operate. AI flattens our hiring curve, and helps us innovate from idea to product faster. It streamlines go-to-market, improves customer outcomes, and drives efficiencies across both the front and back office. AI is a force multiplier throughout the business.” CrowdStrike isn’t the only tech firm cutting jobs because of AI. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! TheWall Street Journalreports IBM has, “used artificial intelligence, and specifically AI agents, to replace the work of a couple hundred human resources workers.” However, as a result of these cuts, it was able to hire more programmers and sales and marketing people. “While we have done a huge amount of work inside IBM on leveraging AI and automation on certain enterprise workflows, our total employment has actually gone up, because what it does is it gives you more investment to put into other areas,” IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told the publication. So while AI might be taking some people’s jobs, it’s resulting in an increase of opportunities in other areas. Krishna also urged the Trump administration to increase, rather than cut, federal AI R&D funding, tellingTechCrunch: “We have been an extremely strong advocate - and this is both the company and me personally - on that federally funded R&D should be increased.

    "title": "Shocked that Skype lost the battle against Zoom? I knew it was doomed all the way back in 2011, and here’s why",
    "article_text": "A bag-fumbling of galactic proportions When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Well,there goes Skype. Bye-bye, you garbage piece of software. I'm surprised you managed to hang around for as long as you did, frankly. Okay, I’m being a bit mean here; the impact of Skype on the global tech ecosystem shouldn’t be downplayed, as it effectively brought video communication to the mainstream - something that previously was the domain of corporate execs with money to burn on expensive early video-conferencing solutions. For a wonderful, all-too-brief period in the early 2010s, Skype was everywhere: a way to chat face-to-face with distant relatives or schoolmates who were just beyond the reach of an after-class bike ride. But I can’t pretend Skype was all sunshine and rainbows, even before the pandemic lockdowns and the rise of its chief competitor,Zoom. I remember sitting for ages waiting for a call to connect, frequent audio dropouts, and sometimes struggling to log in at all. Sure, internet connections are faster and more consistent now than they were when Skype was first conceived back in 2003, but that’s not an all-encompassing excuse for the app’s many failings. See, Skype’s greatest victory was also a sword of Damocles hanging over its head: its 2011 purchase byMicrosoft. A multi-billion dollar deal that positioned Skype to replace Windows Live Messenger (formerly known as the ever-iconic MSN), the purchase proved to be an immediate boon for Skype, as it was widely inserted into Windows devices over the following years, thus reaching a massive global audience. Unfortunately, this deal also meant that Skype was owned by Microsoft, which is rarely a safe position to be in. RememberZune? Yeah, me neither. The list of products and serviceskilled off by Microsoftover the years is long and storied, and many - including myself - saw the writing on the wall long before serious external competition arrived on the scene. A key issue was Microsoft’s long-running and ill-placed desire to make Teams work. I’ll be honest: as someone who was, in a previous and much worse place of employment, forced to use Microsoft Teams, I can say with conviction that it sucks. Rigid settings, feature bloat, and an inexplicable ravenous hunger for RAM make it a frequently painful piece of software to use, especially on an outdated work PC. But Microsoft wanted - and still wants - it to be a Thing People Want To Use, which ultimately led to Skype taking a back seat as its features were gradually cannibalized to improve Teams. In fact, now that Skype has officially been taken out back with a shotgun, Microsoft is actively encouraging users toport their accounts over to Teams. And what did Skype get in return? A drip-feed of features that nobody asked for, most of which did little to improve the core video-calling functionality. The interface became more cluttered, frequent UI redesigns left users confused, and yet there was a paradoxical feeling of stagnation; meanwhile, the meteoric rise of social-media-driven video calling across platforms such as Facebook andWhatsAppoffered a far more streamlined and pleasant user experience. Zoom has been around since 2011 (ironically, the same year Microsoft acquired Skype) but you’d be forgiven for thinking that it just popped into existence at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. When we were collectively displaced from our offices and had to construct impromptu workspaces inside our homes, video conferencing became an everyday necessity - and as we all know, this was where the cracks in Skype’s facade really started to show. Technical debt is never an easy hurdle to overcome, and Skype’s aging software architecture - while cutting-edge back in 2003 - gradually became a weight chained around its ankle. With Teams at the forefront, investing in updating Skype never seemed like a priority for Microsoft. The app didn’t even change over to a centralized system from its outdated peer-to-peer networking until more than half a decade after Microsoft bought it. One of the worst blunders was Microsoft’s insistence on keeping it partially anchored to actual phone numbers (with a dial pad feature, no less) in an era when interlinked accounts are king and phones are more than just phones. It was no doubt a move intended to retain the crop of older users who were unaware of the alternatives, but the 100-user call capacity and streamlined interface of Zoom made it an easy choice for professionals who needed to keep their careers afloat while the world screeched to a halt outside. It’s certainly not a universal truth that Microsoft ruins everything it touches -the Surface tablet line is finally good now!- but the tech giant has something of a reputation for enshittification. I’ve been following thegradual decay of Windowsfor years now, and looking at how Microsoft treats its most widely known product makes understanding the fall of Skype very easy. I’ve settled into a belief that Microsoft isn’t able to just let things be what they are. Everything had to bemore!More features, more information, more settings, more AI! Forget what consumers actually want; the line must go up, the goalposts must keep moving, everything must be constantly changing and innovating or it’s worthless. Once you start to see Microsoft as a tech company incapable of sitting still, its successes and failures all start to make a lot more sense. What people needed for the remote working shift during the pandemic was an effective, straightforward video conferencing tool. They didn’t find that in Skype, which had already become a bloated shell of its former self after years of ‘innovation’ at the hands of Microsoft. So I say this now, to the creators of Zoom: if it ain’t broke… Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Christian is TechRadar’s UK-based Computing Editor.

    "article_text": "This looks promising When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're expecting a brand new flagship phone fromSonyin the very near future, and a new leak has revealed plenty about the upcoming handset – including the design of the device, the colors it's going to be available in, and some of the features it'll offer. This all comes fromAndroid Headlines, where you'll find a host of images of the Sony Xperia 1 VII, as well as some of its marketing material. We can see the standard Xperia design language in evidence here, including a flat screen and boxy corners. The three colors the phone is going to come in are apparently black, green, and purple, and there are plenty of shots of each shade. We can also see a triple-lens camera around the back, matching the Sony Xperia 1 VI released in May 2024. Only a few days agowe heard thatthis phone would be unveiled on May 13, and \"powered by Alpha\" – the name of the technology in Sony's digital cameras. It's clear that photography capabilities are going to be a big focus for the smartphone. In ourSony Xperia 1 VI review, we praised the core specs of the handset, the strong photo and video performance, and the battery life. However, we did have concerns over the durability of the design and the charging speeds. For the follow-up, the materials leaked by Android Headlines suggest that we'll get a new Zeiss coating on the screen to combat glare, while there'll be a 5,000 mAh battery inside (the same as on the Xperia 1 VI) that apparently offers two-day battery life. Focus lock and macro photography features are highlighted, as well as full-stage stereo speakers, while the screen is apparently going to make some use of the same Bravia technology that Sony deploys in its television sets. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. This coming Tuesday everything will be made official, and of course we'll bring you all the details of the Sony Xperia 1 VII as they're announced. From what we've heard so far, it looks set to jump straight to the top of ourbest Sony phoneslist.

The answers to today's Connections, game #700, are… I might be missing something here (in fact I am definitely missing something here) but what on earth does MOTHER MAY I mean? That one caught me out today, which was a shame because otherwise I spotted all of the elements of the MOTHER ___ group, EARTH, GOOSE and SUPERIOR, which would have given me purple before any of the others. As it happened I only solved that one by default, but fortunately none of the other groups were too tricky either. I got blue, COMMON VIDEO GAME FEATURES first – POWER-UP and LEVEL made it too obvious – then whizzed through yellow and green without any problems. If only they were all so easy. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

    "title": "After six months with my iPhone 16 Pro, I’m still not convinced by the Action button",
    "article_text": "Time to take Action When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last year, I finallyupgraded from an iPhone 12 Pro to an iPhone 16 Pro, and to say it was a big step up would be an understatement. From the speedy performance and improved camera system to theDynamic Islandand super-smooth 120Hz display, I’ve found a lot to love about thebest iPhonemoney can buy in 2025. Since getting aniPhone 16 Pro, one thing I’ve really grown fond of isCamera Control. This built-in tool lets me quickly open the Camera app when time is of the essence, and I can even do it as I’m taking my phone out of my pocket. There’s no need to look at the display or fumble with on-screen controls – it’s just a quick, snappy way to start shooting. Yet there’s one new feature in my iPhone 16 Pro that I really haven’t taken to: theAction button. Simply put, I’ve never found a compelling use case for it. Part of my indifference towards the Action button comes down to how little time it might save me. Lots of the pre-defined options thatAppleproposes – like activating the flashlight and setting offShazam– are easy enough for me to get to in other ways, either via the Lock Screen or in the Control Center. Likewise, I’ve set myFocus modesto start up automatically, so I never really need to do so manually using the Action button. I don’t useVisual Intelligenceor Voice Memos enough to warrant adding them instead. And I’ve found nothing in Apple’s suggested list of controls, shortcuts, or accessibility features that I’ve wanted to add to the button. In the end, I’ve spent most of my time with the Action button set up as a mute toggle, which is exactly what the feature replaced on my oldiPhone 12 Pro. Part of the problem is that the thing I’d really love to use the Action button for is incredibly fiddly (or downright impossible) right now. For me, it would be great to use the side-mounted toggle for contextual shortcuts – where, at a certain time of day or a specified location, the Action button does one thing, and at another time or location, it does something else. I haven’t found a way to do that yet. And while there are ways to have multiple shortcuts run when you press the button, setting them up is an involved, complex process. I’d like to see a native option to do so from Apple, but that doesn’t seem to be forthcoming, unless the company has something up its sleeve for theWorldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)this June. Sure, maybe this is a “me” problem – after all, my colleagues John-Anthony and Axel have found some excellent uses for the Action button involvingartificial intelligenceandlanguage translation. But neither of their setups really appeals to me and my lifestyle. Right now, I’m still looking for something to change my mind. Perhaps the only thing that might convince me of the Action button’s utility is Shazam – like Camera Control, it’s something that’s designed to be used quickly. But even so, adding it to the Action button is only likely to save me a second or two compared to opening Shazam from the Control Center. Yes, identifying a song can be time-sensitive, but not quite as much as snapping a photo before the moment’s gone. At the end of the day, I’m fine with the Action button and my minimal use of it. After all, it doesn’t get in the way or slow down my day-to-day life. Most of the time, I simply forget it’s there. But it would be great to find a really convincing reason to use it that can revolutionize how I use my iPhone 16 Pro. If anyone can suggest one to me, I’m all ears.

    "title": "5 of the most exciting hi-fi teasers we've seen for the High End Munich 2025 show",
    "article_text": "It's Christmas for affluent audiophiles as the luxury audio show returns one last time When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. High End Munich is where the audio world shows off some of the latest and greatest audio equipment for audiophiles, often with price tags of the \"if you have to ask, you can't afford it\" variety. And while it's true that some of the equipment you'll see at the show costs more than a helicopter made of diamonds, it's a fascinating insight into the world of ultra-high-end hi-fi. This final event from Munich – it's moving to Vienna next year – is genuinely exciting, and some manufacturers are already teasing what they'll be showing next week. Here are five teasers of hi-fi heaven worth looking out for. British high-end pro audio brand Chord Electronics describes its Ultima Reference range of pre-amps and power amps as \"our absolute pinnacle of audio engineering\", and it's teasing a \"groundbreaking\" new product that will be a \"showstopper\" at High End Munich. So what is it? It's definitely analogue, it's going to be a flagship product, and it's apparently state-of-the-art, too. That's all we know so far, but it'll be unveiled by company founder John Franks, and we'll see it on the first day of the event, May 15. Meze Audio make somebeautiful and unusual headphones, and the new 105 SILVA promise \"exquisite design\" and \"the next major step forward for audio innovation\". The new headphones have 50mm dynamic drivers with cellulose composite domes and titanium-covered surrounds, and Meze says the sound signature \"is a new take on Meze Audio’s iconic characteristics, including the technicalities of 109 PRO combined with the warmth and genre versatility of 105 AER.\" Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. They're likely to be somewhat pricier than the more consumer-focused, open-backed and wired105 AERcans ($399 / £369 / AU$799 a pair) we saw recently, but we're intrigued all the same. Nagaoka makes the highly regarded MP-200 cartridge as well as the MP-110 that came pre-fitted in theFluance RT85N turntable. For the High End Munich 2025 show it'll be unveiling its new flagship, the MP-700, which will apparently deliver \"ever more refined and accurate sound reproduction, bringing listeners closer to the original performance.\" Naturally, it won't exactly be a bargain, with the price expected to be $1,399 / £1,149 (around AU$2,400) when it becomes available later this month. But it certainly looks a fitting way for the company to celebrate its 85th birthday. Your travel experience is about to get a whole lot better...✈️Find out more on 15.05.25 📆#highendaudio #ifiaudio #highendmunich2025 pic.twitter.com/pEN7Ax3IbVMay 9, 2025 iFi Audio promises to launch \"two new travel audio essentials – both for in-flight and in-car sound\". We're excited about that, because we really rate iFi's DACs: our most recent iFi review, of its flagshipValkyrie DAC, raved about its \"staggeringly complete sound\". It's not exactly portable, though, so we're all ears when it comes to these new products. Qobuz, which is arguably thebest music streaming platformforhi-res audio,is having a press conference on Thursday 15 May. Could this finally be the official launch of the long-awaited Qobuz Connect? The feature is similar to Spotify Connect in that it lets you control your Qobuz playback remotely on compatible hardware. It's been in beta for a while and started appearing for non-beta app users earlier this week, which would make the High End Munich 2025 show a good place for a bigger reveal. An official launch would likely coincide with more manufacturers announcing support and releasing the appropriate firmware updates.

    "title": "A new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leak may have revealed the foldable phone's dimensions and super-thin bezels",
    "article_text": "Here's what's coming When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The rumors around theSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7are starting to seriously pick up, and a new leak suggests the new foldable will be taller, wider, and thinner than its predecessor, as well as having smaller bezels around the main display. This comes from well-known tipster@UniverseIce, who claims the bezels around the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be a mere 1 mm thick. That compares to 1.9 mm on the currentSamsungGalaxy Z Fold 6, so it's a substantial difference. There's also a mention of the bezels around the display on theSamsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, which apparently measure 1.2 mm. It seems that super-thin bezels are going to be a feature when Samsung gets around to unveiling these two foldables. If Samsung sticks to the same schedule as last year, we'll see these phones sometime in July. There has also been talk of aSamsung tri-fold phonewhich may be unveiled at the same time, though there's a good chance it'll go on sale later than the other two handsets. I made a table to compare the body sizes of Samsung Fold6, Fold SE, and Fold7. pic.twitter.com/VzjCZYGtjgMay 9, 2025 We also have some dimensions from@IceUniverseabout the size of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Apparently it's going to measure 158.4 mm by 143.1 mm when opened out, and will be just 3.9 mm thick front to back. The current handset – see ourSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 reviewfor details – measures 153.5 mm x 132.6 mm x 5.6 mm. It seems Samsung's engineers have been busy getting the new foldable as thin as possible, reducing the thickness by almost a third. Head to ourOppo Find N5 reviewto read about the phone that currently has the title of the thinnest foldable on the market: it measures just 4.21 mm front to back. If these rumors are true, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be even thinner. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. That thinness might have an impact on battery life, but we'll have to wait and see.

    "title": "Physical buttons are making a comeback in cars, thanks to new safety guidelines – but I'm bracing myself for more annoying user experiences",
    "article_text": "Physical buttons are making a comeback in cars, but for how long? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. There has been a fresh call from both the industry and drivers to reduce the amount of distraction found in many modern cars. A vast number are demanding more physical switches and easy-to-reach buttons to replace fiddly touchscreens and illogical menu systems. EuroNCAP, arguably the leading vehicle safety organization in Europe, has stated that it will “incentivize” those manufacturers that provide easy-to-locate, tactile switchgear for core functionality. This will mean that manufacturers might not be able to achieve the coveted five-star safety rating unless they meet this criteria. Ironically, the decision has come from the very same safety body that made it mandatory for manufacturers to provide a plethora of active safety systems should they want to gain top marks. To many at least (including this writer), these are more of a hinderance than a help. The endless bonging of a speed limit alert system, the erratic actions of automatic lane keep assist technology and the incidents of 'ghost braking' when a camera system misinterprets a non-existent hazard up ahead are all the bane of a modern motorist’s life. But it was EuroNCAP that actively encouraged such solutions in pursuit of safer roads. Dacia boss,Denis Le Vot– who has had to put up with lower-than-average EuroNCAP safety scores because his cut-price products couldn’t afford such systems – understands that they are essential for the public perception of safety but knows the vast majority of his customers turn them off. So the Renault Group as a whole has introduced a button that does just that… with a simple long press. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. But EuroNCAP’s director of strategic development Matthew Avery wants to take tackle the sticky issue of touchscreens and toldWiredthat major manufacturers are “on notice”. “They’ve got to bring back buttons,” he added. A sensible move, seeing as there has been a growing trend among carmakers to bury core car functionality under layers of touchscreen menus. Call it the “Tesla effect”, but having to tap multiple icons to access the fog lights, turn up the heating or to adjust the side mirrors is infuriating, not to mention distracting. Don’t get me started on opening a modern glovebox. The same Wired article pays reference to a study carried out by British consultancy TRL, which concluded that infotainment systems impair reaction times behind the wheel more than alcohol and narcotics use. Driving is hard work, requires skill and a great deal of concentration, even if we feel we can do itwith our eyes closed. Manufacturers will wax lyrical about their AI voice assistants' ability to assist with many functions, with everyone from VW to Mercedes-Benz innovating in that area. But real-world testing reveals they don’t always work and most of the time, the entire process takes longer and more brain power than relying on muscle memory to prod a switch. While many manufacturers have listened to customer feedback and have promised more physical buttons (VW is a good example), a number of others are pushing further into touchscreen territory. Many newEVs hailing from Chinaseem to have “borrowed” from the Tesla infotainment handbook wholesale and most commit everything to menus and submenus. Mercedes-Benz has essentially introduced IMAX into its vehicles with the upcomingSupersceen systemthat’s to be debuted on the CLA. Similarly, BMW revealed an update of its once fantasticallytactile iDrive systemthat’s soon to become largely screen-based, swapping any remaining physical buttons for annoying haptic surfaces on the steering wheel. In the US, Chevrolet just revealed an all-new interior for the iconic Corvette, which is now packed with screens. Although its original button layout was massively over-the-top. As a modern car designer, it’s not easy to balance a clean, stylish and architectural interior with something that is safe and easy to use – the default is to remove as much clutter as possible, including helpful switchgear. But it feels like the public has spoken and, finally, essential items like wipers, lights, indicators, horn, and hazard warning lights will be scrutinized by Europe’s leading vehicle safety organization. However, with automotive manufacturers already eyeing up a time when we will all be driven around infully autonomous pods, the return of physical buttons won’t be for long. Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft. Outside of work hours, he can be found tinkering with distinctly analogue motorcycles, because electric motors are no replacement for an old Honda inline four.

It does so by both encrypting all internet connections to prevent third-party snooping, then rerouting these via itsVPN serversdotted across the world to spoof users' real IP addresses for extra privacy. Around since the 1990s, VPNs were initially a technology reserved for businesses and IT nerds. As life increasingly moved online, however, the need for everyone to secure their online privacy became more relevant. Recent statisticsshow, in fact, that an estimated 1.6 billion people worldwide used VPNs in 2024, with the global VPN market projected to reach $76 billion by 2027. NordVPNis currently TechRadar's top recommendation. Our reviewers praised its many security features, great performance, and extensive server network. You can read our fullNordVPN reviewhere. Besides being more private online, VPNs also turned out to be a great tool to bypass geo-restrictions you may find on the internet. That's because VPNs' IP-spoofing capabilities make you look as if you're browsing from a completely different country within a couple of clicks. More and more people have started using astreaming VPNto unlock foreign libraries enforced on Netflix catalogs and similar platforms. Likewise, VPNs also enable millions of people worldwide to access a free and uncensored web. As per Proton VPN data,119 countries saw VPN usage soar in 2024during times of political crisis, as citizens needed a way to evade government-imposed internet censorship.

    "title": "I think the Google Pixel 9a is brilliant, but it has me questioning annual upgrades more than ever before",
    "article_text": "The Pixel 8a is still a brilliant option When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google’s Pixel range comprises some of thebest phoneson the market right now, but it’s with the A series that the phonemaker really shines. Year on year, the company has produced one of the best affordable premium smartphones, beating out competitors on price while offering exceptional performance where it matters. In 2025, however, I’m feeling less energetic about the beloved handset. Don’t get me wrong – theGoogle Pixel 9ais a phenomenal phone and there are legitimately good reasons to buy it. It’s no doubt better than theiPhone 16ewhere it matters most and more accessible than theSamsung Galaxy S24 FE. However, it’s only slightly higher specced than the Pixel 8a, and introduces a new design that looks more iPhone-like than anything else. The Tensor G4 chip found in thePixel 9aonly offers gentle performance improvements over the G3 in the Pixel 8a. The larger battery only accounts for about two extra hours of battery life in our stress test – worthy of note and praise, but not enough to offset the Tensor’s habit of being a power hog. And so when collecting my thoughts on the Pixel 9a, a phone I’ve enjoyed using over the past month, I’ve really only been pushed back to the Pixel 8a – a phone I truly loved but scolded for a price bump it received in Australia (where I live) over the 7a. Weighing the differences, it’s tough for me to recommend the Pixel 9a as the phone to buy, when the previous model is now cheaper and technically similar. After all, the main focus of the A series device is to be accessible – so I’m naturally in favor of the less expensive device. The Pixel 8a is much the same beast as the Pixel 9a, but in fairness I think there are legitimate reasons for someone to upgrade. Looking at benchmarks passed through Geekbench and 3DMark, there’s not much of a performance argument to be made here, but there are odd features that may have you wanting the newer device, such as the new editing tools and the higher brightness. I’m just going to be efficient. Below I’ve listed the areas where the phonesactuallydiffer. I’m not listing the price, as they both had the exact same starting cost though retailers are now offering the Pixel 8a cheaper. Spec Google Pixel 9a Google Pixel 8a Size / design 154.7 L x 73.3 W x 8.9 D mm /  squared design with flat back (no camera bar) 152.1 L x 72.7 W x 8.9 D mm /  rounded design with curved back (camera bar) Cameras 48MP (wide) / 13MP (ultrawide) / 13MP (selfie) 64MP (wide) / 13MP (ultrawide) / 13MP (selfie) Display / brightness 6.3-inch P-OLED / 1080 x 2424 / 2700 nits peak brightness 6.1-inch OLED / 1080 x 2400 / 2000 nits peak brightness Battery (capacity) 5,100mAh 4,492mAh Battery (Future Labs rundown test) 13 hours and eight minutes 11 hours Charging 23W wired / 7.5W wireless 18W wired / 7.5W wireless Charging times 50%: 30 Minutes 100%: 94 minutes 50%: 32 minutes 100%: 100 minutes IP rating IP68 IP67 Years of support Seven years Seven years (six remaining) CPU Tensor G4 Tensor G3 3DMark Wild Life test 9213 (maxed out) 8500 3DMark Wild Life Extreme test 2617 2430 Geekbench single core test 1697 1373 Geekbench multi core test 4333 4306 Additionally, the Pixel 9a also includes several editing features previously found on the more expensive Pixel 9 devices, such as Add Me, macro focus, auto frame, Reimagine and macro focus video. The charging time figures above were observed by the good folks atAndroid Authority. With retailers still offering the Pixel 8a, and often at a steeply discounted price, there’s not really a lot of improvement here that’d make me want the Pixel 9a instead. The screen is nicer and slightly larger, but not as large as the one found on the similarly pricedNothing Phone 3a Pro– a phone thatI personally prefer over the Pixel 9a, also. The Pixel 9a has observably better gaming performance, but I’d argue that, if gaming’s a priority for you, you’d be better off with theiPhone 16 Plusor, hell, thePixel 9 Pro XL– though obviously these don’t come cheap, and if you’re OK with a smaller display, the 9a might be fine. The battery may be larger in the Pixel 9a than in the Pixel 8a, but that hasn’t really translated to a meaningful difference on testing (or in my day-to-day use). The same can be said of charging times, despite a 5W increase in capacity. The cameras are brilliant on both devices and I’m not prepared to say one is better than the other – Google’sreally goodat this specific thing and you’re getting a brilliant snapper either way. Finally, on the topic of ongoing support, it’s brilliant that phone companies are starting to support their devices for seven years. However I’d argue that, even if shopping for an affordable all-rounder like the Pixel 9a, you’d likely upgrade within that time. You’ll notice quality and battery alike degrade and you’ll probably be looking for the next thing within three or so years – but even if you want to keep your phone around for a while, six years of remaining support isn’t bad at all. Don’t take me as pessimistic – there are legitimate reasons for getting the Pixel 9a instead of the 8a. The brighter screen is a good one. The 700 nits difference in favor of the Pixel 9a is observable, although the 2,000 nits performance of the Pixel 8a still leaves many key competitors (looking at you,iPhone 16e) in the dark. The stronger IP rating of the Pixel 9a would give me greater peace of mind that it wouldn’t break as easily from contact with water. The same goes for the greater battery life – even if I may argue in the previous section that it’s notthatbig of a difference, you may personally be shopping for the biggest battery possible, and I can’t argue against that. There's also those earlier mentioned camera and editing tools that the Pixel 9a has – you might be particularly taken by some of them (Add Me is very cool), and although I don't think any of them are more worthwhile than a saving, you might prefer a more feature-rich handset. Finally, the phone looks great! I actually love the design – Google’s removal of the camera bar originally had me apprehensive, but I don’t mind what they’ve done with a more neutral shape. It’s more iPhone-like and generally might be preferred among some shoppers. It’s a safe bet the Pixel 8a will be discounted more and more as time goes on, and I’d encourage you to jump on it when the price suits. The Pixel 9a will also likely see a discount sometime in 2025 from some retailers (likely including Google itself come Pixel 10 season), but we’ll have to wait and see. I’d really love for Google to reshape its range around the A series – it’s a phenomenal device, but I can’t help but feel that they could make it more appealing. A cheaper variant is at the top of my list, but also a model with a larger screen would be nice – one that brings the fight to other Android phones that may offer larger displays but miss out on all the other great Google features. For now though, while I’m usually head over heels for new phones, I’ve long been of the mind that Google’s Pixel range should be just atadmore accessible, given a couple of price increases in the past five years. I’d certainly like the Pixel A to be cheaper, and it’s a shame that we can’t call the Pixel 9a ‘budget’. With price drops, however, the Pixel 8a is looking more and more attractive.

    "article_text": "Here's your firmware update for May 10, 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. What a week we've had.GTA6got a new trailer that looks stunning,Sonosand IKEA sadly ended their audio partnership, andSonyteased its new flagship headphones. To catch up on all this and more scroll down to see the week's seven biggest tech news stories with quickfire snippets on each and links to the larger story if you're keen to know more. When you're done be sure to check outseven new movies and TV shows to stream this weekend (May 9). YouTubestarted to pilot a two-personYouTube Premiummembership in select countries this week (namely France, India, Taiwan, and Hong Kong). It will allow two people to split a subscription at a rate that’s cheaper than two individual plans, or splitting a family plan. In France an individual plan costs €12.99 per month and a family plan is €23.99, while a two-person plan is €19.99 – so we’d expect it to cost around $18.99 / £16.99 / AU$26.99 in the US, UK, and Australia. Apparently, this plan is part of YouTube’s ongoing experiments that look to find “new ways to provide greater flexibility and value to our YouTube Premium subscribers.” Though it’s yet to be seen if this will make YouTube Premium a better value proposition. Netflix is finally acknowledging that it’s not just for movies and TV shows anymore, redesigning its home screen to accommodate live events and gaming in a way that should better connect you to real-time events. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It’s also finally dabbling in generative AI in, perhaps, the smartest way possible: search. Now you can find your next binge using natural language queries. There are other big changes like labels on top of title images and a general reshuffling of interface elements. It’s too soon to say if everyone is loving the new Netflix. After four years without hardware, Whoop has unveiled not one but two new wearables for 2025. The Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG are actually one and the same device, the latter a \"medical-grade\" variant with more intensive health features like ECG, blood pressure, and more. The wearables look great and boast a 14-day battery life, as well as a new design. Unfortunately, there's also a new pricing structure that means the very best features are reserved for those who pay the highest price. There is now a cheaper option and a more expensive one to the previous offering, but the Whoop 5.0 has some features disabled at the cheapest pricing tier. It's a tough pill to swallow for users who have waited four years for new Whoop wearables, but withGarminand others taking subscriptions to another level, it's the direction the industry appears to be heading in with no remorse. Earlier this week, Sonos and IKEA announced that they would be parting ways after six years of collaborating on audio homeware tech which includes the popular Symfonisk bookshelf and lamp speakers. In an email sent toThe Verge, Sonos spokesperson Erin Pategas broke the news and revealed that Symfonisk’s current inventory of products is being phased out globally at all IKEA locations, with no plans to release future products. Though the future of Sonos and IKEA will cease to exist, Sonos has offered reassurance that existing products in its Symfonisk range will still receive software updates despite the discontinuation of the partnership. The news come as quite the surprise since we’ve been very fond of Symfonisk’s speakers, but with the unpredictable future of new tariff laws looming over businesses, this is a measure that Sonos has had to carefully consider. Microsoftexpanded its Surface lineup, with the all-new Surface Laptop 13-inch and theSurface Pro12-inch 2-in-1 device using the Snapdragon X Plus processor. Most importantly, the former is the lightest and thinnest Surface Laptop to date. Battery life has also been upgraded for both, providing that extra time needed while you're away from your desk or power source. It’s worth noting that these new devices are much cheaper on this occasion; the Surface Laptop 13-inch starts at $899 / £899 / AU$1,699, while the Surface Pro starts at $799 / £799 / AU$1,499 – a huge fall from the previous versions for both, starting at $1,099 / AU$1,899. They’re available for pre-order right now. It’s been three years since Sony debuted its top-end wireless headphones, the WH-1000XM5s. But after numerous leaks, the tech giant has confirmed exactly when we’ll be seeing its successors – on May 15, next week. What can we expect from them? The rumors so far point to improved noise cancelling and audio processing, plus the return of a hinged design that Sony skipped on the current model. On the downside, there will also likely be a small price hike. But despite that, May 15 (or May 16, if you’re in Australia), is a date for your diary if you’re in the market for some premium, travel-friendly cans. GTA 6broke the internet this week with a brand new trailer focused on Vice City and the game's partners in crime, Jason and Lucia. But story teasers aside, it looks incredible. We’ve already called it one of the most beautiful games of this generation – it looks leagues ahead of what other studios have achieved – and most staggering of all the trailer was apparently captured entirely on a PS5. It clearly impressed many others too as the trailer has racked up over 94 million views in three days (at the time of writing) and Spotify streams of the songHot Togetherwhich featured heavily in the trailer surged by 182,000% in the hours after the trailer released. All we have to do now is wait a little over a year until May 26, 2026 so we can play it for ourselves.

    "article_text": "Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Moscow was a complete success, proving that China-Russia relations are rock solid, Foreign Minister Wang Yi has said. The Chinese leader paid an official state visit to Moscow this week, attending the 80th anniversary Victory Day celebrations in the Russian capital. Xi held extensive talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, after which both sides signed a sweeping range of documents around furthering bilateral cooperation, as well as a joint declaration on global strategic stability. “The visit looked back on history, looked to the future, inherited friendship, defended justice, and was a complete success,”Wang said in a press briefing on Saturday. The visit underscored that“China-Russia relations are as solid as a rock, that the results of the victory of the Second World War cannot be challenged, and that the world needs justice instead of hegemony,”the top diplomat said. Xi and Putin held talks lasting nearly ten hours, and“signed more than 20 cooperation documents, injecting new strong momentum into the development of China-Russia relations,”he added. The two powers are in their“best period in history,”Wang said.“Trying to drive a wedge between China and Russia can only be a pipe dream.” The superpowers agreed to further economic, trade, and energy cooperation, as well as to boost collaboration in high-tech fields, including nuclear energy, aerospace industries and AI. During the talks, Moscow and Beijing underscored that they complement each other’s economic strong points and have significant room for development, Wang said. Bilateral annual trade between Russia and China hit $245 billion last year, according to Chinese customs data. Nearly all trade between Russia and China is now carried out in rubles and yuan, and is protected from influence by other countries, Putin noted during the talks. In the face of global and historical changes,“it is important to remain trusted eternal friends in the spirit of seasoned friendship,”the Russian leader said in a press statement alongside Xi earlier this week.",

    "title": "Ukraine’s European backers can’t replace US military aid – NYT",
    "article_text": "Ukraine’s European sponsors lack the manufacturing capacity to replace US arms supplies to Kiev, the New York Times wrote on Saturday. The administration of US President Donald Trump has shifted from spending billions on supporting Ukraine to focusing on domestic issues. It has also signaled to its European NATO allies that Washington has no interest in propping up the military bloc alone. The NYT noted that the US has not announced a new arms package for Ukraine for more than 120 days. While the Pentagon still has $3.85 billion in armaments earmarked for Kiev under the previous administration, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declined to answer when asked if the arms would be sent to Ukraine, the newspaper wrote. Kiev is running low on long-range missiles, artillery and, most of all, ballistic aid defense systems – which are mostly manufactured in the US – the NYT wrote, citing a Ukrainian official. While European leaders and investors appear willing to pump more funds into arms manufacturing,“industry executives and experts predict it will take a decade to get assembly lines up to speed,”according to the newspaper. This comes on the backdrop of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s proposal to mobilize up to €800 billion for military spending in the EU, citing threats from Russia and the inability to rely on long-term US support. The Trump administration has consistently demanded that the European NATO states increase their annual military spending to 5% of GDP, calling the longstanding 2% target insufficient. Russian officials have condemned the steps being taken in Europe toward militarization, and dismissed claims that Moscow intends to attack either the EU or NATO. Moreover, Russia has expressed concern that, rather than supporting the US peace initiatives for the Ukraine conflict, the EU is instead gearing up for war with Russia. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov previously noted that the EU is“becoming militarized at a record pace,”and said that there was now“very little difference”between the EU and NATO.",

    "title": "Trump’s first 100 days were ‘worst ever’ – Biden",
    "article_text": "Former US President Joe Biden has criticized the first 100 days in office of his successor, Donald Trump, while dismissing widespread speculation about his own cognitive decline, which was widely seen as the key reason behind his decision to drop out of the race. In an interview with ABC News, Biden gave his take on Trump’s performance, saying“He’s had the worst 100 days any president’s ever had. And I would not say honesty has been his strong point.”His comments come after the end of the three-month period during which political opponents of sitting US presidents typically limit their public criticism. Biden also noted that he was“disappointed but not surprised”by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump, claiming that her race and gender played a role.“They went the sexist route,”he said.“I’ve never seen quite as successful and consistent a campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn’t lead the country – and a woman of mixed race.” Asked whether he believes he could have beaten Trump in 2024, the former president replied,“I do.”He argued that the 2024 presidential race“wasn’t a slam dunk.”Trump secured narrow victories in several key battlegrounds, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Responding to reports alleging cognitive decline in the final year of his presidency, Biden strongly denied the claims.“They are wrong,”Biden said.“There is nothing to sustain that… I said when I got out of the race, I was still going to be president. I think I did a pretty damn good job the last six months.” Speculation about whether Biden was fit for office swirled around him months before the November election, fueled by recurring gaffes. Concerns peaked, however, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June 2024.

She went on to lose the general election to Trump, 312 to 226 in the Electoral College vote.",

    "article_text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un paid a visit to the Russian Embassy in Pyongyang on Friday to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. He used the occasion to reaffirm North Korea’s alliance with Moscow and promised to defend the country from any Western-backed attack, including by“the Kiev neo-Nazis.” Kim placed flowers at the Eternal Flame monument to honor the Soviet soldiers, calling it a tribute to the“heroic lives and feats of the unknown soldiers,”according to the state-run KCNA news agency. He was accompanied by senior officials, including Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui, Defense Minister No Kwang-chol, as well as his daughter. During a lengthy speech, Kim extended greetings to President Vladimir Putin, calling him a“seasoned leader of a powerful state”and his“closest friend and comrade.”He hailed the Soviet Union’s role in defeating Nazi Germany, but said its legacy is under renewed threat. ”The revival of Nazism… is a serious threat that can never be tolerated,”Kim said. Referring to Ukraine’s recent attempts to invade Russian territory, he added,“We condemn this in most vehement and resolute terms as a hysterical action that can be taken only by the Kiev neo-Nazis.” He noted that North Korean troops helped Russia defend Kursk Region from a large-scale Ukrainian incursion, warning that Pyongyang could intervene again under the 2024 comprehensive strategic partnership treaty with Russia. “If the henchmen of the United States and the West, with their tacky, defective munitions, attempt another assault on the Russian Federation… I… will unhesitatingly issue an order on using the armed forces of the DPRK in repelling the enemy’s invasion,”he said. North Korean service members, including several top commanders, were present at the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow, where Putin thanked them for their defense of Kursk Region.",

    "article_text": "India and Pakistan have agreed to cease hostilities, US President Donald Trump has said, adding that a deal was reached following a“long night of talks”mediated by Washington. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has confirmed that a deal was reached but did not mention US involvement. New Delhi has said the truce came into effect at 5 pm local time. “I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire,”Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social on Saturday. He also hailed both sides for demonstrating“common sense and great intelligence.” US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said that the two neighbors had decided to “start talks on a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” According to Rubio, he and US Vice President J.D. Vance were involved in talks with senior Indian and Pakistani officials over the past 48 hours, including Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif, India’s top diplomat, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and Pakistani Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir. Shortly after the announcement, India’s Foreign Ministry said that the heads of military operations of the two nations had agreed to cease all hostilities in a phone call earlier on Saturday initiated by the Pakistani side. Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar took to X to say that“Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect.” The truce follows a brief but rapid military escalation between the two nuclear powers. Earlier this week, New Delhi launched ‘Operation Sindoor’, a series of strikes on suspected terrorist facilities in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The strikes were in retaliation for a terrorist attack in April in the India Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of 26 civilians. The attack was initially claimed by“The Resistance Front”, a group believed to be linked to the Pakistani-based jihadist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba. New Delhi said its investigators had been able to identify communication nodes of terrorists in and to Pakistan. Islamabad has vehemently denied that it had any role in the attack and has called for an impartial probe. Islamabad has condemned India’s actions as a“heinous provocation”and responded with shelling across the Line of Control, the de facto border between the countries in Kashmir, as well as with drone strikes. Late on Friday, Pakistan announced that it had launched a large-scale military operation against India called ‘Bunyan Al Marsoos’ (Unbreakable Wall) in what it called retaliation for the Indian strikes. Strikes targeting Indian military sites ensued.",

    "article_text": "NATO has never offered Ukraine the prospect of joining the bloc as part of any potential settlement of its conflict with Russia, the organization’s secretary general, Mark Rutte, has said. The Ukrainian leadership’s longstanding aim of membership in the US-led military alliance is viewed by Moscow as one of the root causes of the current conflict. “We never agreed that, as part of a peace deal, there would be guaranteed NATO membership for Ukraine,”Rutte said on Friday during a joint press conference with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. He emphasized that Ukraine’s NATO accession had been agreed upon by members of the bloc, but“for the longer term, not for the peace negotiations ongoing at the moment.” At present, NATO and Ukraine maintain close cooperation, Rutte said. He noted that the alliance has a command center in Wiesbaden responsible for coordinating military aid to Ukraine, and that NATO is also working jointly with Kiev to organize training for Ukraine’s armed forces. Earlier this year, Rutte also said“yes”when asked by Bloomberg whether US President Donald Trump had already taken the question of Ukraine’s NATO membership off the table in the ongoing peace efforts. Top Russian officials have on numerous occasions accused the West of intentionally provoking the conflict in Ukraine by disregarding security concerns repeatedly voiced by the Kremlin over NATO’s expansion in Eastern Europe and its growing military cooperation with Kiev. “I believe all of this was deliberately done to create additional conditions to limit our economic growth and contain Russia’s development,”Russian President Vladimir Putin said in 2023. The renunciation of Ukraine’s NATO ambitions remains one of Moscow’s core conditions for a peace agreement, alongside Kiev not acquiring nuclear weapons and recognizing Russia’s new borders. The Kremlin has also consistently cautioned that continued Western military support for Kiev would only prolong the hostilities without changing the outcome.",

    "title": "German spies grant AfD reprieve",
    "article_text": "Germany’s domestic intelligence agency has temporarily suspended its classification of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a“confirmed right-wing extremist”group, pending the outcome of a legal appeal. The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) suspended the label on Thursday and removed a press release about the designation from its website. The classification, which was announced by the BfV last week, was based on a comprehensive report alleging that the AfD promotes policies excluding individuals with migrant backgrounds, particularly Muslims, from full societal participation. The BfV claimed that the party“disregards human dignity”and uses terms such as“knife-wielding migrants”to ascribe violent tendencies to non-European ethnic groups. The AfD leadership condemned the decision as“a severe blow to German democracy”and filed a lawsuit in a Cologne court, arguing that the classification was politically motivated and lacked sufficient evidence. As a result, the BfV temporarily withdrew the classification, but said it would monitor the party as a“suspected case”of an extremist organization. The suspended designation would have empowered the BfV to carry out broad surveillance of the AfD’s activities. The lower-level designation also allows surveillance, but under stricter judicial oversight. AfD co-leaders Alice Weidel and Tino Chrupalla welcomed the temporary suspension, calling it“a first important step”that will help“counter the accusation of right-wing extremism.” The ‘extremist’ label was met with skepticism by many German politicians. Then-German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and incoming Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt warned against banning the AfD. Dobrindt has argued that the party should be made irrelevant through good governance rather than drastic measures. He also insisted on a discussion over the reasons that the AfD has risen to prominence, referring to recent polls indicating that it has become the most popular party in Germany, reaching 26% support. The AfD’s surge has often been attributed to public frustration over the immigration policies of the mainstream parties, as well as economic challenges and perceived government ineffectiveness.",

    "article_text": "Bulgarian President Rumen Radev has openly criticized the EU’s continued military support for Ukraine, warning that Kiev’s path to victory against Russia is“doomed.”He made the remarks in a Facebook post on Friday, timed with Russia’s Victory Day celebrations in Moscow marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Radev called it“the tragedy of our time”that decades after World War II, international disputes in Europe“are once again being resolved by military means.” “Europe does not have its own vision for the end of the [Ukraine conflict] and the establishment of peace, but continues to invest in a cause that, in my opinion, is doomed,”the Bulgarian leader wrote. He added that“pouring more weapons”into Ukraine would not bring peace closer, calling it a“utopian hope”that leads instead to“the opposite – even more victims, destruction and lost territory every day.” Radev also questioned the EU’s goals in prolonging the Ukraine conflict. “Is Europe afraid of the return of peace? Because the return of peace also means returning public attention to the crises that are smoldering within our countries and societies,”he stated, stressing that Europe must learn the lessons of World War II, abandon its militaristic approach, and focus instead on diplomatic solutions. “Europe must remember that unity and prosperity were made possible by joint efforts to eradicate the rivalries, hatred, and disputes that led to the Second World War,”he said. Radev has opposed sending military aid to Kiev and is one of the few EU leaders to speak out against Brussels’ hardline stance against Moscow. He previously warned against prolonging the conflict, dismissing the idea of Ukraine defeating Russia as“impossible,”while urging for peace. Russia has warned against Western military aid to Ukraine, saying it would only drag out the conflict. Moscow offered a 72-hour ceasefire from midnight May 8 to midnight May 11 to mark Victory Day, describing the offer as a humanitarian gesture aimed at paving the way for direct peace talks without preconditions. Ukraine dismissed the overture as“manipulation”and demanded a 30-day ceasefire instead. The Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine launched multiple attacks of various kinds, including four attempted cross-border incursions into the Russian regions of Kursk and Belgorod, following Russia’s ceasefire declaration.",

Nicole Kidman, Sofia Coppola, Kirsten Dunst and Elle Fanning at the Cannes Film Festival. (Photo: AFP) Luxury fashion labels are increasingly reaching beyond the red carpets and exclusive parties of the cinema world, becoming partners with filmmakers and production companies. At the Cannes film festival this year, which starts Tuesday (May 13), labels will be looking to showcase not only their outfits, but also their credibility as investors. Alongside corporate heavyweights such as Chanel and Dior, trendy Paris-based label AMI and its founder Alexandre Mattiussi have linked up with the festival for the first time. AMI is set to present a new award for emerging talent – the Grand Prix AMI Paris – at the secondary Critics’ Week section of the festival. \"We’re going there humbly, in support of cinema and its actors, to accompany artists,\" Mattiussi, who serves as creative director of his brand, told AFP. But AMI has also co-produced several films such as The Beast in 2023 by Bertrand Bonello, starring French actress Lea Seydoux, or Enzo by Robin Campillo which will premiere in Cannes this year. Fashion and cinema are \"in a way, the same job. I also tell stories through clothing. A runway show has a context, music, and this idea of spectacle – it’s a narrative process too,\" added the 44-year-old. But Mattiussi stressed he doesn't \"consider myself a film producer. That would be pretentious.\" \"I don’t get involved in the scripts or creative decisions,\" he said. His label contributed to costumes for The Beast, much like Jonathan Anderson – newly appointed creative director of Dior Homme and formerly at Loewe – did for Luca Guadagnino’s 2024 movie Queer. For years, Anderson’s runway shows have also served as gathering spots for cinema stars, from Timothee Chalamet to Tilda Swinton. Other fashion houses are expanding their presence in the film industry with Saint Laurent running a division devoted entirely to cinema, called Saint Laurent Productions. Run by current artistic director Anthony Vaccarello, the division aims to co-produce two to three films per year. It has already backed works by Paolo Sorrentino (Parthenope), David Cronenberg (The Shrouds), and Jacques Audiard’s 2024 smash hit musical Emilia Perez. Kering, the owner of Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga among others, is also the sponsor of a major Cannes prize – Women in Motion – which recognises figures who \"advance the place of women in cinema and in society\". A post shared by 𝐀𝐌𝐈 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐱𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐫𝐞 𝐌𝐚𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐮𝐬𝐬𝐢 (@amiparis) This year’s winner will be Australian actor Nicole Kidman. L’Oreal, the festival’s official make-up partner for 28 years, also sponsors a prize supporting \"women in cinema\". In return, its logo appears behind stars including Eva Longoria, Helen Mirren, Andie MacDowell, Viola Davis, and Aishwarya Rai. A new sponsor this year will be French carmaker Alpine, which has teamed up with another major parallel section of the Festival, the Directors’ Fortnight. It will be showcasing its sports cars on the water-front boulevard of Cannes known as La Croisette. A post shared by Nicole Kidman (@nicolekidman) Copyright© Mediacorp 2025. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

    "title": "Trump hails 'total reset' in US-China trade relations as talks continue",
    "article_text": "World World President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in front of the West Wing of the White House, May 8, 2025, in Washington. (Photo: AP/Alex Brandon) WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump hailed a \"total reset\" in US-China trade relations,ahead of a second day of talks on Sunday(May 11) between top officials from Washington and Beijing aimed at de-escalating trade tensions sparked by his aggressive tariff rollout. In a Truth Social post early Sunday, Trump praised the \"very good\" discussions and deemed them \"a total reset negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner\". Trump added: \"We want to see, for the good of both China and the US, an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!\" He did not elaborate on the progress. The second day of closed-door meetings between US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng is due to restart in the morning, according to an individual familiar with the talks who was not authorised to speak publicly. \"These talks reflect that the current state of the trade relations with these extremely high tariffs is ultimately in the interests of neither the United States nor China,\" Citigroup global chief economist Nathan Sheets told AFP. The discussions are the first time senior officials from the world's two largest economies have met face-to-face to tackle the thorny topic of trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China last month, sparking robust retaliation from Beijing. The first day of negotiations took place Saturday at the residence of the Swiss ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, a discrete villa with sky blue shutters near a large park on the left bank of Lake Geneva. Going into the meeting, both sides played down expectations of a major change in trade relations, with Bessent saying they would focus on \"de-escalation\" and not a \"big trade deal\", and Beijing insisting the United States must ease tariffs first. A commentary published by China's state news agency Xinhua called the talks \"an important step in promoting the resolution of the issue\". The fact that talks are happening at all \"is good news for business, and for the financial markets\", said Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE). But Hufbauer cautioned he was \"very sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations\", with even a tariff rate of 70 per cent to 80 per cent still potentially halving bilateral trade. China's vice premier went into the discussions buoyed by Friday's news that China's exports rose last month despite the trade war. The unexpected development was attributed by experts to a re-routing of trade to Southeast Asia to mitigate US tariffs. Among some of the more moderate Trump officials like Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, \"there's a realisation that China is better equipped to deal with this trade war than the US\", said Hufbauer. The Geneva meeting comes after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first deal with any country since he unleashed his blitz of sweeping global tariffs. The five-page, non-binding deal confirmed to nervous investors that the United States is willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties, but kept in place a 10 per cent baseline levy on most British goods. Following the US-UK trade announcement, analysts have voiced pessimism about the chances of any significant changes to the US-China trade relationship following the talks in Geneva. \"I think it's quite possible they'll walk away from Geneva saying how constructive and productive the talks were, but not actually reducing tariffs at all,\" Hufbauer said.

    "article_text": "World World Russian President Vladimir Putin gives a statement to the media at the Kremlin in Moscow, on May 11, 2025. (Photo: Reuters/Sergey Bobylev/Host agency RIA Novosti/Handout) MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday (May 11) proposed direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15 that he said should be aimed at achieving a durable peace and eliminating the root causes of the war. The announcement came hours after Kyiv and European leaders called for anunconditional 30-day ceasefireto start Monday. \"We are determined to have serious negotiations ... to eliminate the root causes of the conflict,\" Putin told reporters in a middle of the night statement at the Kremlin. \"We do not exclude that during these talks we will be able to agree on some new ceasefire,\" he added, without directly addressing the call made by the leaders of Ukraine, Britain, France, Germany and Poland for a ceasefire to start Monday. \"It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv. Nevertheless, we are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,\" Putin said. \"Our proposal, as they say, is on the table, the decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their curators, who are guided, it seems, by their personal political ambitions, and not by the interests of their peoples.\" \"We propose to start (negotiations) without delay on Thursday May 15 in Istanbul,\" Putin said, adding that he would talk to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan soon to ask his help to facilitate the talks. Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, triggering the gravest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Russian and Ukrainian negotiators held direct talks in Istanbul in the first weeks of the conflict, but failed to agree to halt the fighting, which has been raging ever since. Tens of thousands have been killed since Russia launched its offensive, with millions forced to flee their homes. Major European powers threw their weight behind an unconditional 30-day Ukraine ceasefire on Saturday, with the backing of US President Donald Trump, and threatened Putin with \"massive\" new sanctions if he did not accept within days. Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly said he wants to end the \"bloodbath\" of the Ukraine war, which his administration casts as a proxy war between the United States and Russia. Former US president Joe Biden, Western European leaders and Ukraine cast the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and repeatedly vowed to defeat Russian forces. Putin on Sunday also accused Ukraine's Western backers of wanting to \"continue war with Russia\" and - without mentioning the specific Ukraine-European proposal for a 30-day ceasefire - slammed European \"ultimatums\" and \"anti-Russian rhetoric\".

    "article_text": "Entertainment Style & Beauty Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Obsessions Living Singapore People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty People Dining Dining Dining Singapore Travel Singapore Singapore Wellness Wellness The paper linked phthalates, commonly found in plastics, to 350,000 deaths globally. But the data come with caveats. (Art: The New York Times/Chang W Lee) The news made for an alarming headline recently: Research showed that common chemicals in plastics were associated with 350,000 heart disease deaths across the world in 2018. The statistic came from a studypublished in the journal eBioMedicine. The authors, a group of researchers at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine, estimated that roughly 13 per cent of cardiovascular deaths among 55- to 64-year-olds worldwide that year could be attributed to phthalates, which are used in food packaging, shampoo, toys and more. Research on the effect of phthalates on cardiovascular disease is still emerging, but their link to metabolic risk factors like obesity suggests they could play a role in heart disease. While experts agree that phthalates are harmful, they cautioned that the study relied on complex statistical modelling and a series of assumptions and estimates that make it difficult to determine how many deaths might be linked to the chemicals. “This is an early step of trying to understand the magnitude of the problem,” said Dr Mark Huffman, a cardiologist and a co-director of the global health centre at WashU Medicine in St Louis. But, he added, there’s a need for far more studies to understand the relationship between phthalates and heart health, and what other factors might come into play. Phthalates are found in personal care products like shampoos and lotions, as well as in food containers and packaging. It’s possible to ingest them through food, absorb them through the skin from products containing them or breathe them in as dust. Studies have shown that phthalates are endocrine disrupters, meaning that they can interfere with our hormones. They have been associated with negative effects on reproductive health, pregnancy and birth issues. Some studies have shown an association between phthalates and cardiovascular disease, but there isn’t strong evidence to show that the chemicals directly cause heart issues, said Sung Kyun Park, a professor of epidemiology and environmental sciences at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. There is evidence that phthalates increase the risk of metabolic disorders like obesity and Type 2 diabetes, which can cause cardiovascular disease. One way phthalates may do this is by increasing oxidative stress–cell and tissue damage that happens when there are too many unstable molecules in the body–and by promoting inflammation, said Dr Leonardo Trasande, senior author of the new paper and a professor of paediatricsand population health at NYU. In the latest study, researchers attempted to quantify global cardiovascular deaths attributable specifically to one type of phthalate, known as DEHP. One of the most widely used and studied phthalates, DEHP is found in vinyl products including tablecloths, shower curtains and flooring. The researchers relied on estimates from previous research for several measures: Phthalate exposures, the risk of such exposures on cardiovascular deaths and the global burden of cardiovascular disease. They then calculated the share of deaths attributable to phthalate exposures in different countries, Dr Trasande said. The Middle East, South Asia, East Asia and the Pacific accounted for nearly three-quarters of these deaths. This was an observational study that showed a correlation between estimated exposure to the chemical and disease at the population level. Experts said that the methods used were not unusual for studies that model global disease, but that such studies come with caveats. For example, Dr Huffman said, the estimates from the literature that the authors relied on in their calculations may themselves have incorporated some bias or confounding variables, such as socioeconomic status or dietary behaviours, that could relate both to plastic exposure and to cardiovascular disease rates. “A pretty important part of the result of the model is what you put into the model,” Dr Huffman said. The study also relied on an earlier analysis by Dr Trasande to estimate the risk of cardiovascular death from phthalate exposure, after controlling for other known risk factors. Butthatpaperonly examined US patients, which means it might not be possible to generalise the results to a global population, where dietary habits, cigarette smoke exposure, physical activity and other cardiovascular risk factors may vary. What’s clear from the study, experts said, is that we need more research on phthalate exposure and the associated health risks. Though it would be ethically impossible and impractical to do a classic randomised trial, in which one group of people were exposed to phthalates and others were not and they were followed for many years, other types of studies could help more clearly establish a link. One way, Dr Park said, would be to have researchers recruit a large, representative sample of patients, measure their levels of exposure and follow them for years, perhaps until death. Dr Huffman suggested it would also be worthwhile to try out strategies that might reduce exposure levels and then measure any changes in health outcomes. Tracey Woodruff, director of the programme on reproductive health and the environment at the University of California, San Francisco, said that despite the uncertainties in the estimates of the current paper, it is clear that phthalates can increase the risks of preterm birth, reproductive issues and metabolic disorders. To her, the findings only add to the list of reasons to reduce the amount of phthalates in the supply chain.

    "title": "What can you do about tinnitus? How to manage that persistent ringing in your ears when a cure isn’t possible",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Style & Beauty Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Obsessions Living Singapore People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty People Dining Dining Dining Singapore Travel Singapore Singapore Wellness Wellness There aren’t many cures for people who hear phantom ringing or buzzing noises – but there are ways to manage the condition. (Art: The New York Times/Eric Helgas) Tinnitus is the experience of hearing phantom noises, typically in the form of ringing, buzzing or roaring sounds. It is a common and usually harmless condition. According to a2024 analysis, about 11 per cent of American adults experience tinnitus, and 41 per cent of them hear noises constantly rather than intermittently. But can you make it go away? It’s rare for tinnitus to be cured, but a person’s prognosis depends on what is causing the symptoms. Even if it’s not curable, “there are a lot of good ways to manage it,” said Dr Mohamed Elrakhawy, an ear, nose and throat (or ENT) doctor at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Tinnitus can have a variety of causes, said Dr Zachary Schwam, an ENT at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Sometimes, he said, it can be a result oftumours,nerve problems, asymmetries in veins,holes inorfluid behindthe eardrums, earwax or damage to the bones behind the eardrums. In these cases, it’s typical for tinnitus to occur in only one ear, and it can sometimes resemble the sound of a heartbeat. If your tinnitus presents this way, it’s important to get it checked out by a doctor, Dr Schwam said. But most of the time, tinnitus is a harmless byproduct of hearing loss, said Dr Kenny F Lin, an ENT at Houston Methodist Hospital. “The hair cells of the cochlear nerve endings are damaged and send an altered signal to the brain, which is perceived as a ringing, humming, buzzing or static sound,” he said. People who are regularly exposed to loud noises are also more likely to develop tinnitus, Dr Schwam said. “Enjoy your concerts, enjoy your work, but just make sure you’re using the proper ear protection,” he said. Often, tinnitus is a minor annoyance that becomes less bothersome over time. But in some cases, it can become debilitating, interfering with the ability to work and sleep, Dr Elrakhawy said. Tinnitus has been linked withanxiety, depressionand, in rare cases, evensuicide. Stress, anxiety and lack of sleep can make tinnitus worse, Dr Schwam said. “I often tell people that those things are not necessarily causing your tinnitus, but they’re certainly not helping,” he said. To determine the cause of tinnitus, a doctor will ask about a person’s clinical history and perform a physical exam. “If it’s only one ear or in both ears, if it’s all the time or comes and goes, if there are certain triggers or situations that make it worse–those all really do help focus on what the next step would be,” Dr Elrakhawy said. A doctor is likely to suggest a hearing test and may also request other types of tests, including MRI or CT scans. If tinnitus is caused by a bone, nerve or circulatory issue, then treating the underlying problem may cure it, Dr Schwam said. But if hearing loss is the cause, then treatments can improve symptoms but may not eliminate them, he said. Typically, tinnitus treatments for people with hearing loss are aimed at reducing the impact on their daily lives, particularly on sleep and their ability to work, Dr Lin said. One popular approach, he said, involves listening to masking sounds such aswhite noise, ocean or rain sounds, music and the sounds of fans or humidifiers, which can make tinnitus less noticeable. “As long as the brain is able to hear outside sounds, it is less likely to hear the inside sounds,” he said. A hearing aid may also help if a person’s hearing loss is significant enough to warrant one. “Hearing aids amplify sounds that you no longer hear well, so it is essentially a masking device that you wear throughout the day,” Dr Lin said. Some hearing aids even have special tinnitus masking settings that may feed certain frequencies into the ear to optimise masking. Counseling and other forms of therapy can help, too. “We often meet patients that suffer terribly from tinnitus and the negative impact on mood, including anxiety and depression,” said Dr C Matthew Stewart, an ENT at Johns Hopkins Medicine. But when physicians explain what’s going on and assure patients that their tinnitus isn’t dangerous, it can help them cope better, Dr Schwam said. Some patients benefit fromcognitive behavioural therapy, a form of psychotherapy that can help people better manage their symptoms, or fromtinnitus retraining therapy, which involves counselling along with sound therapy. If you’re experiencing tinnitus, talk to your primary care provider or ask for a referral to an ENT or audiologist who treats tinnitus, Dr Elrakhawy said. Although there are many over-the-countersupplements andeardropsmarketed as tinnitus treatments, he doesn’t know of any that are shown to work. Some of Dr Schwam’s patients have brought over-the-counter eardrops containing heavy metals to their appointments, asking if they might help. “I take a look at the drops, and they have ingredients that I would never put in a human body,” he said.

    "title": "What returning home to care for my mum after my father's death taught me about love and loss",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Style & Beauty Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Wellness Obsessions Living Singapore People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty People Dining Dining Dining Singapore Travel Singapore Singapore Women Women After her father died, writer Genevieve Jiang returned home to support her mother through grief. But in doing so, she found herself learning how to live alongside her – not just as a daughter, but as a caregiver and companion through life’s quiet transitions. After her father’s death, writer Genevieve Jiang (right) moved home to support her mother through her grief. (Photo: Genevieve Jiang) This audio is generated by an AI tool. When my father died in July last year, I found myself entering a new chapter with my mother we weren’t quite prepared for. In those early days, there were bills to pay, probate paperwork to file, and endless administrative matters to sort through. We were practical, composed. But beneath that quiet efficiency was agriefthat neither of us quite knew how to navigate. My mum had leaned on my dad for over 52 years – emotionally, logistically, financially. After he died, I knew she would need support. I decided to move back home – not out of obligation, but instinct – after staying on my own for more than a decade. We had always been close. While living on my own, I visited them every weekend. We spoke regularly – about what to cook, what to watch, what needed doing that weekend. The everyday kind of closeness. But this was different. This was daily proximity, emotional weight, and the delicate challenge of staying present for someone else while holding space for your own sorrow. Grief has a way of stirring all kinds of emotions. I found myself aching, not just for my dad, but for the quiet expectations that came with caregiving. There were moments – small, sharp ones – when I wished my efforts were more seen, or acknowledged. I was grieving too. But in our family, love is rarely spoken aloud. It comes through doing – through meals prepared, errands run, presence offered. And I had to learn to accept that. Still, we connected in small, significant ways. We sorted through photos, reliving old stories in silence. And then there was the day I took Mum for a walk at East Coast Park – her first visit there in years. I nudged her gently, hoping it might help lift her spirits, even if just for a while. She grumbled about the distance – “So far! Are we there yet?” – but surprised me by climbing onto a stationary bike along the path, her face lighting up like a child trying something new. That moment, fleeting as it was, felt like the start of something. A shift, however slight. The beginning of showing up for each other differently. These days, I no longer live with her full-time. I spend weekdays at her place – working from a home office I’ve set up – and return to my own flat on weekends. It’s a rhythm that emerged slowly, and for now, it holds. Leaving my full-time job to care for my dad after he was diagnosed with cancer just weeks before he passed was never meant to be permanent. But life has a way of rearranging itself. What began as a short-term change has become a quieter, steadier way of being. Living with my mum again after more than a decade on my own came with its share of adjustments. I wanted to be there for her – to cushion the hardest parts – but I also had to learn how to carve out space for myself. There were legal matters to manage, banking apps she couldn’t navigate, moments when I felt like a personal assistant. And yet, there were also moments of deep tenderness. She began planning simple meals whenever I stayed over, making sure I ate right – as if I were still a teenager. She made an effort not to comment on my habits, like working late nights, even when she clearly disapproved. I recognised these gestures for what they were: Her way of loving me in the only language she’s ever known – care, routine, presence. Growing up, she had always been the steady one. My father, though devoted, had a temper. I was a headstrong teen, often clashing with him. My mum stood between us more times than I can count. As I grew older, I saw how she showed up in quieter ways – preparing food after a long day, sitting with me after personal and professional setbacks, never prying but always there. Now our roles have reversed. I nudge her gently to keep trying new things, whether it’s joining a support group activity, or figuring out how to use an app. I’ve learnt to meet her where she is, instead of where I think she should be. Progress is slow, but every step forward – no matter how small – matters. Our evenings have become a quiet ritual. After dinner, she’ll sit with me as I unwind with aNetflixshow. “Why are your shows always so violent?” she’ll ask. Or, “I have no idea what’s going on.” I’ll end up giving her a running commentary, pausing now and then to explain who’s who, or why someone just got stabbed. She’ll nod, half-listening, sometimes pulling up her own show on her phone while mine plays in the background. But she stays. And in her staying, I hear everything she doesn’t say. In this part of the world, the idea of leaving one’s parents to live out their old age alone can still feel unthinkable. Cultural expectations around filial piety run deep. But as families evolve and our lives grow more complex, so too do the ways we care. For me, the question was never whether to be there for my mum. It was how to do so in a way that honours her dignity, while also protecting my own sense of self. My father’s example helped shape that. He was never demonstrative, but his devotion was steadfast. He rose before dawn every day to drive us to school, saved quietly and spent sparingly. His love was in the details. In many ways, I now understand caregiving the same way – not as grand gestures, but as the act of staying. Sitting beside someone when it matters. Carrying the load when they can’t. Being present, even when it’s unglamorous. Especially when it’s unglamorous – like setting up her Singpass account, accompanying her to the lawyer’s office to sign a single document, or going through paperwork she can’t quite make sense of. This has been a season of grief and transition, but also of growth. We’ve had our share of difficult days, fights and friction, but we’ve also learnt how to just be. How to honour the past without being stuck in it. How to sit with each other in the present, no matter how ordinary. I don’t know what the next season will look like. But I do know this: For all the complexities ofmother-daughter relationships, for all the things left unsaid – there’s something profoundly healing in learning to show up for each other. In the end, it’s not always about fixing, or saving, or changing. Sometimes, love just looks like staying the course. Quietly. Faithfully. Together.

    "title": "This home in Singapore puts the spotlight on the owner’s extensive art collection",
    "article_text": "Dining Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Obsessions Obsessions The quirky architecture of this house in Singapore is as much an attraction as the art collection inside. Next to the staircase is Kwodrent's Arrangement in Monochrome installation; above the television is an artwork by Syagini Ratna Wulan. (Photo: Finbarr Fallon) This audio is generated by an AI tool. It was with delight that I encountered an artwork by local artist Dawn Ng the moment I stepped into this inter-terrace house. The archival pigment print Some Will Fall In Love With Life And Drink It From A Fountain That Is Pouring Like An Avalanche Coming Down The Mountain from her Clocks series offers a Technicolor punch to a white wall. Is it a rainbow mountain or a coloured-in pebble, writ large? The artwork itself is enigmatic but what strikes me more is the insouciant juxtaposition of the chromatic picture with colourful baskets atop an antique timber cabinet as if to say: Art, like a piece of furniture or even tableware, should be enjoyed without inhibition in a home. The home in question belongs to a 40-something medical professional who prefers to be unnamed. Art is her passion and here in this dwelling designed by Wu Yen Yen, the founder of Genome Architects, she can finally display many pieces that had for a time been stored away. Both client and architect were secondary school classmates and so working together on the house was casual and inhibited. “I sat next to her in class! It was a fun collaboration. It’s my first time building a house, but Yen Yen knew what I wanted and made the process easy,” said the homeowner, who had grown up in Serangoon, and sought to build a house here. The brief? To design a three-storey house to enjoy her art collection and pets in, and to future-proof it for her parents to eventually consider moving in to live with her, shared Wu. The pets are two cats that happily roam this spacious abode. The parents have not moved in yet even at the request of their filial daughter but after visiting the home, they are giving it serious contemplation. The art is a vital part of the narrative. The homeowner began collecting about 20 years ago, starting with Australian Aboriginal paintings and textiles. “I was always drawn to ethnic and tribal designs and crafts, as well as contemporary sculptural and 3D pieces,” she explained, adding that she usually sources from local galleries and art fairs. Not surprisingly, gallery owners have become close acquaintances. “Friends like Stephanie Fong from FOST Gallery and Richard Koh from Richard Ho Fine Art (RKFA) came by and gave suggestions on how to display some of the pieces,” said the homeowner.One such advice was the placement of Kwodrent’s Arrangement in Monochrome installation next to the staircase. Being at eye level, one can come up close to scrutinise the acrylic polypropylene loop pins and polyamide cable ties ‘bouquets’. “The art installer also gave great ideas on where to hang certain works,” said the homeowner. “I also wanted to display most of the bigger art works because I had limited storage space.” The house is a perfect foil for the art without pandering to the white cube art gallery typology. It is ‘art-in-house’ in the manner of mixing the elemental and prosaic, such as an abstract piece by Indonesian artist Syagini Ratna Wulan above the television. But Wu’s architecture also makes this project ‘house-as-art’. Firstly, the building looks nothing like its neighbours – a Spanish-style, terracotta roof and vanilla-walled building on one side, and an uncharacteristic white box on the other. Its facade is a considered jumble of features not typically associated with domestic architecture, particularly a two-storey, arched brick surface with arched screen doors and a three-storey glass curved wall that fronts a spiral staircase. The former is stoic, suggestive of ecclesiastical structures and blocks out the sun; the latter is fluid, transparent and lets in copious daylight. The pairing is unorthodox but then again, as Wu explained, the homeowner was most happy to explore unexpected materials, forms and colours. “I’ve always liked brickwork, geometry and pattern, clean lines and quirky designs,” she said. “I told Yen Yen that I wanted a house with good natural light, is well crafted and easy to clean. I also wanted a spiral staircase, and she delivered!” Wu approached the design of the outside and inside differently. “Externally, the vaulted roof, which continues into the attic, the brick wall and screen, and the circular glass staircase, establishes a strong visual identity in its play of formal composition, depth and tactility,” she said. In contrast, distinct volumes and voids in clean, solid, neutral colours come together to create a “quiet” three-storey interior, where art can be meaningfully displayed throughout, and the inhabitants can feel peaceful. Apart from many white surfaces, a colour-block of moss green on the first storey frames the entrance door, and hides the powder room door and a foldaway staircase to a mezzanine-cum-store room. It extends to define the kitchen joinery at the rear of the house where full-length glass doors open to the backyard. There is terrazzo too (cladding the pantry counter on the second storey), and metal framing the fenestration. Inside the house, white metal mesh is used for the balustrades and flooring at parts. “They are expressed as lightweight and porous so that the connective areas are not visually broken up,” Wu highlighted. This is also genius in enhancing light and airflow through the narrow section, and allowing the artwork to be seen from the different levels. Along the left party wall, Wu has designed parts of the house to be entirely see-through from the front to rear, as well as from the first storey up to the attic level where the homeowner has her bedroom and an art storeroom. This wall is where the homeowner mounts her largest pieces: Yeoh Choo Kuan’s Sun Rays Through the Clouds, Sabri Idrus’ Flux, Wayan Novi’s Tropical Happiness #2 and Khairulddin Wahab’s In the Margins. She chose to place these colourful pieces facing her parents’ room. They become the view through large swivel doors that double as canvases with art hook incorporated into them. These doors are part of a future-proofing strategy, explained Wu. Inside the parents’ large en-suite bedroom are sliding doors that provide the option of creating two adjoining private rooms, connected to a potential caregiver’s room toward the front of the house. The second storey and attic have open spaces that overlook the tall void like internal terraces. Here, cabinets exhibit the homeowner’s other curiosities, such as an amazing collection of baskets collected from travels, auctions, thrift stores and flea markets. “I’ve always found weaving to be a fascinating craft, as it requires significant mathematical skills and a great memory,” said the homeowner. Her dogged passion saw her hunting down Werregue baskets woven by local indigenous communities of Colombia where she travelled to a few years ago. “The weaving technique was unlike any I had seen. I spent the entire trip looking out for them and luckily, found some on the last day,” she shared. Sometimes, the pieces come to her in star-matched ways, as she recounted: “One of the first baskets I collected, which is still one of my favourites, is the huge Lombok basket that I got from the previous tenant of a black-and-white rental home in the Seletar airbase. I had always wanted one and it came together with the first place I stayed on my own!” On the third storey is another wondrous collection displayed on open shelves, of Isan betal nut boxes that the homeowner purchased over the years from a good friend who runs Isan Gallery in Singapore. “I generally gravitate towards geometric designs and I like how some of the boxes have seemingly ‘modern’ motifs but are actually more than 50 years old.” Wu highlighted that while the house was designed to display art, it was also meant to be functional. For example, the front elevation screens shield from the southwest-facing sunlight. She used solar simulation to inform some of her design decisions, such as where to place a triple-volume space (the front of the house) and windows to mitigate stack effect, enhance air movement, and frame views. Being a transitional space, the spiral staircase was also placed here as a solar buffer. “We have designed this circular staircase to be as lightweight as possible, so that it is a see-through sculptural form that is backlit from the inside while still letting in abundant indirect natural light,” Wu elaborated on the design. The curved windows at the front next to the spiral staircase can be slid open to help create airy interiors. This is a crazy detail, I commented as I observed the curved sliding tracks. Wu agreed that it was difficult to both design and construct. “We also overlapped glass pieces at the higher areas so that the stairwell can be constantly ventilated passively. Considering the steps, landings, material sizes, dimensional tolerances and need for structural rigidity, working with curved glass, curved steel and a curved staircase.” On how the house has met her expectations, the homeowner commented: “It has a lot of natural light and volumes of space, which give greater visual impact to the artwork. Friends have remarked that the house has good curb appeal, an interesting internal layout and the spiral staircase gets great reviews!” With more space for her art, she would love to add “a sculpture by Kim Lim, an ecriture by Park Seo Bo and a basket by Jeremy Frey”. So far, none of the artists whose work she has in her home have visited but I would like to think they would be more than happy to pay a visit and see their art bringing joy to both the home and homeowner.

    "title": "Commentary: As Filipinos prepare to vote, ex-president Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest is dividing families",
    "article_text": "Commentary Commentary President Ferdinand Marcos Jr is facing resentment from Duterte's supporters as well as a challenge from his own sister, Senator Imee Marcos, says this political science professor. BANGKOK: It’s been two months since former Philippine presidentRodrigo Duterte was arrestedand handed over to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to face potential prosecution for crimes against humanity. Duterte’s arrest has angered his supporters and caused polarisation to worsen in the lead-up to important parliamentary elections on May 12. The election could be a referendum on the current president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, whose approval rating fell to 25 per cent in March after Duterte’s arrest. It had been 42 per cent a month earlier. Duterte’s daughter, Vice President Sara Duterte, meanwhile, has seen her approval rating increase to 59 per cent, despite the fact she wasimpeached by the House of Representativesearlier this year for threatening to assassinate Marcos. Some of Marcos’ former allies are now drifting towards Sara Duterte, potentially setting her up for a successful run for the presidency herself in 2028. Marcos is not only dealing with the resentment of some segments of the public, he’s also facing a challenge from his own sister, Imee Marcos, a senator. Imee Marcos conducted several hearings in the Senate to probe into the procedures followed by the national police and other government agencies in implementing Duterte’s arrest warrant, which had been issued through Interpol. Right from the start, she denounced Duterte’s surrender to the ICC as a violation of the Philippine constitution and the country’s sovereignty. She asserted the court did not have jurisdiction over the Philippines after it withdrew from the Rome Statute in 2019. In a press conference on Apr 29, Imee Marcos announced a Senate committee is recommending the filing of criminal charges against the head of the Department of Justice and other officials who arrested and turned him over to the ICC. On May 7, the ombudsman asked these officials to respond to the Senate committee complaint within 10 days. Imee Marcos has political motivations of her own for acting in this way. She is seeking another term herself and has been trailing in public opinion polls. To make the political machinations even more complex, Sara Duterte has now endorsed Imee Marcos’ bid for re-election. Some of Duterte’s supporters, however, have been sceptical about Marcos’ motives in conducting the hearings. Though Duterte’s arrest has dominated the headlines in the Philippines, it’s unclear whether Marcos’ declining popularity as president is tied solely to this incident. Many Filipinos supported Duterte’s arrest, according to one poll in March. And Marcos’ government has also been criticised for the state of the economy. But at least one observer has pointed to the Duterte family’s effective use of TikTok to control the narrative around his arrest, portraying it as a kidnapping. Sara Duterte has recently claimed her name is on the ICC prosecutor’s list of those who will be arrested next. It is also important to note Duterte’s supporters have resorted to the dissemination of fake news and disinformation against the Marcos administration. His supporters have also aimed their attacks on the ICC pre-trial judges, as well as victims of the drugs war during Duterte’s time in office. The outcome of the elections in the Philippines next week will no doubt have short- and medium-term implications for the country’s politics. First, if all nine of the Senate candidates backed by the Marcos administration win, they would expand his bloc of supporters in the chamber. This bloc may then vote to convict Sara Duterte when her impeachment case moves to a Senate trial. If she’s convicted, she would be banned from running for president in 2028. But it’s uncertain if two-thirds of senators would vote to convict – the threshold necessary for impeachment. Some pro-Marcos and independent senators may be wary of antagonising loyal Duterte supporters. If Sara Duterte is acquitted, this would likely only boost her bid for the presidency. The ICC’s pre-trial chamber will hold a hearing in September that will be watched closely by pro- and anti-Duterte forces in the Philippines. On May 8, the chamber rejected a petition filed by Duterte’s defence team to excuse two judges over alleged bias. His loyal supporters will likely increase their attacks against the ICC, the victims of Duterte’s drugs war, and the Marcos administration through the use of fake news and disinformation as the trial progresses. If Duterte is convicted by the court prior to the 2028 election, it will certainly be used as a campaign issue by both sides, too. And this will only further worsen polarisation in the Philippines.

I tried to move around the ball. \"At times it went very well, at times it could have been better, yes, but in any case, it doesn't matter about the result today. It has been a remarkable day for me, so I'm very happy.\" The Italian said he was surprised about how well his game felt after the layoff, as he extended his tour-level winning streak to 22 matches. \"I was surprised how things can (feel good) so quickly. I tried to give everything I have. I think that's the only thing I can do and that's the only thing I can control right now,\" Sinner said. \"The sensation felt quite good, to be honest. Of course, there were some ups and downs, that is normal, but (Navone) played some great tennis, especially when he broke me in the second set. \"I tried to accept that and tried to work again. Now I have some good feedback, and hopefully I can work with that.\" Sinner will next face lucky loser Jesper de Jong.

    "title": "European leaders tell Putin to agree to Ukraine ceasefire or face new sanctions",
    "article_text": "World World From left, Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his wife Olena Zelenska, French President Emanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Maidan Square in Kyviv, Ukraine, Saturday May 10, 2025 as European leaders meet for talks. (Stefan Rousseau, Pool Photo via AP) KYIV: Major European powers threw their weight behind an unconditional 30-day Ukraine ceasefire on Saturday (May 10), with thebacking of US President Donald Trump, and threatened President Vladimir Putin with \"massive\" new sanctions if he did not accept within days. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Ukraine set the start of the ceasefire for May 12 at ameeting in Kyiv, during which they held a phone call with Trump. \"So all of us here together with the US are calling Putin out. If he is serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a press conference. \"No more ifs and buts, no more conditions and delays.\" Soon after the European leaders' announcement, the Kremlin appeared to pour scorn on it. \"We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Interfax. Peskov was later quoted by the state TASS news agency as saying that Russia would consider the ceasefire proposal, while Moscow has its own position. Western sanctions against Russia have been toughened repeatedly since its full-scale invasion in 2022, without ending the war. But following through on the threat would be a sign of growing Western unity after months of unpredictability in US policy since Trump's return to the White House in January. After engaging directly with Russian officials, clashing publicly with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and briefly cutting vital military aid to Kyiv, Washington has patched up ties with Ukraine and signed an agreement giving the US preferential access to new Ukrainian minerals deals. Trump, who did not immediately comment publicly on the European leaders' remarks, has also signalled frustration with what Washington views as Putin's foot-dragging over a ceasefire. \"In the event that the ceasefire is violated, massive sanctions will be prepared, in coordination between the Europeans and the United States,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. By imposing new sanctions, the White House would be aligning itself more closely with Western Europe, which has been rattled by a trade war in which Trump has imposed tariffs on them and other countries and has suggested he might not come to the defence of NATO allies that underspend on their defence. Zelenskyy said he and the visiting leaders had agreed the unconditional ceasefire must start on Monday and cover air, sea and land. If Russia refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors, he said. The leaders later issued a joint statement summing up the contents of the proposed 30-day ceasefire and saying its main purpose was \"to make room for diplomacy\". They welcomed support for the proposal from both Europe and the United States and said that if Russia sought to apply conditions, \"this can only be considered as an effort to prolong the war and undermine diplomacy\". Peskov had been quoted as saying on Friday that Russia supported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of \"nuances\". In remarks to US broadcaster ABC broadcast earlier on Saturday, Peskov had suggested Western military assistance for Ukraine must stop for a temporary ceasefire to take effect. \"Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine,\" he said. Macron said that if the ceasefire went ahead, it would be monitored mainly by the US and European countries would contribute. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now a senior security official, derided the idea of giving Russia an option between being sanctioned or giving Ukrainian forces an opportunity to rebuild. \"Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses!\" he wrote on X. The European leaders said the terms of a peace deal would be negotiated during the 30-day pause in fighting. \"We have no illusions that the ceasefire will be breached,\" Zelenskyy said. On the eve of the summit, the US embassy in Kyiv warned of a \"potentially significant\" air attack in the coming days. When the European leaders arrived in Kyiv by train on Saturday, a screen on the platform announced the arrival of the \"Bravery Express\". Zelenskyy accompanied them as they paid their respects at a Kyiv memorial honouring Ukrainian soldiers killed in the war. The visit falls on the final day of a May 8-10 ceasefire declared by Putin that Ukraine did not accept, denouncing it as a sham. Both sides have accused each other of violating it. Reuters journalists at a field hospital near the front line in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region saw soldiers being brought in with combat injuries sustained since the Russian ceasefire began. \"There hasn’t been any ceasefire, shelling has continued just as before, drones are flying just like before, the same with explosives being dropped. Nothing has changed at all,\" said a wounded soldier who gave his name as Stanislav.

    "title": "Hamas releases video of two Israeli hostages alive in Gaza",
    "article_text": "World World Demonstrators light a bonfire during a protest demanding a cease-fire deal and the immediate release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip, Saturday, May 10, 2025, in Tel Aviv, Israel. (Photo: AP/Oded Balilty) JERUSALEM:Hamas's armed wing released a video on Saturday (May 10) showing two Israeli hostages alive in the Gaza Strip, with one of the two men calling to end the 19-month-long war. The pair were identified by the Hostages and Missing Families Forum campaign group as Elkana Bohbot and Yosef Haim Ohana, who were kidnapped during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war. The undated three-minute video footage released by Hamas's Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades shows one of the hostages, 36-year-old Bohbot, visibly weak and lying on the floor wrapped in a blanket. The second hostage, Ohana, 24, speaks in Hebrew urging the Israeli government to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of all remaining captives - a similar message to statements made by other hostages, likely under duress, in previous videos released by Hamas. In a statement, Bohbot's family said that \"Elkana and Yosef are crying out to be saved. While all the people of Israel hear their calls, a handful of decision-makers refuse to listen,\" echoing criticism of the Israeli government for failing to bring back the hostages. \"How much more can we bear? How much more can they endure? The fact that they are still there is a disgrace,\" the family said. Late Saturday, Israeli demonstrators calling for the release of the hostages and an end of the war gathered outside the defence ministry headquarters in the coastal city of Tel Aviv. AFP images showed some protesters holding pictures of the hostages and placards that read \"we can save the rest\" and \"all of them now\". Bohbot, a Colombian-Israeli, was seen bound and injured in the face in footage from the day of the Hamas attack, and his family have expressed concern about his health. Bohbot and Ohana, both abducted by Palestinian militants from the site of a music festival, are among 58 hostages held in Gaza since the 2023 attack, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead. Hamas also holds the remains of an Israeli soldier killed in a 2014 war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that the fate of three hostages presumed alive was unclear, without naming them. \"We know with certainty that 21 hostages are alive ... and there are three others whose status, sadly, we do not know,\" Netanyahu said in a video shared on his Telegram channel. Israel resumed its military offensive across the Gaza Strip on March 18, after a two-month truce that saw the release of dozens of hostages. Since the ceasefire collapsed, Hamas has released several videos of hostages, including of the two appearing in Saturday's video. Israel says the renewed offensive aims to force Hamas to free the remaining captives, although critics charge that it puts them in mortal danger. Hamas's October 2023 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. The health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said on Saturday that at least 2,701 people have been killed since Israel resumed its campaign in Gaza, bringing the overall death toll since the war broke out to 52,810.

    "title": "Take a Closer Look at Maluma’s $5 Million Met Gala Watch",
    "article_text": "Malumasure knows how to make an entrance. Dressed in a custom, effervescent zoot suit from designerWilly Chavarria, the Colombian singer rocked up to the Met Gala with aJacob & Co.Billionaire III Emeralds on his wrist. Similar to the watchworn by Usher at last year’s ceremony, it features hundreds upon hundreds of precious stones and a skeletonized, hand-wound tourbillon movement. In addition to its complex caliber, whose bridges arealsoset with emeralds, it also boasts an integrated, gem-set bracelet. Guinness World Records needs to establish a category for the largest collection of emeralds to adequately honor this timepiece. We get used to seeing mind-blowing, high-end fare at places likeWatches and Wondersandcourtside, but the sheer number of emeralds dripping off this piece—714 natural, no-heat stones weighing nearly 148 carats—is difficult to comprehend. Of course, it’s par for the course for jewelerJacob Arabo(aka “Jacob the Jeweler”), whose wares have been gracing the wrists of A-list rappers, singers, and actors for decades. Arabo’s love of precious stones (particularly diamonds) resulted in the first Billionaire, a pièce unique that debuted in 2016. Since then, Billionaire has spawned a larger collection available in diamond-, ruby-, and emerald-set iterations. Jacob & Co. didn’t use just any emeralds on Maluma’s watch, either. They are sourced directly from the city Muzo in the singer’s native Colombia. Muzo just so happens to be known as the world capital of emerald mines, which made them a perfect match for Maluma’s watch. Everything about this watch is made to highlight the precious stones that adorn its every crevice. That being said, however, it still boasts an impressive degree horological savoir faire: The hand-wound JCAM39 movement is fitted with thin, white gold bridges and set with 57 emeralds—using a harder, more traditional material would’ve made gem-setting impossible. These bridges suspend a one-minutetourbillonand its barrel in vertical alignment in the center of the transparent dial, giving the impression that the movement componentry is floating in space. With 72 hours of power reserve and 167 components, the JCAM39 has more than enough Swiss clout to impress even the most jaded of watch nerds. Beyond the movement, the Billionaire III Emeralds’ 54mm x 40mm rectangular case is fashioned from white gold and set with 76 emerald-cut emeralds and one rose-cut ruby. An inner bezel is set withanother76 stones, while the integrated bracelet boasts no fewer than 504 emerald-cut emeralds. All together, the natural stones weigh in at nearly 148 carats. A pièce unique with a $5M price tag, it’s the type of watch tailor-made for garnering attention at an occasion as special and prestigious as theMet Gala. (Granted, you’d probably elicit our attention if you wore this watchanywhere, but why waste it on a trip to the supermarket?) Jacob & Co. has always been a brand of kings.Maluma, one of the world’s best-selling Latin artists, fits the bill perfectly. Hamilton’sRichard Mille74-02 is an automatically-wound, ultra-skeletonized tourbillon with a 18K 5N red gold baseplate and 18K 3N yellow gold bridges. The unique look of Hamilton’s watch is largely thanks to painstaking creation of the case. Those stripes result from stacks and stacks of ultra-thin quartz brought together through heat and pressurization. The striations develop naturally through the process. Not happy with that already complicated development, Richard Mille then adds in 22-carat pink gold leaves. Is this watch the next beloved RM piece?Pharrell wore the same model to Monday’s Met Gala. Philadelphia Eagles quarterbackJalen Hurtsrocked a solid-gold Breitling Super Chronomat B01 44 to the Time 100 event in New York last weekend. A far cry from the stainless steel fare that the brand famously made for pilots during the early-to-mid-20th century, this impressive hunk of precious metal nevertheless features the complication that madeBreitlinga household name: the humblechronograph. Measuring 44 mm in 18K red gold, it’s got a matching bracelet, a chocolate brown dial with a triple-register layout, and a chronometer-certified, automatic movement. (It’s also got a rotating timing bezel and 200m of water resistance, so if you suddenly found yourself in need of a dive watch in a pinch, the Super Chronomat would be up for that job, too.) Yuki Tsunoda, a driver on Red Bull’s F1 team, wore one of thehottest watches of Watches and Wonders ‘25at the Grand Prix in Miami this week. Given his occupation and the setting, he couldn’t have made a more fitting choice than the TAG Heuer Formula 1 in black with a matching strap. This version with red and white accents is a limited edition. The watch’s features include a rotating dive bezel and a 38-mm case with a black DLC coating. Powered by the brand’s Calibre TH50-00, it usesSolargraphtechnology to hold a charge for months. (40 hours of direct sunlight yields a 10-month power reserve.) Available for just $1,800, the Formula 1 is one of the best buys in big-brand watches. Did you know that comedianNate Bargatze owns Darth Vader’s Cartier Tank watch? Well, not exactly—the Sith Lord didn’t wear it while destroying Alderaan or Force-choking any Rebellion scum. However, the oversizedTankdid belong to David Prowse, the English actor and bodybuilder who played the physical role of Darth Vader (to whomJames Earl Jonesfamously provided the voice). Said to have been gifted to Prowse by the crown prince of Saudi Arabia around 1980, the automatically-wound Tank later found its way to the auction block—and subsequently to Bargatze’s wrist. This ‘Jumbo’ Tank Louis Cartier ref. 17002 isa bit larger than your average Tank Louis and features a slightly bulging caseback to accommodate the movement’s winding rotor.",

    "title": "Trump Administration Is “Actively Looking” To Deprive Migrants of Habeas Corpus",
    "article_text": "PresidentDonald Trumpand his administration are “actively looking at” suspending the writ of habeas corpus for migrants, denying them their constitutional right to challenge in court if the United States government is legally detaining them,Stephen Millertoldreporters on Friday. The White House deputy chief of staff, who hascraftedsevere andcallousimmigration policy throughout both of Trump’s terms, cited the Constitution and referred to habeas corpus as a “privilege” that “can be suspended in time of invasion.” The Constitution reads, “The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.” While the clause does not specifically note who in Washington has the power to invoke it, the resoundingconsensusamong legal and constitutional scholars is that Congress has to sign off on suspending habeas corpus. Supreme Court JusticeAmy Coney Barrett, in anessayco-written with the attorneyNeal Katyalfor the National Constitution Center, also said that revoking the writ is up to Congress. In the country’s history, the writ of habeas corpus has only been revoked four times, most notably by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War. It was also revoked in the Philippines in 1905, in Hawaii after Pearl Harbor, and in 1871 to fight the Ku Klux Klan in South Carolina. Miller was asked about the possibility of revoking this legal protection just hours after a federal judge in Vermont had ordered the release ofRumeysa Öztürk, the Tufts University student who wastakenoff the street by immigration authorities in March. Öztürk, a Turkish-born Fulbright scholar studying in a PhD program in Massachusetts, had a legal F-1 visa.

Trump has painted immigrants as “animals” who are “poisoningthe blood of our country,” while Miller hassaidthat “America is for Americans and Americans only.” During Trump’s first term, MillerorchestratedTrump’s family-separation policy and the Muslim ban, among other crackdowns that targeted migrants of color.

    "title": "Pope Leo XIV's Childhood Home Is (Probably) Up For Grabs",
    "article_text": "Thefirst American popeis about to make a major impact on Chicago’s real estate prices. The childhood home ofPope Leo XIVwas already on the market when the man formerly known asRobert Francis Prevostwas named the new pontiff. The price, as you can imagine, will probably go up. Way up. Born in 1955, Pope Leo spent his younger years in Dolton, Illinois, a community about 30 minutes from downtown Chicago. At least some of those years were spent at a 1200-square-foot brick house on East 141st Place, a residence that has been on the market since well beforethe conclave to choosethe Catholic Church’s successorconvened. “Three levels of living space await you in this immaculately rehabbed single family home!!” NBC Chicagoquotes the listingas reading. “Situated on a quiet block, this affordable, brick, move-in ready retreat features 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, & almost everything new.” Pope Francis appoints as new cardinal U.S-born prelate prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, Robert Francis Prevost during the Ordinary Public Consistory for the Creation of new Cardinal at St. Peter's Square on September 30, 2023 in Vatican City, Vatican. TheNew York Timesreportsthat Leo’s father owned the home even before the eventual pope was born and held on to it until 1996, after Leohad taken a postin Peru. It changed hands several times since, landing with property flipperPawel Radziklast year,theNew York Postreports. It was listed for sale earlier this year for less than $250,000, a price consistent with the area’s median sale price of $150,000, per Zillow. That median will likely go up, when Radzik decides to sell. When real estate brokerSteve Budziksuddenly started receiving above-ask offers on the property late this week, the pair realized what they had and removed the listing to assess their options. “It’s like a winning lottery ticket,” Budzik told thePost. “What are the chances?” Radzik says that few details remain of the interior of the house, which he fully gutted in the flip. “The only thing still original are the walls,” he told thePost. “Everything else was replaced.” Nevertheless, Radzik—who bought the home for $66,000—might opt to remodel the house once again, returning the home to its original floor plan, Budzik says. “At this time the seller is just not ready to make a decision if he wants to sell it,” Budzik tells NBC. “He wants to kind of let the dust settle… he’s evaluating all the options.” How anOrgasmic Meditation GroupSparked a Troubled Federal Case Deconstructing Trump’s ElaborateOval Office Makeover Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act MeetCardinal Robert Francis Prevost, the First American Pope Revisit All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet The Dystopian Coming-of-Age StoryStephen KingConsidered Too “Merciless” to Film Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter All ofQuentin Tarantino’s Movies Ranked Elon Musk’s 14 Children and Their Mothers (That We Know Of) From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "Taylor Swift Spokesperson Blasts Justin Baldoni Over Blake Lively Subpoena",
    "article_text": "Thelegal battle betweenBlake LivelyandJustin Baldonihit a new level this week.Taylor Swift, well-known as a friend of Lively’s, was subpoenaed as a witness in Baldoni’s $400 million lawsuit against hisThis Ends With Usco-star, in a move Swift’s spokesperson decried as “designed to use Taylor Swift’s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait.” It’s the latest salvo in a dispute that’s been brewing since last summer, whenrumors of troublebehind the scenes started to plague the Baldoni-directed feature.The adaptation ofColleen Hoover’s best-selling novel about problematic and abusive relationships was hit with its own claims of abuse followingan internet scrumthat suggested Lively behaved unprofessionally on set—a scrum, Lively claimed in a December 2024 lawsuit, that was ginned up as part of a PR strategy from Baldoni, film production company Wayfarer Studios, and a team of crisis communications operatives. According to Lively’s representatives, the anti-Lively campaign was a preemptive measure to silence her from going public with sexual harassment and misconduct claims against Baldoni and his colleagues. Baldoni and his company responded with suits of their own: a $250 million defamation claim against theNew York Times,which was firstto report on Lively’s allegations, and a $400 million defamation suit against Lively, herself. Singer Taylor Swift and Actress Blake Lively hug prior to Super Bowl LVIII between the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs at Allegiant Stadium on February 11, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. It’s the latter case for which Swift was subpoenaed byBryan Freedman, the attorney for Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios, and the publicists said to be behind the allegedly anti-Lively smear campaign,Melissa NathanandJennifer Abel. It’s unclear, however, what help Swift might provide to Baldoni’s case. It’s indisputable that Swift and Lively are well-documented as friends,spending privateandpublic timetogether, but it’s hard to see how that translates to the singer’s ability to comment on the alleged harassment (or lack thereof) on theIt Ends With Usset. A representative for Swift raises the same point, saying in a statement that “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even seeIt Ends With Usuntil weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history.” Taylor Swift celebrates her birthday with Blake Lively on December 13, 2023 in New York City. “The connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, ‘My Tears Ricochet.’ Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift’s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case,” the statement reads. It’s certainly not the first time that Baldoni’s team has brought Swift’s name up in connection with Lively.According toLively’s initial legal filing, the PR team hired by Wayfarer provided a “scenario planning document” that read “our team can also explore planting stories about the weaponization of feminism and how people like Taylor Swift, have been accused of utilizing these tactics to ‘bully’ into getting what they want.” In an email sent to Wayfarer shortly before the film’s August 9, 2024 release, a PR strategist wrote “We have seen the most innocuous issues turn giant due to socials or the hugest crises have no effect on social whatsoever. You just cannot tell at this stage. But, BL does have some of the same TS fanbase so we will be taking it extremely seriously.” (BL and TS are assumed to reference Lively and Swift, respectively.) Taylor Swift and Blake Lively cheer from the stands during an NFL football game between the New York Jets and the Kansas City Chiefs at MetLife Stadium on October 1, 2023 in East Rutherford, New Jersey. A spokesperson for Lively says that the Baldoni team’s move to bring Swift into the case is another attempt to punish Lively for speaking out. “Mr Baldoni, [Wayfarer Studios co-founderSteve Sarowitz], and team continue to turn a case of sexual harassment and retaliation into entertainment for the tabloids, going as far as suggesting thatthey sell ticketsto a concert venue - Madison Square Garden - to witness Ms. Lively’s deposition, to subpoenaing Taylor Swift, a woman who has given a voice to millions the world over. This is a very serious legal matter, not Barnum & Bailey’s Circus,” the statement reads. “The defendants continue to publicly intimidate, bully, shame and attack women’s rights and reputations. Including in the past month seeking to strike down for all, a powerful California victims’ rights law, calling it ‘unconstitutional’. The disturbing actions by a billionaire, men who made their careers as ‘female allies’ and their team continue to show their true colors.” The case is expected to be heard in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on March 9, 2026, with JudgeLewis J. Limanpresiding.

    "article_text": "Chan Lai-lai’s pregnancy via IVF offers encouragement to older women in the city, but experts warn of increased risks of advanced maternal age The pregnancy of a 58-year-old woman in Hong Kong has sparked hopes for older women seeking to have children but also raised concerns about the risks of giving birth later in life. Chan Lai-lai, wife of local actor Brian Wong Chak-fung, told the Post on Saturday the recent announcement they were expecting their second daughter in September had been encouraging to a lot of women of a similar age in the city. “In fact, many people have privately messaged me, expressing that it has become a source of hope for them. Some have attempted it once and have already given up,” said Chan, referring to her successful in vitro fertilisation, a type of assisted reproduction service. “I told them that if you give up after one attempt, you deprive yourself of a second chance. You need to regain a positive mindset to try again, and this requires time for adjustment.” Her pregnancy has attracted public attention at a time of increasing calls for the government to implement more measures to help older women give birth, including by allowing them to store embryos for as long as they want. Apart from the IVF treatment, Chan also received injections to boost the chance of pregnancy and ensure the fetus’ health.",

The authority said on Saturday that a laboratory at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Kwai Chung detected weak positive results for Covid-19 in some of the flocked swab samples after routine tests were conducted on a batch of specimen collection kits. Following the discovery, authorities took immediate action, including suspending all flocked swabs from the supplier, enhancing the testing of specimen collection kits delivered in January, and reviewing test results of patients who had used affected swabs. “The Hospital Authority is following up on this event stringently and has notified the Department of Health,” an authority spokesman said. “We have demanded that the supplier of the flocked swabs concerned thoroughly investigate its quality control and testing records, provide an explanation, and implement remedial measures. “The Hospital Authority does not rule out taking further action to hold the supplier accountable.” The flocked swabs were procured from a local supplier and delivered to the public hospitals of Kowloon West, including Caritas Medical Centre, Kwai Chung Hospital, North Lantau Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital and Yan Chai Hospital, between January and the end of April.",

    "article_text": "Society for Protection of the Harbour’s 85-year-old founder has called for final effort to oppose legal changes before organisation closes An advocacy group that has fought to protect Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour for 30 years may take the government to court for passing a legal amendment to relax reclamation restrictions, calling it the last-ditch effort before the organisation closes. Winston Chu Ka-sun, founder of the Society for Protection of the Harbour, said on Saturday that the society had begun winding up procedures before a “new turn of events” from legal advisers that might push the group to remain in operation for the time being. “However, in this new turn of events, we are advised by senior counsel that there may be a remedy through the law courts. The law courts may be able to declare that this law offends the common law,” Chu said. The 85-year-old lawyer, who began campaigning to protect the harbour in 1995, expressed his disappointment with a legal amendment on Wednesday that allows the government to carry out small-scale and temporary reclamation works. The legal amendment also paves the way for large-scale reclamation under a new mechanism. The new mechanism allows the chief executive and his advisers to decide if large-scale reclamation projects at Victoria Harbour could go ahead, replacing current rules stating all reclamation at the harbour is forbidden unless proven to have an “overriding public need” supported by “cogent and convincing materials” in court.",

The semiconductor industry plays a sizable role in the “AI race” that the U.S. seems determined to win, which is why this context is worth paying attention to: from Intel’s appointment of Lip-Bu Tan to CEO — who wasted no time getting to work trying to revitalize the legacy company — to Joe Biden proposing sweeping new AI chip export rules on his way out of office that may or may not actually stick. Here’s a look at what’s happened since the beginning of the year. May 7: Just a week before the “Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion” was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, includingAxiosandBloomberg, the administration won’t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework. April 30:Anthropicdoubled down on its supportfor restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, “American firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in ‘baby bumps’ or ‘alongside live lobsters.’” April 22:Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company’s engineering focus. April 15:Nvidia’s H20 AI chip got hit with an exportlicensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week. April 9:Nvidia’s CEOJensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lagoresort, according to reports. At the time,NPR reportedHuang may have been able to spare Nvidia’s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S. April 3:Intel and TSMCallegedly reached a tentative agreementto launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel’s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn’t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come. April 1:CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going tospin off noncore assetsso it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers. March 12:Intel announced that industry veteran, and former board member,Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEOon March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an “engineering-focused company” under his leadership. February 28:Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead,the company slowed down constructionon the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won’t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031. February 3:U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnickurging the Trump administration to further restrictAI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia’s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. January 27:Chinese AI startupDeepSeekcaused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released theopen version of its R1 “reasoning” model. While this isn’t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek’s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry. January 13:With just a week left in office, former president Joe Bidenproposed sweeping new export restrictionson U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions. January 6: Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed inThe Wall Street Journalendorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China’s AI market was behind the U.S.’. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.
