    "article_text": "CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz addresses how Medicare and Medicaid can be protected from waste, fraud, and abuse, and discusses state and federal government collaboration regarding the benefits. Federal spending riddled with waste, fraud and abuse is costing taxpayers billions – and Dr. Mehmet Oz saysMedicaid is a glaring example, where crucial care is being siphoned away from the Americans who need it most. \"There's about $14 billion we've identified with DOGE, of folks who are duly enrolled wrongly in multiple states for Medicaid,\" Oz said on this week's \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" \"You live in New Jersey, but you move to Pennsylvania, and which state gets your Medicaid? Turns out both states collect money from the federal government.\" Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, urged that Medicaid be \"clean[ed] up\" so it serves the people it was initially designed to assist – those at the dawn or twilight of their life, those \"living in the shadows,\" and those with disabilities who are unable to receive access to care because of others \"clawing at the cloth\" of the system. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL SUPPORT MEDICAID REFORM. HERE'S WHY Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz speaks during a ceremony in the Oval Office at the White House on April 18, 2025 in Washington, DC.(Andrew Harnik) Republicans have urged the need toeliminate waste, fraud and abuse in such medical assistance programs, much to the concern of those who say the \"big, beautiful bill\" on its way through Congress threatens healthcare for those in need. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has denied that the bill threatens such coverage, telling \"Sunday Morning Futures\" last month that safeguarding Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security remains a \"big priority\" for Republicans, butrooting out waste, fraud and abuseis essential to make these programs work more efficiently for all. \"We have to eliminate people, for example, on Medicaid who are not actually eligible to be there. Able-bodied workers… young men who should never be on the program at all,\" he said at the time. Oz told guest host Jackie DeAngelis that the problem goes even further, pivoting to the lack of a federal work requirement for Medicaid — something that exists in other federal programs like food stamps. DEMS DRAFT CBO INTO ANTI-TRUMP 'RESISTANCE' AS WHITE HOUSE WORKS TO SHUT DOWN LEFTIST DATA SPIN Dr. Mehmet Oz says many of those most in need of Medicaid services are unable to use the program as intended.(iStock) \"Let's be clear what this means. It doesn't mean you have a job. It means you're trying to get a job – which is a good thing because we have twice as many jobs as there are people looking for them right now,\" he said. \"But, if you don't or can't seek a job, you can volunteer somewhere. You can get an education. You can help out with other people inside the household. There's many ways that you can chip in.\" \"There is a work requirement for SNAP, right, the food stamps program. There's a lot we can do. I think there's a moral hazard if we don't, because you've got people who are not working who could work, who should work, and it's better for them and better for the country if they do.\" Oz also said states are currently \"incentivized\" to not cooperate with the federal government. He pointed to a provision under the program's expansion that allows the federal government to cover up to 90% of the costs in some states compared to 50% or 60% in others. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP That uneven structure, he argued, incentivizes states to keep more able-bodied adults enrolled in Medicaid to bring in more federal money. \"Right now, in many states, if you go to the hospital, and you're an able-bodied person, the hospital gets paid more [for a Medicaid beneficiary] than if you're a Medicare beneficiary. Now, how does that work?\" he said. \"People work their whole life, chipped into Medicare, they get the program, they retire thinking they have got a great system, and the hospital tells them, 'Listen, you guys don't pay as well as the able-bodied folks on Medicaid who haven't been able to get a job.' So, in a way, we value them more, and that's what ends up happening that disrupts the system.\" Taylor Penley is an associate editor with Fox News.",

    "article_text": "The U.K. is considering mandating the use of chemical castration for sex offenders under an overhaul of the justice system aimed at freeing up more space in its overcrowded prisons, Reuters reported. (Credit: Reuters.) A British government minister says she’s \"not squeamish\" about the idea of chemical castration for male sex offenders, and wants to make it mandatory. The UK is considering a range of options from a new report, which aims to cut the country’sprison populationby 10,000 inmates to help alleviate chronic overcrowding. \"Problematic sexual arousal and preoccupation can be reduced via chemical suppressants and other medications, which can be prescribed for individuals who have committed a sexual offense under certain circumstances,\" the new report states. Prisons in the south-west of England have been involved in a pilot program of chemical castrations since 2002, and Justice Minister Shabana Mahmood from theruling Labour Partytold lawmakers in parliament on Thursday that the program would expand to 20 more prisons in two other regions of England.

One recent study found that reoffending rates were up to 60% lower for prisoners who had received the treatment. \"For some, offending relates to power, but for another subset of offenders, the combination of chemical suppressants and psychological interventions can, we believe, have a big and positive impact,\" Minister Mahmood told parliament. Initially, the option for chemical castration treatment would be only voluntary, and medical ethicists say it could be a problem to force doctors to treat an inmate who doesn’t want to have it done. In Britain, there is a strict tradition of informed medical consent where a patient can refuse medical treatment, and a doctor can’t ordinarily be forced to carry it out.

The UK's new government said it will release low-risk prisoners after they have served 40% of their sentences, compared with 50% currently, as part of a plan to address an overcrowding crisis in the country's jails.(Photo by Andrew Aitchison / In pictures via Getty Images) Sex offenders make up a significant percentage of the prison population in England, and at the end of March, more than 20% of inmates were incarcerated onsex crimescharges. The new report cautions that chemical castration \"should never be used as a risk management tool or standalone rehabilitative offer, and it is only appropriate for a limited number of sex offenders\". Chemical castration is already being used in some other European prisons to treat sex offenders. Authorities in Sweden have been carrying out limited clinical trials on volunteers at a Stockholm prison, while in Germany and Denmark it is more widely used but still on a voluntary basis. In Poland, courts can pass a sentence of mandatory chemical castration for some categories of sex-offense prisoners. Thursday’s report, written by a former government minister from the Conservative Party, also made four dozen recommendations to try and ease prison overcrowding. These include giving fewer people jail sentences under 12 months and encouraging other types of punishment instead, such as community service or fines; developing new policies for early release with good behavior for inmates, and tagging all offenders who committed crimes of abuse against women and girls.

However, the report has been broadly welcomed by the Howard League for Penal Reform, the world’s oldest prison charity. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The government is taking an important step forward by accepting most of the recommendations from this important review,\" says Chief Executive Andrea Coomber, but she cautioned that \"the prisons crisis will not be solved by half-measures.\" Senior police officers have cautioned that if there will be fewer prisoners behind bars, they need more resources to manage the risk that offenders pose outside of jail.

Denmark, which is set to take over the presidency of the European Union in July, published a letter demanding more leeway to expel immigrants who commit crimes. Leaders of Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Italy, and Poland signed the letterwith Denmark. \"Many have come here via legal pathways.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., over spending cuts and the national debt in PresidentDonald Trump's\"big, beautiful bill\" this weekend. Johnson madethe comments during an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday\" with host Shannon Bream, after Paul had called the spending cuts in the current version of the bill \"wimpy.\" \"It sounds like his biggest objection is the fact that we are extending the debt ceiling. That's a critically important thing to do. We have to do it. We're not going to get any Democrats to assist on that,\" Johnson said Sunday. \"So to get it through the Senate and make sure we don't crash the U.S. economy and default on our debts for the first time in history, it has to be part of the reconciliation package. And that's why President Trump and all the other Republicans in Congress, House and Senate understand the necessity of this,\" he added.

I support making them permanent, so I support that part of the bill. I support spending cuts. I think the cuts currently in the bill are wimpy and anemic, but I still would support the bill, even with wimpy and anemia cuts, if they weren't going to explode the debt. The problem is the math doesn't add up. They're going to explode the debt. The House's is $4 trillion. The Senate's actually been talking about exploding the debt by $5 trillion,\" Paul said. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is standing in the way of passing President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) He went on to say that there is no way he can vote for a version of the bill that raises the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. \"There's got to be someone left in Washington who thinks debt is wrong and deficits are wrong and wants to go in the other direction,\" he said. Paul instead proposed raising the debt ceiling for a period of three months, or $500 billion, on a rolling basis.

    "article_text": "Former Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway weighs in after Republicans called for key Biden aides to testify on the concealment of the former president's decline. Former PresidentJoe Biden'sdecision to run for re-election divided longtime Democratic advisors, a new book about Biden's cognitive decline and his administration's alleged cover-up revealed. Biden's former Chief of Staff, Ron Klain, shut down former PresidentBarack Obamaadvisor David Axelrod for repeatedly calling Biden's age an issue. \"The presidency is a monstrously taxing job and the stark reality is the president would be closer to 90 than 80 at the end of a second term, and that would be a major issue,\" Axelrod toldThe New York Times. Soon after the Times' story was published in June 2022, Klain called Axelrod fuming, CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios political correspondent Alex Thompson revealed in their book, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\" BIDEN STRUGGLED TO FILM 2024 CAMPAIGN VIDEOS AMID DECLINING HEALTH, NEW BOOK CLAIMS: 'THE MAN COULD NOT SPEAK' Advisors to President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama disagreed on whether Biden should run for re-election in 2024.(REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY) \"Who's going to beat Trump? President Biden is the only one who has done it. You better have a lot of certainty about a different candidate before you say the president should step aside. The future of the country depends on it!\" Klain told Axelrod on the phone, according to Thompson and Tapper. FOX NEWS' PETER DOOCY REVEALS HISTORY OF QUESTIONING BIDEN'S MENTAL FITNESS Klain believed it was \"sloppy thinking\" that anyone other than Biden could beat Trump, the journalists said in the book. But Axelrod,like most Americans, worried about the first octogenarian president's age and his ability to serve four more years. The chief strategist for Obama's back-to-back winning campaigns, Axelrod was one of the last advisers to meet with Biden before Obama chose him as his running mate in 2008. Axelrod told Tapper and Thompson that they didn't expect Biden to run for president at 73 and eventually discouraged Biden from running for president in 2015. They certainly didn't expect Biden to run for president at 77.

Axelrod told Biden that age would be an issue for his campaign but encouraged him to lean on his experience and wisdom, the journalists said. Axelrod's apprehension about Biden's age only grew, and when it came time for Biden to make a decision about his re-election, he knew Biden shouldn't run in 2024.

He said the \"stakes of miscalculation here are too dramatic to ignore.\" \"Only @JoeBiden can make this decision. If he continues to run, he will be the nominee of the Democratic Party. What he needs to decide is whether that is wise; whether it's in HIS best interest or the country's?\" Axelrod questioned on social media.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on the Trump administration's hopes to change birthright citizenship amid some pushback, on 'America Reports.' The Supreme Court heard a case this month centered on PresidentDonald Trump'sexecutive order seeking to end so-called birthright citizenship, in one of the most closely watched and potentially impactful cases heard by the court in recent years. Though the case itself was used largely as a means of challenging lower court powers to issue so-called universal or nationwide injunctions, justices on the high court did inquire about the merits of the order itself, \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" which Trump signed on the first day of his second White House term. The order, which was slated to take force Feb. 20, directed all U.S. agencies to stop issuing citizenship documents to children born to illegal immigrants or children born to mothers living in the country on a temporary visa, if the father is not a permanent resident or U.S. citizen. Despite theSupreme Court’sfocus on universal injunctions in hearing the case, deep and unyielding concerns persist about Trump’s attempt to undo more than 100 years of legal precedent.

Chip Somodevilla/Pool via Reuters/File Photo(Reuters) The ACLUincluded in its lawsuitthe story of one couple from Indonesia but living in New Hampshire whom they said would be affected by the order. \"They arrived in 2023, applied for asylum, and their application awaits review,\" ACLU attorneys said of the couple. \"The mom-to-be is in her third trimester. \"Under this executive order, their baby would be considered an undocumented noncitizen and could be denied basic health care and nutrition, putting the newborn at grave risk at such a vulnerable stage of life,\" they added. And such problems would persist throughout their lives, lawyers for the group noted. These persons would not be able to obtain necessary identification, such as drivers' licenses, and would not be able to vote, hold some jobs or serve on juries. Though Trump had spoken in detail in his first term and on the campaign trail about wanting to end birthright citizenship, his executive order sent shockwaves through the nation. It was met by a wave of lawsuits from Democrat-led states and immigrants’ rights groups. WHO IS JAMES BOASBERG, THE US JUDGE AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S DEPORTATION EFFORTS? Demonstrators hold up signs during a \"Hands Off!\" protest against President Donald Trump at the Washington Monument in Washington, Saturday, April 5, 2025.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) One lawsuit, brought by 18 Democratic attorneys general, warned that ending birthright citizenship would strip hundreds of thousands of U.S.-born children of their citizenship as the result of a circumstance completely outside a child’s control. Statistics also bear this out. Roughly 150,000 children are born annually in the U.S. to parents of noncitizens.  If the order were to take force as Trump envisioned, experts warned the impact would be catastrophic. ​​\"President Trump's attempt to unilaterally end birthright citizenship is a flagrant violation of our Constitution,\"New JerseyAttorney General Matthew Platkin, who joined 17 other Democrat-led states in suing to block the order, said earlier this year.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP More than 22 U.S. states and immigrants' rights groups sued the Trump administration to block the change to birthright citizenship prior to the Supreme Court's decision to take up the case, arguing in court filings that the executive order is both unconstitutional and \"unprecedented.\" To date, no court has sided with the Trump administration in upholding the executive order.

David Spiller, a sponsor of the legislation, amended the bill so it applies to all counties rather than just counties with populations over 100,000 as was the case in the original version, according to FOX 7 and The Texas Tribune. \"This bill is not immigration reform,\" Spiller said Saturday. \"This bill is the strongest border security bill — indirectly — that we could have this session.\" ALLEGED HUMAN SMUGGLERS ARRESTED IN TEXAS AFTER HIDING INSIDE HOLLOWED HAY BALES The Texas House gave initial approval to a bill that would require local law enforcement to collaborate with ICE.(David Dee Delgado/Getty Images) The measure needs another House vote before it can return to the Senate, where the upper chamber must agree to the changes or both chambers must straighten out their differences before the bill can be sent to Republican Gov.

Charles Schwertner, could help the Trump administration’s mass deportation plans, but immigrants’ rights advocates say the requirement would lead to racial profiling of black and brown people and prompt fear among undocumented Texans who may be reluctant to report a crime or seek help from authorities who are collaborating with ICE, according to The Texas Tribune.",

    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the benefits and risks of ketamine use. Season 2 of the reality show \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" depicted one couple — Jen and Zac Affleck — as they went through ketamine therapy, which they claimedsaved their marriage. What is ketamine, and can it really benefit relationships? An anesthetic used to induce sleep before and after surgery, according to Cleveland Clinic, ketamine is also used illegallyas a recreational drug. FDA APPROVES OPIOID-FREE PAIN MEDICATION WITH 'NO SIGN OF ADDICTION' The Alcohol and Drug Foundation (ADF) describes ketamine as a \"dissociative drug,\" meaning it causes people to feel \"separated or detached\" from their bodies or physical surroundings. In recent years, ketamine has been used as an alternative therapy fortreatment-resistant depression(TRD). Season 2 of \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" depicted one couple — Jen and Zac Affleck — going through ketamine therapy, which they claimed in interviews saved their marriage. Jen Affleck is shown third from right.(Getty Images) \"It can be a party drug, and it can be abused, but I think if you have the right intention and you do it in the proper setting with a doctor, it can be super impactful,\" Zac Affleck said in an interview with Women’s Health. As far as personal beliefs, \"there's nothing in the Mormon guidelines that says you can't do ketamine, but it’s in the gray area,\" Affleck added. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a derivative of ketamine in a nasal spray format (Spravato, or S-ketamine) for treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation. Some clinical studies have shown that ketamine therapy can be effective in treating severe depression in veterans.(Julia Rendleman for The Washington Post via Getty Images; iStock) Some clinical studies have shown that ketamine therapy can be effective in treating severe depressionin veterans. \"Ketamine acts like an antidepressant that can help distract someone from negative thoughts and feelings in a relatively short amount of time,\" Rolando Larice, M.D., medical director at Sana Lake Recovery in Missouri, told Fox News Digital. KETAMINE THERAPY SHOWN EFFECTIVE IN TREATING SEVERE DEPRESSION IN VETERANS, STUDY FINDS The drug is believed to create more connections betweenbrain cells, a process thought to ease depression and decrease suicidal thoughts, according to Mayo Clinic. Dr. Justin Gerstner, psychiatrist and chief medical officer at Ellie Mental Health in Minnesota, previously told Fox News Digital that he uses ketamine therapy in his own practice. \"Ketamine acts like an antidepressant that can help distract someone from negative thoughts and feelings in a relatively short amount of time,\" one doctor told Fox News Digital.(iStock) \"It's been quite transformative for a lot of our clients,\" he said. One practice administers ketamine to clients via IV injection, partnered with psychotherapy. Gerstner’s practice usually administers ketamine to clients via IV injection in two- to three-hour sessions,partnered with psychotherapybefore and after treatment. It is intended to be used in combination with antidepressant pills only under the supervision of a medical professional. At high doses, the drug can cause adverse health issues thataffect cardiovascular, respiratory and neurologic function, which can be fatal, said the American Addiction Centers website. ELON MUSK REVEALS WHY HE TAKES KETAMINE, DENIES ABUSING THE DRUG: ‘I SHOULD KEEP TAKING IT’ Some risks include elevated blood pressure,difficulty breathing, amnesia, seizures, addiction, problems with judgment and coordination, and a lower urinary tract irritation called ulcerative cystitis, according to the same source.

    "title": "Prostate cancer screening after 70: Experts question guidance after Biden's diagnosis",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Karl Rove and former Biden 2020 campaign surrogate Kevin Walling discuss former President Joe Biden’s prostate cancer diagnosis and allegations of a cover-up by the Democratic Party on ‘The Story.’ Former PresidentJoe Biden’saggressive prostate cancer diagnosis has raised questions about prevention and detection. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends that men aged 55 to 69 discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) screening with their healthcare provider and make an individual decision about screening. They recommend thatmen over the age of 70skip screenings altogether. DR. MARC SIEGEL: BIDEN'S PROSTATE CANCER DIAGNOSIS REVEALS DANGEROUS FLAW IN SCREENING GUIDELINES The USPSTF is a \"commonly used\" resource, although other agencies and associations offer varying guidelines, according to Dr. Shawn Dason, a urologic oncologist at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center. Dason stressed that it's important for men in their 50s and 60s to confer with theirhealthcare providersto make shared decisions on screening. An expert stressed how important it is for men in their 50s and 60s to talk with their healthcare providers to make shared decisions on screening.(iStock) \"They should engage in a discussion about the topic of prostate cancer and the role of PSA in screening — and the potential benefits and harms,\" he said. There’s a \"little bit of variability\" in whether men under age 50 and over 70 should be screened due to potential risks, which can include over-treatment or unnecessary treatment, Dason said. In past decades, \"we didn't really have an understanding of the nuances … about whenprostate cancershould be treated and when [it] should just be observed in a protocol called ‘active surveillance,’\" he said. GLEASON SCORE FOR PROSTATE CANCER: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BIDEN'S DIAGNOSIS It is possible for some men to be over-treated after a diagnosis, he also said. In certain cases, the cancer may not have led to death or other clinical problems — but the treatment could cause \"bothersome\" urinary, sexual orbowel-related side effects, Dason said. \"Studies have shown that use of the PSA has fallen off likely in men over the age of 40 as a result of the USPSTF recommendation,\" one doctor said.(iStock) \"You might be diagnosed with a prostate cancer that is not likely to actually cause your death or create any other problem for you,\" he said. \"You might then receive treatment for that prostate cancer — and the treatment might be worse than the actual impact of the cancer itself.\" JOE BIDEN DIAGNOSED WITH ‘AGGRESSIVE FORM’ OF PROSTATE CANCER WITH METASTASIS TO THE BONE There is \"much more limited data\" to support that screening over the age of 70 could save a man's life from prostate cancer, Dason noted, while it's \"pretty clear\" that the harms ofprostate cancer treatmentincrease with age.\" Screening could reduce the chance of death in some cases, however, which is why it's important to have a discussion with a doctor, according to Dason. \"You might be diagnosed with a prostate cancer that is not likely to actually cause your death or create any other problem for you,\" one expert said.(iStock) Men whodon't have symptomsbut are considered of \"average population risk\" should be screened, he advised. \"Having symptoms is a totally different conversation,\" he said. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Generally, when we use the term screening, we're talking about somebody who is not having any symptoms … They're having an annual health checkup.\" Fox News' senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel revealed that he’s been \"bothered\" by the guidelines not recommending routine prostate cancer screening, particularly for thoseover age 70. \"Studies have shown that use of the PSA has fallen off in men over the age of 40 as a result of the USPSTF recommendation,\" he wrote in a recent op-ed for Fox News Digital. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health \"This is particularly disturbing considering that there are over 300,000 new cases ofprostate cancerin the U.S. diagnosed every year, with over 35,000 deaths, many of which may be preventable with earlier diagnosis.\" \"I am saying that all men over the age of 45 should have this screening. Period. Regardless of age.\" Siegel noted that treatment options have advanced over the years, and are now better tolerated with fewer side effects for patients at various stages and ages. \"Many critics are saying that apresident of the United Statesshould have the most aggressive prostate cancer screening regardless simply because he is president,\" he said. \"But I am saying that all men over the age of 45 should have this screening. Period. Regardless of age.\" Men who don't have symptoms but are considered of \"average population risk\" should have screenings, an expert advised.(iStock) Dason agreed that some men aged 70 and older are appropriate candidates for screening. \"If you're ingood health, and you're going to have a reasonable life expectancy, the diagnosis of [a serious] prostate cancer could have a big impact on extending that life or improving your quality of life.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By contrast, men who are not great candidates due to health issues and limited life expectancy face greater harm from a screening than benefit, he clarified. \"I would encourage men to think about their situation and have a conversation with their medical provider.\" Angelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.",

The challenge, known as \"the Murph,\" consists of a variety of strength training and cardio activities, which Murphy himself used to complete during SEAL training. AMERICANS SHOULD HONOR MEMORIAL DAY IN THIS WAY, MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS SUGGEST Murphy’s former SEAL roommate, Kaj Larsen, told Fox News Digital how he also participated in these workouts, which have turned into a nationalmovement of patriotism. \"Murph and I would often run to the pull-up bars and then do this workout where we did 100 pull-ups, 200 push-ups and 300 air squats, and then we'drun backto our barracks room,\" Larsen said.

    "article_text": "Petco Love Lost is a free platform that uses AI-powered photo matching to reunite lost pets with their families. If your job has you feeling tense, your dog might be feeling it too. A new studypublished in Scientific Reportsfinds that stress from work can affect your dog at home. The research, led by Tanya Mitropoulos and Allison Andrukonis, shows that when dog owners dwell on work problems after hours, a habit known as \"work-related rumination,\" their pets show more signs of stress. Researchers surveyed 85 working dog owners. Theymeasured job stressand how often people kept thinking about work during their free time. Then they asked how stressed owners thought their dogs were and also tracked actual behaviors linked to canine stress, like whining, pacing or restlessness. WOMAN SAYS DOG DETECTED HER BREAST CANCER BEFORE DOCTORS DID: 'HE'S KNOWN THIS WHOLE TIME' A stressed office worker, at left, covers her face while sitting at her laptop. At right, a black Labrador retriever looks visibly anxious. A new study found that job stress can affect dogs through emotional contagion and work-related rumination.(Getty Images) The study found that owners with higher job stress had dogs who showed more stress-related behaviors. That link stayed strong even when the researchers accounted for other stress in the home. Interestingly, owners didn’t always realize their dogs were stressed. It was a pup's behavior that told the story. The big factor driving the connection? Rumination. Owners who mentally took work home were more likely to havestressed-out dogs. Thinking about work off the clock seemed to spread stress from humans to pets. This idea is known as \"crossover,\" when one person’s stress spills over to others in a home. Previous research has shown this happens between spouses, and now there’s evidence it can happen between people and their pets too. 10 WAYS TO TREAT YOUR PET AND CELEBRATE THEIR JOY A dog sits on a hardwood floor with a sad expression. New research finds that dogs can absorb their owners' work stress through emotional cues and changes in routine.(Getty Images) Dogs are especially sensitive to their owners’ moods. Scientists call this \"emotional contagion,\" the idea that dogs can pick up on human feelings through tone of voice, body language and other subtle cues. When an owner is distracted or irritable from work stress, the dog notices. Over time, this can affect the dog’s well-being. The study also suggests another explanation. When people are focused on work problems, they may become less patient, more distant or less consistent with routines like walks and feeding. That kind of change in care can also increase stress in dogs. A woman pinches the bridge of her nose in frustration while working from home. A 2025 study published in Scientific Reports links job stress and rumination to signs of stress in pet dogs.(Getty Images) The authors point out that Americans overwhelmingly see their pets as part of the family. That makes it even more important to understand how our behavior affects them.

    "article_text": "California girls' high school athletes reflect on their experience competing against a trans athlete in a postseason meet, as the state continues to defend its policies on gender eligibility. A biologically maletrans athlete will competefor the girls' long jump and triple jump state championship in California next week. The trans athlete finished in first place in both events at Saturday'sCalifornia Interscholastic Federation(CIF) Track Championship Masters Qualifiers. In triple jump, the athlete won with a distance of 40-04.75, while the runner up only reached 39-06.00. In long jump, the trans athlete's margin of victory was shorter, reaching 19-03.50 while the runner-up managed 19-00.75. During the long jump medal ceremony, the athlete who finished in third place did not show up and accept the third place medal next to the trans athlete. No reason has been given. The second-place finisher received a noticeably vocal applause. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Tracy Howton, a local parent of an athlete who competes in track and field, attended the event Saturday and had to witness what is becoming a regular site for her and others in the community. \"As the parent of a female jumper, we have watched this happen at the last three track meets. Today we watched incredible female athletes lose their opportunities to go to states to a biological male. I can’t imagine how devastating it would feel to work so hard and then be unfairly stripped of your opportunity to compete at states. It’s heartbreaking,\" Howton told Fox News Digital. \"Governor Newsom, our California elected officials and the CIF are failing our girls. It’s that simple. They owe the competitive female athletes of California representation. They owe them responsible decisions based on science and fundamental truth. For our family, this experience has reinforced just how important it is to use your voice to stand up for truth, remembering that bad decisions can be corrected.\" The CIF has been at the center of a national controversy in recent weeks as the trans athlete has dominated the girls' track and field postseason. The situation has become so volatile that PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration sent a warning to the CIF and the athlete's high school, Jurupa Valley High School, of consequences for allowing the situation to continue. CIF is already under investigation by the U.S. Department of Education for defying Trump's \"Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports\" executive order. The federation came under additional scrutiny when its officials allegedly forced athletes toremove shirtsthat read \"Protect Girls Sports\" at the Southern Sectional prelims on May 10. \"CIF’s and Jurupa Valley High School’s apparent flouting of federal civil rights law by allowing a male athlete to compete in a female California track and field [Southern Sectional Division 3 final] this Saturday, and the alleged retaliation against the girls who are protesting this, is indefensible,\" Julie Hartman, a Department of Education spokesperson, previously told Fox News Digital. \"We will not allow institutions to trample upon women’s civil rights. OCR’s (Office of Civil Rights) investigation into CIF continues with vigor.\" CALIFORNIA GIRLS' TRACK ATHLETE OPENS UP ON LOSING 1ST-PLACE TITLE TO TRANS COMPETITOR The Jurupa Unified School District (JUSD) has responded to the controversy in a previous statement to Fox News Digital. \"JUSD continues to follow both California law and CIF policy regarding school athletics. Both state law and CIF policy currently require that students be permitted to participate in athletic teams and competitions consistent with their gender identity, irrespective of the gender listed on the pupil's records. JUSD remains committed to protecting the rights and safety of the students we serve, in accordance with applicable state and federal laws,\" the statement reads. The situation is set to come to a head next Saturday when the athlete will look to cap off a dominant postseason run with a pair of state titles. The event will take place at Veterans Memorial Stadium at Buchanan High School in Clovis, California, and will feature a rematch between the trans athlete and a female athlete who has spoken out against her trans opponent's inclusion. In long jump, the athlete will face off against Katie McGuiness, who came in second place behind the athlete at last weekend's sectional final.

    "title": "Hackers are bypassing fingerprint scanners to steal your identity",
    "article_text": "A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch. Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they’ve become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well). Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it’s still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost everyAndroid phoneon the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us: \"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?\" I get what you’re saying, Frank. You’d think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn’t be bypassed. But you’d be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they’re not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity. Join The FREE CyberGuy Report: Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals — plus instant access to myfree Ultimate Scam Survival Guidewhen you sign up! A smartphone on a table(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods. Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers atNYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\"using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringentsecurity settings. Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you’ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,researchers at Cisco Talostried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks. On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn’t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn’t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn’t work on them. 19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone’s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work. PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks. Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants. Image of a smartphone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) TOP 20 APPS TRACKING YOU EVERY DAY Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don’t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger. Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea. HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL INFO FROM PEOPLE SEARCH SITES A person using a fingerprint for security verification purposes(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) 10 SIMPLE STEPS TO IMPROVE YOUR SMARTPHONE’S SECURITY AND PRIVACY Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures. 1. Choose trusted phone brands:If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brandslike Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data. 2. Keep your phone updated:Phone updatesare not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don’t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected. 3. Use strong antivirus software:Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage. Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? 4. Don’t rely only on your fingerprint:Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn’t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on youriPhoneandAndroid. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in. 5. Be careful about who handles your phone:If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don’t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It’s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints. 6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It’s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it’s better to skip it and use your password instead. 7. Consider using a personal data removal service:Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. Get afree scanto find out if your personal information is already out on the web. WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they’re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don’t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn’t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.

    "title": "Democrats don't need a 'left-wing' Joe Rogan, they need to win back the real one",
    "article_text": "Rep. Ro Khanna told Fox News Digital on Wednesday why he is proposing legislation to codify President Donald Trump's executive order to lower prescription drug prices. It was hard to concentrate in my congressional office because I could overhear a lively interview with conservative media host Glenn Beck through the thin wall. You might assume I work for a Republican, but I’m chief of staff to progressive California Congressman Ro Khanna. What if I told you it was one of our best interviews in recent months? They disagreed on President Trump’s deportation efforts and USAID funding, but they agreed on revitalizing manufacturing and leading against China. Theheadline for the interviewread, \"Progressive Democrat sits down with Glenn Beck despite disagreements: ‘We’re all Team America.’\" We agreed he’d return soon. ROGAN MOCKS DEMOCRATS FOR 'NOT COURSE CORRECTING AT ALL' IN MONTHS AFTER LOSS TO TRUMP There’s debate about whether Democrats need a stronger message or more robust left-wing media. But what Democrats really need is to relearn the art of persuasion—not just crafting a compelling message, but figuring out how to make it cut through today’s crowded media landscape. Democrats don’t need a \"left-wingJoe Rogan.\" We need to persuade the real one, along with Americans nationwide, that we share common ground and are worth supporting. I know it’s possible because I saw Ro begin that process with Glenn Beck. They didn’t agree on everything, but the conversation opened a door. That’s persuasion: not instant conversion, but showing up, listening, and finding places to start. Podcast host Joe Rogan talked about the faith needed to believe in the \"miracle\" that a big bang caused the beginning of the universe, on his May 7 podcast.(Screenshot/Joe Rogan Experience) Our leaders are too often surrounded by chattering consultants obsessed with poll-tested messages and terrified of ruffling feathers. Every morning, I get dozens of emails urging me to tell Americans that MAGA Republicans are trying to take away their healthcare. I believe it! But it takes more than one line to convince people. We need specifics, facts, and a clear vision of what Democrats stand for. Ro has been building this foundationfor years. He’s traveled to dozens of states, partnering with Silicon Valley to expand tech opportunities, and since the election, held town halls in Republican districts—not to preach, but to listen. At a recent Allentown, Pennsylvania, event, Ro spoke with the Trump supporters protesting outside about his bipartisan bill to lower prescription drug costs. By the end, they came inside—and applauded. Having a message is just the first step. The next challenge is breaking through today’s media ecosystem—can it go viral on social media, get picked up by the press, or reach broader audiences, and still land? Amplification matters equally. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION It’s undeniable that Republicans have invested significantly more time and resources into building a powerful online ecosystem to reach voters. To overcome that right now,Democrats need to be fearless. Flood the zone, reach people where they are, win them over. Download TikTok, hire a talented, chronically online 22-year-old to post on subreddits, and create a Substack. Talk to Mehdi Hasan in the morning and Laura Ingraham in the evening. Write an op-ed for Fox News Digital. It’s not about giving anyone a platform or legitimacy—their platforms already exist, and their audiences view them as legitimate. It’s about using those platforms to share our message and tailoring how we communicate to different audiences without compromising our values. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP We also need to balance between viral moments with nuanced messages about complicated issues. Ro’s prescription drug bill has gained traction on X and Reddit. But his core vision—a new economic patriotism focused on 21st century solutions for the economic success of every community including new factories and AI academies—hasn’t taken off online the same way. Yet, in longer-form interviews and podcasts, it’s met with enthusiasm. Both messages matter, and we need to find the right time and place for each. After all, Joe Rogan supported Bernie Sanders in the 2020 presidential election. When he drifted toward Donald Trump, we shrugged and said he was gone for good. Why not try again with a tailored message and an eye toward persuasion? Joe, if you’re reading this, I have a pitch for you. Marie Baldassarreis Chief of Staff for Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents California’s 17th district.",

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: Jake Tapper chose lying Biden sources over his own eyes",
    "article_text": "CNN's Jake Tapper discusses the Biden White House's use of the term \"cheap fakes\" for legitimate video of the president last year. A great deal of mirth and ribbing has been directed atCNN’s Jake Tapperin recent days over his co-authoring of a tell-all blockbuster book about how awful he and his colleagues are at their jobs. But last week, during one of his approximately 27 million TV appearances to hawk, \"Original Sin,\" the book on the Biden administration’s lies that he dashed off with Axios’ Alex Thompson as soon as the 2024 election was over, Tapper said something that was so close to really understanding his subject and his job that it almost hurt. 'THE VIEW' MELTS DOWN OVER LATEST BIDEN BOOK, SLAMS CNN FOR 'HAWKING' IT Appearing on CBS News, Tapper said, \"So, therewerepeople reporting on what they saw. The conservative media was, to their credit, all over this. Now, they didn't have insider information, but they were just making sense of all the clips, and all of the weird moments, and off-putting moments.\" What Tapper misses here is that conservative media didn’t get it right in regard to Joe Biden’s obvious and abject unfitness for officein spiteof not having insider information, they got it rightbecausethey were not relying on insider information. In Tapper’s twisted view of journalism, and it is one widely shared, the evidence we see with our own eyes is not sufficient. Instead, it isn’t news until some whistleblower spills the beans, which puts all the power in the hands of sources. TOPSHOT - US President Joe Biden looks down as he participates in the first presidential debate of the 2024 elections with former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at CNN's studios in Atlanta, Georgia, on June 27, 2024. (Photo by Andrew CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP) (Photo by ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP) Since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s, everything has to be a Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein-style scoop. A story isn’t real without some turncoat in the administration, even though they, too, have agendas. Obviously, the big problem here is that all of Tapper and Thompson’s sources spent years deceiving them and the American people, but now, suddenly, we are expected to believe everything these same serial liars say. Sorry. Not happening. Let’s take the tempting tale being spun by Tapper and Thompson now that it was actually first sonHunter Bidenwho was running the show. It's delicious, maybe the crack-addled Burisma executive really is the smartest man Joe ever met. The artist behind the curtain. However, and call me a cynic if you will, this particular version of events just so happens to be the one that paints Tapper and Thompson’s insider sources in the best possible light. Tapper began criticizing Hunter Biden's shady foreign deals in 2023 despite calling allegations against Hunter Biden \"too disgusting\" to show on CNN in 2020.(Photo by Taylor Hill/WireImage | Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) Basically, what these insiders are saying is, \"Man, we really tried to do the right thing, but that Hunter, he just blocked us at every chance, which is too bad because he has a pardon for anything he did with the autopen now, but what can you do?\" And once again, Tapper and Thompson just eagerly write it all down as if they were standing atop Mt. Sinai taking dictation of the Ten Commandments from God. The bottom line is that even if you are a generous soul inclined to trust Tapper and Thompson, only a fool would trust their insider sources. So honestly, what is the point of even reading the book? This speaks to a much deeperproblem with journalismwhich tends to frame all political coverage as a government that is lying and intrepid reporters sussing out the actual truth when that is almost never what actually happens. Instead, these journalists confuse sourcing with access, so all their \"sources\" are people advancing their agenda. Now, suddenly, the agenda is to pile on Biden and salvage our reputations (for media AND insiders). George Orwell said, \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printed: everything else is public relations.\" Tapper and Thompson have both been doing a lot of PR for Democrats for a very long time. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION A source, especially an anonymous source, is almost by definition only telling a reporter something they want the reporter to print. It can sometimes be helpful, but it is never the whole story. The hilarious final twist in all of this is that in Donald Trump, we have a president who takes more questions than the average corporate call center and owns everything the press accuses him of from sending migrants to El Salvadoran jails to holding Crypto Balls at his resort. It's all just out in the open. The age of post-Watergate \"gotcha\" journalism has driven the industry off of a cliff. Nobody believes what journalists say because they are just mouthpieces for those in power. The primary job of the journalist isn’t to pry out some hidden information being kept from people; They aren’t detectives. It is to accurately report on and analyze what we know is happening. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In that regard, the coverage of Joe Biden’s decline, his clear inability to serve, is arguably the worst journalism that ever been attempted. Tapper and Thompson couldn’t see what was right in front of their face because they were convinced there had to be something deeper, something hidden. It is time to turn the page and get back to a journalism that deals in reality, not speculation. Until that happens, Americans have no reason to believe anything the Jake Tappers and Alex Thompsons of the world tell them.

    "title": "Too busy to rest: Your time off is important for your health and productivity — so use it!",
    "article_text": "While many Caribbean islands are safe for spring breakers, tourists should still exercise caution in the region, according to former DEA Senior Special Agent Michael Brown. The email sits in Kyle’s inbox: \"Please submit yourvacationplans for the year.\" He glances at his project timeline, then at the family photo – his kids beaming from last summer's brief weekend at the lake. His calendar is packed with deadlines stretching into next quarter. There's never a \"good\" time, he thinks, moving the email to his \"Later\" folder for the third time this month. Like Kyle, millions of Americans find themselves in this cycle –postponing vacationsand stockpiling unused leave days, convinced next month will be less busy. Each year, workers leave billions of dollars worth of paid time off (PTO) unused, effectively gifting these earned benefits back to their employers. But this isn't just about unused benefits – it's about how humans function at their best. Employees often blame a toxic work culture, demands for overwork, or unsupportive bosses as reasons why they don’t take available leave. But whether parental leave, sick leave, or general PTO, employer support for employee time off exist for a reason — because employees and the companies they work for are all better off when people can take abreak from work. Here’s why. IVANKA TRUMP MAKES COST RICA SPLASH VACATIONING WITH EXTENDED FAMILY FOR SPRING BREAK First, it’s about health. Chronic stress and burnout have measurable negative impacts on physical and mental health, including risks of cardiovascular issues, anxiety, and depression. This is especially true for long periods of uninterrupted work without proper breaks. Taking vacation time allows the body and mind to repair and reset. (iStock) This also has direct effects on productivity. While it may seem counterintuitive, research has found that taking time off actually improves workplace performance. This is in part because the human brain requires periods of rest to maintain peak cognitive function. This is especially relevant for knowledge workers who need focus, or service workers who need regulation. Studies show that after a vacation, employees return with enhanced creativity, better problem-solving abilities, and renewed energy. Such breaks are also helpful for innovation and creativity. Distance from daily and maybemundane work routinescreates mental space for new perspectives and ideas. Breakthrough insights often erupt during or after vacation time, when minds are free to wander and make novel connections. When a break is spent in nature, that can be all the more inspiring. So taking true breaks can be considered especially important for jobs which rely on stellar innovation and creativity. It’s not just about whether or not to take that vacation — it’s also about who does it. Peer pressure matters, but managers and leaders especially set the tone at the top. When employees, especially leaders, don't take vacation time, it creates an unhealthy workplace culture which normalizes overwork. By taking your vacation, you help establish healthy boundaries and give permission for others to do the same. This is not only helpful for setting the standards for your current employees, but also showcasing a culture that will make other talented individuals want to work with and for you — as no one wants to work at the place where it feels expected to never take time off. (iStock) Another concern of managers is how leave policies look on paper, as compared to how they are actually implemented. Results from my own research interviewing working mothers discovered a theme of resentment against companies that espoused having family-friendly workplaces with paid leave, that was then felt as deeply hypocritical when individual managers weren’t supportive of their folks taking such leave. This is when a policy designed to help or support employees can end up not providing that support — there is a gap between what is written and what is unwritten. This means that employers often feel good about having the policies on paper, and either aren’t aware or don’t care if employees ever actually use them. The box is checked — but is the support actually delivered? HR professionals call this the \"implementation gap,\" and it can have deeply negative effects on employee commitment and identification with their employer. Beyond work, relationships with family and friends require quality time to nurture and maintain. Vacation allows for creating meaningful memories, strengthening bonds, and pursuing that ever-elusive balance between work and life responsibilities. Our connections with others provide the emotional support system that makes us more resilient at work. Without time devoted to those connections, that support is weakened. So don’t be like Kyle and don’t postpone your vacations until later — take them now. Whether a day, week, or longer, take the time you need to replenish your energy, restore your well-being, and rejuvenate your relationships with important people in your life. Managers and leaders, make sure that your leave policies are well-communicated and well-executed. Set the standard with your own behavior as you personally and professionally benefit from taking that vacation. Your job will still be there when you get back stronger, more energized, and more resilient than before.

    "title": "Righteous harvest: How faith and farming can help us live the American dream",
    "article_text": "High school student Naomi Kirkland says working on a farm takes 'grit' and hard work. InAmerica’s farm country, there is a steady heartbeat that pulses throughout the fields—the faith community. It’s not confined to Sunday sermons or midweek Bible studies. It’s in the calloused hands that till the land, in families who pray over the crops, and in pastors who bless the harvest. As a small farmer from Georgia, rooted in faith, family, and the rich soil of the American South, I know how powerfully faith and farming walk hand in hand. The Word of God tells us in James 2:26, \"Faith without works is dead.\" On American soil, those works take the form of plowing fields, planting seeds, harvesting crops, and stewarding the land. As we look ahead to America’s 250th anniversary in 2026, we must pause to reflect on the role that faith and agriculture played in building our great nation. From the Revolution to Reconstruction, from the Dust Bowl to the Civil Rights Movement, farmers of faith haven’t grown just crops—they have grown courage, resilience, and community. Historically, the bond betweenfarmersand churches has been more than symbolic—it is practical. In colonial times, the church was often the first public institution built in rural communities, meeting spiritual needs and serving as a hub for news, markets, and mutual aid. Black churches, in particular, were bedrocks of resilience, preaching the Gospel while helping families survive through farming and food programs during Jim Crow and beyond. LIBERAL LEADERS HAVE BETRAYED OUR CIVIL RIGHTS LEGACY AND FAILED ATLANTA On my family’s farm, we proudly carry that legacy forward. We grow hydroponically, cultivating herbs, vegetables, and even butterflies with prayer at the root of every crop. We share our harvest with our church, using food not just to nourish, but as an educational tool. But we mustthink beyond our own fields. Across the country, the partnership between farmers and faith institutions can tackle important challenges. One important challenge is addressing food waste. It is unacceptable that over 30 percent of food in the United States goes uneaten, while millions remain food insecure. Somefood wastebegins on the farm, through both surplus production and also \"imperfect\"—but otherwise wholesome and nutritious—produce that does not meet cosmetic standards for mainstream shelves. But what the world calls imperfect, God calls usable. This is where farmers and faith leaders can step in together. By partnering with local farmers, faith institutions can help redirect unsold produce to those in need, turning what would have been waste into nourishment and hope. Imagine churches hosting community dinners using donated ingredients. Picture youth ministries learning to cook fresh, local meals. Further, faith institutions can also spread the word about community-supported agriculture (CSA) programs. Off the farm, faith institutions can work with restaurants, caterers, campuses, and hotels to recover non-perishable and unspoiled perishable foods, provided food safety guidelines are met. They can collect and coordinate the donation of items across communities, helping ensure good food reaches people, not landfills. To make it easier, liability protections exist for those seeking to make good faith donations of food to nonprofit organizations like churches. These efforts restore more than nutrition. They restore dignity and connection. They show people where their food comes from and remind them that every harvest is part of something sacred. This is a vision championed by the America First Policy Institute, where I serve as chair of the American Dream Coalition. We believe in empowering families, promoting self-sufficiency, and reigniting prosperity for the one-blood human race, especially in rural and underserved communities. Initiatives that unite farmers and churches align with that mission and offer the kind of grassroots revival our country urgently needs. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION When churches embrace andsupport agriculture, whether by reducing food waste or simply sharing a harvest, they reaffirm biblical truths about stewardship, generosity, and compassion. And when farmers partner with churches, they discover renewed purpose in using their bounty to serve others. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP My uncle, Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., reminded us that \"Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.\" I say faith matters. Farming matters. And when you bring the two together, you do not just grow crops. You grow hope. So let us not grow weary. Let us sow with intention. Let us water these partnerships with prayer and reap a harvest of blessing and prosperity for our communities. Faith and farming, together, can help us live out the true promise of the American Dream. These are my personal views and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Department of Agriculture or the U.S. Government.

    "title": "Justice Department urged to seek death penalty in Capital Jewish Museum murders",
    "article_text": "DC Mayor Muriel Bowser and officials brief after a shooting near the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The Justice Department shouldpursue the death penaltyagainst Elias Rodriguez for the first-degree premeditated executions of Sarah Milgrim and Yaron Lischinsky on May 21st outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington D.C. This is a sober decision to make, but not a difficult one. It’s exactly the kind of case where the death penalty is warranted. Before getting into why the accused richly deserves theultimate punishment, let me state clearly that Rodriguez is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt. SHOOTING AT CAPITAL JEWISH MUSEUM HIGHLIGHTS RISING WAVE OF ANTI-JEWISH HATE CRIMES First, according to the CriminalComplaint filedagainst the accused, he murdered foreign officials and committed first-degree murder. Criminal complaints are placeholders and are the first step in a process that leads to a formal indictment, which is imminent. No doubt, as additional evidence is gathered, more charges will be added, some may be altered, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia (where I used to work as a prosecutor) will seek an indictment of the accused. A grand jury, which meets in secret, only needs to find probable cause to believe that the accused committed the crimes listed in the indictment. Elias Rodriguez, the 31-year-old suspect accused of shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers on Wednesday, May 21, in Washington D.C.(Instagram/@shinewithIsrael) That is a forgone conclusion; he will be indicted in the coming days. Second, this isn’t a whodunnit. Not only are there eyewitnesses to the crimes, but there is video surveillance. On top of that, once the forensic evidence is tested, the accused’s DNA, fingerprints, and other inculpatory evidence tied to the accused will be developed and available for trial. Any one of those pieces of evidence, both direct and circumstantial, could be sufficient to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. But there’s more: the accused told the officers at the scene that he \"did it,\" and blurted out \"I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza, I am unarmed.\" Third, this wasn’t a heat of passion or spontaneous act by the accused. Not only did he fly from Chicago to D.C. with a 9mm handgun (in his checked luggage), he purchased a ticket to the Museum event three hours before it started, walked behind the two victims as they exited, and shot them numerous times. As Sarah tried to crawl away, the accused shot her again. Sarah sat up for a moment. The accused reloaded and fired several shots into her body. A sketch from the preliminary hearing/arraignment for Elias Rodriguez, man accused of shooting two Israeli staffers.(Dana Verkouteren) Video surveillance captured this horrible scene. Fourth, law enforcement officers recovered 21 expended 9mm cartridges from the scene, a 9mm magazine, and a 9mm handgun with its slide locked, indicating that it had expended all of its ammunition. The handgun was registered to the accused in Illinois, where he purchased the weapon in 2020. The federal death penalty is authorized for several crimes, including first-degree murder. The Trump administration wisely reinstated the use of the federal death penalty for appropriate cases, and Attorney General Pam Bondi issuedrevisedguidance with respect to the process by which federal prosecutors may seek the death penalty. Although there are 93 United States Attorney’s Offices spread around the country, if any office wants to seek the death penalty, they must request to do so by submitting their justification memo to the Capital Case Section of Main Justice in Washington D.C. The process requires a pre-indictment review, consultation with the victim’s family, and a thorough review by the Capital Review Committee, composed of seasoned prosecutors. Since the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court in 1976, there have been 1,625 executions, most of which took place at the state level. Today, 27 states have the death penalty. There are only three federal death row prisoners awaiting execution as of today (there were 40, but President Biden commuted the sentences of 37 vicious killers just before leaving office). Fifty-five percent of those executed have been white, 34% have been black, and 8% have been Hispanic. Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim were shot and killed as they left an event at the Capital Jewish Museum, pose for a picture at an unknown location, in this handout image released by Embassy of Israel to the U.S. on May 22, 2025.(Embassy of Israel to the USA via X/Handout via REUTERS) Death penalty trials have two phases: the guilt phase and the sentencing phase. If an accused is found guilty of a death-eligible offense by a jury, then the case proceeds to the sentencing phase. In federal death penalty cases, the government must prove that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors. Aggravatingfactorsfor homicide include death during the commission of another crime, a previous conviction of a violent felony involving a firearm, previous conviction of other serious offenses, or a heinous, cruel, or depraved manner of committing an offense. Mitigating factors include impaired capacity, duress, no prior criminal record, and others. Given the fact that the accused hunted down and executed two helpless victims, shot them in the back, shot them when they were on the ground, shot Sarah as she tried to crawl away, reloaded, and shot Sarah again, the government will likely proceed on the theory that the accused’s actions were heinous, cruel, and depraved, and argue that those factors far outweigh any mitigating factors. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In the 1996 fictional movie \"A Time to Kill,\" set in the deep south, a 10-year-old African American girl named Tonya was abducted, raped, and beaten by two redneck white men, who, after throwing full beer cans at her and unsuccessfully trying to hang her, threw her off a bridge into a river. Tonya survived. The men were arrested. But before they were tried, Tonya’s father, Carl Lee Hailey, shot and killed them in the courthouse, fearing that an all-white southern jury would acquit the monsters. Carl Lee went on trial for their murder, and was represented by Jake Brigance, played by Matthew McConaughey. During his closing argument to the jury, Jake asked the jury to close their eyes as he described the brutal rape of Tonya. \"This is the story about a little girl walking home from a grocery store one sunny afternoon…suddenly a truck races up, two men jump out and grab her, they drag her into a nearby field, and they tie her up, they rip her clothes from her body, now they climb on, first one then the other, raping her, shattering everything innocent and pure, vicious thrusts, in a fog of drunken breath and sweat. When they are done, after they killed her tiny womb, murdered any chance of her to bear children, to have life beyond her own, they sat and used her for target practice.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As he describes the hanging and then how they threw her over the bridge to the creek bottom 30 feet below, he asks the jury, \"Can you see her? Her raped, beaten, broken body, soaked in their urine, soaked in their semen, soaked in her blood, left to die. Can you see her? I want you to picture that little girl.\" After a long pause, he says, \"Now imagine she’s white.\" With that in mind, try this thought experiment: imagine Sarah and Yaron were black, and the accused was a white supremacist who shot them coming out of a function at the National Museum of African American History and Culture. After he was apprehended by the police, he said \"I did it for the KKK, I did it for the Confederacy.\" Sarah and Yaron deserve justice. Justice, in this case, is the ultimate punishment.

CarGurus recently showed depreciation rates of up to45%. Meanwhile, Business Insidertalked this past weekwith two owners who shared firsthand what value Tesla has assigned their Cybertruck. One owner, who bought a $100,000 AWD 2024 model and accumulated 19,623 miles, received a quote for $63,100 (a 37% depreciation); the other purchased a top-of-the-line $127,000 Cyberbeast last September was shown a quote for $78,200, which would amount to a 38% loss after eight months. Tesla initiallybanned ownersfrom reselling the vehicle –  a policy typically used to prevent scalping of high-demand vehicles and to maintain brand control. In Tesla’s case, it may also have delayed a wave of trade-ins or resales from owners facing a backlash owing to Elon Musk’s high profile in the Trump administration or frustrated with ongoingquality controlissues, which have included runaway gas pedals and falling trim pieces. Worth noting: trade-in figures are typically lower than private-party sales, and EVs as a category depreciate fast. According to Wired, some brands can lose up to50%in year one.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Artificial intelligence is a deep and convoluted world. The scientists who work in this field often rely on jargon and lingo to explain what they’re working on. As a result, we frequently have to use those technical terms in our coverage of the artificial intelligence industry. That’s why we thought it would be helpful to put together a glossary with definitions of some of the most important words and phrases that we use in our articles. We will regularly update this glossary to add new entries as researchers continually uncover novel methods to push the frontier of artificial intelligence while identifying emerging safety risks. Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, is a nebulous term. But it generally refers to AI that’s more capable than the average human at many, if not most, tasks. OpenAI CEO Sam Altmanrecentlydescribed AGI as the “equivalent of a median human that you could hire as a co-worker.” Meanwhile,OpenAI’s charterdefines AGI as “highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work.” Google DeepMind’s understanding differs slightly from these two definitions; the lab views AGI as “AI that’s at least as capable as humans at most cognitive tasks.” Confused? Not to worry —so are experts at the forefront of AI research. An AI agent refers to a tool that uses AI technologies to perform a series of tasks on your behalf — beyond what a more basic AI chatbot could do — such as filing expenses, booking tickets or a table at a restaurant, or even writing and maintaining code. However, as we’veexplained before, there are lots of moving pieces in this emergent space, so “AI agent” might mean different things to different people. Infrastructure is also still being built out to deliver on its envisaged capabilities. But the basic concept implies an autonomous system that may draw on multiple AI systems to carry out multistep tasks. Given a simple question, a human brain can answer without even thinking too much about it — things like “which animal is taller, a giraffe or a cat?” But in many cases, you often need a pen and paper to come up with the right answer because there are intermediary steps. For instance, if a farmer has chickens and cows, and together they have 40 heads and 120 legs, you might need to write down a simple equation to come up with the answer (20 chickens and 20 cows). In an AI context, chain-of-thought reasoning for large language models means breaking down a problem into smaller, intermediate steps to improve the quality of the end result. It usually takes longer to get an answer, but the answer is more likely to be correct, especially in a logic or coding context. Reasoning models are developed from traditional large language models and optimized for chain-of-thought thinking thanks to reinforcement learning. (See:Large language model) A subset of self-improving machine learning in which AI algorithms are designed with a multi-layered, artificial neural network (ANN) structure. This allows them to make more complex correlations compared to simpler machine learning-based systems, such as linear models or decision trees. The structure of deep learning algorithms draws inspiration from the interconnected pathways of neurons in the human brain. Deep learning AI models are able to identify important characteristics in data themselves, rather than requiring human engineers to define these features. The structure also supports algorithms that can learn from errors and, through a process of repetition and adjustment, improve their own outputs. However, deep learning systems require a lot of data points to yield good results (millions or more). They also typically take longer to train compared to simpler machine learning algorithms — so development costs tend to be higher. (See:Neural network) Diffusion is the tech at the heart of many art-, music-, and text-generating AI models. Inspired by physics,diffusion systems slowly “destroy” the structure of data— e.g. photos, songs, and so on — by adding noise until there’s nothing left. In physics, diffusion is spontaneous and irreversible — sugar diffused in coffee can’t be restored to cube form. But diffusion systems in AI aim to learn a sort of “reverse diffusion” process to restore the destroyed data, gaining the ability to recover the data from noise. Distillation is a technique used to extract knowledge from a large AI model with a ‘teacher-student’ model. Developers send requests to a teacher model and record the outputs. Answers are sometimes compared with a dataset to see how accurate they are. These outputs are then used to train the student model, which is trained to approximate the teacher’s behavior. Distillation can be used to create a smaller, more efficient model based on a larger model with a minimal distillation loss. This is likely how OpenAI developed GPT-4 Turbo, a faster version of GPT-4. While all AI companies use distillation internally, it may have also been used by some AI companies to catch up with frontier models. Distillation from a competitor usuallyviolatesthe terms of service of AI API and chat assistants. This refers to the further training of an AI model to optimize performance for a more specific task or area than was previously a focal point of its training — typically by feeding in new, specialized (i.e., task-oriented) data. Many AI startups are taking large language models as a starting point to build a commercial product but are vying to amp up utility for a target sector or task by supplementing earlier training cycles with fine-tuning based on their own domain-specific knowledge and expertise. (See:Large language model [LLM]) A GAN, or Generative Adversarial Network, is a type of machine learning framework that underpins some important developments in generative AI when it comes to producing realistic data – including (but not only) deepfake tools. GANs involve the use of a pair of neural networks, one of which draws on its training data to generate an output that is passed to the other model to evaluate. This second, discriminator model thus plays the role of a classifier on the generator’s output – enabling it to improve over time. The GAN structure is set up as a competition (hence “adversarial”) – with the two models essentially programmed to try to outdo each other: the generator is trying to get its output past the discriminator, while the discriminator is working to spot artificially generated data. This structured contest can optimize AI outputs to be more realistic without the need for additional human intervention. Though GANs work best for narrower applications (such as producing realistic photos or videos), rather than general purpose AI. Hallucination is the AI industry’s preferred term for AI models making stuff up – literally generating information that is incorrect. Obviously, it’s a huge problem for AI quality. Hallucinations produce GenAI outputs that can be misleading and could even lead to real-life risks — with potentially dangerous consequences (think of a health query that returns harmful medical advice). This is why most GenAI tools’ small print now warns users to verify AI-generated answers, even though such disclaimers are usually far less prominent than the information the tools dispense at the touch of a button. The problem of AIs fabricating information is thought to arise as a consequence of gaps in training data. For general purpose GenAI especially — also sometimes known as foundation models — this looks difficult to resolve. There is simply not enough data in existence to train AI models to comprehensively resolve all the questions we could possibly ask. TL;DR: we haven’t invented God (yet). Hallucinations are contributing to a push towards increasingly specialized and/or vertical AI models — i.e. domain-specific AIs that require narrower expertise – as a way to reduce the likelihood of knowledge gaps and shrink disinformation risks. Inference is the process of running an AI model. It’s setting a model loose to make predictions or draw conclusions from previously-seen data. To be clear, inference can’t happen without training; a model must learn patterns in a set of data before it can effectively extrapolate from this training data. Many types of hardware can perform inference, ranging from smartphone processors to beefy GPUs to custom-designed AI accelerators. But not all of them can run models equally well. Very large models would take ages to make predictions on, say, a laptop versus a cloud server with high-end AI chips. [See:Training] Large language models, or LLMs, are the AI models used by popular AI assistants, such asChatGPT,Claude,Google’s Gemini,Meta’s AI Llama,Microsoft Copilot, orMistral’s Le Chat. When you chat with an AI assistant, you interact with a large language model that processes your request directly or with the help of different available tools, such as web browsing or code interpreters. AI assistants and LLMs can have different names. For instance, GPT is OpenAI’s large language model and ChatGPT is the AI assistant product. LLMs are deep neural networks made of billions of numerical parameters (or weights, see below) that learn the relationships between words and phrases and create a representation of language, a sort of multidimensional map of words. These models are created from encoding the patterns they find in billions of books, articles, and transcripts. When you prompt an LLM, the model generates the most likely pattern that fits the prompt. It then evaluates the most probable next word after the last one based on what was said before. Repeat, repeat, and repeat. (See:Neural network) A neural network refers to the multi-layered algorithmic structure that underpins deep learning — and, more broadly, the whole boom in generative AI tools following the emergence of large language models. Although the idea of taking inspiration from the densely interconnected pathways of the human brain as a design structure for data processing algorithms dates all the way back to the 1940s, it was the much more recent rise of graphical processing hardware (GPUs) — via the video game industry — that really unlocked the power of this theory. These chips proved well suited to training algorithms with many more layers than was possible in earlier epochs — enabling neural network-based AI systems to achieve far better performance across many domains, including voice recognition, autonomous navigation, and drug discovery. (See:Large language model [LLM]) Developing machine learning AIs involves a process known as training. In simple terms, this refers to data being fed in in order that the model can learn from patterns and generate useful outputs. Things can get a bit philosophical at this point in the AI stack — since, pre-training, the mathematical structure that’s used as the starting point for developing a learning system is just a bunch of layers and random numbers. It’s only through training that the AI model really takes shape. Essentially, it’s the process of the system responding to characteristics in the data that enables it to adapt outputs towards a sought-for goal — whether that’s identifying images of cats or producing a haiku on demand. It’s important to note that not all AI requires training. Rules-based AIs that are programmed to follow manually predefined instructions — for example, such as linear chatbots — don’t need to undergo training. However, such AI systems are likely to be more constrained than (well-trained) self-learning systems. Still, training can be expensive because it requires lots of inputs — and, typically, the volumes of inputs required for such models have been trending upwards. Hybrid approaches can sometimes be used to shortcut model development and help manage costs. Such as doing data-driven fine-tuning of a rules-based AI — meaning development requires less data, compute, energy, and algorithmic complexity than if the developer had started building from scratch. [See:Inference] A technique where a previously trained AI model is used as the starting point for developing a new model for a different but typically related task – allowing knowledge gained in previous training cycles to be reapplied. Transfer learning can drive efficiency savings by shortcutting model development. It can also be useful when data for the task that the model is being developed for is somewhat limited. But it’s important to note that the approach has limitations. Models that rely on transfer learning to gain generalized capabilities will likely require training on additional data in order to perform well in their domain of focus (See:Fine tuning) Weights are core to AI training, as they determine how much importance (or weight) is given to different features (or input variables) in the data used for training the system — thereby shaping the AI model’s output. Put another way, weights are numerical parameters that define what’s most salient in a dataset for the given training task. They achieve their function by applying multiplication to inputs. Model training typically begins with weights that are randomly assigned, but as the process unfolds, the weights adjust as the model seeks to arrive at an output that more closely matches the target. For example, an AI model for predicting housing prices that’s trained on historical real estate data for a target location could include weights for features such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether a property is detached or semi-detached, whether it has parking, a garage, and so on. Ultimately, the weights the model attaches to each of these inputs reflect how much they influence the value of a property, based on the given dataset.

His family was in the industry, and he says he “grew up” working in a machinist shop while in high school. Now Warner is building a robotics company of his own, Intempus, that looks to make robots a bit more human. Intempusis building tech to retrofit existing robots with human-like emotional expressions to help humans better interact with these machines and better predict their movements. Giving these robots human-like reactions will also produce data that can be used to better train AI models. These robots will show expression through kinetic movements, Warner told TechCrunch. “Humans derive a lot of our subconscious signals, not from face, not from semantics, but solely from the movement of your arms and your torso,” Warner said. “This extends to dogs and cats and other animals that aren’t humans.” Warner said he got the idea for Intempus while he was working at AI research labMidjourney. He said Midjourney, like many other AI research labs, was working onworld AI models, or AI models that understand and make decisions based on the dynamics of the real world and spatial properties, as opposed to just cause and effect. But it will be really hard for these models to achieve this spatial reasoning, Warner realized, because a lot of the data the models were being trained on came from robots that didn’t have this spatial reasoning, either. “Robots currently go from A to C, that is observation to action, whereas humans, and all living things, have this intermediary B step that we call physiological state,” Warner said. “Robots don’t have physiological state. They don’t have fun, they don’t have stress. If we want robots to understand the world like a human can, and be able to communicate with humans in a way that is innate to us, that is less uncanny, more predictable, we have to give them this B step.” Warner took that idea and started to research. He started with fMRI data, which measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow and oxygen, but it didn’t work. Then his friend suggested trying a polygraph (lie detector test), which works by capturing sweat data, and he started to find some success. “I was shocked at how quickly I could go from capturing sweat data for myself and a few of my friends and then training this model that can essentially allow robots to have an emotional composition solely based on sweat data,” Warner said. He’s since expanded from sweat data into other areas, like body temperature, heart rate, and photoplethysmography, which measures the blood volume changes in the microvascular level of the skin, among others. Warner launched Intempus in September 2024 and spent the first four months exclusively on research. He’s spent the last few on a mix of building up these emotional capabilities for robots and engaging potential customers. He’s already signed seven enterprise robotics partners. Intempus is also part of the current cohort of Peter Thiel’sThiel Fellowship program, which gives young entrepreneurs $200,000 over two years to drop out of school and build their companies. Warner said the next step for Intempus is to hire — he’s done everything until now as a team of one — and get some of the tech that’s already been built in front of humans to start testing. While Intempus is currently working on retrofitting existing robots and plans to focus on that, Warner said he’d never rule out Intempus building its own emotionally intelligent robots in the future. “I have a bunch of robots, and they run a bunch of emotions, and I want to have someone come in and just understand that this robot is a joyful robot, and if I can innately convey some emotion, some intents that the robot holds, then I’ve done my job properly,” Warner said. “I think I can, you know, really prove that I’ve done this over the next four to six months.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture LIMITED TIME: Save $300+ on your ticket, plus an additional 50% on a second for a full immersive day of AI!

    "title": "'Situation is dire' - BBC returns to Gaza baby left hungry by Israeli blockade",
    "article_text": "There is no excitement as the camera passes. The children barely glance. What can surprise a child who lives among the dead, the dying, the waiting to die? Hunger has worn them down. They wait in queues for scant rations or for none at all. They have grown used to my colleague and his camera, filming for the BBC. He witnesses their hunger, their dying, and to the gentle wrapping of their bodies - or fragments of their bodies - in white shrouds upon which their names, if known, are written. For 19 months of war, and now under a renewed Israeli offensive, this local cameraman - who I do not name, for his safety - has listened to the anguished cries of the survivors in hospital courtyards. His physical distance is respectful, but they are on his mind, day and night. He is one of them, trapped in the same claustrophobic hell. This morning he is setting out to find Siwar Ashour, a five-month-old girl whoseemaciated frame and exhausted cry at Nasser hospitalin Khan Younis affected him so much, when he was filming there earlier this month, that he wrote to tell me something had broken inside him. She weighed just over 2kg (4lb 6oz). A baby girl of five months should be about 6kg or over. Siwar has since been discharged and is now at home,  my colleague has heard. That is what brings him to the street of pulverised houses and makeshift shelters of canvas and corrugated iron. He conducts his search in difficult circumstances. A few days ago I messaged to ask how he was doing. \"I am not okay,\" he replied. \"Just a short while ago, the Israeli army announced the evacuation of most areas of Khan Younis… We don't know what to do - there is no safe place to go. \"Al-Mawasi is extremely overcrowded with displaced people. We are lost and have no idea what the right decision is at this moment.\" He finds a one-bedroom shack, the entrance formed of a floral patterned, grey and black curtain. Inside there are three mattresses, part of a chest of drawers, and a mirror which reflects sunlight across the floor in front of Siwar, her mother Najwa and her grandmother, Reem. Siwar is quiet, held secure by the protective presence of the two women. The baby cannot absorb regular milk formula because of a severe allergic reaction. Under the conditions of war and anIsraeli blockade on aid arrivals, there is a severe shortage of the formula she needs. Najwa, 23, explains that her condition stabilised when she was in Nasser hospital, so doctors discharged her with a can of baby formula several days ago. Now at home, she says the baby's weight has started to slip again. \"The doctors told me that Siwar improved and is better than before, but I think that she is still skinny and hasn't improved much. They found her only one can of milk, and it [has] started running out.\" Flies dance in front of Siwar's face. \"The situation is very dire,\" says Najwa, \"the insects come at her, I have to cover her with a scarf so nothing touches her\". Siwar has lived with the sound of war since last November when she was born. The artillery, the rockets, falling bombs - distant and near. The gunfire, the blades of Israeli drones whirring overhead. Najwa explains: \"She understands these things. The sound of the tanks, warplanes, and rockets are so loud and they are close to us. When Siwar hears these sounds, she gets startled and cries. If she is sleeping, she wakes up startled and crying.\" Doctors in Gaza say many young mothers report being unable to breastfeed their babies due to lack of nutrition. The pressing problem is food and clean water. Najwa was malnourished herself when Siwar was born. She and her mother Reem still find it difficult to get anything to eat themselves. It is the struggle of every waking hour. \"In our case, we can't provide milk or diapers because of the prices and the border closure.\" On 22 May Israeli military body Cogat said there was no food shortage in Gaza. It said \"significant quantities of baby food and flour for bakeries\" had been brought into the enclave in recent days. The agency has repeatedly insisted that Hamas steals aid, while the Israeli government says the war will continue until Hamas is destroyed and the Israeli hostages held in Gaza are released. According to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, 20 hostages seized by Hamas in the 7 October 2023 attacks are believed to be alive and up to 30 others dead. Aid agencies, the United Nations and many foreign governments, including Britain, reject Cogat's comment that there is no food shortage. US President Donald Trump has also spoken of people \"starving\" in Gaza. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the amount of aid Israel has allowed into Gaza as \"a teaspoon\". He said Palestinians were \"enduring what may be the cruellest phase of this cruel conflict\" with restricted supplies of fuel, shelter, cooking gas and water purification supplies. According to the UN 80% of Gaza is now either designated as an Israeli militarised zone or a place where people have been ordered to leave. The denials, the expressions of concern, the condemnations and the moments which seemed like turning points have come and gone throughout this war. The sole constant is the suffering of Gaza's 2.1 million people, like Najwa and her daughter Siwar. \"One does not think about the future or the past,\" Najwa says. There is only the present moment and how to survive it. With additional reporting by Malak Hassouneh, Alice Doyard and Nik Millard. A school sheltering displaced families in central Gaza was among those hit, according to medics and civil defence officials. Officials say a 28-year-old with US citizenship had Molotov cocktails in his backpack and called for \"death to America\". A British surgeon working in Nasser Hospital said he had operated on the doctor's surviving 11-year-old.

    "title": "Lineker says emotional farewell on final Match of the Day",
    "article_text": "Gary Lineker held back tears as he signed off from his final edition of Match of the Day after 26 years in the hot seat and officially left the BBC. The host announced in November that he would leave the football show at the end of the Premier League season, which concluded on Sunday. He had been due to remain with the BBC to front coverage of the men's FA Cup and the World Cup, but has now left the corporation completely afterapologising for sharing an antisemitic social media post. On his swansong on Sunday, Lineker apparently made a nod to the controversy, opening the show by telling viewers \"it wasn't meant to end this way\" - before going on to turn the line into a reference to the final day of the season. At the end of the programme, Lineker was presented with a commemorative cap and golden boot by pundits Alan Shearer and Micah Richards, who were alongside him. \"It's been an absolute privilege to have hosted Match of the Day for a quarter of a century. It's been utterly joyous,\" he said. Speaking directly into the camera to viewers at home, he added: \"And my final thank you goes to all of you. \"Thank you for watching, thank you for all your love and support over the years. \"It's been so special, and I'm sorry that your team was always on last. Time to say goodbye.\" The former England forward replaced Des Lynam as the main presenter of the BBC's flagship football programme in 1999, and went on to become its highest-paid presenter. He hit the headlines for airing his opinions beyond football on social media, however. He was suspended in 2023 for a post about the then-government's asylum policy, with numerous fellow BBC Sport presenters and pundits walking out in support. After Lineker was reinstated, the BBC issued new rules for presenters posting on social media. Earlier this month, Lineker was criticised for sharing a social media post about Zionism that included an illustration of a rat, historically used as an antisemitic insult. Lineker apologised, saying he had not seen the image and \"would never consciously repost anything antisemitic\". However, it was then announced he would leave the BBC earlier than expected, and that Sunday's show would be his last. In a statement at the time, Lineker said football had been \"at the heart of my life\" and that he cared deeply about the game and his BBC work, but he recognised \"the error and upset that I caused\". \"Stepping back now feels like the responsible course of action,\" he said. BBC director general Tim Davie thanked Lineker for being \"a defining voice in football coverage for the BBC for over two decades\", and said they had \"agreed he will step back from further presenting after this season\". Lineker's final episode in the presenter's chair on Sunday saw him interview Liverpool manager Arne Slot as they collected the Premier League trophy. Slot paid tribute, saying: \"Thank you for being such a great presenter of a BBC show that I watched many times when I lived in Holland, and now still.\" The show began with a montage of former Everton and Spurs striker Lineker's goals and later looked back on highlights of his time at the helm of Match of the Day. This included him famously presenting a segment while wearing only his Leicester City boxer shorts, as he had promised, after his boyhood team won the Premier League in 2016. His longstanding sidekicks Shearer and Richards also paid tribute, introducing a montage that included testimonies from the likes of Alan Hansen, Ian Wright and Paul Gascgoine as well as the late Johan Cruyff, singer Andrea Bocelli and Lineker's sons. \"You won't believe it but you will be missed,\" offered Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola. \"You've been great to me and you've been unbelievable to Match of the Day,\" added Shearer. In January, it was revealed that Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan would jointly take over Match of the Day presenting responsibilities from the start of the 2025-26 season. \"I'd like to wish Gabby, Mark and Kelly all the very best when they sit in this chair,\" Lineker said. \"The programme is in the best of hands.\" Alan Yentob: A look back at a colourful, creative life and career Gerry Adams is suing the BBC over a 2016 story in which it was alleged he sanctioned the murder of Denis Donaldson. The Rest is Football will have its last episode on BBC Sounds this week ahead of the host's exit. The Match of the Day host will leave the corporation after presenting his final episode on Sunday. He will no longer present the corporation's future coverage of the FA Cup and World Cup as planned.",

    "title": "Trump agrees to extend EU trade talks after 50% tariff threat",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has agreed to extend a deadline to negotiate tariffs with the European Union until 9 July. It comes after President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said she had a \"good call\" with Trump on Sunday. Last month, Trump announced a 20% tariff on most EU goods, but later halved it to 10% until 8 July to allow time for negotiations. On Friday, Trump expressed frustration with the pace of negotiations with the EU and threatened to impose 50% tariffs. Speaking to reporters, Trump said Von der Leyen told him \"we will rapidly get together and see if we can work something out\", posting later on Truth Social that it was his \"privilege to extend the deadline\". Von der Leyen earlier said she was ready to move \"swiftly\" to agree a trade deal with the US, but that the bloc needed until 9 July to agree a \"good deal\". In remarks to reporters at the White House on Friday afternoon hours before talks with the bloc, Trump said he planned to raise tariffs on all goods sent to the US from the EU to 50% by 1 June, citing impatience at negotiations. Later on Friday, the EU's trade chief Maroš Šefčovič reaffirmed the bloc's commitment to securing a fair deal. Following a call with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, he said: \"The EU's fully engaged, committed to securing a deal that works for both.\" He continued: \"EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect, not threats. We stand ready to defend our interests.\" Trump has long criticised what he views as an unfair trade relationship with the EU, despite the bloc being one of Washington's largest trading partners. Last year, the EU exported more than $600bn (€528bn; £443bn) in goods to the US while importing $370bn worth, according to US government data. The president has specifically raised concerns on trade in cars and agricultural goods. Although some tariffs were paused earlier this year to allow for negotiations, a 25% levy on EU steel and aluminium remains in place. European leaders continue to warn against escalation. France and Germany have called for a diplomatic solution, stressing that tariffs would harm both economies. The EU has threatened - and paused - its own measures against the US. It said it would introduce a 25% tariff on €18bn ($20bn; £15bn) worth of US goods coming into Europe but this was put on hold. The bloc is also currently consulting on additional measures against US imports into the US valued at €95bn. In a rare rebuke, the US president says he is \"not happy\" with his Russian counterpart over the latest attacks. As the cities where Floyd grew up and died hold commemorations,  the US \"reckoning\" with racism seems to be fading.

    "title": "Rate 'rigging' traders say they were scapegoated - now the Supreme Court will decide",
    "article_text": "The Supreme Court is poised to rule on the cases of two former City traders jailed for rigging interest rates, amid concerns raised by senior politicians that there may have been a series of miscarriages of justice. If the traders are successful in their application - which is opposed by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) - it could lead to the quashing of all remaining convictions secured in nine criminal trials. Tom Hayes, a former trader at the Swiss bank UBS, became thefirst banker to be jailedfor \"rigging\" interest rates in August 2015. He was accused at the age of 35 by the United States Department of Justice and the Serious Fraud Office of being a \"ringmaster\" of an international fraud conspiracy and sentenced to 14 years in jail. Together withformer Barclays trader Carlo Palombo,he is now awaiting a crucial Supreme Court judgement. Hayes and Palombo were among 37 City traders prosecuted for \"manipulating\" the interest rate benchmarks Libor and Euribor, which track the cost of borrowing cash between the banks and are used to set the interest rates on millions of mortgages and commercial loans. In criminal trials onboth sides of the Atlanticfrom 2015 to 2019, 19 were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and nine were sent to jail. As they served time, evidence emerged that central bankers and government officials across the world, including a top adviser at 10 Downing Street at the time, had pressured banks such as theirs to engage in very similar conduct to what they were jailed for – but on a much greater scale. No central banker or government official was prosecuted. Then, soon after they were released after serving their full jail tariffs, a US appeal court decided such conduct wasn't a crime after all; nor even against any rules. The US Department of Justice revoked the charges against Tom Hayes, and the US courts then threw out all similar convictions. Yet in the UK, they remain convicted criminals. The Serious Fraud Office, which prosecuted the cases, says the defendants were convicted of conspiracy to defraud and points to a number of previous unsuccessful attempts to overturn convictions at the Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court's now being asked to decide if judges were wrong to tell juries their conduct was unlawful. If it does so, it could lead to the overturning of all remaining convictions, throwing a global 17-year scandal into reverse. It's also likely to prompt renewed calls for a public inquiry into evidence of much larger interest rate \"rigging\" – ordered from the top of the financial system by central banks and governments worldwide. This is the first time the cases have reached the Supreme Court following public pressure from senior politicians, including former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and former Brexit Secretary David Davis. They have told the BBC they're concerned the traders have been \"scapegoated\" in a scandalous series of miscarriages of justice that runs \"deeper than the Post Office\". They want a public inquiry. What the FTSE 100 or the Dow Jones are to share prices, Libor is to interest rates: an index, updated every day, that tracked the cost of borrowing cash between the banks from 1986 until 2024. Each day at 11am, 16 banks across London would answer a question: at what interest rate could they borrow money? Before answering, traders on the banks' cash desks would look at the range of interest rates at which other banks on the market were offering to lend cash, which normally differed from each other by just one or two hundredths of a percentage point (e.g. HSBC offering to lend funds at 3.14%, Bank of China at 3.16%, JP Morgan at 3.15%). Each bank would then select a rate from that range of offers to submit as their answer. An average would then be taken to get the official benchmark, Libor (London Interbank Offered Rate). A similar process was used to get Euribor, the equivalent of Libor for euros. The evidence against Hayes and Palombo were messages they had sent to the cash traders asking them to select a 'high' or 'low' rate from that range, depending on what might benefit their banks' trades – which went up or down in value linked to Libor (or Euribor). Their requests might make no difference to the average; or they might nudge it very slightly in their bank's favour – up or down by no more than one eighth of one hundredth of a percentage point (0.00125%). But it was seen as worth the effort of making the requests, which had been industry practice for years, in case it might help their bank make more money or lose less. Prosecutors alleged Hayes was dishonestly seeking to manipulate the Libor rate to benefit the bank's trading positions and therefore his bonuses while \"cheating\" others trading on the market, \"motivated by pure greed\". The SFO accused Palombo of being a \"crook\" and a \"cheat\" who had \"left his moral compass at home\". The traders protested that any potential gains to their bonuses from a nudge to Libor of a maximum 0.00125% were far too little to motivate a criminal conspiracy. What they saw as the clerical task of choosing 'high' or 'low' rates based on the commercial interests of the bank - was merely what every bank had done since the 1980s, long before they started work. But according to the SFO, it was interest rate \"manipulation\" that amounted to evidence of an international conspiracy to defraud. At his 2015 trial, Hayes said he had not asked for any false answers to be given to the Libor question – but merely tried to ensure his bank selected a commercially advantageous rate from the range of accurate interest rates at which it could genuinely borrow. But the judge, Mr Justice Jeremy Cooke, decided that any attempt to take into account commercial interests when submitting a Libor rate was \"self-evidently\" unlawful. Sentencing Hayes to 14 years, he dismissed the argument that it was City practice. \"The fact that others were doing the same as you is no excuse, nor is the fact that your immediate managers saw the benefit of what you were doing and condoned and embraced it, if not encouraged it.[…] The conduct involved here must be marked out as dishonest and wrong and a message sent to the world of banking accordingly.\" The defendants say court rulings retrospectively criminalised not only their actions years before, but also those of senior bankers and civil servants, much higher up the financial pecking order, who had sought to influence Libor on a much greater scale. Audio recordings, documents and data uncovered by the BBCindicate that in the 2008 financial crisis, governments and central banks from the Bank of England to the Banque de France and Banca d'Italiapressured banks to push Libor and Euribor down artificiallyin order to make real interest rates appear lower than they were and quell speculation about banks' solvency - a highly commercial motive. The difference, though, was that whereas the traders were asking for shifts of one hundredth of a percentage point, the central banks sought moves up to 50 times the size, giving rates that were obviously false, far away from the range of interest rates where cash was being borrowed or lent on the money markets. In a BBC Radio 4 podcast series exposing the scandal,The Lowball Tapes, Palombo asks despairingly, \"If that's not criminal, how can I be a criminal?\" Contemporary emails and phone transcripts, official interviews by the FBI andfirst-hand accountsof witnesses point to the involvement of top officials at Downing Street and the Treasury. They were not shown to the juries at the traders' trials. Palombo describes his life since being prosecuted as a \"Kafka nightmare\" where he could barely understand the accusations made against him, with no sense of having done anything even vaguely wrong. To him and to Hayes, one of the most serious implications is that what happened to them could happen to anyone in the workplace - to them, if normal commercial practice can be retroactively criminalised, no-one can be sure that the daily tasks they're currently engaged in at work won't, in years to come, be condemned and prosecuted. The Treasury has said it did not seek to influence individual bank Libor submissions. The Bank of England has said Libor was not regulated at the time. The Banque de France, Banca d'Italia and the Federal Reserve have declined to comment. In the traders' cases the Court of Appeal, led by judges including Lord Chief Justice John Thomas and Lord Justice Nigel Davis, blocked the path to the Supreme Court five times from 2015 to 2019. In 2021, the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) initially said it wouldturn down Hayes's application. But then in January 2022 a US appeal courtfully acquitted two former Deutsche Bank traders,Matt Connolly and Gavin Black, saying prosecutors had failed to produce any evidence they had asked for false rates to be submitted at which their banks could not borrow. All US convictions for 'rigging' Libor were subsequently thrown out. The pair had initially been convicted in 2018 on similar charges to Hayes and Palombo. The following year, the CCRC was persuaded to change its mind. In 2024, Court of Appeal judges certified, for the first time in these cases, that there was a point of law of general public importance at stake, finally clearing the path to the Supreme Court. Two months ago, the Supreme Court heard arguments that judges in the lower courts had told juries that Hayes and Palombo's requests were wrong as a matter of law – when it should have been left as a matter of fact for the jury to decide. The SFO told the court the defendants didn't challenge the jury directions at the time. Hayes and Palombo now await the Supreme Court's judgement. The decision has been condemned by trans rights advocates and by gender critical activists. The regulator issues new guidance after the Supreme Court ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law. The bank is closing its branches in Bridgnorth and Ludlow, saying demand for the services had fallen. A month on from the landmark Supreme Court ruling, how is the transgender community feeling? Organisers say a recent Supreme Court decision on the Equality Act was an attack on trans rights.",

    "article_text": "A mother and her three children who died after a house fire that took place in north-west London in the early hours of Saturday morning have been named by police. Nusrat Usman, 43, her daughter Maryam Mikaiel, 15 and two sons Musa Usman, eight, and Raees Usman, four, died when the house in Stonebridge, Brent, went up in flames, the Metropolitan Police said. A 13-year-old girl, who has not been named, remains in hospital in critical condition while a woman in her 70s has been discharged. A man, 41, was arrested on suspicion of murder outside the property. He has since been bailed and detained under the Mental Health Act, the Met said. Officers were called to Tillett Close at around 01:20 BST on Saturday, attending alongside the London Fire Brigade (LFB). Two terraced three-storey homes were gutted in the fire. Eight fire engines and about 70 firefighters from stations across Wembley, Park Royal and Willesden were sent to tackle the blaze. Ateddy bear and flowerswere seen laid near the properties on Sunday. Supt Steve Allen, from the local policing team, said on Sunday that specialist officers were supporting the family. \"Our thoughts go out to all those impacted by what has happened,\" he said. \"Local officers are working closely with officers from the Specialist Crime Command on what continues to be a very complex investigation.\" Extra officers will also be deployed to the area in the coming days, he added. A woman and child were initially rescued from the second floor of one of the affected properties and received emergency care but were declared dead at the scene, the LFB said on Saturday. Two more children were found inside the property and also declared dead, it added. Keeley Foster, LFB assistant commissioner, described the incident as \"extremely tragic\" and said the attending crew were met with a \"well-developed fire\". She added that the LFB would work with the Met to determine the cause of the fire. One neighbour, who said the family had moved to the UK from Pakistan more than 20 years ago, told the BBC that after hearing smashing and screaming, she had gone out to find the building on fire. Mohamed Labidi, a 38-year-old teacher who lives in Tillett Close, told the news agency PA that the family were \"really good people\". Another neighbour said she felt \"numb\" and was \"stunned by the devastation\" the fire had caused. The leader of Brent council, the local MP and London's mayor have all expressed their condolences. An animal hospital says freeing a fox stuck on a road is one of the most horrific cases it has seen. Up to 10,000 fans will gather to mark the club's Champions League victory on Bank Holiday Monday.

As for the show itself, six months ago showrunner Russell T Davies said that no decision would be made on commissioning series three until after series two had been broadcast. With Doctor Who being co-produced with Disney+, one of the factors will be whether the BBC and the streamer decide to renew that arrangement, and what alternatives could be explored if they decide not to. And those kind of discussions take a significant amount of time. The Reality War is on BBC One (Disney+ internationally) on Saturday. This section contains spoilers for The Last Of Us, season 2 The first season ofThe Last of Uswas haunting, terrifying and moving in equal measure. So there was a lot to live up to when season two kicked off - but it has not disappointed. The TV adaptation of the hit video game stars Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal as lead characters Ellie and Joel. But early on in the new season, Joel was brutally killed. In doing so, showrunners chose to remain faithful to the game - but I've still not fully recovered from the trauma of it all. Thankfully for Pascal fans, the latest episode treated us to more scenes with the actor as it went into flashback mode. For me, this demonstrated once again why this series is so excellent - it jumps from the terror of dodging zombies and ruthless militia to poignant, heart-wrenching moments, in a way you can never quite tell what's coming next. All this to say, the season has been building up to one heck of a final episode. UK viewers can watch it on Sky this Monday. On Monday, K-pop boyband Seventeen are turning 10 years old, and they're celebrating by releasing a long-awaited new album. Called Happy Burstday, it features 16 new tracks including three group songs and 13 solo songs and is their first full-length album in nearly three years. Seventeen, which boast a whopping 13 members, have had a remarkable 12 months, including making history asthe first K-pop act on Glastonbury's main stagelast summer. Unlike most Korean pop acts, they don't do collaborations - and they also write and produce their own material. Not much information has been provided about the new album yet, but a teaser video on the band's social media channels revealed a cake with candles spelling out \"Happy Birthday\", before transforming into the title, Happy Burstday. \"New tour, new unit single album, new Seventeen content... and more to come,\" it promised fans, with press notes suggesting the band is ready to \"embrace a fearless new era\" as they enter their second decade. By Tom Richardson, Newsbeat reporter After taking players out of their comfort zones for years, developer FromSoftware is getting out of its own. The Japanese studio – famous for its incredibly challenging single-player titles such as Dark Souls and Bloodborne – is turning its hand to online multiplayer. Elden Ring Nightreign, launching on PS5, Xbox and PC from Friday, drops squads of players into an ever-shifting landscape where they must survive for three days and nights against waves of enemies and hulking bosses. A follow-up (of sorts) to smash-hit Elden Ring, it swaps the sprawling RPG's giant map and methodical gameplay for fast-paced, three-player action. There's little doubt that the developers - masters of meticulously designed combat systems – will have effectively tweaked its trusted formula to fit the new mould. But drawing players away from multiplayer behemoths like Fortnite and Call of Duty has proved, for others at least, to be a challenge more fiendish than even FromSoftware could dream up. Disney's Lilo and Stitch remake and the latest Mission: Impossible become two of the year's biggest films. Artists and festivalgoers give their takes on the big talking points from Radio 1’s Big Weekend in Liverpool. The long-serving host leaves the BBC after apologising for sharing an antisemitic social media post. The group provide a rousing end to the final day of the weekend-long music festival in Liverpool. A hotel where the Beatles superstar stayed just months before he quit the band is to be demolished.",

    "title": "A self-created fairy story: The rise and fall of Michelle Mone",
    "article_text": "Michelle Mone spent 25 years building her business empire and public profile through the British media. A brilliant self-publicist, she was regularly described as one of the UK's most successful businesswomen. She was the plucky underdog who, through sheer grit and a knack for a good headline, pushed her Ultimo bra concept onto the marketplace and into the high street's biggest shops. She even claimed to have given Hollywood star Julia Roberts a cleavage. The story she told time and time again to a grateful media brought her fame, riches, and even a peerage. But Baroness Mone of Mayfair has now been stripped of the Conservative whip, is on leave from the House of Lords and a business connected to her is under investigation by the National Crime Agency. How did it come to that? That's the question a newtwo-part BBC Scotland documentaryseeks to answer. The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone begins in 1999 as the then 28-year-old talks her way into Selfridges in London, and a deal to sell her gel-filled Ultimo bra. Born in her own words \"into nothing\", Mone was raised in the Dennistoun area of Glasgow. She left school at 15 with no qualifications but a determination \"to make something of myself\". Friends from the time describe her hard work ethic, energy and \"bubbly\" nature. \"No matter where you're from, look at me, you can do it,\" she would later say. She worked as a model and \"ring girl\" at boxing matches and moved into promotions and sales before setting up MJM International with husband Michael. They re-mortgaged their house and went £70,000 into debt developing the Ultimo Bra, which is when Mone turned up unannounced at Selfridges. Virginia Marcolin was the shop's lingerie buyer, and the person Mone had travelled to London to see. \"I thought: 'This girl is not what I'm used to dealing with'. She was kind of country bumpkin and a little bit like not overly refined, just very authentic. And this was just such a fresh, new product,\" she says. \"That was the start of it. It was her persistence.\" Mone's natural knack for promotion got them the deal but the cash-poor company needed funds to fulfil the order. They found an investor in Tom Hunter, who in 1998 had just sold his sportswear company JJB Sports for £280m. The man who made that introduction was Jack Irvine, former newspaper editor turned successful PR executive. He became a key figure in building Mone's early media profile. The newspapers and broadcasters were hungry for stories about her, and she was very happy to help. \"She had two driving forces,\" Irvine says. \"One was to be very rich and one was to be very famous.\" Coverage from that time stressed her humble roots, battle to succeed, new-found wealth, and the global success of her bra. Magnus Llewellin, now editor of the Times newspapers in Scotland, remembers one infamous story from the time. \"Stories would circulate around Michelle Mone. One of those was that her bra was used in the film Erin Brockovich, that Julia Roberts wore one of her bras,\" he says. \"If you actually bother to check, somebody involved in the actual making of the film came out and said an Ultimo bra wasn't used in the production.\" The truth is that the media, especially the Scottish media, helped create the Michelle Mone myth. And she had a gift for using that. \"The story was almost too good to debunk. A young woman fighting in a male-dominated business world, making a way for herself. That was a great story to tell,\" Llewellin says. After more than 20 years together as a couple and more than a decade in business, the Mones very publicly separated, divorcing in 2011. Michelle bought Michael out of the business and became the face and body of the brand, modelling her own lingerie. Behind the scenes at the company there were a number of employment tribunals, including one high-profile case in which a member of staff found a recording device in his office. Despite her legal challenges, Mone remained in the public eye, a regular feature on television programmes. And her knack for publicity led to her next move - into the world of politics. She had been a Labour supporter but defected to the Conservatives in 2010. Four years later she was a prominent voice in favour of the union during the independence referendum, going so far as to say she would leave Scotland in the event of a 'Yes' vote. In 2015, Prime Minister David Cameron made her his government's \"entrepreneurship tsar\". Within weeks it was announced she was to become a Conservative peer, as Baroness Mone of Mayfair. By then she had sold her interests in the company she had built. But her new roles brought increased scrutiny over her business record. Magnus Llewellin points out that MJM International never turned over more than £10.1m a year, and in 2012 lost more than half a million pounds. \"By that time the company was in real trouble,\" he says. Businessman Donald Anderson runs the Gap Group, a plant hire company which in 2024 had a turnover of £302.3m, employed more than 2,000 people, and made a pre-tax profit of £43.9m. He wrote to the prime minister at the time of Mone's appointment. \"Miss Mone is not a successful entrepreneur, she is a small time businesswoman with a PR exposure far in excess of any actual success,\" he wrote. He now says: \"If the only thing she achieved was self-publicity, I don't think that's a very good reason to put you into the House of Lords. If you follow that logic then the House of Lords will be full of influencers in the next 10 years.\" In 2016, Mone announced she was in a new relationship with Doug Barrowman, a billionaire businessman. They settled in the Isle of Man, and worked together in the booming crypto-currency sector. In 2020, the Covid pandemic struck. As the death toll rose, UK ministers sought out firms to urgently supply Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), even setting up a VIP lane to give priority to some suppliers. A company called PPE Medpro made it onto the VIP list. This caught the eye of campaigners who were concerned that firms on the list were run by people with connections to the Conservative Party. It emerged that PPE Medpro was controlled by people connected to Doug Barrowman. Mone, a Conservative peer, repeatedly denied any involvement in the business, the deal or the subsequent profits. Butthe Guardian uncovered a connectionto government ministers. The paper's David Conn says: \"We did our own freedom of information request, and we got the emails that she'd sent to Michael Gove and Lord Agnew saying that she was offering to supply PPE through 'my team in Hong Kong' and that it had gone through the VIP lane. \"And we also got some WhatsApp messages which Michelle Mone had sent about the PPE deals and she said she was sitting on the jet and it was about to take off, which we assumed was their jet, their private plane.\" The National Crime Agency (NCA) launched an investigation into PPE Medpro. Several of the couple's properties were raided. Two years into his investigation, David Conn received a leaked document showing Barrowman made at least £65m from the deals, with £29m of this paid into a trust of which Mone and her three adult children are beneficiaries. Throughout this time, Mone was uncharacteristically quiet. But that changed at the end of 2023 when she and Barrowman - by then married - released a PPE Medpro-funded documentary in which she admitted being a \"conduit\" between the company and ministers. They also agreed to appear on the BBC'sSunday with Laura Kuenssbergprogramme. On camera, Mone admitted she could one day benefit from the trust, and said they had done nothing wrong. When asked about lying to the press, she replied: \"That's not a crime. \"Saying to the press I'm not involved, to protect my family, can I just make it clear, it's not a crime.\" Laura Kuenssberg says: \"That's a phrase that will always stick with me. \"When she said that, I thought: 'There's a thing. There's a headline'.\" Michelle Mone lost the Conservative whip and has taken a leave of absence from the House of Lords. She has made no further media appearances. PPE Medpro is still under investigation by the NCA and the government is suing the company for £122m plus costs, claiming the medical gowns the company supplied \"did not comply with the specification in the contract\". The peer declined the offer to be interviewed for The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone. In response to the programme, a statement said the couple had provided \"full and detailed statements to the NCA and cooperated with the investigation throughout\". It said they had never been arrested and no charges had been brought against them. The statement also defended PPE Medpro's delivery of PPE equipment to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). It continued: \"Baroness Mone, along with the whole of the Mone/Barrowman family, were beneficiaries of trusts... never direct recipients of PPE Medpro profits. \"The DHSC was fully aware of their involvement from the outset. It was a mistake to have misled the press.\" Michelle Mone's public life was a self-created fairy story which many in business, politics, and especially the media, bought into. For Magnus Llewellin, there's a clear moral to this tale. \"What it does tell us about modern Britain is, we still like fairy tales. We want to believe those rags to riches tales. \"But once you step into the world of politics, things can get a bit trickier. \"It's a parable of excess, hubris, and then eventually nemesis.\" Laura Kuenssberg says: \"For Michelle Mone, public attention, knowing how to grab public attention, is an ability that she obviously always had in spades during her business career. \"But things went wrong for her and you can't turn that attention off.\" The Rise and Fall of Michelle Mone isavailable on iPlayerand is on BBC Scotland at 22:00 on Monday 26 May and BBC Two at 21:00 on Wednesday 28 May. Firearms officers arrested at 29-year-old man at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital hospital in Glasgow.

    "title": "'We didn't see it as treason': The Russian couple who became informants for Ukraine",
    "article_text": "It was shortly after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 that Sergei and Tatyana Voronkov decided they would leave Russia. The couple, who had long been critical of Vladimir Putin, had condemned the actions of Russia to friends and acquaintances. In response, they were told that if they didn't like it they could leave. So the couple, both Russian citizens, decided to relocate to Ukraine, where Tatyana was born. In 2019 they eventually settled in Novolyubymivka, a village of about 300 people in the south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region. The couple got four dogs and started raising livestock, while Sergei, 55, also found work as a land surveyor – his specialism during his time in the Soviet army. They hoped for a quiet life. But when Moscow launched its full scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the peace of their new lives was shattered by the first Russian rockets flying over their home. \"I heard something whistling, something flying, and I went outside,\" Tatyana, 52, recalls. \"A rocket was flying right over the house. \"I went on the internet to see what had happened and they wrote that Kyiv had already been bombed.\" The couple quickly found themselves in occupied territory, and decided to become informants for Ukraine. What followed was detention, interrogation, an escape into Europe – and a letter of thanks from the Ukrainian army. It was when a Russian convoy passed their home for the first time that Tatyana decided to act. She ran inside and messaged an acquaintance in Kyiv, whom she believed had contacts in Ukraine's security services. The contact sent her a link to a chatbot on messaging app Telegram which told her they would be contacted by a person with a unique identifier. The couple were then asked to provide the location and details of Russian electronic warfare systems and military hardware they had seen, particularly missile systems and tanks. The locations would help the Ukrainian army target and destroy Russian troops in the area with drones and artillery. \"We didn't think of it as treason,\" says Tatyana, who along with Sergei insists the information they gave did not result in any strikes on civilians or civilian infrastructure. \"Nobody attacked Russia. This was a fight against evil.\" For two years, Sergei would collect coordinates and Tatyana would transmit them from her phone - removing all traces of the messages afterwards - as and when their village's internet access allowed them to do so. But all of this came to an end when Sergei was detained in April 2024 by armed men while he was shopping for gardening seeds in the regional centre of Tokmak. Sergei says he was taken to an abandoned house and put in a cold basement pit - around two metres wide and three metres deep - where he slept in a squatting position. The next day he was questioned about whether he had passed details of Russian positions to the Ukrainians. Sergei says a bag was kept over his head during the interrogation and he was threatened with violence. After initially denying his involvement, Sergei confessed on the fourth day of his captivity, fearing that if he were subjected to violence he might accidently implicate others. While all of this was happening, Tatyana was desperately searching for information on his whereabouts. She travelled the area and phoned hospitals and morgues, while the couple's son, who was still living near Moscow, contacted various authorities there. Ten days after Sergei's arrest, security forces searched the Voronkovs' home and dug up $4,400 that had been hidden by the couple in their garden. Shortly after, Tatyana was told that her husband was \"sitting in a basement\" and was with Russia's security services, the FSB. Weeks later, after 37 days in captivity, Sergei was made to confess to assisting Ukraine on camera by people who introduced themselves to him as FSB. But to his surprise, he was released two days later, though almost all of his documents, including his passport, were confiscated. To this day, Sergei and Tatyana do not understand why he was released. However, the BBC understands this is not uncommon in parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia, where investigative and judicial processes lack transparency and often no explanations are given as to why a person is detained or released. In the weeks after Sergei's release, the couple believe they were kept under surveillance, with cars constantly driving up to their home and strangers asking them if they were selling anything. Believing they'd never be left alone, the couple began plotting a way to leave. After consulting human rights activists, Sergei and Tatyana decided to try to travel to Lithuania. But to do that, they needed to return to Russia first to get Sergei a new passport. Their neighbours in Novolyubymivka helped by buying livestock and household appliances from them. The couple even managed to find a new home for their dogs, which Sergei says was his biggest worry. The couple set off in their car. Fearing they could be pulled over and quizzed by Russian forces, they made up a cover story about going to the beach to get fresh air for Tatyana, who has asthma. They even brought a straw hat and a rubber ring to make the story more convincing. But in the end they weren't stopped. The couple were initially denied entry into Russia, but were eventually able to enter after Sergei got a certificate proving he had applied for a new passport. After delays in getting his passport and a thwarted attempt to leave Russia via Belarus, Sergei bought a fake passport through Telegram. The couple were then able to travel by bus to Belarus and cross the border using Sergei's forged document. From there, they crossed into Lithuania, a member of the European Union and a close ally of Ukraine, though Sergei was detained for holding forged documents. He was later found guilty of using a fake passport by a Lithuanian court. The couple are now living in a shelter for asylum seekers and hope to settle in Lithuania. The Ukrainian army sent them a letter of thanks - at the request of their former handler in Kyiv - to support their application for asylum. The BBC has seen a copy of the letter. The BBC has also seen documents from official bodies in both Russia and Ukraine that confirm what happened to the Voronkovs. We are not reproducing them to protect the identities of those involved. The Voronkovs' actions have caused deep rifts in the family. Their son, who remains in Russia, stopped talking to his parents after learning what they had done.  Sergei's mother, who is 87, still lives in Russia and is supportive of the war and President Putin. But despite this, the couple are adamant they will never return to Russia. \"Only if it starts showing some humanity,\" Sergei says. \"For now, I see nothing human there.\" Play for Ukraine in Reading hopes to provide a vehicle loaded with essential items for Ukraine. On Ukraine peace talks, the Kremlin has played for time through deflections and side-steps, writes the BBC's Steve Rosenberg. As Arctic ice melts, global powers seize new opportunities to extract oil, speed up trade and boost their military presence. They each handed over 270 servicemen and 120 civilians on the Ukrainian border with Belarus. Lyudmila Vasilyeva is fined for \"discrediting\" the Russian army after calling for an end to Moscow's war in Ukraine.",

    "title": "Radio 1's Big Weekend: Five takeaways from 'Scouse Coachella'",
    "article_text": "Music lovers, you made it. Festival season has arrived, getting off to a loud and lively start in Liverpool for Radio 1's Big Weekend. Around 100,000 people flocked to Sefton Park for \"Scouse Coachella\", as it became known, enjoying around 100 acts across three days - and even a little sunshine between the showers. So what went down? Newsbeat spoke to artists and fans about the big talking points. ...is just getting started. \"This is the most nervous I've ever been and I have no idea why,\" Sam Fender told the crowd during his much-anticipated headline set on Saturday night. It marked the start of a big summer for the North Shields singer-songwriter - the first of many huge shows across the country off the back of his latest album People Watching. There may have been some teething problems and tech issues at points - he was seen struggling with his guitar connection at times. But it didn't stop the crowd spontaneously chanting anthems like Seventeen Going Under and Hypersonic Missiles long after the songs had finished, bringing a smile to Fender's face. His vulnerability and relatability is part of what makes him endearing to his followers. In some respects, he's an unlikely superstar - but he's about to become an even bigger one. For fans Chevy and Emily - who became friends at a Sam Fender gig - it's his \"local hero\" vibe. \"Every time I see him it's the same excitement,\"Emily told Newsbeat.She's in for an exciting few months. It's not a Big Weekend without Anthems sets - inspired by the Radio 1 brand, throwing it back to bangers from the '00s and '10s. A lot of the Liverpool crowd weren't even born when Sugababes and Natasha Bedingfield dropped their biggest hits, but it didn't stop them singing every word. \"Our music is timeless,\" Sugababes told Newsbeat backstage - and the fans agree. It was \"very nostalgic\"for Laura and Alicewho said \"it's so good to see them back\". It may have been more than 20 years since the group first pushed the button. But with new generations taking inspiration from Y2K culture, their new millennium, pop-meets-R&B energy has had a recent resurgence - inspiring younger acts like FLO - and it's not going away anytime soon. By Saturday morning, rumours were swirling around Sefton Park - suggesting Ed Sheeran would be the \"Secret Set\" opening the New Music stage. After it was confirmed on social media, fans rushed to the tent - but a few songs in, the area had \"reached capacity\". Sheeran - who's spent the last couple of years selling-out massive stadiums around the world - said he wanted to play the smaller tent to feel the \"energy\" - and those lucky enough to be there loved the intimacy. \"He's the biggest artist in the world\" for fan George, who described it as \"a mental pull - the fact they managed to get him for a secret set\". But for those shut out after the area was closed like Kate, 20 and Scarlett, 19, it was disappointing he wasn't on the Main Stage, where more fans could have seen him. \"I messaged my mum when it got announced,\" Kate tells Newsbeat. \"Her and my sister were so jealous, and I was like, 'I'll send you videos!', but I'm not going to be able to.\" When this year's Main Stage headliners were announced, fans and journalists were quick to point out that they were all white and male acts. The BBC defended the line-up, telling Newsbeat at the time that female artists would make up around 60% of it - adding that \"Radio 1 has a rich history of supporting and championing female and diverse artists\". \"It's very lazy,\" Self Esteem tells Newsbeat backstage, when asked about the lack of female headliners. But the singer, whose real name is Rebecca Lucy Taylor, says the \"music industry is still so heavily-weighted in favour of men\". From Tate McRae to HAIM on the Main Stage and Joy Crooks to JADE in the New Music tent - Sunday was seen as a day for women, demonstrating the depth and breadth of female talent. Fans, like Ellie,praised the waythat Lola Young represents women in a \"real\" and authentic way. These acts might not have closed the Main Stage this time, but for many, they stole the show. The BBC says Radio 1 will \"continue to advocate\" for representation in the industry. If you've been to a festival in recent years, you'll have either used or been surrounded by disposable vapes, despite some events banning them. As the last major festival before a UK-wide ban on 1 June, there were special bins at the Big Weekend to recycle them. Some people we spoke to at Sefton Park weren't aware of the upcoming law change, while others said it was sad. Many had planned ahead, including Izzy, who's training to be a doctor. \"I've got a reusable one now,\" she said, adding she would usually \"have a pack of cigs\" at a festival but she'd \"hate smoking that in a crowd and a vape's easier\". But if vapes are now part of every festival, there's been so much about this Big Weekend - the first ever in Liverpool - that's felt unique to the city. From the warmth of the people, to the hundreds of red football shirts on display as Liverpool lifted the Premier League down the road - it's felt like a three-day celebration of the people and culture. Additional reporting by Shaun Dacosta, Eleanor Doyle & Manish Pandey Listen to Newsbeatliveat 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen backhere. Match of the Day's Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Micah Richards discuss Mohamed Salah's \"ridiculous consistency\" for Liverpool and how his \"deadly\" style of play is so difficult to stop. The group provide a rousing end to the final day of the weekend-long music festival in Liverpool. A hotel where the Beatles superstar stayed just months before he quit the band is to be demolished. Oliver Glasner says Crystal Palace are disappointed with a 1-1 draw to Liverpool on the final day of the Premier League season but overall, expresses happiness with his side's campaign after securing a 12th placed finish in the table to go with their FA Cup triumph. Liverpool midfielder Curtis Jones pays tribute to his departing team-mate Trent Alexander-Arnold following the Reds final game of the season a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace at Anfield.",

    "title": "Alan Yentob: BBC TV's creative giant, on screen and off",
    "article_text": "As the face of documentary series like Arena, Imagine and Omnibus, Alan Yentob was usually seen interviewing the biggest names in the arts and entertainment. But viewers may not have realised the extent to which the broadcaster helped shape the very TV channels he appeared on. Having begun his career as a documentary maker, Yentob went on to hold virtually every major job in BBC television, including running both BBC One and BBC Two. As a commissioner of programmes, he introduced audiences to such perennial favourites as Absolutely Fabulous, Have I Got News for You and Wallace and Gromit. Like Sir David Attenborough before him, Yentob's career eventually saw him return to his first love - film-making - becoming a cultural figure in his own right. Alan Yentob was born in Stepney, east London, in 1947, the son of Jewish immigrants from Iraq. The family moved to Manchester before returning to a flat on London's Park Lane - where the traffic noise was so bad that he struggled to do his homework. Despite attending an expensive private school, his grades weren't quite good enough for Oxford. So Yentob spent time at the Sorbonne in Paris, before studying law in Leeds - where he fell head-over-heels in love with drama. His twin brother Robert did the expected thing and joined the family textile business. Alan was determined not to. In 1968, he applied for a BBC traineeship - with an application verging on cocky. He wrote: \"My dramatic debut at the age of nine in The Merry Wives of Windsor was greeted with a gratifying critique by one of my contemporaries: 'You ought to be a film star, cos you've got smashing legs'.\" Somehow, it worked. Yentob joined the trainee scheme as the only non-Oxbridge recruit of his year group. A few years later, having only made one short film, about Dave Prowse - the actor  who played Green Cross Code man and provided the on-screen presence of Darth Vader - Yentob hit the big time. Cracked Actor, his fly-on-the-wall documentary about David Bowie, portrayed a mentally fragile pop star struggling with cocaine addiction. \"Our encounters tended to take place in hotel rooms in the early hours of the morning, or in snatched conversations in the back of limousines,\" Yentob recalled. \"He was fragile and exhausted, but also prepared to open up and talk in a way he had never really done before.\" Rolling Stone magazine later called it the \"greatest rockumentary ever\". Soon afterwards, Yentob was asked to take over BBC arts programme Arena. He ditched its magazine format and turned it into a series of documentaries on subjects like Mel Brooks (who became godfather to Yentob's children), Orson Welles, and even the Ford Cortina. A decade later, he was poached to become the BBC's head of music and arts, and began a rapid ascent of the corporation's hierarchy. As one of the youngest ever controllers of BBC Two, he let Jennifer Saunders rip with Absolutely Fabulous, her comedy about the world of fashion and PR. She even dropped his name into one episode as an in-joke. He introduced a live arts discussion programme called The Late Show, brought Nick Park's beloved Wallace and Gromit to a national audience, and gave an obscure motoring journalist by the name of Jeremy Clarkson his first go at presenting Top Gear. In so doing, Yentob was credited with blowing off the cobwebs at BBC Two in the face of a new creative powerhouse in the television landscape: Channel 4. In 1993, he was promoted to run BBC One - where one of his first tasks was to axe the channel's biggest investment for years, Eldorado, the sunshine and sangria soap set in Spain. The set near Malaga had cost £2m to build, but the clunky plot lines and poor sound quality were, Yentob insisted, damaging the network's brand. By 2002, the media landscape was rapidly changing. Yentob launched children's channels CBBC and CBeebies in his new role as the corporation's director of drama, entertainment and children's - revolutionising the viewing habits of kids previously restricted to an hour or two of shows after school. Dressed in his trademark suit and trainers, he helped commission new shows like The Office, The Thick of It and Life on Mars - as well as overhauling classics like Doctor Who. TV executive Wayne Garvie, who worked for the BBC's commercial arm, believed Yentob was one of the corporation's most creative forces. \"When the BBC was creating shows like Dragons' Den, launching CBBC, making comedies like The Office – who was the man overseeing production at that time? Yentob,\"he told the Guardian in 2015.\"It's never been the same since.\" The folowing year,the newspaper's Sam Knightdescribed him as \"Britain's most influential TV executive of the last half-century\". In 2004, Yentob was announced as the corporation's creative director. It was a rather amorphous role that gave him licence to have his say almost everywhere. It also allowed him room to step back in front of the camera to present a new series, Imagine. It ran for 20 years, exploring every corner of the world of the arts including encounters with rapper Jay-Z, arts supremo Charles Saatchi, comedian Billy Connolly, and his old friend Mel Brooks. There was controversy when it was claimed the programme had used shots of him nodding during interviews he had not conducted - creating the false impression he had been present. But a staff investigation reportedly found that no fake \"noddies\" had ever been broadcast. His expenses came under scrutiny when he claimed £3,381 for a business class flight from London to New York for filming. In 2015 a children's charity of which he was chairman - Kids Company - collapsed. There were grumblings from within BBC News that Yentob tried to influence journalists against running the story and, eventually, he resigned as creative director. At the time, Yentob said the speculation had been \"proving a serious distraction\" when the BBC was in \"particularly challenging times\". BBC News concluded that he did not influence its reporting of Kids Company. In 2021, the founder and former trustees of the charity, including Yentob, werecleared of any personal wrongdoing. Yentob continued to front Imagine, making memorable portraits of writers like Maya Angelou, architect Frank Gehry and artist Rachel Whiteread. But even the best-connected man in British television could not prevent the series from being almost entirely axed in 2023. With arts programmes struggling to deliver international sales, the BBC announced it would only commission the occasional one-off special. Having been appointed a CBE in the 2024 New Year Honours List, he sat down for an interview with his old friend, Sir Salman Rushdie. The controversial author was still recovering from an assassination attempt, and spoke movingly about how members of the public had tried to save him. It was to be one of Yentob's last major pieces of work for the BBC - an organisation he had been so much part of for nearly 60 years. And, having never lost his enthusiasm and creativity during that precipitate rise through the ranks of BBC senior management, he had a special bond with many of those he interviewed. \"As an executive,\" the late Australian broadcaster Clive James once said, Alan Yentob \"was more of an artist than the artists.\" Alan Yentob: A look back at a colourful, creative life and career Gerry Adams is suing the BBC over a 2016 story in which it was alleged he sanctioned the murder of Denis Donaldson.

    "title": "Call for freeze on Syrian asylum claims to end",
    "article_text": "Ministers are facing calls to start processing Syrian asylum applications again, as new figures showed more than 7,000 people are still in limbo. The UK paused decisions on Syrian claims for asylum and permanent settlement in December, after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad. But more than five months on, Syrians in the UK still do not know when their claims will be assessed. Charities including the Refugee Council say the current situation has left people in an \"indefinite limbo\" and are calling for claims to be processed again on a case-by-case basis. The government said decisions were paused \"while we assess the current situation\". A Home Office source said this was \"a necessary step while there is no stable, objective information available to make robust assessments of risk\" on people returning to Syria and the policy \"will remain under constant review\". A total of 7,386 Syrians were waiting for an initial decision on an asylum claim by the end of March,according to the latest figures published on Thursday. Assad's regime was overthrown by a rebel offensive led by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in December, after years of civil war. HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa was named as Syria's interim president earlier this year, but the situation remains uncertain and HTS is still designated a terrorist group by the UK. In December, the Conservatives suggested most Syrian asylum claims were related to the threat posed by Assad's government and those people could return when it was safe to do so. However, Haytham Alhamwi, chairman of the Syrian British Consortium, said while many Syrians left because of Assad's rule others may still feel unsafe to return. \"Many of them are still calling for democratic change in Syria, which is not guaranteed at the moment. Some of them were afraid of those military groups, they didn't come running from Assad himself,\" he told the BBC. The number of Syrian asylum claims fell by 81%following the UK's decision to pause decisions. However, despite a sharp drop, 299 Syrians came to the UK on small boats in the first three months of this year - 5% of the total number of arrivals. People claiming asylum do not normally have the right to work while their case is being considered and are provided with government-funded accommodation and financial support to pay for essentials if they would otherwise be destitute. Jon Featonby, chief policy analyst at the Refugee Council, said that as well as leaving Syrians \"stuck in limbo\" this also had an impact on the taxpayeras the government is paying to house many of them. More than 5,500 Syrians were living in government-funded accommodation at the end of March. Of these, 2,130 were in hotels, which the government has pledged to stop using for asylum seekers. With Labour promising to clear the overall backlog of asylum claims, Mr Featonby said the situation was causing a \"blockage\" in the system. Azadi - not his real name - arrived in the UK by small boatin June 2023 and is waiting for a decision on his asylum application. The 25-year-old, who is Kurdish, said he was grateful to the UK government for providing him with food and accommodation but he wanted to be able to work and pay tax. \"I stay at home a lot of the time,\" he told the BBC. \"Every day is the same. I am not progressing so it is stressful.\" Earlier this year,the new Syrian government signed a deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)which integrated its military and civilian institutions into the state and recognised the Kurdish minority. But Azadi said he did not trust the new government and felt Syria was not safe for Kurds, who were denied basic rights during Assad's rule. He said his hometown had been destroyed by the civil war and there was no way for him to get an education there. \"It's not a life there at all,\" he added. The pause also applies to Syrians who have already been granted refugee status and were initially given the right to stay in the UK for five years before they can apply for permanent settlement - also known as indefinite leave to remain. The Refugee Council says that whilst this group still have the right to live and work in the UK, their temporary status can often make it harder to secure a job or housing. Mr Featonby said Syrians in the UK were also nervous about whether they will be allowed to stay if the government's position on Syria changes and it is deemed a safe country. Leen Albrmawi arrived in the UK in October 2019 and applied for indefinite leave to remain last year. However, she said her \"whole life collapsed\" when the government paused decisions for Syrians in December. The 28-year-old had been accepted to study business at university but was told she was not eligible for a student loan because she did not have the right to live in the UK permanently. After spending the last five years obtaining the necessary qualifications to apply, Leen was devastated she could not afford to take up the offer. Meanwhile, her employer, a telecoms company, has been chasing her for an update on her leave to remain application. Leen still has the right to work while her application is pending but is concerned she could lose her job. She also fears that if the Home Office changes its position on Syria she could be forced to leave the UK. \"I literally have no one in Syria, no family, nothing,\" she told the BBC, adding that her hometown had been destroyed in the civil war. Leen lives in Salford with her mother and sister,who already have British citizenship as they came to the UK earlier than her. \"I've been in the UK now nearly six years, so I've built my whole life here,\" she said. Mr Featonby said the Refugee Council recognised the situation in Syria had changed but there was unlikely to be clarity on how safe the country would be in the future anytime soon. He suggested people who were seeking protection for reasons unrelated to the previous regime could have their claims prioritised.

    "title": "Rayner refuses to confirm if two-child benefit cap will be abolished",
    "article_text": "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has refused to confirm whether the government is planning to scrap the two-child benefit cap. On Sunday,the Observer reportedthat Sir Keir Starmer had privately backed abolishingthe limit and requested the Treasury find the £3.5bn to do so. The policy prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Asked on Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg if she would like to see the cap go, Rayner said: \"I'm not going to speculate on what our government is going to do.\" She pointed to the establishment of a Child Poverty Taskforce, which had been considering whether to remove it, among other measures. \"We're looking in the round at the challenges. That is one element,\" she said, givingplans to speed up housebuildingas an example. It followsthe delay of the government's child poverty strategy- being worked on by the taskforce - which had been due for publication in the spring. The BBC has been told it could be set out in the autumn. On Tuesday, a memo from Rayner's departmentleaked to the Daily Telegraphappeared to urge the chancellor to \"claw back\" child benefit payments from wealthier families, alongside several other suggestions. Asked if she backed the proposal on Sunday, Rayner refused to be drawn. She told Laura Kuessberg that ministers were \"looking at child poverty\" and that she supported what the government had done so far. She was also categoric in her denial of being behind the leak. \"I do not leak. I think leaks are very damaging,\" she said. It was put to Rayner that some in Labour had characterised her as jostling for Sir Keir's job as a result of the memo being shared. \"I do not want to run for leader of the Labour Party. I rule it out,\" she said, adding that being the deputy prime minister was the \"honour of my life\". She also denied that there were splits in Sir Keir's cabinet, saying: \"I can reassure you the government is solid.\" Questions around the two-child benefit cap come afterthe prime minister announced a U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments, following weeks of mounting pressure. Sir Keir said the policy would be changed in the autumn Budget, adding that ministers would only \"make decisions we can afford\". Asked if any change would arrive before this winter, Rayner said it would be for Chancellor Rachel Reeves to outline at the \"next fiscal event\". More than 10 million pensioners lost out on the top-up payments, worth up to £300 a year, when it was limited to only those in receipt of pension credit. On Sunday,Nigel Farage said he would fully reinstate the allowanceand scrap the two-child benefit cap if Reform UK formed the next government. \"Farage says a lot of things,\" Rayner said in response to a question about his remarks. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch later told the programme of Farage's intervention: \"This is nonsense. People are just making promises, throwing out all sorts of things, but they won't be delivered.\" The country could not afford to lift the two-child benefit cap, she said, adding the public are \"sick and tired of politicians making promises they cannot keep\". However, when asked about winter fuel payments, Badenoch urged the government to restore them in full. Reform UK also plans to scrap the two-child benefit policy, as part of plans to outflank the government. The train company is the first to transfer to public control under the current government. As the chancellor prepares to set government budgets for future years, who are likely winners and losers? Some MPs are calling on the chancellor to raise taxes on the wealthy instead of cutting welfare. The taskforce, which is working on the strategy, has been considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap.",

    "article_text": "The bodies of five skiers have been found by rescuers near Switzerland's luxury Zermatt resort. They were recovered a day after emergency services were alerted by a group of climbers ascending the Rimpfischhorn - a 4,199-metre peak in the Valais Alps - to several pairs of skis left unattended near the summit. Aerial and ground searches led to the discovery of the bodies below the summit on the Adler Glacier, Valais local police said in a statement on Sunday. The victims were found at varying altitudes on avalanche debris in high altitude areas near the Swiss-Italian border. Three bodies were located in one area and two more were discovered higher up on a narrow patch of snow, rescue service Air Zermatt said. A fifth pair of skis was later found during the search, confirming that the group had travelled as a party of five. Their identities have not yet been formally released. The public prosecutor's office has opened an investigation into the circumstances of the accident. Zermatt is one of Switzerland's more premium Alpine resorts, visited by affluent British and other European skiers. But the climb to Rimpfischhorn is considered a more advanced expedition, around five hours from the resort. There are a number of approaches to the climb, all of them requiring an overnight in a high hut. From Zermatt the usual way is to take lifts to Blauherd at 2570 meters. In a separate incident on Friday night, Air Zermatt was also involved in a challenging mountain rescue on the Fiescherhörner, where four alpinists were stranded amid fog and high winds. The initial evacuation attempt had to be aborted due to the weather, but a second attempt just after midnight brought all four to safety. The police say that eight people were in the area on a ski tour and all but one were swept away. Here's your guide to the grand final as the great Eurovision party heads to Basel in Switzerland.

    "article_text": "A dual US and German citizen was arrested on Sunday for allegedly attempting to burn down the US embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, according to the justice department. Officials said they arrested Joseph Neumayer, 28, at John F Kennedy Airport in New York.  He was deported by Israeli authorities after he was found with explosive devices in a backpack near the embassy. Mr Neumeyer appeared in court on Sunday and is being held in jail, the justice department said. \"This defendant is charged with planning a devastating attack targeting our embassy in Israel, threatening death to Americans, and President Trump's life,\" said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. The arrest comes just days after a gunman killed two Israeli embassy staff members outside a Jewish museum in Washington DC. Federal officials say Mr Neumayer arrived in Israel in April and on 19 May headed to the US Embassy in Tel Aviv with a dark-colored backpack. The 28-year-old spat on an embassy guard as he walked by, the justice department said. When the guard tried to detain him, Mr Neumayer allegedly ran away, leaving behind a backpack with three Molotov cocktails, small bombs made with flammable liquids that are meant to start fires once they are lit and thrown. Police later found Mr Neumeyer at his hotel where he was arrested, the justice department said. Officials say he had posted on his social media account pledging to \"burn down the embassy in Tel Aviv\" and had called for \"death to America, death to Americans\". Officials say Mr Neumeyer also threatened to assassinate Trump in social media posts on another account believed to be connected to him. Mr Neumeyer was sent back on Sunday to the US, where he was arrested. He faces a maximum of 20 years in prison if convicted. Last Wednesday, a young couple, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were shot dead outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington DC. Police identified the suspect as 30-year-old Elias Rodriguez from Chicago, who they say shouted \"free Palestine\" after he shot the couple. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is expected to attend a memorial in Israel for the victims on Monday. A British surgeon working in Nasser Hospital said he had operated on the doctor's surviving 11-year-old. This has been a tumultuous week for the Jewish state, the BBC's Paul Adams writes. Police say the victims, a young couple, were shot by a man who shouted \"free, free Palestine\". The attack is being investigated as a hate crime and could lead to the death penalty, prosecutors say. The aid, including flour and baby food, was picked up three days after Israel eased an 11-week-long blockade.",

    "article_text": "A second power outage in two days has hit the French Riviera region after a fire at a substation in Nice overnight, which authorities said was caused by a malicious act. At least 45,000 homes were affected after the blaze broke out at around 02:00 local time (01:00 BST) on Sunday, a day after nearby Cannes suffered a massive blackout that was blamed on suspected sabotage. Police in Nice say \"tyre tracks\" were found and the door to the substation, in the west of the city, was \"broken\", according to local media reports. Nice Airport, the tramway network, and neighbouring towns of Saint-Laurent-du-Var and Cagnes-sur-Mer, were impacted before power was restored later in the morning. Nice's mayor Christian Estrosi said on X that he \"strongly denounced\" the \"malicious acts that affect our country\". The city's deputy mayor, Gaël Nofri, said the substation fire was \"probably of criminal origin\". It came a day afterCannes suffered a major blackout during the international film festival.Officials said it may have been caused by an arson attack on a substation. Around 160,000 homes in the city and surrounding areas lost power. Several screenings were interrupted by the power cut in the morning, before festival organisers were able to switch to private generators. At the moment, no link has been established between the two incidents. Estrosi said authorities would reinforce the security network around the Nice's electric sites. An investigation into \"organised arson\" has been opened. Nice prosecutor Damien Martinelli was quoted by AFP news agency as saying investigations were underway, in particular \"to clarify the damage and the manner in which the act was committed\".",

    "article_text": "Mumford & Sons closed this year's Radio 1's Big Weekend with a thrilling set full of new and old songs. The headline act played hits such as I Will Wait and Rushmere to entertain the crowd at Sefton Park in Liverpool, complete with fireworks and confetti. Other artists on the Main Stage through the day included Tate McRae, Lola Young, Jorja Smith, Wet Leg and Haim. Speaking ahead of their performance, Mumford & Sons lead singer Marcus Mumford told BBC Newsbeat the band were \"stoked to be headlining again\". He added that it had \"been a while\" since they played big shows, but were keen to use Big Weekend to \"get back in the saddle for us and find our home again\". The group managed to squeeze a lot into the one hour slot they had, something they had thought about while preparing. \"[We had to] figure out how we're going to supply people with the essence, and the finest perfume of Mumford & Sons,\" guitarist Ted Dwayne said. In the crowd, Sian was singing along and told a roving BBC Newsbeat reporter that she had seen the band a few years before with the same people she was with on Sunday. \"It's a full-circle moment,\" she said. Another fan, Kurtis, reacted: \"Amazing, just so much fun. what a lovely way to end the weekend.\" The day saw mixed weather at the festival site, with Tate McRae's early high-energy performance basking in the sunshine contrasted with fans braving a heavy downpour to watch Haim later on. But many fans were not deterred by the downpours. After Haim told the crowd the band would \"party harder\" in the rain, Rebecca said Mumford & Sons \"would be just as good in the rain as well\". Her friend Izzy adds: \"It's a good atmosphere - I feel emotional.\" Elsewhere, the New Music Stage was headlined by Jade, formerly of Little Mix, and also saw performances from South Arcade, Joy Crookes, Flo and Self Esteem. Jade told Newsbeat she was feeling \"a little bit nervous\" ahead of her set, because it was her \"first big solo performance\". Admitting she's had \"tunnel vision\" about the set, fans in the New Music Tent were cheering her on with every song. Over the three days, an estimated 100,000 music fans enjoy around 100 performances across four stages. Tom Grennan thrilled on Friday with surprise acts including Ella Henderson, Mel C, The Zutons and KSI. The Higher singer described \"headlining the biggest weekend of the summer\" as \"pretty crazy\". He followed The Wombats, Natasha Bedingfield, James Hype and Biffy Clyro, who also performed on the Main Stage. Saturday saw a nervous Sam Fender lead the crowd in singing hits Seventeen Going Under and Hypersonic Missiles. Before that, fans saw Tom Odell, Sugababes, Myles Smith, Blossoms and Wolf Alice on the Main Stage. But the highlight for many was the surprise set by Ed Sheeran on the New Music Stage, announced just a few hours before it took place on Saturday. The Shape of You singer said he chose that stage because he'd \"never played it before\" and felt the tent had \"the best energy\". You can catch highlights of Radio 1's Big Weekend onBBC iPlayer.

    "title": "Villa make refereeing complaint after missing out on Champions League",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played 'The ref's blown too early' - How error may have cost Villa Champions League football Aston Villa have complained to referees' body Professional Game Match Officials Limited after a \"big mistake\" by official Thomas Bramall contributed to themlosing 2-0 at Manchester Unitedand missing out on the Champions League. With the match goalless and Villa down to 10 men after goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was correctly sent off, the visitors thought Morgan Rogers had given them the lead. Rogers nudged the ball away from United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir as he attempted to gather and slotted home. However, Bramall blew for a foul, thinking Bayindir had two hands on the ball, though television footage showed otherwise. Because Bramall stopped play before the ball entered the net, the video assistant referee (VAR) could not intervene. Moments later, Amad Diallo headed United in front - and Christian Eriksen's late penalty condemned Villa to a defeat that meant they finished sixth and missed out on Champions League football on goal difference. In Villa's post-match news conference, director of football operations Damian Vidagany said the club were unhappy 35-year-old Bramall had been given such an important game. \"We are going to send a complaint,\" said Vidagany. \"The complaint is not about the decision, it is about the selection of the referee - one of the most inexperienced referees in the Premier League. \"It's not about the decision, clearly it was a mistake. The complaint is about the referee. The problem is why the international referees were not here today.\" This video can not be played 'We have to accept the mistake of the referees' It was initially indicated that Villa would complain to the Premier League, but they  later said they had written to PGMOL. Villa stated their belief a \"more experienced referee\" should have been appointed to a game \"with such high stakes\". \"Of the 10 referees to officiate across the Premier League today, Mr Bramall was the second least experienced,\" the club said. \"The decision to disallow Morgan Rogers' goal, which would have given the club a 1-0 lead with 17 minutes remaining in the match, was a major contributing factor to the club not qualifying for the Champions League. \"We acknowledge the outcome will not change, but we believe it is important to address the selection methodology to ensure high-stakes matches are treated as such with regards to officiating and to ensure the implemented VAR technology is allowed to be effective.\" Bramall first refereed in the Premier League in August 2022 and his games this season have largely been in either the top flight or the second tier, with 11 in the Premier League and 12 in the Championship. Villa manager Unai Emery was visibly furious with the decision to disallow Rogers' goal - and award United their late penalty. Speaking after the game, he said: \"The TV is clear but, of course, we have to accept it. It was a mistake. A big mistake.\" PGMOL - the body responsible for refereeing games in English professional football - declined to comment. So, what do the Football Association (FA) laws say? Law 5 states: \"The referee may be assisted by a video assistant referee only in the event of a 'clear and obvious error' or 'serious missed incident' in relation to: goal/no goal, penalty/no penalty, direct red card (not second caution), mistaken identity when the referee cautions or sends off the wrong player of the offending team.\" A message on social media from the Premier League match centre read: \"The referee's call was a free-kick to Manchester United with Bayindir deemed to be in control of the ball before Rogers gained possession. \"The whistle was blown by the referee before the ball entered the goal, therefore the incident was not reviewable by the VAR.\" Villa captain John McGinn, speaking to TNT Sports, admitted United deserved to win but said the decision to not give the goal was \"incredible\". He added: \"Everyone wanted the correct decisions when the VAR was implemented. You watch rugby... even if the referee has awarded a try and it's wrong, it's overturned. \"It's so, so hard to take, especially when the impact it has on us - as a club and a team - is so big. If you were 1-0 up at that point and all you need is a point to get to the Champions League, it's costly. \"The referee didn't really know what to say. He is a young referee who has progressed very quickly. Maybe we could look at having more experienced referees.\" Law 12 states a goalkeeper is considered to be in control of the ball with the hand when: The ball is between the hands or between the hand and any surface or by touching it with any part of the hands or arms, except if the ball rebounds from the goalkeeper or the goalkeeper has made a save Holding the ball in the outstretched open hand Bouncing it on the ground or throwing it in the air BBC Match of the Day pundits Alan Shearer and Micah Richards were in agreement with Aston Villa, that Bayindir was not in control of the ball. Former England striker Shearer said: \"You would be absolutely raging if you were Aston Villa and rightly so. \"It is an error and the referee has blown too early so VAR can't intervene. A huge error when you look at the ramifications. \"The keeper makes a mess of it, never has control of the ball. Morgan Rogers has every right to get the ball. I understand the anger, I really do.\" Former Manchester City defender Richards added: \"It is a howler. If you look, he is not in control of the ball. The referee has made a mistake and it should have been a goal. \"He has made a mistake, as simple as that, and the problem was because the ref blew too early he couldn't go to VAR. \"For Aston Villa to be so close, it is just not good enough. Referees make mistakes, we know they do, but he just needed to calm down.\" Emery approached Bramall as he left the field at the end of the game Villa were probably the club in greatest need of qualify for the Champions League next season because they have made the second highest losses in Premier League history (Â£678m) - only exceeded by Chelsea (Â£1.257bn). While Villa will have earned record revenues in 2024-25 (after revenue of Â£276m in 2023-24), they are still substantially behind the 'Big Six' - Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Tottenham and Chelsea - the clubs their owners want to challenge for Champions League places on a regular basis. Since being promoted to the Premier League in 2019, Villa - under new owners Wes Edens and Nas Sawiris - have been one of the bigger spenders in terms of transfer fees - investing more than Â£868m on players. The owners have backed a series of managers - Steve Bruce, Dean Smith, Steven Gerrard and Unai Emery - but at a significant cost. The good news for Villa fans is the funding for the transfers has come from the owners' pockets in the form of shares, instead of borrowing and incurring interest costs. A lot of the transfers have been on credit terms which, while not unusual in the Premier League, means Villa owe more than Â£150m in previous purchases. Champions League qualification would have helped the club deal with the cash requirements in respect of some of these former player purchases. Villa have only managed to break even once in the past 15 years, and that was solely because of the sale of Jack Grealish. Former owners Randy Lerner and Tony Xia both walked away from the club having lost over Â£100m. Villa's wages-to-revenue ratio last year was 96% and only the last-gaspÂ£42m sale of Douglas Luiz to Juventusensured they would comply with financial regulations. Champions League football was again crucial to Villa's immediate financial future this year, with the revenue in that competition four times as much as the Europa League. It is therefore likely sales will be needed this summer, but who could go? Martinez's emotional reactionat the end of Villa's final home game of the season suggested he feels his time at the club is over. Forward Leon Bailey is a likely departure, but academy graduate Jacob Ramsey would generate the most profit if Villa need to claw back cash before the 30 June accounting deadline. Villa have a Â£40m option to turnMarcus Rashford's loan from Manchester Unitedpermanent but it is difficult to see that happening in the Europa League. Barcelona have publicly stated their interestin the England international, and while Rashford has enjoyed his time at Villa, there have been no talks over a permanent deal and a move to Spain would be difficult to resist. Real Madrid loaneeMarco Asensiohas made a bigger impact, and reports have suggested talks over a move from PSG have begun. A place in the Champions League would have helped that.

    "title": "'Big Four' reunite at Nadal's French Open farewell",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played The 'big four' reunite for Nadal at Roland Garros Rafa, Roger, Novak and Andy. The names roll off the tongue for the modern-day tennis fan as quickly as John, Paul, George and Ringo do for a Beatles geek. This fab four - or the Big Four as they are known - of the ATP Tour's post-millennium golden era are not seen together much these days, with Rafael Nadal becoming the third of the group to retire at the end of last year. But he, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray reunited on Sunday as the French Open gave an emotional farewell to its 14-time champion. \"After all these years fighting for everything, it's unbelievable how time changes the perspective of things,\" an emotional Nadal, 37, told his rivals-turned-friends after they strode out to join him on Court Philippe Chatrier. \"All the nerves, pressure, strange feelings when you see each other when you're rivals, it's completely different when you finish your career. \"We built amazing rivalries but I think in a good way, we fought hard for titles but were good colleagues and respected one another. \"It means a lot that you're all here. I really enjoyed a lot pushing myself to the limit every single day to compete with all of you.\" Nadal cradled his son Rafael Junior on his way out of Court Philippe Chatrier Federer, who famously held hands with Nadal as they cried during the final match of the 43-year-old Swiss' career, received the first warm embrace, with hugs for Djokovic and Murray following. Djokovic, 38, arrived in Paris just hours earlier after winning the 100th title of his career on Saturday, while Briton Murray laughed afterwards he had thought he would be at the ceremony in his role as the Serb's coach. Their partnership came to an end earlier this month, resulting in French Open tournament director Amelie Mauresmo asking 38-year-old Murray if he could still make it. \"I didn't know they would be here - but I could imagine they would come,\" Nadal said. \"The agendas of people sometimes are difficult. But of course they know that [being there] would make the day very special for me.\" Murray travelling to Paris from London and back on Sunday was a measure of his respect and appreciation for Nadal, who he became friends with when they were juniors. \"What he went on to achieve was amazing, particularly here,\" Murray told a small group of reporters. 'Gracias Rafa' - why retiring Nadal means so much Why was Rafael Nadal so good on clay? 'Nadal's success made Roland Garros feel like the Bernabeu' \"People say it all the time with records but I genuinely think that this one, I would be really very, very surprised if that gets broken. \"It is going to stand the test of time I think. \"He's an amazing, amazing player, a great guy, and it was great to see him have a proper send-off.\" Nadal later gave an amusing anecdote which offered further insight into his friendship with Murray. \"After Arsenal beat Real Madrid [in the Champions League], he messaged me. \"I'll read it out to you: 'Hey Rafa, I haven't spoke to you in a while - just checking in to make sure you are OK'. \"It took me five seconds to realise what I was reading. I thought 'he's such a nice guy'. This British sense of humour. By the way - I didn't text him back when PSG beat Arsenal.\" Nadal was overcome by emotion and filled up with tears on several occasions during the ceremony Nadal played the bulk of his 115 French Open matches on Court Philippe Chatrier and won each of his 14 titles on the most famous clay court in the world. Six months after the final match of his career at the Davis Cup Finals in Spain, he returned for a special farewell. Nadal matches on Chatrier used to be a sea of Spanish red and yellow. On Sunday, the colour scheme was Roland Garros terracotta. Each ticketholder was handed a T-shirt on their way into the 15,000-seater stadium, creating a palette which matched the colour of the surface which Nadal dominated for so long. Even before Nadal appeared for the 50-minute ceremony, the chant of \"Rafa! Rafa! Rafa!\" rang out as his adoring audience waited for his arrival. The majority rose to their feet when a suited-and-booted Nadal walked out, including Carlos Alcaraz - long seen as the heir to Nadal's crown - and reigning women's champion Iga Swiatek. A lengthy round of applause lasting more than a minute followed. It left Nadal overcome with emotion, biting his lip and wiping his mouth as he absorbed the acclaim. After watching a showreel of the iconic memories he made at Roland Garros, Nadal paid tribute to his family - who were sat in the front row of the presidential suite - the tournament and the French fans. The presence of Rafael Nadal's family -  father Sebastian, mother Ana Maria, wife Mery, son Rafael Junior and sister Isabel - has been constant throughout his career Towards the end of a speech conducted in Spanish, French and English, Nadal could not hold back the tears any more. He sniffled through a message of thanks to one specific family member - his uncle Toni, the man who taught him tennis from the age of three and coached him to 16 of his 22 major titles. Following the cameo of Federer, Djokovic and Murray, there was still time for one more surprise. Mauresmo and French Tennis Federation president Gilles Moretton unveiled a silver plaque, featuring Nadal's footprint, next to the Chatrier net post. \"It was perfect. I could not have expected a more emotional day. It was unforgettable with plenty of emotions,\" Nadal said. \"For a guy like me, who does not like these sort of things, I am still a bit shy and don't like to be the centre of attention. But I enjoyed it a lot.\" Reigning French Open champions Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek were among the 15,000 crowd watching the ceremony 'Merci Rafa' was printed on the commemorative T-shirts given to the crowd Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "Salah has final say on day of 'special' Liverpool celebrations",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played How centrepiece Salah bring brilliance to Liverpool - Analysis It had to be Mohamed Salah. With just six minutes left of what has been a memorable title-winning campaign for Liverpool, the Egypt forward hit arecord-equalling goal against Crystal Palaceon Sunday to ensure the season finale party at Anfield did not follow a defeat. The goal was Salah's 29th in the league and that tally, along with his 18 assists, meant he moved level with Alan Shearer and Andy Cole for the most goal involvements in a Premier League season. It also meant he secured a fourth Golden Boot, equalling the record held by Arsenal legend Thierry Henry. \"Mo Salah has had an incredible season,\" former Arsenal and Manchester City forward Ellen White said on BBC Radio 5 live. \"Not only is he prolific in front of goal but he is creative as well. \"He showed great professionalism when there was so much talk around his contract and he just got better and better as the season went on. \"It's great that we get to see him in the Premier League for another couple of seasons.\" Mohamed Salah has won the Premier League Golden Boot for a record-equalling fourth time Salah's goal and his significant contribution to Liverpool's record-equalling 20th league title win - that moves them joint level with Manchester United - was one of many things being celebrated on a day that will live long in the memory of the club's fans. The Reds, of course, won the Premier League in 2020 but that was during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the title secured in empty stadiums because people were banned from gathering in large numbers. That meant this was the first time Liverpool's players and supporters were able to celebrate lifting the trophy together since 1990, and boy did they savour it. This video can not be played Slot looking forward to 'celebrating PL title with fans' The party atmosphere started long before kick-off on a sunny day in Liverpool, with the streets around Anfield a sea of red as supporters gathered in huge numbers, regardless of whether they had a ticket for the match or not. With Crystal Palace having won the FA Cup last week, their fans had also arrive in party spirit and there was a classy moment before kick-off when, after receiving a guard of honour by the Palace players, the home team formed one of their own to mark the Eagles' trophy success. A host of Liverpool legends were in attendance including former Reds boss Jurgen Klopp, while their former captain Alan Hansen returned to Anfield after recovering from a serious health issue to present the trophy at full-time. Even when Ismaila Sarr put Palace ahead, the Kop did not skip a beat as they worked their way through a catalogue of Liverpool songs. But Salah's goal and the full-time whistle resulted in the loudest cheer perhaps ever heard for a 1-1 draw as Liverpool ensured there was to be no end-of-season blemish on the campaign. \"These players and these fans hate losing and that is what they showed today,\" said Reds boss Arne Slot. \"It Is 35 years since the fans could be part of it. Everyone could see what it meant to them and that is what makes it special. \"You play football for yourself and your family but also for the fans and these ones are special.\" Trent Alexander-Arnold is widely expected to join Real Madrid in the summer No-one was in any mood for negativity, so it was a nice touch that Trent Alexander-Arnold was cheered onto the pitch as a half-time substitute to play his final 45 minutes in a Liverpool shirt. Having been booed by some Reds' fans at Anfield in the game after announcing he would end his two-decade long association with the club at the end of the season, the response this time was only positive as his first touch of the ball was greeted by huge applause. There were more big cheers when he was presented with the trophy and the full-back struggled to hold back the tears as he hugged his team-mates for a final time on the Anfield pitch. \"I didn't know what to expect stepping out at Anfield after what had happened a few weeks ago,\" Alexander-Arnold told Sky Sports. \"I wanted to play for the club one more time and he (Arne Slot) trusted me to play. To get the reception I got means more than anything. \"I've played hundreds of games for the club but I've never felt so loved and cared for than today. \"There wasn't a day, minute, second that I didn't think about the team. Twenty years is a very long time time but I've loved every single minute of it. The ups and the downs. \"It's been an honour and privilege to be part of. \"I'll remember this day. It's very special for me. It goes down as the best day of my life.\" This video can not be played 'Trent, thank you so much' - Jones thanks Liverpool 'legend' It was fitting that Alexander-Arnold's final Liverpool performance was up there with some of his best. He displayed his incredible range of passing to help turn the tide of the match in the home side's favour. \"It was no surprise they [the fans] were brilliant today, and also towards Trent,\" added Slot. \"It also helped what an unbelievable half he played. He deserved it, I'm very happy for him in and around the club. \"Everyone could see how difficult he had it after the game and that shows how hard it is to leave the club. That is all we can do, make it hard for players to leave the club but it was great for him to have the farewell.\" Last summer, Liverpool perhaps raised a few eyebrows by not being particularly active in the transfer market, with striker Federico Chiesa their main arrival. But with Alexander-Arnold departing they are likely to be busier this summer to ensure they stay ahead of their rivals. Work on that is already under way with tjhe Redsmoving for Bayer Leverkusen duo Jeremie FrimpongandFlorian Wirtz.Frimpong can play anywhere down the right-hand side, while Wirtz is an attacking midfielder. \"We want new players and ideally you sign them as early as you can,\" added Slot. \"This club doesn't start work from today, there has been already so much hard work done behind the scenes.\" But regardless of who may arrive in the summer, Slot hopes that Sunday's scenes of celebrations will drive those already at the club on to achieve more success. \"Hopefully the appetite will be big,\" he said. \"That is what we have to see in the upcoming weeks. A few have already shown they can win multiple times. They just keep on performing year after year. \"We know it will be tough again, it was already tough this season and it will be just as tough or tougher next season.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "'Now Isak has the stage he craves as Newcastle secure golden ticket'",
    "article_text": "Manager Eddie Howe takes the acclaim after leading Newcastle United back into the Champions League Newcastle United's players entered St James' Park into an atmosphere at boiling point with a message stretched across the entire length of the famous Gallowgate End outlining what was at stake. \"You Entered The Pitch As Players. You Left It As Legends\" was emblazoned on a giant banner as the club's quest to reach the Champions League went to the final stages against Everton. Newcastle and manager Eddie Howe got there in the end to go some way towards that status â but it did not go smoothly as hoped. Howe's side were a pale shadow of their usual vibrant selves as Everton shut out the deafening noise sweeping down from the Toon Army to deservedlywin 1-0,Newcastle riddled with nerves and tension throughout, the mood spreading to the stands. And for 11 anxious minutes in the second half, in the time it took Carlos Alcaraz to head Everton in front after 65 minutes and until former Sunderland forward Amad Diallo put Manchester United ahead against Aston Villa at Old Trafford to return Newcastle to the top five, it looked like they would be leaving the pitch heartbroken. In the end, all was well that ended well as they added the golden ticket of a return to the Champions League to the silver, with their first domestic trophy in 70 years and first success of any kind since 1969following the Carabao Cup finaltriumph against Liverpool. Even then, some Newcastle players were clearly unaware of events at Old Trafford when the final whistle signalled defeat, Tino Livramento and others slumping to the turf in dismay, looking like they believed the place in Europe's elite competition had been lost. Once Aston Villa'scontroversial losshad been confirmed, the Champions League anthem sounded around St James Park, full-scale elation breaking out among Howe, his players and their families, and the fans. The anxiety, and the many televised shots of Newcastle's supporters biting their nails, was forgotten as they went through their full Champions League song-sheet in readiness for next season. Newcastle secure Champions League place despite home defeat by Everton Which Premier League sides have qualified for Europe? Newcastle United players celebrate after reaching the Champions League despite defeat at home to Everton on the season's final day Despite the anti-climax of this performance, it capped a superb season for Newcastle and their inspirational manager Howe. The start to their campaign was overshadowed by financial uncertainly as Howe became a reluctant seller to avoid the club breaking profit and sustainability rules. It has ended in glory, with the estimated Â£100m riches of the Champions League flooding into the coffers. The notion of Newcastle winning silverware and qualifying for the Champions League seemed a distant prospect during those troubled times. A transfer of England forward Anthony Gordon to Liverpool was considered, while there was a concern a Â£100m buy-out clause for Brazil midfield man Bruno Guimaraes might also be activated. No offer came from Anfield for boyhood Liverpool fan Gordon, nor for Guimaraes, so it was talented young duo Yankuba Minteh and Elliott Anderson who were sacrificed to Brighton and Nottingham Forest respectively. To add to Howe's frustration, the summer-long pursuit of Crystal Palace's Marc Guehi also ended in failure, with no deal done and the England defender remaining at Selhurst Park. Howe, though, managed the instability superbly, recovering from an indifferent start to lead his side to that long-awaited trophy, then changing the club's landscape even further by taking them back into the Champions League. It has been a remarkable piece of management, clearing away any clouds of uncertainty still lingering at St James' Park. And Howe sounded in the mood to move Newcastle forward in a significant manner when he discussed this summer's transfer business. \"Yes, it is going to be a big transfer window,\" he said. \"It's difficult to say on numbers, but I do think it's a window that we have to be active in and I'm sure we will be. \"The power of the Champions League and the pull of the Champions League is huge and we can't get away from that, the excitement that this will bring for the people here. \"And of course it's a selling point for us now, it's an opportunity for us to sell that dream to future players that might be considering coming to us. Newcastle's resolve â which in their defence has never wavered â to keep outstanding striker Alexander Isak may just have been tested had they failed to finish in the top five. Now the Swede has the stage he craves, and which his ability deserves. Talk of a new contract will replace any speculation about a departure. The same will apply to coveted, and influential, midfield duo Guimaraes and Sandro Tonali. Jacob Murphy, at 30, finally fulfilled the potential Howe believed he had with eight goals and 12 assists in 30 Premier League games, while Isak, inevitably, was the spearhead with 23 goals and adding six assists in 34 league appearances. At the heart of it all is Howe, whose legendary status on Tyneside has been cemented even further by this landmark and memorable campaign. He believes Newcastle will be in better shape following their last Champions League appearance during the 2023-24 campaign, when they had an outstanding 4-1 home win over French champions Paris St-Germain but failed to reach the knockout phase. \"The experience we had there the first time will help us no end, I think,\" admitted Howe. \"We felt we grew through the competition, so I think we are stronger. I think we are better prepared both physically and mentally for the competition ahead.\" Newcastle have already had one big parade and party for the Carabao Cup success. The celebrations on Sunday may not reach those heights, but the significance of what has been achieved, albeit with their season ending in defeat, cannot be underestimated.

    "title": "Norris win 'incredible' but pole 'more emotional'",
    "article_text": "Lando Norris is three points behind his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri in the drivers' championship Lando Norris said his victory in the Monaco Grand Prix was an \"incredible\" feeling, but that he was \"more emotional\" about taking pole position the day before. Norris drove a perfectly controlled race to win Monaco from the front, while the new rule mandating drivers use three sets of tyres introduced extra jeopardy but made no difference to the result. But, for Norris, the fact that he had been able to end a difficult run of qualifying results, and perhaps begin to turn a corner in the struggles he has been having with the McLaren this year, had potentially deeper meaning. Norris' pole in Monacowas his second of the year and his first since he won the season-opening race in Australia from the front of the grid. In the meantime, team-mate Oscar Piastri had taken three poles and four wins and seemed to be establishing himself as the championship favourite. But Norris' pole-then-win in Monaco, combined with Piastri's struggles to third in both qualifying and race, cuts the Australian's lead to just three points, and also increases Norris' advantage over Red Bull's Max Verstappen, fourth in Monaco, to 22 points. \"Today is incredible, but I was more emotional yesterday than I was today,\" Norris said. \"That's how much yesterday meant to me, to kind of get my groove back in qualifying, because it's something I've just had my whole life. \"It's just always been good, until this year. And I've had to work hard to try and get it back. For no other reason apart from a couple of things that I've clearly struggled with and also just having tough competition.\" Norris wins in Monaco to narrow gap to Piastri Drivers give mixed reviews to Monaco two-stop rule Norris has found this year's McLaren car difficult to drive on the limit, not providing him the front-end bite or feedback he requires to be fast. He and his engineers have been working on this hard over the past few weeks. So to be the fastest man around one of the most demanding tracks on the calendar, where precision is more important than anywhere else, meant a lot. \"Yesterday gave me confidence,\" Norris said. \"Todayâ¦ yeah, nothing new in the sense of I've had confidence in every Sunday we've had this year. I've not needed the confidence on Sundays, but yesterday was a bigger day for me. \"I was more proud of yesterday than I almost was of today. Not just because a pole in Monaco sets up a win, but the accomplishment of doing it, no matter what the track would have been, was something I'm more proud about. \"So yeah, a good weekend for me, not just in terms of the result but personally, to kind of give myself that momentum, that boost, definitely makes me feel better going into Barcelona next week.\" Both he and McLaren team boss Andrea Stella, though, were reluctant to call this a definitive breakthrough. After qualifying, Norris said it was \"definitely a step in the right direction\". After the race, Stella said: \"Lando deserves to be praised for a very, very well-managed and executed weekend. And I think this is just the start of many more coming in the future. \"I don't want to think about a turning point. The journey that we are going through with Lando is the counterpart of a journey that we are going through with Oscar. \"They are simply different in terms of what we are doing, because the two drivers are in different phases, or were in different phases, and because of the characteristics and the opportunities to work on. \"This is a journey that is not changed by one stage of the journey. Certainly, this one can help a lot with the consolidation of the work that we have done. \"It shows that when you put together and you pull off good work, and you believe in this work, then you see the results. \"So I think this can cement what we have done so far, but for me we are nowhere near at the final destination.\" Piastri, as befits a man of such coolness, was keeping it all in perspective. \"The margins are so fine, and if this is a bad weekend, it's not going too badly at all,\" he said. Verstappen and Red Bull tried what they could in the race. They left their final stop to the last lap. It put them in the lead, from fourth place, after Norris, Leclerc and Piastri had made their final stops. Had the race been stopped as a result of a big accident - not uncommon in Monaco - it would have meant they grabbed an unlikely victory, because of a rule that allows drivers to change tyres under a red flag but keep position. But the red flag did not happen, and Verstappen dropped back. Lewis Hamilton should have benefited, but the Ferrari driver lost too much time - in traffic and otherwise - and was not close enough to move up from fifth. Verstappen, always expecting a difficult weekend in Monaco because of the Red Bull's traditional struggles in low-speed corners and over bumps and kerbs, said he had \"no grip\". \"When we think about the championship,\" he said. \"I just want to go race by race, of course, some tracks you might be a bit better.\" The Spanish Grand Prix at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya this coming weekend should bring Red Bull back into the game more. \"Less low-speed corners, more high-speed,\" Verstappen said. \"Hopefully, that will suit the car a bit better. It should be, yeah. I'm sure, well, I hope. Because if we're 0.7 seconds a lap behind in Barcelona, that would not be good.\" A change to the rules, introducing tougher tests on the flexibility of front wings will affect all the teams. But whether it changes the competitive order remains to be seen. Verstappen said: \"People always hope for a big upset, but I honestly don't think it will change a lot.\" McLaren lead the constructors' championship with 319 points, more than double the total of Mercedes in second From yachts to pit stops: Monaco GP in pictures How to follow Spanish Grand Prix on the BBC Get to know maybe the coolest, calmest F1 driver in history Andrew Benson Q&A: Send us your questions Incredible images from 75 years of F1 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "‘One of the most heartbreaking tragedies’: Gaza doctor’s last goodbye before nine children killed in airstrike",
    "article_text": "In the early hours of Friday, as she did every day, Dr Alaa al-Najjar said goodbye to her 10 children before leaving the house. The youngest, Sayden, six months old, was still sleeping. And like every day, with war raging in Gaza and Israeli strikes landing just metres from her neighbourhood in Khan Younis, Najjar worried about leaving them at home without her. But Najjar, 35, had little choice. One of Gaza’s dwindling number of medics, a respected paediatrician at the Nasser medical complex, she had to go to work to care for injured babies who had barely survived Israeli attacks. She could never have imagined that that farewell to her family would be her last. A few hours later, the charred bodies of seven of her children, killed by an Israeli airstrike on Khan Younis, arrived at her hospital. Two other bodies, including Sayden’s, remained under the rubble. Of her 10 children,only one had survived, along with their father, Hamdi al-Najjar, 40, also a doctor. Both are now in hospital. “It’s one of the most heartbreaking tragedies since the beginning of the conflict,” Mohammed Saqer, the head of nursing at Nasser hospital, said. “And it happened to a paediatrician who dedicated her life to saving children, only to have her own motherhood stolen in a moment of fire and deafening silence.” Footage shared by the director of Gaza’s health ministry and verified by the Guardian shows the burnt, dismembered bodies of children being pulled from the rubble of Najjar’s building near a petrol station as flames still engulfed what remained of the family’s home. Ali al-Najjar, 50, the older brother of Hamdi, Alaa’s husband, said: “When I heard the house was bombed, I instinctively rushed to my car and headed to the place as I knew my brother and his children were inside. When I arrived, I was shocked. I found my nephew Adam, who survived, lying on the road under the rubble. He was covered in soot, his clothes were almost torn, but his soul was still inside him. My brother was lying on the other side, bleeding heavily from his head and chest, and his arm was cut off. He was still breathing with difficulty.” Ali called the medical team and took the two survivors to the hospital. Then he began searching for his nine missing nieces and nephews. “The house was very difficult to clear because the ceiling was stacked on top of itself. I started searching around the house hoping to find any of the children because I assumed the bombing might have thrown them outside the house,” he said. “But then, sadly, the first burnt body appeared. After completely putting out the fire, we found the rest of them – some were mutilated and all were burnt.” Alaa al-Najjar rushed to the site of the explosion as rescuers pulled the body of her daughter Revan from the rubble. In tears, she begged the rescuers to let her hold her one last time. “Her [Revan’s] body was completely burnt from the upper part, nothing remained of her skin or flesh,” Ali said. “There are still two bodies of my brother’s children we could not find: the oldest, 12-year-old boy, Yahya, and the six-month-old girl, Sayden.” Najjar returned to the hospital to check on her son Adam, 11, and her husband. Sources at the Nasser hospital who transferred the children’s bodies one by one to the morgue said their mother was not able to identify them, so bad were the burns. The children’s names were Yahya, Rakan, Ruslan, Jubran, Eve, Revan, Sayden, Luqman and Sidra. “Alaa went to the morgue, held her children in her arms, recited the Qur’an over them and prayed for them,” said Dr Ahmed al-Farra, 53, the director of the children’s building at the Nasser medical complex. “Other female doctors around her collapsed from grief and rage, but Dr Alaa remained composed. God sent peace upon her heart. After they were buried, she went directly to check on her husband and son and began caring for them.” Colleagues at the hospital described Najjar as a committed, polite and ethical doctor, capable of enduring immense pressure, treating dozens of children and patients daily, and at the same time caring for a large family. “She was in constant worry for her children when she was at the hospital. When she heard a house had been bombed in the Qizan al-Najjar neighbourhood, her mother’s heart sensed something was wrong,” Farra said. He said there were no words for her loss. “If anyone wants to share an opinion, let them first imagine it happening to them – to suddenly lose every person connected to you.” After saying goodbye for the last time to the lifeless bodies of her seven children, Alaa went to the ward where her surviving child was being treated. “Her husband was suffering from severe injuries – brain damage and fractures caused by shrapnel, along with shrapnel wounds and fractures in the chest. He was placed on a ventilator and fitted with medical tubes,” Farra said. ‘‘Her son’s condition was relatively better – his injuries ranged from moderate to severe.” Najjar’s colleagues and friends said her children held Egyptian citizenship and that Alaa and Hamdi had been planning to leave for Egypt and enrol their children in Cairo’s Al-Azhar University. The Israel Defense Forces said: “Yesterday, an IDF aircraft struck a number of suspects who were identified operating from a structure adjacent to IDF troops in the area of Khan Younis. The Khan Younis area is a dangerous war zone. Before beginning operations there, the IDF evacuated civilians from this area for their own safety. The claim regarding harm to uninvolved civilians is under review.” The Gaza health ministry says nearly 54,000 Palestinians, including 16,503 children, have been killed in Israeli attacks across the territory. Farra said: “My only hope is that those who were killed are not just names on paper. We were created just like every other human being in this world. And like every other human, we have the right to live.”",

    "title": "Israeli strikes over past 24 hours killed at least 38 people in Gaza, Palestinian officials say",
    "article_text": "Israeli strikes over the past 24 hours have killed at least 38 people in Gaza, health officials in the Palestinian territory have said, bringing the death toll to more than 100 in less than three days. An attack on a tent housing displaced people in the central city of Deir al-Balah killed a mother and her two children, according to Gaza’s health ministry. Another strike in the Jabaliya area of northernGazakilled at least five, including two women and a child, it added. Civil defence agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal said some people were still under the debris, as “the civil defence does not have search equipment or heavy equipment to lift the rubble to rescue the wounded and recover the martyrs.” Two more people, including a woman who was seven months pregnant, were killed in an attack targeting tents sheltering displaced people around Nuseirat in central Gaza, said Bassal. Sunday’s death toll includes the civil defence’s director of operations, Ashraf Abu Nar, and his wife, who were killed in a strike on their home in Nuseirat, according to Bassal. Local media reports said that in Jabaliya, journalist Hassan Majdi Abu Warda and several family members had been killed by an airstrike that hit his house earlier in the day. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement that two of its staff, Ibrahim Eid and Ahmad Abu Hilal, had been killed in a strike on a house in Khan Younis on Saturday. “Their killing points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza. The ICRC reiterates its urgent call for a ceasefire and for the respect and protection of civilians, including medical, humanitarian relief, and civil defence personnel,” the ICRC statement added. Israel has intensified its air campaign in Gaza in recent days. On Friday, a strike on Khan Younis destroyed the home of doctors Alaa and Hamdi al-Najjar,killing nine of their 10 children. The Israel Defense Forces said on Saturday it had targeted more than 100 sites across the territory over the weekend, despite aid agencies warning that the Palestinian population is plunging deeper intomalnutrition and famine. For nearly three months Israel blocked food, fuel, medicine and all other supplies from entering Gaza, worsening a humanitarian crisis for 2.3 million Palestinians. Under international pressure, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu,who has vowedthat the entire Gaza Strip will be under Israeli security control by the end of the war, said last week he would ease the 11-week siege ofGazato prevent a “starvation crisis”. Aid agencies and many governments say that crisis already exists. A total of 107 aid trucks belonging to the UN and other aid groups carrying flour, food, medical equipment and pharmaceuticals were transferred on Thursday into Gaza, the Israeli military said. The UN secretary general said on Friday that Israel had only authorised for Gaza what “amounts to a teaspoon of aid when a flood of assistance is required” to ease the crisis. “Without rapid, reliable, safe and sustained aid access, more people will die – and the long-term consequences on the entire population will be profound,”António Guterrestold reporters. “The entire population ofGazais facing the risk of famine … The Israeli military offensive is intensifying, with atrocious levels of death and destruction.” Israel accuses Hamas of siphoning off aid. The UN and aid groups deny there has been significant diversion. Israel says it plans to seize full control of Gaza and facilitate what it describes as the voluntary migration of much of its population, a plan rejected by Palestinians and much of the international community. Experts say it would probably violate international law. Health officials in Gaza said on Sunday that at least 3,785 people had been killed in the territory since Israel ended the ceasefire on 18 March. Israel’s 19-month offensive followed the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 in which more than 1,200 people, mostly Israeli civilians, were killed. The Israeli offensivehas killed more than 53,939, Palestinians, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which says women and children make up most of the dead. It does not provide figures for the number of civilians or combatants killed.The offensive has destroyed vast areas of Gaza and displaced about 90% of the population, often multiple times.

    "title": "Irish pro-Palestine activists embrace ‘Paddystinian’ term as badge of honour",
    "article_text": "The term was coined to disparage Ireland’s solidarity withPalestinebut has been adopted as a badge of honour that now adorns T-shirts, hoodies, pins and social media bios: welcome to Paddystine, home of the Paddystinians. Irish activists have embraced the neologism as a galvanising term to campaign against Israel’swar in Gazaand to pressure the Irish government to do more to end the conflict. The belief that it was originally intended as an insult by Israel supporters has fuelled its spread on TikTok and other platforms where Irish people proclaim themselves “Paddystinians” and also, in a repurposing of the old-fashioned female name Biddy, “Biddystinians”. “It was being used as a negative,” Ross McGann, who has nearly 40,000 followers on TikTok, said this week. “Once I heard that I thought: ‘Nah, we can flip this around.’ It’s a very Irish thing to do – you take an insult and you flip it back.” The 35-year-old content creator, who lives on a farm in County Offaly, incorporated Paddystinian into his TikTok bio and into his videos, which have been widely shared. “The word paddy has been used in a derogatory sense towards Irish people but in my family we have lots of Patricks, so to us paddy is a positive word. Given what’s happening inGazaI thought it’s only fair that we own it.” The proliferation of the term has added another strand to Irish activism on Gaza amid controversy over outspokenstatements by the rap group Kneecap. With one of its membersfacing a terror charge, there is a question mark over the group’s invitation to perform at Glastonbury next month. The origin of the term Paddystinian is unclear but many first heard of it in December after Israelclosed its embassy in Dublinto protest what it said was Irish government antisemitism and extreme hostility. Pro-Israeli voices online combined Paddy with Palestinian to underscore the accusation that Ireland, byrecognising Palestinian statehoodand lobbying the EU for a tougher line on Israel, was rewarding terrorism by Hamas. Ben Cohen, a columnist for the Jewish News Syndicate, wrote that he initially regretted making a quip about Paddystinians because Paddy was an ageing pejorative about drunkenness and other Irish stereotypes. “As it turns out, I needn’t have worried,”he wrote. “I discovered that the hashtag #Paddystinian was being eagerly adopted on social media by Irish supporters of Hamas. The accompanying posts were variously obnoxious or downright stupid, with many of those mocking the assertion that their country is antisemitic.” Zoë Lawlor, the chair of theIreland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, welcomed the adoption of the term. “It was being used as an insult. People here thought that was hilarious so we really embraced it and turned it on its head. We started having fun with it at chants. Lots of people changed their Twitter names and social media handles to reflect that.” Garments, badges, pins and other accessories emblazoned with “Paddystinian” have become popular merchandise. Some producers, such as the progressive campaign group Uplift, donate the proceeds to aid for Gaza. Izzeddeen Alkarajeh, a Palestinian who serves Palestinian cuisine at Izz Cafe in Cork, sells Paddystinian pins. “It quickly became one of our top-selling items. It’s a beautiful example of how a term meant to mock can be reclaimed and redefined by the community,” he said via email. The term amplifies awareness about Palestine among young Irish people, as do the Kneecap trio, who visited the cafe in February, said Alkarajeh. “Ireland has consistently shown solidarity with the oppressed, and this is especially evident now in the face of the ongoing crisis in Gaza.” Jilan Wahba Abdalmajid, the Palestinian ambassador toIreland, laudedIrish solidarity. “Any link between the Irish people and the Palestinian people is a positive one. I hope the Irish people feel the same. We share the same history of colonisation and know too well how important freedom, justice, and human rights are.” Activists say their goal is to leverage online solidarity to pressure the Irish state to match tough statements on Israel with actions, such as an enacting a bill to ban trade withillegal Israeli settlements on the West Bank, ending the Irish central bank’s authorisation of Israeli state bond sales in Europe and curbing the use of Irish airspace for flights suspected of carrying war material to Israel. “Our pressure point is the Irish government,” said Lawlor. “The rhetoric is very strong but they have to back it up with actions. If they do that we can start a snowball effect within the EU.”",

    "title": "Men and women getting skin cancer in different parts of the body – study",
    "article_text": "Areas of the body most likely to develop skin cancer vary between men and women, research has found, as cases of melanoma are expected to rise this year. According to analysis byCancerResearch UK (CRUK), four in 10 melanomas in men are found on the torso, including the back, chest and stomach, the equivalent of 3,700 cases a year. More than a third – 35% – of melanomas in women are found on lower limbs, from the hips to the feet, and account for 3,200 cases every year. It’s thought the variations are due to differences in behaviour, with men more likely to be in the sun without a shirt while women might wear shorts or skirts as the weather gets warmer. The study found that 87% of melanoma cases, the equivalent of 17,100 in the UK each year, are caused by overexposure to UV radiation. Last year, rates of melanoma skin cancer reached anall-time high in the UK, with new diagnoses increasing by a quarter from 21 to 28 in every 100,000 people between 2007 and 2009 and 2017 and 2019, according to CRUK figures. There has been a 57% rise among the over-80s and a 7% rise in those aged 25 to 49. The charity has also warned that melanoma cases are expected to rise again this year, with 21,300 cases. Michelle Mitchell, CRUK’s chief executive, said:“Improvements in skin cancer survival rates highlight the remarkable progress driven by our research. But the growing number of people diagnosed with melanoma is still concerning, especially when we can see that rates are rising faster in men. “If you notice anything different on your skin, like a new mole, a mole that’s changed in size, shape or colour, or any patch of skin that looks out of the ordinary – don’t ignore it, speak to your GP. We want to beat skin cancer for everyone, no matter who they are or where they’re from – early diagnosis is key and could make all the difference.” Fiona Osgun, head of health information at CRUK, said: “As the weather gets warmer, it’s really important to look after yourself in the sun. Getting sunburned just once every couple of years can triple your risk of melanoma skin cancer, compared with never being burned. And it’s not just the hot, sunny days you need to watch out for – UV rays can be strong enough to cause skin damage between mid-March and mid-October in the UK, even when it’s cloudy or cool. “That’s why we encourage people to take some simple steps to stay safe. Try to stick to the shade between 11am and 3pm when the sun is strongest, wear clothes that help cover up your skin, with a hat and sunglasses, and use a sunscreen with at least SPF30 and 4 or 5 stars.” Prof Peter Johnson, the national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: “Prevention is by far the best plan with skin cancer, so avoid the sun when it is at its hottest and ensure you use sunscreen. For skin cancer, as for any cancer, it is vital that you are seen and diagnosed as early as possible, so people should come forward if they are concerned about symptoms. Getting checked saves lives.”",

    "title": "Plans for NHS staff to restrain those in mental health crisis ‘dangerous’, medics say",
    "article_text": "Plans forNHSstaff to restrain and detain people experiencing a mental health crisis, instead of the police doing so, are “dangerous”, doctors, nurses and psychiatrists have warned. The former prime minister Theresa May has proposed legislation inEnglandand Wales that would change the long-established practice for dealing with people who may pose a risk to themselves or others because their mental health has deteriorated sharply. But a coalition of eight medical groups, ambulance bosses and social work leaders said the switch would put mental health staff at risk and damage their relationship with vulnerable patients. The row has echoes of the controversy stirred by the Metropolitan police’s decision in 2023to stop responding to 999 calls involving mental ill healthunless they involved a threat to life. The force said the change meant officers were attending crimes such as robberies faster, but mental health groupssaid they feared it could result in deaths. May and two ex-health ministers, Syed Kamall and Frederick Curzon, have tabled amendments to the mental health bill going through parliament which, if passed, would lead to mental health nurses, psychiatrists or other doctors being called out to restrain and detain someone under the MentalHealthAct. Those professionals would each become an “authorised person” who is allowed to detain someone under the act. May took an active interest in mental health issues during her time as home secretary and in Downing Street. She helped ensure those detained under the act were no longer held in police cells and were instead taken to “places of safety”, usually at NHS facilities. But in a joint statement on Monday the eight groups said the risks posed by someone in a mental health crisis meant police officers must continue to always attend. The groups include the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association. At present, only police officers are permitted under the Mental Health Act to detain someone in a mental health crisis, for example because they are having a psychotic episode. The groups said: “Removing police involvement entirely has hugely dangerous implications, as entering someone’s home without permission is fraught with huge risks and is only currently done with the assistance of police intelligence. Without this, professionals may be entering homes without police help and therefore lacking crucial intelligence that could ensure their safety.” They added: “While we recognise the immense pressures faced by police services, we also acknowledge that mental health crises in the community are becoming increasingly acute and almost never occur without some level of risk. “The expertise, skills and equipment of the police remain essential for safely reaching individuals in crisis, especially where they may be in immediate danger to themselves, pose a risk to others or face a threat from others.” Dr Lade Smith, the president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Detaining, and if necessary restraining, someone is essentially arresting them and to do this safely requires specialist skills and legal powers. “Expecting clinicians whose role is to provide therapeutic care to arrest people in the street or burst into their homes if they notice someone suffering a mental health crisis is simply inappropriate and indicates a lack of understanding of what health professionals do.” Chief constables are backing the change. They want to see responsibility for dealing with mental health crises become split between their officers and NHS staff. A National Police Chiefs’ Council spokesperson said: “We support the proposed amendments to the mental health bill, which will enable authorised medical professionals to effectively deal with some mental health incidents. This will ensure vulnerable people receive the most appropriate care without feeling criminalised because of their mental health issues.” They added: “We will always attend incidents where there is a risk of serious harm to the individual or attending professionals, or where criminality is involved.” The groups opposed to the plan also include the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, the College of Paramedics, the Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, the British Association of Social Workers and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services. The Labour MP Rosena Allin-Khan, the party’s former shadow cabinet minister for mental health who is also an A&E doctor, voiced unease about the plan. She said: “I am concerned that these amendments aim to turn practitioners into enforcers and could expose healthcare staff to increased danger. It runs the risk of eroding trust in dedicated and hard-working mental health staff by delegating police powers to them.” Ministers are also against the change. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “Extending police powers to other professionals would represent a major shift in the roles, responsibilities and practice for health and care staff and would place additional resource on an already stretched NHS at a time where we are trying to rebuild a health service fit for the future. “It also raises questions around whether it is right for the health and social care professionals to have powers to use reasonable force, which could have implications for patient, public and staff safety, as well as potentially damaging the relationships clinicians have with patients.”",

    "article_text": "Four people who died after a fire in north–west London on Saturday have been named by police. Nusrat Usman, 43, and three of her children, Maryam Mikaiel, 15, Musa Usman, eight, and Raees Usman, four, died at the scene of the fire which gutted two homes in the Stonebridge area of Brent in the early hours of Saturday. A 13-year-old girl from the same family remains in critical condition, the Metropolitan police said on Sunday afternoon. The force said a 71-year-old woman from the same family who was also injured in the fire had been discharged from hospital. A 41-year-old man who was arrested outside the house on Saturday morning remained in custody on Sunday afternoon. Bunches of flowers and a blue teddy bear were left near the homes as fire crews wearing helmets and respiratory equipment built scaffolding against the burnt-out buildings. Neighbours said the family were of Pakistani origin and had lived on Tillett Close for years. Firefighters said the mother and one of her children were rescued from the second floor but pronounced dead by air ambulance crews. The other two children who were declared dead were found inside the property as crews tackled the fire, London fire brigade said. Cecilia Marquis, 60, a neighbour, said she was “stunned by the devastation” of the fire. Marquis, who is a caterer at Brentford FC and witnessed the fire, said: “This will leave a devastating impact.” In a statement on Saturday, Supt Steve Allen, from the Met’s local policing team in north-west London, said detectives were leading the investigation into the cause of the fire. “Despite the efforts of the emergency services, I can confirm a woman and three of her children died at the scene,” Allen said. “The wider family have been informed, and officers will continue to support them at this incredibly difficult time. “I recognise the significant impact this incident has had on the community.”",

    "article_text": "Federal officials say agents arrested a man on Sunday accused of attempting to firebomb the Tel Aviv branch office of the US embassy inIsrael, a justice department press release said. According to anews releasefrom the US justice department, Joseph Neumayer – a dual US and German citizen – was arrested at John F Kennedy airport in New York after being deported by Israeli officials. The Guardian was not able to verify the details of the criminal complaint cited in the justice department’s press release, with the case docket having not been updated as of Sunday afternoon. The justice department did not respond to the Guardian’s request for access to a copy of the criminal complaint. According to the justice department, Neumayer arrived inIsraelin April. The 28-year-old was then alleged to have arrived to the US embassy branch office in Tel Aviv with a backpack and spit on an embassy guard last week. When the guard tried to arrest him, Neumayer managed to break free and escape, leaving behind his backpack. The justice department alleged that the backpack had three molotov cocktails. Officials reportedly tracked him to his hotel and arrested him. The department’s press release further alleges that a social media account purportedly linked to Neumayer read: “join me as I burn down the embassy in Tel Aviv. Death to America, death to Americans, and fuck the west.” Officials say he also allegedly posted threats to assassinate Donald Trump. The Tel Aviv diplomatic office was the site of the US embassy until 2018, when the embassy formally moved to a site in Jerusalem, in aceremony overseen by Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter. “The defendant is charged with attempting to firebomb the US Embassy and making threats to President Trump,” the FBI’s director, Kash Patel, said in a statement. “This despicable and violent behavior will not be tolerated at home or abroad, and the FBI, working with our partners, will bring him to face justice for his dangerous actions.” Neumayer reportedly stood before a judge on Sunday and was ordered detained without bond. The arrest of Neumayer comes days after authorities in Washington DCarrested a man in connectionwith the fatal shootings of two Israeli embassy officials.",

    "title": "US police officer resigns after wrongfully arresting undocumented teen",
    "article_text": "AGeorgiapolice officer resigned from his job on Friday after erroneously pulling over a teenager, causing her to spend more than two weeks in a federal immigration jail, and leaving her facing deportation. The officer, Leslie O’Neal, was employed at the police department in Dalton, a small city more than an hour north of Atlanta. His arrest of college student Ximena Arias-Cristobal not only led to a domino effect that could lead to her deportation – it also engendered anger and criticism, especially given the circumstances of her immigration-related detention. Though Dalton’s municipal government did not provide any information about why O’Neal resigned, his wifeposted his resignation letter on Facebook, which said he believed the local police department did not adequately defend him. “The department’s silence in the face of widespread defamation has not only made my position personally untenable but has also created an environment where I can no longer effectively carry out my duties within the city of Dalton without fear of further backlash from the community,” O’Neal wrote in the letter. On 5 May, O’Neal pulled Arias-Cristobal over in Dalton. The officer accused her of improperly making a false turn – but those charges were later dropped after the police forceadmitted to mistaking her carfor another. The damage, though, was done by the time Arias-Cristobal’s charges were dismissed. The 19-year-old – who is undocumented and was driving with a Mexican license – was brought to the US from Mexico in 2007, when she was just four. The timing of her having been taken to the US barely missed the deadline for her to qualify for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a program initiated during Barack Obama’s presidency that provided children in her situation some protections from deportation. After O’Neal arrested her, local authorities contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the federal agency that detains and deports immigrants. Ice agents then transferred her to an immigration jail in the state. “I cannot go to jail,” Arias-Cristobal said during the arrest, according to dash-cam footage. “I have my finals next week. My family depends on this.” Arias-Cristobal’s plight captured national attention, with many supporting her and calling for her release. Others – including the far-rightGeorgiacongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene – agitated for Arias-Cristobal to be deported. “In Mexico, today, there’s over 1.6 million United States of America citizens, living and thriving in Mexico, and I’m sure she and her family will be able to do the same,” Greene saidduring an interviewwith Tennessee’s Local 3 News. “But it’s important for our nation, for our sovereignty, for us to uphold the law. And this is what we have to do.” The White House’s attempts to engage in “mass deportations” during Donald Trump’s second presidency has led to an increase in arrests throughout the country. Immigration enforcement operations have been aided by local jurisdictions that partner with Ice, under what are known as 287(g) contracts. These contracts deputize local officials to carry out immigration enforcement arrests, collaborating closely with Ice. The Whitfield county sheriff’s office, which runs the local jail for people arrested in Dalton,has a 287(g) contractwith Ice. Additionally, a law signed last year by Georgia’s governor, Brian Kemp, requires local law enforcement, in the entire state, to apply to enter into 287(g) contracts with Ice. Immigration advocacy organizations have called that law “disastrous”. The Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights, for instance, said it would lead to “racial profiling, terrorize immigrant communities and waste local resources”. Arias-Cristobal’s father, José Arias-Tovar, had also been detained by Ice weeks earlier after another traffic stop for speeding. He bonded out of Ice detention on 16 May. Five days later, Arias-Cristobalpaid a $1,500 bond, leading to her release. She was home with her family by Thursday evening. “We’re going to keep working on her case to try to keep her here permanently,” Arias-Cristobal’s attorney, Dustin Baxter,told local TV station WSB-TV. Arias-Cristobal’s arrest has prompted some torally for her release, whether in person or online. Her advocates have criticized Ice and the local police department for how they have handled her case. A GoFundMe campaign launched for her legal defense hasraised more than $90,000. The jail where Arias-Cristobal was detained before she bonded out is known as the Stewart detention center. It is a run privately in Lumpkin, Georgia, by CoreCivic under a contract with Ice and for years has beenaccused of violating rightsandmaintaining horrific conditions. This article was amended on 25 May 2025 to include the officer’s resignation letter.",

    "title": "Top Republicans threaten to block Trump’s spending bill if national debt is not reduced",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumphas been warned by fiscal hawks within his own party in the US Senate that he must “get serious” about cutting government spending and reducing the national debt or else they will block the passage of his signature tax-cutting legislation known as the “big, beautiful bill”. Ron Johnson, theRepublicansenator from Wisconsin who rose to prominence as a fiscal hardliner with the Tea Party movement, issued the warning to the president on Sunday. Asked by CNN’s State of the Union whether his faction had the numbers to halt the bill, he replied: “I think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about spending reduction and reducing the deficit.” Trump has invested a large portion of his political capital in the massive package. It extends the 2017 tax cuts from his first administration in return for about $1tn in benefits cuts including reductions in the health insurance scheme for low-income families, Medicaid, and to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) food stamps. The bill squeaked through US House by justone voteon Thursday. It now faces a perilous welcome in the upper legislative chamber. Sunday’s admonitions from prominent senators angered by the failure to address the budget deficit bodes ill for Trump’s agenda given the tightness of the Republicans’ congressional majorities. The Senate majority leader, John Thune, can afford to lose only three votes from among his party’s 53. Thune has indicated that changes to the bill might be needed to bring refuseniks on side. That in turn could present the House speaker, Mike Johnson, with a headache. The House will have to approve any changes made in the Senate under the process of budget reconciliation, which allows spending packages to be fast-tracked through Congress avoiding a Senate filibuster of 60 votes. The final contents of the bill will need to be blessed by both chambers, with Democrats almost certain to vote unanimously in opposition. The House speaker renewed his plea to his Senate colleagues on Sunday to go lightly with him. He encouraged them on CBS News’s Face the Nation “to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House”. But Senate budget hawks do not appear to be in the mood for compromise. Ron Johnson estimated that the bill would add up to $4tn to the federal deficit, a calculation that is broadly in line with thelatest analysisfrom the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). Johnson added a rare note of personal criticism of Trump from a congressional Republican. He said that while Trump might not be worried about the national debt, “I’m extremely worried about that.” He added: “We are mortgaging our children’s future. It’s wrong. It’s immoral. It has to stop.” Another key Tea Party senator, Rand Paul from Kentucky, has also been vocal over the deficit. He laid into the spending cuts contained in the big beautiful bill, telling Fox News Sunday that in his view they were “wimpy and anemic” and would “explode the debt”. Other influential Republican senators have been expressing concern about the number of Americans who would lose access to health coverage as a result of the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid. According to the CBO, almost 8 million people would be thrown off the benefit. Speaker Johnson tried to dismiss the concern, telling CBS News that 1.4 million of those vulnerable people were “illegal aliens receiving benefits” – and a further 4.8 million were able-bodied individuals choosing not to work and “gaming the system”. An analysis by the non-partisanFactCheck.orgfound that the claim that 1.4 million undocumented migrants were on Medicaid was false. People living in the US without immigration papers are not eligible for the federal program other than to receive emergency medical treatment. More than 1 million undocumented immigrants are in danger of losing health benefits as a result of Trump’s cuts – but this assistance is provided by states and has nothing to do with Medicaid. Any reduction in Medicaid would be politically awkward for Trump, who promised repeatedly on the campaign trail last year that he would not touch basic safety nets such as Medicaid, Medicare and social security. The president’s loyal supporters in the Maga (“Make America great again”) movement have cautioned against the move. Steve Bannon, who served as chief White House strategist in Trump’s first administration and remains a persuasive voice within the movement, recently told listeners to his War Room podcast: “You got to be careful, because a lot of Maga is on Medicaid.” Josh Hawley, the Republican US senator from Missouri,recently saidthat “slashing health insurance for the working poor” would be “politically suicidal”.",

    "title": "Trump administration tells border shelters helping migrants may be illegal",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationhas continued releasing people charged with being in the country illegally to non-governmental shelters along theUS-Mexico borderafter previously telling those same organizations that providing immigrants with temporary housing and other aid may violate a law used to prosecute smugglers. Border shelters, which have long provided lodging and meals before offering transportation to the nearest bus station or airport, were rattled by a letter from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) that raised “significant concerns” about potentially illegal activity and demanded detailed information in a wide-ranging investigation. Fema suggested shelters may have committed felony offenses related to bringing people across the border illegally or transporting them within the US. “It was pretty scary. I’m not going to lie,” said Rebecca Solloa, executive director of Catholic Charities of the diocese of Laredo, Texas. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) continued to ask shelters in Texas and Arizona to house people even after the 11 March letter, putting them in the awkward position of doing something that Fema appeared to say might be illegal. Both agencies are part of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and have also been accused ofwithholding fundsfrom organizations, in addition to asking them to hand over names of those they’ve helped and implying that some charities are human-smuggling operations. After receiving the letter, Catholic Charities still received eight to 10 people a day from Ice until financial losses forced it to close its shelter in the Texas border city on 25 April, Solloa said. The Holding Institute community center, also in Laredo, has been taking about 20 families a week from Ice’s family detention centers in Dilley and Karnes City, Texas, executive director Michael Smith said. They come from Russia, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Papua New Guinea and China. Annunciation House in El Paso, Texas, a storied institution in the region, has been receiving five to 10 people a day from Ice, including from Honduras and Venezuela, said Ruben Garcia, its longtime executive director. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) did not get a letter but continues receiving people from Ice in Phoenix, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss information that has not been made public. The releases include people who had been held at Ice’s Krome detention center in Miami, Florida, a site of severe overcrowding. Ice’s requests struck Solloa as a “little bit of a contradiction”, but Catholic Charities agreed to them. She said some guests had been in Ice detention centers for two to four weeks after being arrested in the nation’s interior and ordered released by an immigration judge while their challenges to deportations wind through the courts. Others had been flown from San Diego, California, after crossing the border without authorization. Those released were from India, China, Pakistan, Turkey and Central and South America, Solloa said. Smith, a Methodist pastor, said that the Fema letter was alarming and that agreeing to continue caring for people released by Ice was “probably not a good idea”. Still, it was an easy choice. “There’s some things that are just right to do,” he said. Tricia McLaughlin, spokesperson for the DHS, drew a distinction with large-scale releases under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden. The Biden administration worked closely with shelters but, during its busiest times, released immigrants at bus stops or other public locations. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion “Under the Biden administration, when Ice has aliens in its custody who are ordered released, Ice does not simply release them onto the streets of a community – Ice works to verify a sponsor for the illegal alien, typically family members or friends but occasionally a non-governmental organization,” McLaughlin said. The US government has struggled to quickly deport people who have arrived from some countries because of diplomatic, financial and logistical challenges. Those hurdles have prompted Ice to deport people to countries other than their own, including El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama, and – this week –an attemptto remove people, mostly originally from south Asia, to South Sudan. If those options aren’t available, Ice may release people in the US, which the Trump administration is reluctant to do. Fema awarded $641m to dozens of state and local governments and organizations across the country in the 2024 fiscal year to help them deal with large numbers of immigrants who crossed the border from Mexico. But Fema has suspended payments during its investigation, which requires shelters to provide “a detailed and descriptive list of specific services provided”. Executive officers must sign sworn statements that they have no knowledge or suspicions of anyone in their organizations violating the smuggling law. The releases show how border shelters have often maintained close, if cordial, relations with federal immigration authorities at the ground level, even when senior officials publicly criticize them. “We have a good working relationship with our federal partners. We always have,” Solloa said. “They asked us to help, then we will continue to help, but at some point we have to say: ‘Yikes, I don’t have any more money for this. Our agency is hurting and I’m sorry, we can’t do this anymore.’” Catholic Charities hosted at least 120,000 people at its Laredo shelter since opening in 2021 and housed 600 to 700 people on its busiest nights in 2023, Solloa said. It was counting on up to $7m from Fema. The shelter closed with a loss of nearly $1m million after not receiving any Fema money.",

    "title": "Can Pope Leo retain US citizenship while leading a foreign government?",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV’s election as the first US-born leader of the Roman Catholic church elevated him to the rare, legally thorny, position of being an American citizen who now is also a foreign head of state. Bornin Chicago asRobert Prevostin 1955, the new pope for the past decade has held dual citizenship in the US and Peru, where he spent time as a missionary and bishop. As pope, Leo serves as leader of both the Holy See, the governing body of the Catholic church, and Vatican City, an independent state – raising the question of whether he can remain a US citizen while leading a foreign government. Americans working for foreign governments aren’t automatically at risk of forfeiting their US citizenship. But the US state department says on its website that it may “actively review” the citizenship status of Americans who “serve as a foreign head of state, foreign head of government, or foreign minister”. “Such cases raise complex questions of international law, including issues related to the level of immunity from US jurisdiction that the person so serving may be afforded,” the policy states. The state department declined to comment on the pope’s status. A spokesperson said the department doesn’t discuss the citizenship of individuals. The core issue is whether foreign leaders should hold American citizenship when they also enjoy broad immunity from US laws, said Peter Spiro, a Temple University law professor and an expert on citizenship law. Such immunity clashes with the constitutional principle that no US citizen should be above the law. However, the US supreme court in a 1980 decision ruled that Americans can’t be stripped of their citizenship unless they intentionally renounce it. “The state department never assumes that you intend to lose your citizenship unless you specifically say so through the renunciation process,” Spiro said. He said it would be hard to argue that Leo, by becoming pope, demonstrated an intent to give up being a US citizen. “I think it’s highly unlikely that the US moves to terminate the pope’s citizenship,” Spiro said. Peruvian law has no conflict with Pope Leo remaining a citizen, said Jorge Puch, the deputy director of registry archives at Peru’s National Registry of Identification and Civil Status. Leo was granted Peruvian citizenship in August 2015, the month before Pope Francis appointed him bishop of Chiclayo in the South American country’s northern region. To qualify, he had to live in Peru for at least two years and pass a civics test. “It is the most praiseworthy thing our beloved supreme pontiff could have done: Wanting to have Peruvian nationality without having been Peruvian by birth,” Puch said. All adult Peruvians, including naturalized citizens, are required to vote in elections through age 69. Voting in Peru’s presidential election next April won’t be mandatory for Leo. He turns 70 in September. It’s not clear what happened to the citizenship status of Leo’s predecessors once they became pope. That’s not information the Vatican discloses. Pope Francis renewed his passport in his home country of Argentina in 2014, the year after he became pope. Popes Benedict XVI and John Paul II – natives of Germany and Poland, respectively – never publicly relinquished citizenship in their home countries. John Paul was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years. Margaret Susan Thompson, a Syracuse University history professor and expert on AmericanCatholicism, said she doubts Leo would renounce his US citizenship. But she believes the new pope was sending a message when he delivered his first speech in Italian and Spanish without using English. “I think he wants to stress that he is the pope of the universal Catholic Church,” Thompson said, “and not an American holding that position”. Other US citizens who have served as leaders of a foreign government include Boris Johnson, the former UK prime minister who was born in New York to British parents. Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed was an American citizen when he was elected president of Somalia in 2017. Valdas Adamkus became a US citizen after his family fled Lithuania to escape Soviet occupation. He returned to win Lithuania’s presidency in 1998, years after the Soviet Union collapsed. Johnson, Adamkus and Mohamed all renounced their US citizenship.",

    "title": "US citizen charged with trying to attack US embassy branch in Tel Aviv",
    "article_text": "A dual United States and German citizen has been arrested on charges that he travelled to Israel and attempted to firebomb the branch office of the US Embassy in Tel Aviv, federal prosecutors in New York have said. Israeli officials deported Joseph Neumeyer to New York on Saturday and he had an initial court appearance before a federal judge in Brooklyn on Sunday. His criminal complaint was unsealed on Sunday. Prosecutors say Neumeyer walked up to the embassy building on May 19 with a backpack containing Molotov cocktails, but got into a confrontation with a guard and eventually ran away, dropping his backpack as the guard tried to detain him. Law enforcement then tracked Neumeyer down to a hotel a few blocks away from the embassy and arrested him, according to a criminal complaint filed in the Eastern District of New York. “This defendant is charged with planning a devastating attack targeting our embassy in Israel, threatening death to Americans, and [US] President [Donald] Trump’s life,” US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement. “The Department will not tolerate such violence and will prosecute this defendant to the fullest extent of the law.” Neumeyer’s court-appointed attorney, Jeff Dahlberg, declined to comment. The attack took place against the backdrop of Israel’s ongoing deadly war on Gaza, now in its 19th month. Nearly 54,000 Palestinians have been killed in the blockaded enclave, where a famine is now looming as Israeli forces continue to seal vital border crossings and uphold a crippling blockade on humanitarian aid including food, medicine, and fuel. Neumeyer, 28, who is originally from Colorado and has dual US and German citizenship, had travelled from the US to Canada in early February and then arrived in Israel in late April, according to court records. He had made a series of threatening social media posts before attempting the attack, prosecutors said. During his first term, Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital despite Palestinian objections, in a move that has not been recognised by the international community. He also moved the US Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.",

    "article_text": "All-rounder Sikandar Raza has written his name in Pakistan cricket folklore after hitting the match-winning six as the Lahore Qalandarsbeatthe Quetta Gladiators by six wickets to win the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2025 final at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Raza, who was part of Zimbabwe’s Test team until Saturday afternoon, joined the Qalandars’ playing XI 10 minutes prior to the toss for the final on Sunday evening in Pakistan’s eastern metropolis. The Pakistan-born off-break bowler and lower-middle-order batter took one wicket and scored 22 runs off seven balls as Lahore chased a target of 202 with one ball to spare. Lahore’s run chase was largely built around Kusal Perera’s 62 runs, with support from top-order batters Mohammad Naeem and Abdullah Shafique, but it was Raza’s whirlwind journey from the United Kingdom to Pakistan and his subsequent role in hitting the winning runs that stole the show and Lahori hearts. The 39-year-old recounted his last 24 hours by saying he had “dinner in Birmingham, breakfast in Dubai, lunch in Abu Dhabi and flew straight to Lahore for the PSL final”. Raza bowled 25 overs in the Test on Friday and batted for 20-plus overs on Saturday before leaving for Pakistan. “To have a victory like this, I just have no words,” he said after the match. The hosts finished on 204-4 from 19.5 overs to lift their third PSL trophy in four years, making Shaheen Shah Afridi the only captain to win three PSL titles. Earlier, Quetta posted a formidable total of 201-9 in their 20 overs as young batter Hasan Nawaz scored 76 runs off 43 balls and Faheem Ashraf cracked three sixes and two fours in an innings of 28 off eight balls. Afridi was the pick of the Lahore bowlers, taking 3-24 in his four overs. Perera was named player of the match for his instrumental innings that kept Lahore in the match until the last over. Meanwhile, Nawaz was named player of the tournament for amassing 399 runs in the competition.",

    "title": "Pope Leo prays for China’s Catholics, a thorny issue in his papacy",
    "article_text": "Newly elected Pope Leo XIV has asked for prayers for China’s Catholics in his first reference to one of the most contentious issues that the Catholic Church and his papacy face in the arena of geopolitics. Speaking on Sunday from the window of the Vatican’s Apostolic Palace, the pontiff recalled the World Day of Prayer for the Church in China, which falls each May 24 – a feast initiated by Pope Benedict XVI. “In the churches and shrines of China and throughout the world, prayers were raised to God as a sign of concern and affection for Chinese Catholics and their communion with the universal church,” Leo said to about 35,000 faithful. The pope hoped the prayers “obtain for them and for us the grace to be strong and joyful witnesses of the Gospel, even in the midst of trials, to always promote peace and harmony”, he said. Pope Benedict XVI, who headed the church from 2005 until 2013, established the feast as part of his efforts to unify China’s estimated 12 million Catholics, who were divided between an official, state-controlled church that didn’t recognise papal authority, and an underground church that remained loyal to Rome through decades of persecution. Ties with China remain adeeply sensitive issue within the church as some clergymen reject a 2018 deal between the Holy See and China that gave Beijing a say in the appointment of Catholic bishops there, since Catholics were repressed by the Communist Party. The agreement was aimed at uniting the flock, regularising the status of seven bishops who weren’t recognised by Rome, and thawing decades of estrangement between China and the Vatican. While details of the agreement were never released, Pope Francis insisted he retained veto power over the ultimate choice. Critics, particularly on the Catholic right wing, believed Francis had caved to Beijing’s demands and sold out the underground faithful in China. The Vatican has said it was the best deal it could get, and it has been renewed periodically since then. Pope Leo will have to decide whether to continue renewing the accord. There have been some apparent violations on the Beijing side, with some unilateral appointments that occurred without papal consent. The issue came to a head just before the conclave that elected Leo, when the Chinese church proceeded with the preliminary election of two bishops, a step that comes before official consecration. The Vatican has been working for years to try to improve relations with China that were officially severed over seven decades ago when the Communists came to power. Relations had long been fraught over China’s insistence on its exclusive right to name bishops as a matter of national sovereignty, while the Vatican insisted on the pope’s exclusive right to name the successors of the original Apostles.",

    "article_text": "Manchester United have ended their disappointing 2024-25 season with a 2-0 victory over Aston Villa on the final day of the Premier League campaign, denying the visitors a Champions League qualification spot in the process. United surprisingly dominated the first half of Sunday’s game against a side chasing a top-five finish. Against the run of play, Morgan Rogers appeared to have netted Villa a crucial goal 18 minutes from time, but referee Thomas Bramall ruled that he had fouled United goalkeeper Altay Bayindir before slotting home. The hosts’ cause was aided as Villa goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez was sent off just before the break. Furious Villa’s mood worsened after Amad Diallo immediately headed the hosts in front down the other end, before Christian Eriksen’s penalty ensured United finished 15th and sixth-placed Villa had to settle for a place in the Europa League next term. Newcastle United breathed a sigh of relief as their 1-0 defeat by Everton could have opened the door for Villa to climb above them with a win over United. Villa manager Unai Emery confronted Bramall after the final whistle, unhappy at what he believed was a “big mistake” by the match official. “The TV is clear with the move but of course we have to accept it,” Emery said. “It was a mistake. A big mistake.” At the final whistle, Emery stood motionless on the touchline and stared at Bramall for a long time. After confronting the official as he came off the field, Emery continued his discussions with him as they went down the tunnel. Protest songs against Manchester United’s ownership greeted the final whistle, even if supporters had been treated to a rare home success. This season's final standings 🤝pic.twitter.com/lRWyvmvkXQ — Premier League (@premierleague)May 25, 2025 Meanwhile, Manchester City’s disappointing season ended with the consolation of a place in the Champions League after a 2-0 victory at Fulham, earned by Ilkay Gundogan’s overhead kick and an Erling Haaland penalty. The victory ensured City finish third in the table with 71 points from 38 games, the first time they have ended outside the top two since the 2016-17 season. Fulham finished 11th with 54 points. City opened the scoring at 21 minutes when Matheus Nunes’s chipped shot on the angle was clawed away by Fulham goalkeeper Bernd Leno and into the path of Gundogan, whose acrobatic effort steered the ball into the net off the crossbar. The visitors doubled their advantage when Sasa Lukic fouled Gundogan in the box and Haaland converted the spot kick to score his 22nd league goal of the campaign, while Kevin De Bruyne came off the bench for the final five minutes in his farewell to City. City left Jack Grealish out of their match-day squad amid talk he could leave the club, while De Bruyne spent time with the City fans at the final whistle, many of them holding up signs of thanks to the Belgian for his decade at the club. City ended up with 71 points, Chelsea on 69 and Villa on 66, but with an inferior goal difference to Newcastle on the same points. Forest, who still had hopes of a top-five finish going into the last day, will go into the UEFA Conference League. Champions Liverpool ended their campaign with a 1-1 home draw against Crystal Palace in a party atmosphere at Anfield. Runners-up Arsenal, who ended 10 points behind Liverpool, beat bottom club Southampton 2-1 away. Brighton and Hove Albion brought Europa Cup winners Tottenham Hotspur down to earth with a bump as they won 4-1 in north London to finish eighth, but that will not be good enough to secure a European berth for the south coast side next season. Tottenham finished a woeful league season in 17th place, their worst performance since being relegated in 1977.",

    "article_text": "Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has held talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Istanbul, weeks after a military conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi. The two countries would strive to boost cooperation, particularly in defence, energy and transportation, Erdogan’s office said on Sunday. Erdogan told Sharif it was in the interest of Turkey and Pakistan to increase solidarity in education, intelligence sharing and technological support in the fight against “terrorism”, Turkiye president’s office said. The meeting in the Turkish commercial capital comes as Ankara faces a backlash from India over its alleged supply of weapons to Islamabad during the recent conflict between the two South Asian neighbours. Ankara has denied sending weapons to Pakistan. In recent weeks, Erdogan had expressed solidarity with Pakistan after India conducted military attacks across nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. New Delhi said the attacks were in response to an April 22 attack on tourists by armed fighters in Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir, which left 25 Indians and one Nepalese national dead. India has accused Pakistan of indirectly supporting the attack – which Pakistan denies. Turkiye had warned of a risk of an “all-out war” between the nuclear-armed neighbours and called on both sides to “show good sense” to reduce the tensions, while expressing support for Islamabad’s request for an international inquiry into the Pahalgam attack. The two countries announced a ceasefire on May 10. Turkiye and Pakistan have long had close economic and military links. In February, Erdogan visited Islamabad, during which the two countries signed 24 cooperation agreements to bolster bilateral ties. In a sign of India’s displeasure with Ankara, India’s External Affairs Ministry spokesperson last week said that “relations are built on the basis of sensitivities to each other’s concerns”. “We expect Turkey to strongly urge Pakistan to end its support to cross-border terrorism and take credible and verifiable actions against the terror ecosystem it has harbored for decades,” Randhir Jaiswal said during a press briefing on Thursday. Meanwhile, grocery shops and leading online fashion retailers in India declared a boycott of Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams, and cosmetics, as well as clothing. Indian fashion websites owned by Flipkart retail and billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance removed numerous Turkish apparel brands from their sites. India’s annual $2.7bn in goods imports from Turkiye, however, are dominated by mineral fuels and precious metals. We still do not know how the bilateral trade will be impacted amid the strained ties. Indian travel companies also suspended bookings of flights, hotels and holiday packages to Turkiye “in solidarity with India’s national interest and sovereignty”. India has not officially ordered companies to boycott Turkish products. But the country’s civil aviation ministry on May 15 revoked the security clearance of the Turkish-based aviation ground handling firm Celebi.",

    "title": "Rival marches draw thousands before pivotal Polish presidential election",
    "article_text": "Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of Warsaw to show support for the opposing candidates in next weekend’s tightly contested Polish presidential run-off, which the government views as crucial to its efforts for pro-European democratic reform. Prime Minister Donald Tusk hopes to galvanise support for his candidate, liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, to replace outgoing Andrzej Duda, a nationalist who has vetoed many of Tusk’s efforts to reform the judiciary. “All of Poland is looking at us. All of Europe is looking at us. The whole world is looking at us,” Trzaskowski told supporters who waved Polish and European Union flags on Sunday. Tusk swept to power in 2023 with a broad alliance of leftist and centrist parties on a promise to undo changes made by the nationalist Law and Justice government that the EU said had undermined democracy and women’s and minority rights. Trzaskowski beat nationalist opponent Karol Nawrocki by 2 percentage points in the first round of the election on May 18 but is struggling to sustain his lead, according to opinion polls. The two candidates are locked in a tight contest before the June 1 run-off with the latest polls projecting a tie of 47 percent of the vote each. Nawrocki’s voters – some wearing hats with the words “Poland is the most important,” a nod to United States President Donald Trump’s America First policies – gathered in a different part of the capital to show support for his drive to align Poland more closely with Trump and the region’s populists. “I am the voice of all those whose cries do not reach Donald Tusk today. The voice of all those who do not want Polish schools to be places of ideology, our Polish agriculture to be destroyed or our freedom taken away,” Nawrocki told the crowd. Some of his supporters carried banners with slogans such as “Stop Migration Pact” and “This is Poland” or displayed images of Trump. “He is the best candidate, the most patriotic, one who can guarantee that Poland is independent and sovereign,” Jan Sulanowski, 42, said. An estimated 50,000 people attended the gathering of Nawrocki’s supporters while about 140,000 people participated in the march supporting Trzaskowski, the Polish Press Agency reported, citing unofficial preliminary estimates from city authorities. Jakub Kaszycki, 21, joined the pro-Trzaskowski march, saying it could determine Poland’s future direction. “I very much favour … the West’s way to Europe, not to Russia,” he said. At Trzaskowski’s march, newly elected Romanian President Nicusor Dan pledged to work closely with Tusk and Trzaskowski “to ensure Poland and the European Union remain strong”. Dan’s unexpected victory in a vote on May 18 over a hard-right Trump supporter was greeted with relief in Brussels and other parts of Europe because many were concerned that his rival George Simion would have complicated EU efforts to tackle Russia’s war in Ukraine.",

    "article_text": "Lando Norris celebrated his first Monaco Grand Prix win from pole position and slashed McLaren teammate Oscar Piastri’s Formula One drivers’ championship lead to just three points in a race more about strategy than speed. Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc finished runner-up in the home race he won last year, with Piastri third and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen fourth – all four finishing in the order they started. The Sunday afternoon race featured two mandatory pit stops for the first time, but hopes of more action around the cramped harbourside circuit fell short. Drivers through the field played a waiting game, with Verstappen holding off his final stop until the penultimate lap and those behind biding their time while keeping out of trouble. Norris ultimately lapped all but four cars. The win was the Briton’s second in eight races and first since the Australian GP season opener in March, as well as McLaren’s first at Monaco since 2008. “Monaco baby!” Norris shouted over the radio as the chequered flag finally fell. “The last quarter was stressful with Leclerc behind and Max ahead, but we won in Monaco,” he said. “This is what I dreamed of when I was a kid, so I achieved one of my dreams.” Ferrari’s Lewis Hamilton was fifth, with Racing Bulls’ Isack Hadjar sixth and Haas’s Esteban Ocon seventh. Liam Lawson scored his first points of the season for Racing Bulls in eighth place, and Williams completed the top 10 with Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz. Mercedes had a dismal afternoon in the Mediterranean sunshine, after a nightmare in qualifying, with George Russell 11th and Italian rookie Andrea Kimi Antonelli 18th and the last car still running. The virtual safety car was deployed on the opening lap when Sauber’s Gabriel Bortoleto went into the tyre wall at Portier, the turn before the tunnel, as Antonelli passed on the inside. Bortoleto made it back to the pits and continued. Alpine’s Pierre Gasly was the first retirement, the Frenchman crashing into the back of Yuki Tsunoda’s Red Bull car at the tunnel exit on lap nine and limping back to the pits with the front left wheel hanging off. “Is he an idiot? What is he doing?” exclaimed Tsunoda. Gasly, who said he had no brakes, almost took out Argentine rookie teammate Franco Colapinto as he careered through the Nouvelle Chicane.

    "title": "Fewer Venezuelans vote amid boycott calls, fears of government repression",
    "article_text": "Venezuelans are casting their ballots in legislative and regional elections, but in a low turnout fuelled by disillusionment and frustration, under the shadow of a heightened government crackdown and opposition leaders calling for a boycott. Sunday’s elections are the first to allow comprehensive voter participation since last year’s disputed presidential vote, which President Nicolas Maduro claimed to have won despite contradictory evidence. It is also taking place two days afterthe government detained dozens of people, including a prominent opposition leader, and accused them of being linked to an alleged plot to hinder the vote. Members of the military throughout the day outnumbered voters at many polling centres in the capital, Caracas. No lines formed outside the polling stations, including the country’s largest – a stark contrast with the hundreds of people gathered around the same time for the July 28 presidential election. Many people appeared to have lost faith in the electoral process. “I am not going to vote after they stole the elections last year. For what? I don’t want to be disappointed again,” Caracas resident Paula Aranguren said. In the eyes of the opposition, voter participation legitimises Maduro’s claim to power and what they brand as his government’s repressive apparatus. After the presidential election, 25 people were reportedly killed and more than 2,000 people were detained – including protesters, poll workers, political activists and minors – to quash dissent. The government also issuedarrest warrantsagainst opposition leaders, levelling charges against them ranging from conspiracy to falsifying records. Despite the risks, campaigning for some has remained a key form of resistance against the government. “History is full of evidence that voting is an instrument towards democracy,” Henrique Capriles, a former opposition presidential candidate now running for a seat in the National Assembly, told Al Jazeera. “I believe the way we stood for our rights last year kept alive the peaceful fight for our constitution because voting is what we have left to manifest our rejection of Maduro and his government,” Capriles said. Meanwhile, the ruling party is touting an overwhelming victory across the country, just as it has done in previous regional elections. A nationwide poll conducted from April 29 to May 4 by the Venezuela-based research firm Delphos showed only 15.9 percent of voters expressed a high probability of voting on Sunday. Of those, 74.2 percent said they would vote for the candidates of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela and its allies, while 13.8 percent said they would vote for contenders associated with two opposition leaders who are not boycotting the elections. Maduro accuses the opposition of attempts to destabilise the country. “The death throes of fascism have tried to bring in mercenaries, and today, we have already captured more than 50 mercenaries who came in to plant bombs or launch violent attacks in the country,” he told supporters before election day. Political analysts said the chances that free and fair elections would take place are practically nonexistent. “There won’t be witnesses at the table, very few witnesses. Nobody wants to be a witness,” political analyst Benigno Alarcon told Al Jazeera, adding that low voter turnout, no understanding of who the candidates are and the lack of international observers are likely going to make the elections unfair. Some voters who cast ballots on Sunday said they did so out of fear of losing their government jobs or food and other state-controlled benefits. “Most of my friends aren’t going to vote, not even a blank vote,” state employee Miguel Otero, 69, told The Associated Press news agency. “But we must comply. We have to send the photo [showing] I’m here at the polling station now.”",

    "title": "Fact-checking Trump’s claims about Medicaid cuts in GOP bill",
    "article_text": "A Medicaid bill pushed by Republicans proposes significant cuts to the health insurance programme for lower-income Americans. But United States President Donald Trump has claimed the legislation would changeMedicaidin ways that only combat “waste, fraud and abuse”, a phrase he repeated seven times over a couple of minutes. “We’re not doing any cutting of anything meaningful,” the Republican president said. “The only thing we’re cutting is waste, fraud and abuse. … We’re not changing Medicaid, and we’re not changing Medicare, and we’re not changing Social Security.” The House of Representativespassed the billon Thursday, and it now moves to the Senate, where it could be changed. The House version doesn’t directly target Social Security or Medicare. But it changes Medicaid, including in ways that align with Republican priorities. Congress’s nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that at least 8.6 million people will lose coverage because of the changes. “Relatively little of the bill is clearly related to trying to reduce fraud or error,” said Leighton Ku, director of George Washington University’s Center for Health Policy Research. “There are some minor provisions about things like looking for dead people who are enrolled or checking addresses. But the major provisions are not fraud, waste or error by any means. They’re things that reflect policy preferences of the Republican architects.” Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at the health policy research group KFF, agreed that the scope of the bill’s changes go further than Trump said. “The magnitude of the federal spending reductions and resulting coverage loss go well beyond rooting out fraud and abuse,” she said. The bill’s key provisions could be removed before the final votes and enactment while others may be added. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this fact check. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that runs Medicaid, offers official definitions for these three terms: One provision in the bill requires states to confirm recipients’ Medicaid eligibility at least every six months rather than every year under current law. Another would set stricter requirements for verifying enrollees’ addresses and other information. Such efforts could save expenditures on ineligible people and could be classified as a waste-prevention measure. Other provisions are more ideological than focused on waste, fraud and abuse Several of the bill’s highest-profile provisions are driven more by ideology – differences in how expansive the programme should be and what types of people should benefit. One of these provisions involves people in the US without documentation. Because it’s already against the law to spend federal Medicaid funds on undocumented people, the bill takes a different approach: It seeks to make it harder for states to exclusively rely on state funds to cover immigrants in the US. Currently, 14 states and the District of Columbia cover children regardless of their immigration status, and seven states plus Washington, DC, cover at least some adults living in the US without documents too. For these states, the bill reduces the federal government’s share of Medicaid payments from 90 percent to 80 percent. In other words, if a state wants to keep covering undocumented people, it will face a cut in the federal reimbursement rate for the coverage of US citizens, not just immigrants in the country without documents. Budgetary pressures in these states could mean that some citizens also lose some of their benefits or all of their Medicaid coverage. Another provision involves work requirements. The bill would require individuals aged 19 to 64 receiving Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act expansion, which was passed during former President Barack Obama’s Democratic administration, to be working or participating in qualifying activities (such as having a disability, being a caretaker for family members or attending school) for at least 80 hours per month. Research has found that the vast majority of people who would be required to work under similar requirements are already employed or have a qualifying exemption — yet many get thrown off Medicaid because they fail to keep up with the mandatory paperwork. “Work requirements are not about waste, fraud, and abuse. They are fundamentally changing the rules of who is eligible for the programme, and they are adding an immense set of bureaucratic obstacles and red tape for eligible people to keep coverage,” said Benjamin D Sommers, a professor of healthcare economics and medicine at Harvard University’s TH Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School. A KFF analysis in March found that fraud occurs in Medicare and Medicaid mostly by providers. “There are checks on fraud, waste, and abuse at both the federal and the state levels,” KFF wrote. Another bill provision bans Medicaid funds spent on nonprofit organisations primarily engaged in family planning or reproductive services, which would affect Planned Parenthood and other organisations that provide abortions. Finally, at least two provisions focus on saving money. One would require, for the first time, that states impose $35 copays for many types of care. The other would limit retroactive coverage after applying for Medicaid to one month before application, down from 90 days. These provisions don’t specify how they’d root out waste, fraud and abuse. “The ‘Medicaid savings’ in this bill are primarily from reducing programme enrolment,” Sommers said. Trump said the House bill is “not changing Medicaid,” only cutting “waste, fraud and abuse”. The legislation includes provisions that could improve the detection of beneficiaries who aren’t eligible for coverage. But other provisions would change Medicaid to align with Trump’s ideology and Republican priorities. The bill would incentivise states to stop using their own funds to cover undocumented people in the US; it requires people to work or do other approved activities to secure benefits; and it bans Medicaid payments to nonprofits such as Planned Parenthood, which provide abortions among other services. Other changes aim to cut expenses, including the imposition of copays and a shorter window for retroactive coverage. Those provisions don’t specify how they’d cut waste, fraud or abuse. We rate the statementfalse.",

    "title": "Spain hosts European, Arab nations to pressure Israel to halt Gaza assault",
    "article_text": "The international community should look to impose sanctions on Israel to stop its war in Gaza, Spain’s foreign minister has said, at a Madrid meeting of European and Arab nations, urging a halt to Israel’s punishing offensive in which Palestinian deaths and the spread of starvation are increasing each day. The high-level talks on Sunday are the fifth official meeting of what is known as “The Madrid Group”. Countries in the European Union that Israel had long counted on as close allies have been adding their voices to growing global pressure after it expanded military operations in the besieged and bombarded Gaza Strip. A nearly three-month aid blockade has worsened shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine in the Palestinian enclave, which has been devastated and ravaged due to Israel’s relentless war that followed the Hamas-led October 7 attack in 2023. Barely any aid has crossed into Gaza since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said a week ago that Israel would allow limited aid in to assuage concerns from allies. The United Nations has said theamount of aidallowed in so far is a “drop in the ocean”, while some aid groups have described Netanyahu’s announcement as a “smokescreen”. Aid organisations say the trickle of supplies Israel that allowed to enter in recent days falls far short of needs, which is between 500-600 trucks a day. Israel has allowed some 100 trucks carrying aid into Gaza since Wednesday, officials say. Madrid, Spain is hosting 20 countries as well as international organisations on Sunday with the aim of “stopping this war, which no longer has any goal”, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares said. “In this terrible moment, in this humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, we aim to … stop this war … [and to] break the blockade of humanitarian assistance that must go in unimpeded,” Albares told Al Jazeera ahead of the meeting. Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa said he hopes the Israeli government would stop “famine” and “genocide” in Gaza, saying many countries around the world “clearly disapprove it”. For his part, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel Atty said there’s a “lack of political will from the Israeli side” to end the war. “This is the main problem”, Abdel Atty said. “But we will keep trying, we will apply maximum pressure, we will continue to exert our maximum efforts in order to push for a ceasefire”. The Madrid meeting has served as preparation for a high-level UN conference on the two-state solution, which France and Saudi Arabia will host in New York on June 17. “We want to create momentum” ahead of the UN conference, Albares said, so that “everyone” can recognise Palestine as an independent state. “That conference in New York must be a big moment to push towards recognition of the state of Palestine,” he added. A previous such gathering in Madrid last year brought together countries including Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye as well as European nations such as Norway and the Republic of Ireland that have recognised a Palestinian state. Sunday’s meeting, which also includes representatives from the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, will promote a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. After the EU decided this week to review its cooperation deal with Israel, Albares said, “We must consider sanctions, we must do everything, consider everything to stop this war.” Germany’s Deputy Foreign Minister Florian Hahn on Sunday also warned about the impact of Gaza’s deteriorating, “unbearable” humanitarian crisis, calling for an immediate ceasefire and diplomatic solution. Hahn stressed that ending the war in Gaza and creating a path for diplomatic efforts toward a political solution is currently one of German foreign policy’s main priorities. Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra, reporting from Madrid, said Sunday’s meeting is going to be “crucial”. Members are going to be “seeking the potential of further political talks that could be conducive to the Israelis coming along with the Palestinians, discussing the need to end the war and achieve a Palestinian state”, Ahelbarra said. Israel’s deadly assault has killed almost 54,000 people, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, mostly women and children.",

    "title": "Lamine Yamal: Barcelona football star inspires youth in hometown Rocafonda",
    "article_text": "Rocafonda, Spain –The front page of Spain’s biggest sports tabloid Marca screamed LAMINE YA! (Lamine Now!) as speculation mounted over whether the teenage wonder boy would sign a new contract for FC Barcelona. Lamine Yamal is expected to renew his contract with Barcelona before he turns 18 in July, his agent Jorge Mendes assured reporters last week. Deco, the sporting director of Barca, denied reports that Yamal’s agent had asked that the 17-year-old be made the highest paid player in the dressing room, while Spanish media speculated that he could look forward to a 10-fold pay increase to more than 15 million euros ($17m) net per season. Whatever the astronomical sums involved in signing the gifted winger who helped Barca clinch the La Liga title this season, it will seem a world away from the very humble beginnings of this Spanish sporting prodigy. Yamal grew up in a poor area of Mataro, an industrial town located about 32km (20 miles) north of Barcelona, but it is a world away from the glitz and glamour of the Catalan capital. The Barca footballer learned his craft on the streets of Rocafonda, a working-class neighbourhood of Mataro. About half of the 11,000 people who live in this corner of Mataro are classified as “at risk of poverty”, according to the Spanish National Statistics Institute. Many flats appear run down and lack basic modern-day amenities like lifts. One centre in Rocafonda offers help to children who are struggling at school. With 88 different nationalities in the area, Arabic halal butchers are a common sight. Evictions are a daily occurrence in Rocafonda as many households struggle to pay the rent, which averages about $1,334 per month, a fortune to many. Nevertheless, football – or rather Yamal – gives people hope here. “In Rocafonda, more Lamine Yamals and fewer evictions”, reads the graffiti at the Club de Futbol Rocafonda, the municipal football pitch. Children play nearby, perhaps dreaming that maybe, just maybe, they could be the next Lamine Yamal. Wearing an Argentina shirt, Mohammed Kaddouri, who is a year younger than Yamal, says the Barca football player is an inspiration to young people here. “Since Lamine, so many people have started playing football and believe they could be like him. It is not just boys but more girls are playing football too,” he says. His friend Damia Castillo, also 16, met Yamal when he came back to see his family, who still live in the neighbourhood. “He always talks to us like he is a normal person, not like he is some big star. He is from here, and so are we. It makes you think, you know, maybe it could be me,” Castillo told Al Jazeera. Friends said Yamal owes his precocious talents to a baptism of fire playing in the tough streets of Rocafonda. “Lamine learned to play so well because he started playing with bigger kids. Some of these were bigger than him, and some of them were tough kids,” says family friend Mohammed Ben Serghine. “Despite what has happened to him with all this fame, he has remained humble, and he is good with the kids when he comes back to Rocafonda to see his family.” We meet in the Bar El Cordobes, the local bar frequented by Yamal’s father, Mounir Nasraoui, who pops in now and again. On the wall is a yellowing Barca shirt signed by Yamal and replete with his photograph. Last year, the Spain winger’s father published a photograph on social media of his son, which was taken when he was a baby. Yamal was cradled by then-Barcelona footballer Lionel Messi. He wrote on social media: “Two beginnings of two legends. It now appears amazingly prescient.” The Argentina superstar was 20 at the time and had taken part in a promotional campaign for FC Barcelona for UNICEF. Yamal was only five months old when his parents entered him into a raffle and he was paired up with Messi. Yamal’s smiles won over a nervous Messi at the photoshoot. Statistically, Yamal is ahead of Messi for a 17-year-old player, according to football writer Ryan O’Hanlon of ESPN. “Broadly, this is the conclusion: [Michael] Owen, Kylian Mbappe and Yamal are the best teenagers in modern soccer history,” he wrote, basing these assertions on the number of goals and assists. Rocafonda might have been forgotten, like many other fringe, outer-suburban Barcelona neighbourhoods, were it not for Yamal himself. On the walls, someone has painted the number 304. It might just be graffiti, except for one thing. When Yamal scored a wonder goal against France in the Euro 2024 last year, he celebrated by making the sign three, zero, four with his fingers. It was a reference to the postcode of Rocafonda, which in full reads 08304. As the world was transfixed by Yamal’s dazzling skills, it was a sign that even when footballers can expect seven- or even eight-figure salaries, some have not forgotten their roots. At the Bar Familia L Y 304 Rocafonda, run by the player’s uncle, Abdul, you are left in no doubt that Yamal remains faithful to where he came from. Decked out in photographs of Yamal and signed shirts, in one corner is a tiny, plastic version of the World Cup. It begs the thought: might Yamal one day lift the real thing for Spain? The player’s own story starts 30 years ago when his maternal grandmother, Fatima, arrived from Morocco and took up a job in an old people’s residence. She worked to bring her seven children over from Morocco and managed as a single mother. Yamal’s mother, Sheila Ebana, is from Equatorial Guinea, a former Spanish colony in Western Africa. The player’s parents divorced, and when she moved away from Rocafonda, she enrolled him in Club de Futbol La Torreta in Granollers, a nearby town. Yamal speaks fondly about his mother, who gave him the best childhood she could despite the difficulties she faced. “Maybe I didn’t have the best childhood, but I didn’t see it. I only saw the beautiful, thanks to her,” he said in an Instagram interview with user tumejorjugada. Life for both parents has changed dramatically since their son became a superstar. Ebana now has 258,000 followers on Instagram and has moved to Barcelona. His father has also moved to the Catalan capital. Yamal started playing for CF La Torreta, a small club with 200 players, when he was only five. On the window of the club, there is a photograph of the player when he arrived as a small child and another more recent one. “He came here when he was five years old and stayed just two years before Barcelona came for him,” says Jordi Vizcaino, president of CF La Torreta. “I still can hardly believe it when I see how far he has gone, when I see Yamal playing for Barca and Spain. He was just a kid when he came here and is still just a kid really.” Rocio Escandell, president of the Association of Rocafonda Neighbours, has known Yamal and his family all his life. “Lamine has put Rocafonda on the world map. It is a working-class area with lots of migrants, but he has made people here believe they can be something. It does not have to be a footballer. It might be a doctor. Just to believe,” she told Al Jazeera. Her nine-year-old daughter, Abril, is proof of how Yamal has changed expectations. “I have been playing football since I was small, and I score more and more goals. When I am older, I want to be like Lamine,” says Abril.",

    "title": "Gaza’s youngest influencer among children killed by Israel in last two days",
    "article_text": "Israeli forces have killed more than a dozen Palestinian children in the Gaza Strip in the last 48 hours, while thousands more face the threat of imminent starvation amid a drastically deteriorating humanitarian crisis. On Sunday, four-year-old Mohammed Yassine joineddozens of other childrenwho have starved to death in recent days as the World Food Programme (WFP) warned that more than 70,000 children in Gaza face acute levels of malnutrition. As well as causing starvation deaths, Israel has intensified its bombardment and ground offensive in Gaza, killing some 600 people in nearly a week. A strike on a tent housing displaced people in central Gaza killed a mother and her children in the central city of Deir el-Balah, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital, while a child was killed when his family’s tent was struck with a drone in Bani Suheila, east of Khan Younis, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. A strike in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza killed at least five, including two women and a child, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Eleven-year-old Yaqeen Hammad, a popular social media influencer, and nine of Dr Alaa Amir al-Najjar’s 10 children were also killed in separate Israeli air raids. Al-Najjar’s remaining child, 11-year-old Adam, is in critical condition in an intensive care unit. The attacks come amid an Israeli blockade for almost three months that has choked off access to essential food, fuel, and medical supplies. Aid agencies warn that thousands of children are now at risk ofdeath from starvation. Children account for 31 percent of Palestinians confirmedkilledduring Israel’s 19 months of war on Gaza, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza. This figure excludes deaths that have been reported but for which the victims remain unidentified, suggesting the real toll is higher. A report commissioned by the United Nations also highlighted Israel’s disproportionateviolenceagainst children through targeting densely populated areas, with repeated air raids on residential buildings contributing to the rising child death toll. At least 22 Palestinians were killed in Israeli attacks across the Gaza Strip since dawn on Sunday, according to Al Jazeera Arabic. Below are some of the children killed in Israeli attacks: Known for her smile and volunteer work in Gaza, Yaqeen Hammad was killed after Israel shelled al-Baraka in Deir el-Balah, northern Gaza, on Friday night. The 11-year-old influencer and her older brother, Mohamed Hammad, delivered food, toys and clothing to displaced families, the Palestine Chronicle reports. She also played an active role in the Ouena collective – a Gaza-based nonprofit group dedicated to aid and humanitarian relief. Messages of grief and tributes from activists, Yaqeen’s followers and journalists poured in after news of her death spread online. “Her body may be gone, but her impact remains a beacon of humanity,” wrote Mahmoud Bassam, a photojournalist in Gaza. “Instead of being at school and enjoying her childhood, she was active on Instagram and participating in campaigns to help others in Gaza. No words. Absolutely no words,” another tribute read on X. A post shared by الجزيرة (@aljazeera) Activists and Palestinian platforms shared on social media painful scenes of Mohammed Yassine on a hospital bed. Appearing in a video, holding Yassine’s body, Mahmoud Basal of Gaza’s Civil Defence said: “Mohammed Yassine died from hunger, a direct result of the occupation’s prevention of food and medical aid from entering Gaza.” “Mohammed was not the first child, and the fear has become a certainty that he won’t be the last,” Basal added. An Israeli attack on the home of al-Najjar on Friday killed nine of her children and critically injured 11-year-old Adam. Sidar, Luqman, Sadin, Reval, Ruslan, Jubran, Eve, Rakan and Yahya  – aged between seven months and 12 years – all died in the attack, Gaza’s Government Media Office said. Al-Najjar is a paediatrician at the southern city’s Nasser Hospital, where her husband is receiving care after beingcritically injuredin the attack. “It is unbelievable,” said Ahmad al-Farra, head of the hospital’s paediatrics department, of the attack’s impact. “You can’t imagine the shock that [al-Najjar] had when she heard about that [attack]. But up until now, she is trying to be near her son and her husband to survive.”",

    "title": "British MotoGP: Bezzecchi wins after Quatararo fail, red flag drama",
    "article_text": "Marco Bezzecchi has won a chaotic British Grand Prix for Aprilia’s first victory of the 2025 season in a race that was initially red-flagged for an oil spill as riders crashed or retired while in the lead, including pole-sitter Fabio Quartararo. The victory was a first for Aprilia since the Grand Prix of the Americas last year. LCR Honda’s Johann Zarco came second on Sunday and Ducati’s Marc Marquez pipped Franco Morbidelli to finish third and extend his lead in the riders world championship. Both Alex Marquez and his brother Marc crashed while leading before the race was restarted for an oil spill while Yamaha’s Quartararo took the lead at the second time of asking before being forced to retire on lap 12 due to a technical issue with his bike. Bezzecchi’s victory was his first since the 2023 Indian Grand Prix, and the Italian also became the 11th different winner at Silverstone in the past 11 races. “It’s amazing. It has been a really tough time for me in this past month. …  Aprilia trusted in me, and we worked really hard,” Bezzecchi said. “The team made a wonderful job. … I was waiting for a day like this since my last win.” On the first start, sprint winner Alex Marquez had a perfect launch to take the lead from Quartararo, but just as he leaned into turn one, he lost control and crashed, allowing Marc Marquez to take the lead. The elder Marquez also lost control, however, and crashed out of the lead – but the Marquez brothers earned a reprieve when the red flag came out for an oil spill in the final sector after Franco Morbidelli and Aleix Espargaro collided and crashed. Since three laps had not been completed, all riders were eligible for the restart. Quartararo took the lead from Francesco Bagnaia and streaked away to a full second’s lead on the opening lap. Both factory Ducatis suffered on lap three at Copse corner when they went wide as Marc Marquez and Bagnaia dropped to ninth and 10th place. Bagnaia’s race ended on the following lap when he crashed while Bezzecchi moved up to third behind Pramac Racing’s Jack Miller. Behind them, Marc Marquez was a man on a mission as he methodically picked his way through the pack, and by lap 11, he had moved up to fourth. Yamaha’s dreams of taking the chequered flag went up in smoke as Quartararo signalled he had a problem with his bike, and the Frenchman relinquished his lead of nearly five seconds as his ride-height device had failed. Quartararo stopped by the side of the track, hopped off his bike and sank to his knees with his head on the tarmac as the shell-shocked Yamaha garage looked on. “When I saw Fabio with a technical problem, I even thought about a victory,” said Zarco, the first Honda rider to take back-to-back podiums since Marc Marquez in 2021. Bezzecchi held on to win, though, while Marc Marquez swapped places with VR46 Racing’s Franco Morbidelli several times on the final lap before taking third in a photo finish. “Today we were lucky because I made a mistake,” said a fuming Marc Marquez, who now leads his brother by 24 points in the world championship.",

    "title": "Oil riches are on the horizon as Suriname chooses its next government",
    "article_text": "Voters in Suriname, which is on the cusp of a much anticipated oil boom, have begun to elect a new parliament, which will subsequently choose the next president of the smallest nation in South America. Sunday’s elections have already been marked by fraud allegations and have seen little debate about what the next government, which will hold power until 2030, should do with income from the offshore oil and gas Gran Morgu project. It is to begin production in 2028. Experts said Suriname, a country beset by poverty and rampant inflation, is projected to make billions of dollars in the coming decade or two from recently discovered offshore crude deposits. The project, led by TotalEnergies, is Suriname’s first major offshore effort. The former Dutch colony, independent since 1975, discovered reserves that may allow itto compete with neighbouring Guyana– whose economy grew 43.6 percent last year – as a prominent producer. “It will be a huge amount of income for the country,” President Chan Santokhi told the AFP news agency this week. “We are now able … to do more for our people, so that everyone can be part of the growth of the nation.” Santokhi is constitutionally eligible for a second term, but with no single party in a clear lead in the elections, pollsters are not predicting the outcome. The party with the most seats will lead Suriname’s next government, likely through a coalition with smaller parties, but negotiations and the choosing of a new president are expected to take weeks. Fourteen parties are taking part in the elections, including Santokhi’s centrist Progressive Reform Party and the leftist National Democratic Party of deceased former coup leader andelected President Desi Bouterse. Also in the running is the centre-left General Liberation and Development Party of Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk, a former rebel who fought against Bouterse’s government in the 1980s. Provisional results are expected by late Sunday. Suriname – a diverse country made up of descendants of people from India, Indonesia, China, the Netherlands, Indigenous groups and enslaved Africans – will mark the 50th anniversary of its independence from the Netherlands in November. Since independence, it has looked increasingly towards China as a political ally and trading partner and in 2019 became one of the first Latin American countries to join the Asian giant’s Belt and Road infrastructure drive. United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio made a stopover in Suriname in March on a regional tour aimed at countering China’s growing influence in the region. More than 90 percent of the country is covered in forest, and it is one of few in the world with a negative carbon footprint. Santokhi insisted this status is not in danger and Suriname can use its oil windfall “for the transition towards the green energy which we need, also because we know the fossil energy is limited”. “It will be gone after 40 years.”",

    "title": "In Gaza, selling or serving food can get you killed",
    "article_text": "On April 27, my brother-in-law, Samer, was killed in Deir el-Balah in central Gaza when his vegetable stall was bombed. He wasn’t armed. He wasn’t a political figure. He was a peaceful man trying to earn a living to feed his children in a place where food has become more expensive than gold. Samer wasn’t a vendor by profession. He was a lawyer who defended the rights of the oppressed. But the war forced him to change his path. During the ceasefire, he was able to buy vegetables from local wholesalers. After the war resumed and the crossings into Gaza were closed in March, supplies dwindled dramatically, but he maintained a small stock of vegetables. He continued selling day and night, even as buyers became scarce due to the high prices. He often tried to give us vegetables for free out of generosity, but I always refused. When I heard about Samer’s killing, I froze. I tried to hide the news from my husband, but my tears spoke the truth. He looked like he wanted to scream, but the scream remained trapped inside his throat. Something held him back – perhaps his burdened soul could no longer bear even the expression of grief. Samer left behind three little children and a heartbroken family. No one expected his death. It came as a shock. He was a good and pure-hearted young man, always cheerful, loving life and laughter, even in the toughest times. I still remember him standing in front of his vegetable stall, lovingly calling out to customers. Samer is among countless food sellers who have been killed in this genocidal war. Anyone employed in providing or selling food has been targeted. Fruit and vegetable vendors, grocers, bakers, shop owners and community kitchen workers have been bombed, as if they were dealing with weapons, not food. Bakeries, shops, farms and warehouses have been destroyed, as if the food they were providing was a threat. Ten days after Samer was killed, a restaurant and a market on al-Wahda Street, one of the busiest in the Remal neighbourhood of Gaza City, were bombed. At least 33 people were killed. Two weeks before Samer’s martyrdom, the vicinity of a bakery in Jabaliya wasbombed. Days before that, a food distribution centre in Khan Younis wastargeted. According to the Government Media Office in Gaza, more than 39 food and distribution centres and 29 community kitchens have beentargetedsince the beginning of the war. It is clear by now that in its campaign of deliberate starvation, Israel is not only blocking food from entering Gaza. It is also destroying every link in the food supply chain. As a result of the repeated targeting of vendors and markets, all that is available now to buy – for those who can afford to buy food – are scraps. Death has become easier than life in Gaza. The starvation is affecting babies and little children the worst. On May 21, the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor reported at least 26 Palestinians, including nine children, died within a 24-hour period due to starvation and lack of medical care in Gaza. On May 5, the Ministry of Health in Gaza said it hadregisteredthe deaths of at least 57 children caused by malnutrition since the aid blockade began in early March. As a mother, I often go days without eating just to feed my children whatever little food we have left. My husband spends the entire day searching for anything to ease our hunger but usually comes back with mere scraps. If we’re lucky, we eat a piece of bread – often stale – with a tomato or cucumber that I divide equally among our children. The hardship Samer’s wife faces is even more unbearable. She tries to hide her tears from her children, who keep asking when their father will return from the market. The loss forced her to become a father overnight, pushing her to stand in long queues in front of community kitchens just to get a bit of food. She often returns empty-handed, trying to comfort her children with hollow words: “When Dad comes back, he’ll bring us food.” Her children fall asleep hungry, dreaming of a bite to fill their stomachs – one their late father will never bring. Israel has claimed that it is blocking aid to Gaza because Hamas takes it. The Western media, fully complicit in distorting the truth, has parroted the claim. Yet it is clear that Israel is not just targeting Hamas but the entire population of Gaza. It is deliberately using starvation as a weapon of war against civilians, obstructing the flow of humanitarian aid – a war crime, according to international law. Recently, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made the true aim of his government more than apparent by demanding all Palestinians be expelled from Gaza as a condition for ending the war. His decision to allow food through the crossings is nothing but a PR stunt. Enough flour was let in to have images of bread distributed at a bakery circulating in the media and to reassure the world that we are not starving. But these images do not reflect the reality for us on the ground. My family has not received any bread and neither have the majority of families. Flour – where available – continues to cost $450 per bag. While Israel claims that 388 aid trucks have entered since Monday, aid organisations are saying 119 have. An unknown number of these have been looted because the Israeli army continues to target anyone trying to secure aid distribution. This tiny trickle of aid Israel is allowing is nothing compared with the needs of the starving population. At least 500 trucks are required every single day to cover the bare minimum. Meanwhile, some Western governments have threatened sanctions and made some symbolic gestures to supposedly pressure Israel to stop starving us. Why did they need to wait to see our children dying of hunger before doing this? And why are they only threatening and not taking real action? Today, our greatest wish is to find a loaf of bread. Our sole concern is how to keep surviving amid this catastrophic famine that has broken our bones and melted our insides. No one among us is healthy any more. We’ve become skeletons. Our bodies are dead, but they still pulse with hope – yearning for that miraculous day when this nightmare ends. But who will act to support us? Who still has a shred of compassion for us in their heart? And the most important question of all – when will the world finally stop turning a blind eye to our slow, brutal death by hunger?

    "title": "Five years after George Floyd’s death, why misinformation still persists",
    "article_text": "Five years ago on May 25, 2020, a white police officer in the United States killed George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, during an arrest. A bystander’s video showed officer Derek Chauvin kneeling onFloyd’s neckfor aboutnine minutesin Minneapolis, Minnesota, as Floyd pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. The footage sparked weeks of global protests against police brutality and racism. It contributed to a jury’s murder conviction against Chauvin and a federal investigation into the Minneapolis Police Department. Although ample evidence showed that Chauvin and police misconduct were to blame for Floyd’s death, another narrative quickly emerged – that Floyd died because of a drug overdose. Five years later, that falsehood is central to calls for President Donald Trump to pardon Chauvin. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of Trump’s Republican Party from Georgia, for example, recently revived her longstanding and long-debunked take that Chauvin did not cause Floyd’s death. “I strongly support Derek Chauvin being pardoned and released from prison,” Greenewrotein a May 14 X post. “George Floyd died of a drug overdose.” In 2021, aMinnesota jury convicted Chauvinof second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Chauvin also pleaded guilty to twice violating a federal criminal civil rights statute – once against Floyd and once against a 14-year-old in 2017. The state and federal sentences that Chauvin is serving concurrently each exceeded 20 years. In 2023 after a two-year investigation sparked by Floyd’s death, the US Department of Justice found that the city of Minneapolis and its police departmentengaged in a patternof civil rights violations, including use of excessive force and unlawful discrimination against Black and Native American people. The narrative that Floyd died of an overdose persisted through the involved police officers’ criminal trials and beyond their convictions, in part because powerful political critics of the racial justice movement sought to rewrite history with false claims. It was one of many false statements about Floyd’s actions, his criminal history andthe protests that followed his murder. Experts said systemic racism contributes also to the proliferation of the inaccurate narratives and their staying power. “The core through-line that emerges is the kind of longstanding, deep racist narratives around Black criminality and also the ways people try to justify who is or isn’t an ‘innocent victim’,” Rachel Kuo, a University of Wisconsin-Madison professor who studies race, social movements and technology, said of the falsehoods. The summer 2020 protests built on2014and2016 protestsagainst police brutality, but with Floyd’s case as a catalyst, racial justice advocates achieved global visibility and corporate attention, Kuo said. That visibility came with a price. When people of colour achieve visibility for their social movements or political demands, an effort to delegitimise those demands quickly follows, Kuo said. Misinformation plays a part by trying to “chip away” at the belief that what happened to Floyd was unjust or to undermine the protest movement overall, she said. Chauvin killed Floyd after police were called to a corner grocery store where Floyd was suspected of using a counterfeit $20 bill. News reports about Floyd’s criminal record – which included three drug charges, two theft cases, aggravated robbery and trespassing – fuelled false claims about his background. Two autopsy reports – one performed by Hennepin County’s medical examiner and one commissioned by Floyd’s family – concludedFloyd’s death was a homicide. Although they pointed to different causes of death,neither report saidhe died because of an overdose. The Hennepin County medical examiner’s officereported“fentanyl intoxication” and “recent methamphetamine use” among “other significant conditions” related to his death, but it did not say drugs killed him. It said Floyd “experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer”. The private autopsy concluded Floyd died of suffocation. Nevertheless, the Hennepin County autopsy report’s fentanyl detail provided kindling for the drug overdose narrative to catch fire. PolitiFact firstfact-checkedthis narrative when it was published on aconservative blogin August 2020. As Chauvin’s trial approached in early 2021, then-Fox News host Tucker Carlson wrongly told his millions of viewers that Floyd’s autopsy showed he “almost certainly died of a drug overdose. Fentanyl.” Conservative influencer Candace Owens amplified the false narrative in March 2021. Lawyers defending Chauvin argued drug use was a moreprimary cause of deaththan the police restraint, but jurors were unconvinced. Chauvin’s 2021convictiondidn’t spell the end of misinformation about Floyd’s death. The drug overdose narrative emerged again in late 2022 as the trial neared for two other police officers charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd’s death. Misinformation experts said it’s not surprising that Floyd and the 2020 protests remain a target of false portrayals years later because of the widespread attention Floyd’s death drew at a time when online platforms incentivise inflammatory commentary. “Marginalised groups have been prime targets of misinformation going back hundreds, even thousands of years” because falsehoods can be weaponised to demonise, harm and further oppress and discriminate, said Deen Freelon, a University of Pennsylvania Annenberg School for Communication professor who studies digital politics with a focus on race, gender, ideology and other identity dimensions in social media. He said Floyd’s murder was a magnet for mis- and disinformation because it “fits the mould of a prominent event that ties into controversial, long-running political issues,” similar to events such as the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting and the COVID-19 pandemic. Conservative activists and politicians with large followings have continued to target Floyd and the 2020 protests. The drug overdose narrative proliferated in conjunction with the October 2022 release of Owens’s film about Floyd and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, titled The Greatest Lie Ever Sold: George Floyd and the Rise of BLM. Rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, parroted the false narrative in an October 2022 podcast interview, citing Owens’s film. In October 2023, Carlson repeated the false drug overdose narrative. That X video has since received more than 23.5 million views. In December 2023, Greene reshared a different Carlson video with the caption, “George Floyd died from a drug overdose.” Ramesh Srinivasan, an information studies professor at the University of California-Los Angeles Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, said social media algorithms don’t allow for nuanced conversations that require detail and context, which are important for productive discussion about what happened in the summer of 2020. A person’s online visibility and virality, which can directly correlate to their revenues in some cases, improves when a person takes extreme, antagonistic, partisan or hardened positions, he said. “Those conditions have propped up certain people who specialise in the peddling of troll-type content, of caricatured content, of deliberately false content,” Srinivasan said. Freelon said the internet has “added fuel to the fire” and broadened misinformation’s reach. “So it’s important to remain vigilant against misinformation,” he said, “not only because lies are inherently bad but also because the people who bear the harm have often historically suffered disproportionately from prejudice and mistreatment.” PolitiFact researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.",

If you’ve been holding off on an upgrade, maybe it’s finally time. byWes Davis Netflix has been emailing owners of the very earliest Amazon Fire TV devices to let them know it’s ending support for the devices next month,reports German outletHeise. The cutoff for US users is June 3rd,according toZDNet. Amazon spokesperson Jen Lurey Ridings confirmed that support is ending in a statement emailed toThe Verge: Netflix will be discontinuing support for some first-generation Fire TV devices, which were introduced more than 10 years ago. Netflix remains available on all other Fire TV devices. Lurey Ridings specified that Netflix won’t be supported on the first-generation models of Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, and Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote. They also confirmed that people who have those devices “may be eligible for a discount on a newer Fire TV Stick and can contact customer service for more information.” If you didn’t get the email but want to check whether your Fire TV device is one of those losing Netflix support, the outlet writes that you can look in the “About” section under Settings > My Fire TV. Netflix’s email reportedly doesn’t say why it is cutting off the devices. But in a FAQ added to aNetflix help pagesometime in the last couple of months (March 15th is when itfirst showed upon The Internet Archive), the company indicates it may deprecate its app for devices that “can no longer get necessary updates from its manufacturer or support new features.” The company also added new references to error codes R4, R12, and R25-1, which each signify that a device isn’t supported. Netflix did not immediately respond toThe Verge’s request for comment. Update May 25th:Added statement from Amazon spokesperson Jen Lurey Ridings.

All eight seasons will move over from Netflix, which has hosted the absurdly popular kids show since 2020. CoComelon,essentially a series of mind-numbingly plotless, CG-animated vignettes set to karaoke-quality nursery rhymes, is a giant in the world of programming for children, having accounted for 601 million Netflix views in 2023. According toBloomberg, it was the second most-streamed show on the platform last year. Despite its popularity, Bloomberg reports thatCoComelonviews fell by “almost 60% over the last couple of years,” and that compared to all of streaming, it went from the fifth most-watched show in 2023 to not even breaking the top 10 last year.

Plus, a new FCC filing appears to confirm that a new DJI Osmo action cam is on the way. byWes Davis DJI seems to be preparing three new drones for release in the coming months: a Mini 5 Pro, Avata 3, and a Neo 2,according toDroneXL. The site published leaked images and video of the drones, along with a new FCC filing that suggests DJI is also working on a new action camera called the DJI Osmo Nano. DroneXLpublished a video showing two drones that may be follow-ups to theAvata 2and the adorableDJI Neo.DroneXLnotes a few differences, like that the Avata 3’s battery sits farther back and it’s got a larger camera unit up front. It also has four-blade propellers rather than the three-blade setup of the Avata 2. Next to the Avata 3 is what the outlet thinks is a Neo 2 prototype, although it’s hard to discern much more than that it appears to have redesigned propeller guards compared to the original. Yesterday,DroneXLpointed toa new FCC filing that revealed some information about the unannounced Mini 5 Pro. The filing shows the Mini 5 Pro will pack a whopping 33.5Wh battery — a big improvement over the 18.9Wh of the Mini 4 Pro — and the outlet writes that the wireless transmissions specs support rumors that it could stream video from as far as 25 kilometers (15.5 miles) away, or 5 kilometers farther than its predecessor. That range edges it closer to that DJI Mavic 4 Pro thatwasn’t supposed tolaunch in the US butsomehow went on sale here, anyway. (We’d love to know why, butDJI won’t say.) The Mini 5 Pro is expected to launch in September. Rounding outDroneXL’s rumor post is a newly-published FCC filing for the DJI Osmo Nano, a new wearable action camera that appears to have a modular display like the Action line. The outlet notes that the company is also expected to release a Mic 3 andOsmo 360 camera, though it doesn’t have any solid guesses about when they’re coming.

    "title": "Gemini in Chrome feels like a small step toward Google&#8217;s agentic era",
    "article_text": "You can use Gemini to ask questions about what’s in your tab. You can use Gemini to ask questions about what’s in your tab. byEmma Roth I spent my morning with Gemini in Chrome, the new integration that puts the AI-powered assistant right in your browser. Instead of going to the chatbot’s web app, you can click the new Gemini button in Chrome’s top-right corner to start a conversation — but the key difference is that thebrowser’s built-in assistantcan “see” what’s on your screen while you navigate the web. To me, Gemini’s integration in Chrome seems like just the start of Google’smission to make its AI more “agentic,”as I found myself wanting it to do more than it actually could. For now, you can only try out the early access version of Gemini in Chrome if you’re an AI Pro or AI Ultra subscriber, and use either the Beta, Dev, or Canary version of Chrome. I started out by using Gemini to summarize some of the articles onThe Verge, as well as even find some gaming-related news on the homepage, where it pointed out the new Game Boy games Nintendo added to its Switch Online service, the upcomingElden Ringfilm adaptation, and Valve’s massive Steam Deck update. But Gemini can only “see” what’s on your screen, so I found that if you want it to summarize certain elements, likeThe Verge’s comments section, you’ll need to make it visible before the chatbot can provide a response. Gemini will follow you when you switch tabs, too, but it can only pull information from one at a time. If you don’t feel like typing, Gemini in Chrome also lets you switch to its “Live” feature by selecting the button in the bottom-right corner of the dialogue box. From there, you can simply ask a question out loud, and Gemini will respond by speaking to you. I found this especially useful to use alongside YouTube videos, where I cued up a bathroom remodeling video and asked, “What tool is he using?” Gemini responded, “It looks like he’s using a nail gun to fasten some wood pieces together.” In another video, Gemini correctly identified a capacitor on a motherboard, along with the tweezers and hot air tool the YouTuber used to remove it. It can summarize videos and tell you about specific parts you haven’t watched as well, but I found that this isn’t always accurate if a video doesn’t have labeled chapters that it can draw information from. Probably my favorite use case for the integration is having Gemini pull recipes from YouTube videos, so I didn’t have to write the recipes down myself or search for a link in the description. It also came in handy when I asked it to point out the waterproof bags on an Amazon search page. Gemini wasn’t always consistent, though. When I asked Gemini where MrBeast is during avideo of him exploring ancient Mayan cities, including Chichén Itzá, it replied, “I don’t have access to real-time information, so I can’t pinpoint MrBeast’s exact current location.” When I asked it again, it responded with the location listed in the video’s description: Mexico. Another time, I asked Gemini for a link to buy a specific pair of pliers shown in a video, but Gemini again told me that it didn’t “have access to real-time information, including product listings or store inventories.” However, Gemini provided me with links to other products when prompted. At times, I felt that Gemini’s responses were just too long for just a little pop-up window in Chrome. You can extend it, but it doesn’t leave much room on my MacBook Air’s 13-inch display. Plus, one of AI’s main selling points is that it’s supposed to help you save time by providing quick and concise answers, which it doesn’t always do unless I specifically ask for that. Gemini’s follow-up questions, like whether I would like to know more about a particular topic, also got a bit repetitive. Even with these hiccups, I can easily see Google extending Chrome’s Gemini integration beyond just simple questions and answers. Google wants its AI to become “agentic,” meaning it can perform tasks on your behalf, and Gemini in Chrome seems poised to one day adopt these kinds of features. After asking Gemini to summarize a restaurant’s menu, for example, I even thought about asking it to place a pickup order — an agentic task it just can’t do yet. In the future, I could even see it coming in handy by having it bookmark pages related to travel research for me, or maybe even finding and saving YouTube videos of different recipes to my Watch Later playlist. Google seems like it’s getting closer to making that a realitywith Project Mariner’s “Agent Mode” coming to the Gemini app, which will allow it to manage up to 10 tasks at once and search the web for you — and maybe one day, it will bring these capabilities to Gemini in Chrome, too.

    "title": "Android Auto will get Spotify Jam and support for video apps and web browsers",
    "article_text": "Last week, Google revealed a lot of changes coming to Android Auto. Last week, Google revealed a lot of changes coming to Android Auto. byWes Davis Android Auto is getting more than justGoogle’s Gemini assistantafter theGoogle I/O developer conference. The company has also announced or otherwise shown off a slew of changes coming to the infotainment operating system, including an updated Spotify app, a light mode, and the introduction of web browsers and video apps. Let’s start with Spotify. Googlerevealed in a videolast week that the Spotify app for Android Auto is getting an overhaul through new media app templates the company is making available to developers. One feature the music service is adding to Android Auto is Spotify Jam, a feature that lets users share control of an audio source from their individual devices. In cars with Android Auto, that means anyone with Spotify will jump in by tapping a new “Jam” icon on the car’s touchscreen, then scanning a QR code to start adding upcoming songs to the playlist. Being a Spotify feature, it’s much more inclusive than Apple Music’s similar SharePlay feature, which requires everyone to have an Apple device to participate. Spotify Jam will be available “in the coming months,” the company says. Also in the video, Google says it’s adding support for Quick Share to cars with Google built-in soon, letting users do things like add stops to in-progress Google Maps routes. The company also says it’s going to add passkey support for its infotainment OS. Through a Google Figma kit Google made for prototyping Android Auto app UI, we also have a new look at a light mode theme the company is working on for Android Auto. Google didn’t actually say it’s rolling out a light mode in itsblog postabout all the changes coming to Android Auto, but as9to5Googlenotes, the UI option has beenin the works for years. One thing that Google did mention — and briefly at that — is that browser and video apps are coming to Android Auto. The company says that app category, along with video apps, will be available “soon” for Android Auto and that gaming apps are available already available in beta. Naturally, Google says these features will only work while a car is in park. The browsers feature is already available in beta for cars with Google built-in, while video apps arealready availablein that version of its infotainment system. The company also announced that support for weather apps is officially out of beta.

    "title": "Real-world map data is helping make better games about farms and transportation",
    "article_text": "Titles likeCity Bus ManagerandGlobal Farmerare benefiting from OpenStreetMap. byJay Castello I’m feeling a strange sense of pressure as I set up my first bus route inCity Bus Manager. I want to get things right for the public transportation users of this city, probably because it’s the city I actually live in.City Bus Manageruses OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to populate its maps, so I can see all the familiar streets and points of interest laid out in front of me. These are my neighbors, who, like me, want an efficient transit service. I want to be able to provide it to them — even if only in a simulation. City Bus Manageris part of a small group of management sims that are using OSM’s community-generated database to make the whole world their game setting. Other examples includeGlobal Farmer,NIMBY Rails, andLogistical: Earth. In these games, players can build farms, railways, or delivery networks all over the globe, using data about real fields, settlements, and infrastructure to inform their decisions. When the idea of using OSM was first raised at PeDePe, the studio behindCity Bus Manager, “we had no idea if it would be technically feasible,” says Niklas Polster, the studio’s co-founder. But once established, the license gave them access to an entire world of streets, buildings, and even real bus stops. And these do more than just form the game’s world. They’re also used for gameplay elements like simulating passenger behavior. “Schools generate traffic in the mornings on weekdays, while nightlife areas such as bars and clubs tend to attract more passengers in the evenings on weekends,” ” Polster says. Typically, Polster says, people are drawn to playingCity Bus Managerin their local areas. (This seems to be confirmed by looking at YouTube playthroughs of the game, where creators often begin by saying they’re going to dive into their own city or town.) That personal connection appears almost hardwired into people, says Thorsten Feldmann, CEO ofGlobal Farmerdeveloper Thera Bytes. When they showcased the game at Gamescom in 2024, “every single booth visitor” wanted to input their own postal code and look at their own house. There’s a specific fantasy about being able to transform a space you know so well, Feldmann says. In addition to your own home or town, the marketing forGlobal Farmersuggests using famous tourist locations, such as Buckingham Palace, as the beginning of your new agricultural life. “[Players creating their] own stories around those places can be even more impactful than in purely fictional environments,” Feldmann says. There is something inherently fun about being in control of a place you see every day or one that is deeply iconic. In particular, tearing down a perfectly manicured gated garden from which the British royal family takes£510 million per yearand turning it into land to grow food for a country where4.5 million children live in povertymight not be a one-to-one political solution, but it is emotionally compelling. “We’ve heard stories of players who became interested in public transport as a career thanks to the game.” The quality — or lack thereof — of public transportation is another key political topic where I live. The local buses arecurrently in the processof being nationalized again after what South Yorkshire Mayor Oliver Coppard calls a “failed experiment” in privatization. Maybe that’s why, even though these might just be pixels on a screen, I want to do it right. That’s a feeling many players seem to experience. “Our Discord community is full of players who are passionate about public transport,” Polster says. “We’ve heard stories of players who became interested in public transport as a career thanks to the game.” Of course, game developers using OSM data are still making games, rather than exact simulations. The real world is not always a well-balanced game design space. “In smaller towns and villages, routes can be unprofitable with realistic numbers,” Polster says.City Bus Managercompensates for this by giving players more financial support, which is a straightforward and useful bit of game design. But when it comes to treating the games as direct representations of the world, it elides some complexity. For example, according to Polster, some players have reached out to their local transportation agencies with data they’ve gathered from playing in their local areas — despite the fact that the game is not actually designed as a faithful recreation of the real world, even if its map is. Another challenge is that OSM data isn’t always fully reliable. Polster explains that there can be errors or missing data that break very specific areas in the game, requiring PeDePe to manually find the issues and fix them. But OSM is also a volunteer-run program, meaning players can correct the data at the source. “Many of our players contribute directly to OpenStreetMap,” if they find errors in their local area, Polster says, which improves the dataset for everybody, no matter what they’re using it for. Density of data is also a particular issue for theGlobal Farmerdevelopers, who found that OSM has a lot more information about roads than field systems. There are plenty of areas where individual field boundaries aren’t mapped, making “total grey areas where gameplay actually couldn’t happen.” The developers compensated for this by making a map editor, where players can copy satellite images from other sources to correct the data, but it means that those who don’t want to build their own maps are limited to the places where OSM has detailed data or where other players have shared their creations. Management sims have often reached for a sense of realism, and OSM data is a useful tool in that toolbox. It also allows players to control environments they know well and can connect with. But it is not a perfect recreation of the world, and even if it was, that isn’t always what games need. According to Feldmann, navigating these factors “can be very frustrating.” But, just like players, developers are drawn to the idea of blurring the lines between places they know and places they simulate. “It is also super rewarding whenever you manage to find a solution and get great results that are connected to the real world,” Feldmann says.

    "title": "The Newark airport crisis is about to become everyone’s problem",
    "article_text": "A shortage of air traffic controllers, bungled IT management, outdated technology, and a brewing disaster in our airspace. byDarryl Campbell If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. A shortage of air traffic controllers, bungled IT management, outdated technology, and a brewing disaster in our airspace. byDarryl Campbell If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. There are too many planes in the sky. In 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) supervised nearly16.8 millionflights in American airspace — half a million more than the year prior. To manage all of those airplanes, however, the FAA uses an air traffic control systemdesigned in the early 1990s— when features like trackballs and color monitors were new, and air traffic controllers handled less thanhalf as many flights every year. Like many government agencies, the FAA has facedchronic budget constraints and poor oversightin the ensuing two decades. Not only is its system functionally obsolete; it’s also badly understaffed. Too often, the agency must scramble to find the least-bad solution for its mounting problems —and not all of these solutions are good or even safe. One such scenario has been unfolding at Newark Liberty International Airport for the last year. And it hasn’t just created delays and cancellations — it has put people’s safety at risk. Newark airport became national news starting on Monday, April 28th. Around 1:27PM, pilots abruptly lost contact with the controllers that oversee the airport’s approach and departure airspace, known as Newark Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON). “Can you hear us?” asked one United pilot. After a beat of silence, another pilot keyed the radio. “Hey Approach, are you there?” A third chimed in, his call sign more of a question. “Austrian eight-niner?” Several more seconds passed before Newark TRACON came back on the air. “United 1951, how do you hear me?” “Loud and clear now,” the first pilot replied. “Hey Approach, are you there?” For the moment, normal operations resumed — though controllers were worried about the possibility of another outage. “Upjet 905, join the final approach course,” said one controller, then prudently added, “if you don’t hear me, you can continue on the approach.” Seconds later, every radar screen at Newark approach went dark. “Radar contact lost. We just lost our radar.” Suddenly blind and unsure if they could even maintain comms with pilots, Newark’s controllers did what they were trained to do — get everyone to a safe holding place until the situation stabilized. To one United pilot in final descent: “stay on the arrival and maintain 6000.” To a private pilot, also preparing to land: “climb and maintain 4500.” They diverted another private pilot off to a nearby small airport: “Continue on towards Caldwell, call Caldwell Tower 119.8.” And they told a fourth private pilot passing that it was now up to him to maintain visual separation from other aircraft: “we’re just gonna have to cut you loose.” Air traffic controllers prepare for such contingencies, according to Dr. Hassan Shahidi, the president and CEO of the nonprofit FlightSafety Foundation. “Emergency traffic is prioritized,” he said. “Flights may be held on the ground. Nearby centers may take over some services.” Even in the best-case scenarios, however, “disruption is significant.” Controllers at Newark only lost radio and radar for about a minute and a half until backup systems kicked in. And no airplanes crashed or even had a near miss. But it took the rest of the afternoon just to get operations restarted. No one took off again until5PM, more than three hours later. At least a dozen flights were canceled, and 30 others were diverted to nearby airports. Higher-than-normal delays persisted formore than a week after the outageas airlines dealt with planes and crews that were out of position. Another outage occurred a week and a half later on May 9th. At 3:55AM, radar displays went outtwice. “Imma hand you off here, our scopes just went black again,” said one of the controllers as she passed one flight over to JFK and LaGuardia controllers, who still had radar. “If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure on them to fix this stuff.” “Imma hand you off here, our scopes just went black again.” She was right to be exasperated. This was thesixth timein onlynine monthsthat Newark TRACON had lost radio and/or radar. But only now, aftertwo major aviation accidentsin January and February, were people paying attention. The strangest thing of all is that the FAA appears to have brought the problem on itself — thanks in part to endemic government issues such as underfunding and bureaucracy, but also to the agency’s track record of bad risk management when it comes to modern technology. “The airspace around New York is the most complex in the world,” says Michael McCormick, a former air traffic controller and current professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida. Controllers in this sector manage more than6,000 flights per daybetween the30-plusairports, heliports, and seaplane bases in the area. And almost a quarter of that volume is handled by Newark TRACON. Those controllers aren’t actually located at the airport. Beginning in 1978, the FAA centralized approach and departure traffic for every airport in the greater New York City area into the N90 “super facility” in Westbury, Long Island. N90 was and still is one of the largest TRACON control facilities in the country, with200 controllers on staff. Their colocation, along with a direct feed into the FAA’s radar, satellite, and flight data system called STARS, makes operations more efficient and emergencies easier to handle. (For example, close coordination between N90 controllers helped guide the “Miracle on the Hudson” flight to a safe landing.) But since the late ’70s, the job has gotten harder. In 1980, N90 handled an average of2,200 flights per day. Last year, the number was 3,400. But pay has failed to keep pace both with the increasing complexity of the job, and theever-growing cost of livingin New York. In 1978, the median wage for an air traffic controller was around$33,000 a year. In the intervening decades, air traffic wages have increased fourfold, to$127,000 a year. But the cost of living in the area has increased even faster,by more than five times, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It’s a vicious cycle. Low pay relative to cost of living means that N90 can’t keep people the way that facilities in Dallas or Denver can. And retention problems at N90 have led tomandatory overtimeand six-day workweeks, further increasing burnout and losses. For the last five years, the FAA has attempted to solve N90’s “specific recruiting challenges.” But it failed. By the summer of 2023, N90 could muster only two-thirds of its target of300 controllers. TheNewark sectorwas down to half strength. (Other facilities in lower-cost cities such as Dallas or Denver are closer to 80 percent). Delays were inevitable; in the middle of peak travel season, one out of every three flights out of Newark was delayed by an hour or more. By 2024, the FAA decided that more drastic action was needed.It gave up on N90and decided to move Newark TRACON operations into the better-staffed Philadelphia facility. In a vacuum, it might have seemed like a decent tradeoff: disrupt the lives of a few controllers in order to reduce disruptions for thousands of flights and millions of passengers every year. But the FAA made an already marginal decision even worse. First, the majority of Newark’s controllers refused to make the move at all. Eventually, the FAA authorized relocation bonuses of up to $100,000. Even then,only 17 of the original 33 controllers agreed to move from N90. Reassignments brought the total up to 24, still short of the pre-move totals — and far short of the63-person target. Second, the FAA failed to invest in the data infrastructure required to support remote operations. To save money, the FAA electednot to build a new STARS server in Philadelphiato support the move.A new server alonewould require tens of millions of dollars, as well as installation of new internet and power infrastructure. Instead, it elected to send a “mirror feed” of telemetry from the STARS servers at N90, traveling over 130 miles of commercial copper telecom lines, with fiber optics to followby 2030. The annoyances of traditional cable internet — frequent lag, dropped sessions — are probably familiar to those who stream video or play games online. But for air traffic controllers, even the smallest service disruptions can become dangerous. Especially when combined with the FAA’s already dire infrastructure. Every week, the air traffic control system in the United States suffers around700 outages. Its systems aredecades old, and are oftenheld together with improvised fixes— daisy-chained power strips, cables protected only by aluminum foil, old radar systems being cooled by tabletop fans. And in February,at the direction of Elon Musk’s DOGE, the FAA laid off more than 100 workers, including themaintenance technicians and telecommunications specialistsneeded to keep unreliable systems in working order. The FAA’s own analysis downplayed these risks, however. According to aninternal study obtained by CNN, experts calculated that the risk of a critical failure for Newark’s remote feeds were one in 11 million, or a roughly “seven-nines” reliability standard that allowed only three seconds of downtime in a given year. It’s not clear how the agency calculated this figure. And FAA standards only require a “five-nines” standard, which allows up to five minutes of downtime in any given year. This math removed the last remaining impediment to the move. As of this writing, the remote data feeds into Newark TRACON have been down for around 10 minutes over the course of 10 months — nearly two and a half times beyond the “five-nines” standard, and 200 times beyond the “seven-nines” estimate from its report. It’s easy to state the obvious. The FAA should plan better. It should raise salaries and hire more people. It should replace old tech with new. (The agency did not respond to multiple requests for comment.) Such glib solutioning ignores the agency’s intractable problems of time and money. It hired 1,500 new air traffic controllers last year and will hire 2,000 more this year, but many of them won’t be fully certified until 2026 at the earliest. It contracted with Verizon to build new fiber-optic links between FAA facilities, but many of these won’t come online for up to a decade. And its implementation of a “NextGen” air traffic control system to replace the current versionmay not be completed until 2034, even though the project was started in 2003. It still isn’t enough to overcome decades of underinvestment Although the agency’s budget has grown 50 percent over the last decade to $24 billion, it still isn’t enough to overcome decades of underinvestment. Last year, the FAA had to stretch a$1.7 billionmaintenance budget to cover nearly$5.2 billion in outstanding repairsat air traffic control facilities. It had to spend nearly $532 million of its 2025 budget a year early to cover “uncontrollable employee compensation costs” such as mandatory overtime and the “surge” in hiring for new air traffic controllers. Meanwhile, DOGE consultants have focused onfinding money for new Starlink contractsandreducing oversight of SpaceXat the FAA. Cronyism, it turns out, has little impact on (or interest in) the government’s most difficult challenges. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has promised us “safe, state-of-the-art air travel,” but the FAA’s history (and the largely detail-free, eight-page “Brand New Air Traffic Control Plan”) suggest that it will be a long time coming. While we wait, we can at least console ourselves that air traffic controllers have learned how to give us safe air travel in the absence of state-of-the-art air travel. Still, the entire system rests on a knife’s edge between safe operations and potential disaster. The smallest disruption can throw the entire system into chaos — putting thousands of lives, billions of dollars, and the reputation of American aviation as the safest in the world in harm’s way.

In all the time I’ve been covering and paying attention to tech, there have been very few companies as bizarre and intriguing as OpenAI. The company is doing impressive, culture-shaking work, but it also seems to have an endless supply of weird internal drama and a total inability to figure out, like, what in the world it’s doing. Karen Haohas been covering the companylonger than almost anybody, and she has firsthand knowledge of a lot of OpenAI’s twists and turns. This week, she published a terrific book, calledEmpire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI, which is about the company’s history and its future. But the book is more than that, too. It’s a really good look at what AI is doing to us as people, to our societies and our planets, and to the brains of the people building what they hope will make them rich or gods — or both. I’ve been a fan of Karen’s work for a long time, so I asked her to share her homescreen with us. I figured she’d either have, like, 30 AI apps or none at all, and I wanted to know. Here’s her homescreen, plus some info on the apps she uses and why: The phone:iPhone XR. The wallpaper:It’s usually a photo of me and my husband laughing hysterically at an inside joke at our wedding. But you’ll just have to imagine it because we’re really big on privacy. Enjoy this orange gradient instead. Orange is the color of creativity, of fire, of the sunrise and sunset, of beginnings and transition. The apps:Messages, Google Calendar, Photos, Camera, Clock, Apple Notes, Contacts, Settings, FaceTime, Calculator, Weather, Reminders, App Store, Gmail, Proton Mail, Phone, Brave. I have a very boring homescreen! I try not to use too many apps. When I set up a phone, the first thing I do is delete as many of the default apps as possible. But probably the two notable apps to call out: a couple years ago, I switched completely to theBravebrowser, which is the lion icon at the bottom right of the screen. It’s based on Chrome, so you can keep all your plug-ins, but it blocks sites from tracking you to serve you targeted ads. It’s a simple way to not give up so much of your data and preserve your privacy. Highly recommended. The second: under my Audio folder, I have a guitar-tuning app,GuitarTuna, for the rare moments I fiddle with my guitar at home. Music was a big part of my childhood, but I haven’t made nearly enough time for it as an adult. I keep the app on my homescreen as an aspiration to pick it back up more seriously. I also asked Karen to share a few things that she’s into right now. Here’s what she sent back: Here’s what theInstallercommunity is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now, as well!

I only really have three recommendations: I suppose I should giveWallabagan honorable mention, because you can host it yourself, but it’s a much more involved project. If I were just moving over from Pocket and just wanted a nice place to read without a long list of other feature requests, I’d start with Instapaper. But all three are solid options, and they all make it pretty painless to import your old articles. Or just delete them all, start over, and feel the rare freedom of an almost-empty reading list.

    "title": "Meta’s antitrust defense wraps with one big claim: WhatsApp and Instagram couldn’t be better",
    "article_text": "﻿It also addressed the elephant in the room: TikTok. ﻿It also addressed the elephant in the room: TikTok. byLauren Feiner For five weeks, the Federal Trade Commission asked a federal judge to imagine a world where Instagram and WhatsApp flourished outside Meta’s control instead of being acquired by the tech giant. In the sixth and final week of trial, Meta asked Judge James Boasberg to consider that actually, these apps might be as good as they can get. Meta rested its case Wednesday after a brief four days in court (many of its witnesses were also called by the FTC, so it already had the chance to question them in prior weeks). In those final days, Metacalled on WhatsApp cofounder Brian Actonand an early Instagram infrastructure executive to explain how Meta helped those apps grow in ways they’d be unlikely to otherwise — counteringtestimony from Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom, who claimed Meta withheld resources to help the app grow and become safer, and believed Instagram would have still been a hit on its own. Meta argues that far from becoming competitors that checked Meta’s power, Instagram and WhatsApp might have withered, remaining far less useful or accessible to consumers than they are today. Several Meta witnesses also called out the elephant in the room:TikTok. The FTC says that social media apps primarily focused on entertainment like TikTok and YouTubeare not part of the personal social networking services marketit claims Meta’s monopolized — where users connect to their friends and family. Meta says this definition misses the point of how competition works in the social media space. Rather than focus on how consumers use aspects of the apps, it argues, the judge should focus on which industry players compete with one another. It says what actually constrains its power is the constant fight for users’ time and attention, creators’ content, and ad dollars. ”Antitrust law does not require consideration of such an ‘infinite range’ of possible substitutes” Economic experts helped Meta argue that TikTok’s rapid growth poses real competition that must be accounted for. Though TikTok has evolved into a much more formidable competitor for Meta’s products in the years since the FTC first filed the case in 2020, Boasberg warned in aNovember orderthat Meta’s argument about competing for time and attention “is true but beside the point.” Accepting Meta’s view would require accepting that “Meta competes not just with YouTube, TikTok, and X, but also with watching a movie at a friend’s house, reading a book at the library, and playing online poker,” he wrote. “Antitrust law does not require consideration of such an ‘infinite range’ of possible substitutes.” He also cautioned, however, that the government’s claims “at times strain this country’s creaking antitrust precedents to their limits.” During the trial, Boasberg seemed to take seriously a point Meta’s chief marketing officer Alex Schultz testified to: that Facebook and Instagram have already added just about as many US users as they could possibly get. The FTC had noted that Meta’s user growth rate may look slower because it’s already added most of the nation’s 250 million potential eligible users, but even in the face of its claimed competition from TikTok and YouTube, that doesn’t mean it’s not still growing overall. Schultz said that’s exactly why competing for attention with those apps has become so important, since if almost everyone has them downloaded, which ones get regularly opened is what matters. Boasberg later asked the FTC’s lead economic expert, Scott Hemphill, to respond to this, adding that it would be “pretty hard” for Instagram to be much bigger in the US than it already is. Hemphill argued that growing Instagram to its massive scale today doesn’t mean Meta made social media better for users than it otherwise would be. Without Meta’s stewardship, he said, the whole personal social networking market — not just Instagram — might have been a better one for consumers on metrics like consumer welfare and app quality. “Meta is a proud American success story” Meta has argued the FTC is living in the past and exaggerating the continued importance of friends and family sharing on its apps. Still, the company has recognized some users still want to use its products to connect with people they know in real life, prompting them to roll out “OG Facebook,” which lets users scroll through a feed of exclusively their mutual connections, avoiding what’s become the main Facebook experience in 2025 of mostly algorithmically recommended posts. Head of Facebook Tom Alison testified that on the main feed, a user might have to scroll all day to see all the posts from their friends, as the “core experience” has moved away from this kind of content. Judge Boasberg will decide whether the experience of connecting with friends on social media is still important enough to be a distinct market Meta dominates. He dismissedMeta’s attempt to get an early rulingin its favor, however, saying he’snot prepared to issue a verdictyet. Should he side with the FTC, the government would likely ask him to consider tearing away the very apps Meta bought to expand its empire. Meta says that would stifle the exact kind of innovation that the FTC claims it’s promoting. “After six weeks trying to make their case to undo acquisitions made over a decade ago and show that no deal is ever truly final, the only thing the FTC showed was the dynamic, hyper-competitive nature of the past, present and future of the technology industry,” Meta spokesperson Chris Sgro says in a statement. “Meta is a proud American success story, and we look forward to continuing to innovate and serve the people and businesses who love our services.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 25, 2025 / 7:44 PM EDT/ CBS Miami Ten people were hospitalized Saturday morning following a propane gas explosion that triggered a fire and partial roof collapse at a business in the Miami area suburb ofFlorida City, authorities said. Miami-Dade Fire Rescuereceived a call at 8:51 a.m. local time reporting an explosion at a strip mall near the 900 block of West Palm Drive. First responders arrived at a business formerly known as Palm Bakery, located at 941 West Palm Drive, and found a partially collapsed roof and multiple injured victims. Two people were classified as trauma alerts and rushed to a nearby trauma center, while six others were transported with less severe injuries requiring basic life support, fire officials said. Two more victims self-transported to a nearby hospital prior to responders' arrival, authorities said. More than two dozen rescue units responded to the scene, including canine search teams deployed to ensure no one remained trapped under the debris. As of Saturday afternoon, no additional victims had been found. The cause of the explosion is under investigation. Officials with Miami-Dade's Unsafe Structures unit were notified due to the damage to the building. The extent of the structural impact has not yet been determined. Details about the events leading up to the blast remain limited, but crews were continuing to assess the scene.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 25, 2025 / 7:30 PM EDT/ CBS/AP President Trump said Sunday that the U.S. will delay implementation of a50% tariff on goods from the European Unionfrom June 1 until July 9 to buy time for negotiations with the bloc. That agreement came after a call Sunday with Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, who had told Mr. Trump that she \"wants to get down to serious negotiations,\" according to the president's retelling. \"I told anybody that, they have to do that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Sunday in Morristown, New Jersey, as he prepared to return to Washington. Von der Leyen, Mr. Trump said, vowed to \"rapidly get together and see if we can work something out.\" In a social media post Friday, Mr. Trump had threatened to impose the 50% tariff on EU goods, complaining that the 27-member bloc had been \"very difficult to deal with\" on trade and that negotiations were \"going nowhere.\" Those tariffs would have kicked in starting June 1. The announcement, along with threatened tariffs on Apple products, sent the stock market tumbling Friday. \"Just when markets believed the worst of the tariff battle had been overcome, President Trump threatened a 50% tariff against the EU this week, starting on 1 June, and a possible 25% tariff on iPhones produced abroad. This could all be a negotiating tactic, but the uncertainty caused by this back-and-forth is not good for global growth or markets,\" Klaus Baader, an analyst with SG Securities, told investors in a report. But the call with von der Leyen appeared to smooth over tensions, at least for now. \"I agreed to the extension — July 9, 2025 — It was my privilege to do so,\" Mr. Trump said on Truth Social shortly after he spoke with reporters on Sunday evening. For her part, von der Leyen said the EU and the U.S. \"share the world's most consequential and close trade relationship.\" \"Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,\" she said. \"To reach a good deal, we would need the time until July 9.\" © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

Joseph Neumayer, who has U.S. and German citizenship, was taken into custody at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City by FBI special agents after he was deported from Israel. According to the prosecutors, Neumayer traveled to Israel in April. On May 19, he arrived at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv carrying a backpack. Without provocation, Neumayer allegedly spat at an embassy guard as he walked by and was able to flee as the guard attempted to detain him. He left his backpack outside the embassy after the tussle. A search of the backpack found three Molotov cocktails inside. Local law enforcement tracked down the 28-year-old at his hotel, where he was arrested. Investigators found that before he traveled to the embassy, Neumayer allegedly posted on social media: \"join me as I burn down the embassy in Tel Aviv. Death to America, death to Americans, and f***k the west.\" Authorities said that Neumayer also posted threatening messages on social media targeting President Trump. Israel deported Neumayer on Sunday. After his arrest in New York City, Neumayer was charged with attempting to destroy, by means of fire or explosive, the U.S. Embassy. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. \"This defendant is charged with planning a devastating attack targeting our embassy in Israel, threatening death to Americans, and President Trump's life,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi in a statement. \"The Department will not tolerate such violence and will prosecute this defendant to the fullest extent of the law.\" FBI Director Kash Patel said in a statement that Neumayer's alleged actions were \"despicable and violent\" and \"will not be tolerated at home or abroad.\" Lucia Suarez Sang is an associate managing editor at CBSNews.com.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 25, 2025 / 7:00 PM EDT/ CBS News This is an updated version of a story first published on March 23, 2025. The original video can be viewedhere. Frank Larkin's service to America is extraordinary—a former Navy SEAL whose government career included the Secret Service, the Pentagon and the U.S. Senate. But Larkin's greatest contribution is happening now, in retirement, after his son, Ryan, a decorated Navy SEAL himself, took his own life. Ryan's death was put down to mental illness—case closed. But as we first told you earlier this year, Frank Larkin didn't buy it. He suspected his son's military service resulted in an invisible brain injury—a kind of wound unknown to science. If Larkin was right, it might explain many military suicides. And so began Larkin's war which would send a shockwave through the Pentagon. It began in April 2017, when Larkin and his wife opened the door to a silent home. Frank Larkin: I went in the house. We started callin' his name, didn't hear any response. And so, I went into the basement and-- I-- I found him. He-- he had taken his life-- sometime-- during the night. He-- he was dressed in his SEAL Team Seven T-shirt, had a pair of red, white and blue board shorts on. And had illuminated a shadow box next to him that had his, all his medals, ribbons, and other key insignia. It was a shadowbox that I had made for him the previous holiday to just capture, you know, how proud I was of him and what he had done as a symbol of his service to the nation. And then he had also burned a hard drive in the fireplace with all his deployment photos that he had had from, you know, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Africa. I, you know, I-- I've spent over 40 years of my life rescuin' other people. And in the end, I couldn't rescue my own son. His son, Ryan, was 29. For him the military was destiny. Ryan had been 13 years old in September 2001 when his dad was assigned to the New York Secret Service office across the street from the World Trade Center. Frank Larkin: He was motivated by 9/11. I had been on the ground on 9/11 in New York City, had gotten caught in all that turmoil. And he had witnessed that from a hillside-- West of the city-- a town that we lived in in New Jersey. And, you know, it emotionally impacted him. I didn't realize how much. So much, that Ryan joined the Navy out of high school and rose to elite Special Operations—a SEAL—or as Navy slang has it, a \"frogman.\" This is Ryan on one of four combat tours: two in Iraq, two in Afghanistan. One stretch lasted about a year. Scott Pelley: When did you notice that Ryan was not the Ryan that you knew? Frank Larkin: It was coming off that year-long deployment. He became short fused. You know, he stopped laughing, which was a key sign. You know, he became very stoic in his facial expression. I would almost characterize it as putting a mask on where at times he would get into this--you know, mode where he was almost looking right through you. Ryan had returned from the wars to become an instructor in training like this—but his mood only darkened. Navy doctors scanned Ryan's brain but saw nophysicalinjury. He was treated for depression, alcoholism-- in and out of the hospital. Frank Larkin: But at no point had they ever settled on a clinical diagnosis as to what was wrong with him. And it just-- it just tore him apart. He said to me, \"Dad, I don't feel like I'm in my own body.\" Scott Pelley: In August 2016, Ryan wrote the Navy, and he said quote, \"I need help. I just want to feel normal again and live a purposeful life. I loved being a SEAL.\" What is he asking for? Frank Larkin: He's asking for help. I will say that there are some very good people that were trying to do the right thing for the right reason but maybe all the wrong way, because they just didn't know what they didn't know. While others couldn't be bothered with, you know, a broken frogman, you know. \"Let's get rid of it let's get rid of the problem.\" In 2016 Ryan was discharged, honorably. He was released from a Navy medical center with an illness no one could correctly diagnose. Frank Larkin: And he said, \"If anything ever happens to me, I want you to donate, you know, my body, my brain for traumatic brain injury research And, of course, as a father, I'm saying, \"Hey, look. I'm here for ya. We're-- we're gonna get through this. We're gonna figure this out.\" I said, you-- you-- you know, \"please tell me you're not thinking about hurtin' yourself.\" You know, \"No, Dad. I-- I never will go that way. I'm tellin' ya, I'll never go that way.\" And-- about a month later, that's exactly what happened. FrankLarkin's four decades of service prepared him for what came next. A Navy SEAL in the 70s, he spent 20 years in the Secret Service, then led a Pentagon project to defeat roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Finally, he became sergeant-at-arms for the U.S. Senate-- in charge of security. Larkin knew people, knew the military, and the ways of Washington. Frank Larkin: And that put me on this path that I'm on right now, to try to effect change so that we have no more Ryans. Scott Pelley: A war of your own? Frank Larkin: That's right. And failure's not an option. Larkin donated his son's brain to Dr. Daniel Perl at the Uniformed Services University, the military medical school. Wemet Dr. Perl in 2017while reporting on how autopsies discovered microscopic scars in the brains of veterans who had taken their own lives.Depression overwhelmedthem months or years after the enormous blast of a roadside bomb. Dr. Daniel Perl (in 2017): And with the explosion comes the formation of something called the blast wave. And it is sufficiently powerful to pass through the skull and through the brain. Dr. Perl found scarring in Ryan Larkin's brain. But there was one big difference. Larkin had not been hit by a roadside bomb. Most of what he endured waslow-level, repeated, shocks from his own weapons. For example, this large caliber rifle notorious for leaving gunners dizzy. But, even more, there was his job as a trainer. Students came and went but Ryan supervised every blast, every raid, every day. Frank Larkin: Ryan died from his combat injuries from his service to this nation. He just didn't die right way. 'Injuries' fromroutineweapons and tactics. Frank Larkin took the evidence to old friends, now in command of Special Operations. Frank Larkin: They, to their credit, aggressively started to peel the onion on this, and started saying, there's something going on here. We've gotta understand this. In 2019, Special Operations launched a preliminary study to look for brain injuries from cumulative, low-level blasts. At Frank Larkin's urging, Vice Admiral Tim Szymanski found $4 million and 30 active-duty volunteers who were suffering symptoms. Dr. Brian Edlow: The symptoms were broad, and they encompassed cognitive symptoms like difficulty with memory and attention, physical symptoms like dizziness and headaches, as well as psychological symptoms, like depression and disinhibition. Harvard professor Dr. Brian Edlow led the research at Massachusetts General Hospital. He put the troops into scanners twice as powerful as a typical MRI and discovered changes in brain structure. Dr. Brian Dr. Brian Edlow: And this particular region of the brain is critically important because it modulates emotion and cognition. Scott Pelley: And a person who has pathology in that part of the brain would have what kind of symptoms? Dr. Brian Edlow: They could have a broad range of symptoms that could include difficulty with higher level thinking or decision-making. They could have difficulty regulating their emotions. They could have disinhibition or difficulty controlling anger, for example. Scott Pelley: And you put it all together and what do you find? Dr. Brian Edlow: We find that blast overpressure waves may be penetrating the skull into the brain via the orbits, the eyes. Because this location within the brain is just behind the eyes. In 2023, Edlow showed that to Special Operations. A larger, long-term study will be needed to confirm the results. But Special Operations Commanding Gen. Bryan Fenton isn't waiting. Gen. Bryan Fenton: There's a lot more questions than we have answers right now. But all of it, if I can put it into – into I guess, a summation, less is better in terms of exposure to blast overpressure. And we gotta get after that. Today, Special Operations is testing a door breaching charge with half the blast pressure. Training rooms are now designed to absorb shockwaves. And they're training with no blast at all. Gen. Bryan Fenton: Augmented and reality and virtual reality training. I think it's very important to us as we go forward. And real weapons, modified for less shock, are being studied. Scott Pelley: Can you be effective in the field with these modified weapons? Gen. Bryan Fenton: We will not be in ineffective with these weapons. And if we are, we won't use that weapon. And we'll be able to accomplish the mission and protect our force at the very same time. And also, by extension, with the work we're doing, do that for the rest of the services. The 'rest of the armed services' are modifying training and weapons, in part, because Frank Larkin pushed Congress to pass two laws requiring action. A new five-year study is being planned with 200 subjects. These are early days.TypicalMRIs can't see the injury, so there's no test and no diagnosis. But if this is a turning point, it is thanks, in part, to a father who believed in his son. Scott Pelley: Ryan is laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, and I know that you go out there from time to time. I wonder what you say to him. Frank Larkin: Well, I talk to him. First of all, I wanna make sure he's behavin' himself, And I told him that, you know, I'm not givin' up. And I gotta tell ya, Scott, he's here with us right now. You know, much of what I'm sayin' is him—his words— speaking through me. I didn't like what he did. I didn't support what he did. But I've grown to understand why he did it. And it-- he wasn't takin' the easy way out. It wasn't, you know, weakness. He was all about solutions. And this is how he was gonna get their attention. Scott Pelley: Ryan accomplished his last mission. Frank Larkin: To a great degree, yes. But we still have a ways to go. That will be accomplished when we see where these men and women are gettin' the care that they need. But more importantly, you know, buying down the risk on the front end with prevention. That's when we can slap the table. If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, call theNational Suicide Prevention Hotlineat 988 or 1-800-273-TALK (8255).

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 25, 2025 / 6:54 PM EDT/ CBS/AP The United States prevailed over Switzerland 1-0 in overtime of the final of the ice hockey world championship on Sunday. The team accepted the championship trophy while holdingJohnny Gaudreau's #13 jersey, honoring the beloved hockey player who was hit by a car andkilled along with his brother, Matthew, while they were riding their bikes in New Jersey in August 2024. USA Hockey says it is the second trophy won at the tournament by the Americans after winning in 1933. Tage Thompson wristed a shot past goaltender Leonardo Genoni from the top of the right circle for the winner 2:02 into overtime with the 40th shot on goal. Logan Cooley and Brady Skjei provided the assists and goaltender Jeremy Swayman shut out the Swiss with 25 saves. The Americans were also formally awarded the title in 1960 when they won the Olympic tournament and the worlds did not take place. Mikael Backlund and Marcus Johansson scored two goals each as Sweden beat Denmark 6-2 to take the bronze medal earlier Sunday. It was the second straight third-place finish for Sweden while fourth place was the best-ever result for Denmark.

    "title": "Alex Palou becomes first Spaniard to win Indy 500",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 25, 2025 / 6:17 PM EDT/ AP Alex Palou has become the first driver from Spain to win the Indianapolis 500 by holding off former Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Marcus Ericsson over the closing laps Sunday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Palou, who has won three IndyCar titles in four years — including the last two, came to the speedway with four wins through the first five races. But it was No. 6, \"The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,\" that he had circled on his calendar. Without an Indy 500 win, Palou said his career resume would never be complete. At one point, Palou climbed onto its roof and raised his arms in triumph, the winning wreath draped around his neck. He briefly lost his balance and Ganassi instinctively reached out to grab his star driver. No need. Palou rarely makes a wrong move. \"All my family around, it's amazing, honestly,\" he said, smiling. \"All the team around, they make me look really good on the track.\" Ericsson, the 2022 Indy 500 winner, finished second for Andretti Global in a 1-2 finish for Honda. David Malukas was third for A.J. Foyt Racing and the highest-finishing Chevrolet. Two-timedefending race winner Josef Newgardenhad carved his way through traffic from starting on the last row into the top-10 by the 80th lap of the race. However, Newgarden's bid to win three consecutive Indy 500s ended with a fuel pump issue; no driver has ever won from the last row. Meanwhile, Kyle Larson crashed out of theIndianapolis 500near the midway point Sunday and Ryan Hunter-Reay ended the first half at the top of the leaderboard, but failed to get a second victory the race. Hunter-Reay, in a one-off entry for DRR-Cusick Motorsports, won the Indy 500 in 2014 as a driver for Andretti Global. Him leading Sunday with 100 laps remaining was fitting for a race that was first briefly delayed by rain and then hit with a rash of weird incidents. Scott McLaughlin crashed on the warm-up lap while swerving to get heat in his tires. Scott Dixon had a brake fire before the race went green and then Marco Andretti was crashed on the first lap. It was reminiscent of the 1992 Indianapolis 500, when pole-sitter Roberto Guerrero spun out and crashed while also trying to warm up his tires during the parade laps. \"I really have no idea what happened,\" a heartbroken McLaughlin said. \"I can't believe we're out of the race. I had so much hope. It's the worst moment of my life.\" The bizarre only continued as Alexander Rossi went to pit road with smoke coming from the back of his car, only for it to erupt into flames and his fueler caught fire. Rossi angrily flung his gloves over the pit road wall as he fled from the flames. Rinus VeeKay lost his brakes and crashed on pit road and then Robert Shwartzman, the first rookie to start from the pole since 1983, lost control entering his pit stall and hit several of his Prema Racing crew members. \"As soon as I touched my brakes, the whole front just locked and I ran into my guys,\" Shwartzman said. \"It was really scary because when I braked, I was just a passenger.\" Shwartzman, a dual national of Israel and Russia andfirst rookie to lead the field to green since 1983, made his oval debut Sunday. The 25-year-old drove under the Israel flag and is the first Israeli in the field. On the next restart, Larson's attempt to complete \"the double\" of 1,100-miles on the same day when he was collected in a three-car collision. It ended his Indy 500 and allowed Larson to head to the airport to get to Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina in time for the Coca-Cola 600. \"Just bummed out,\" Larson said. \"Try to get over this quickly and get on to Charlotte and just forget about it.\" Roger Penske delivered the command for drivers to start their engines after a 42-minute delay for rain — a pause that had already put Larson's double attempt in jeopardy. The NASCAR star had a 4 p.m. deadline to leave Indianapolis to make it to Charlotte, where the Coca-Cola 600 is his priority. Only one driver has ever completed all 1,100 miles — Tony Stewart in 2001. Larson's bid also failed last year because a rain delay in Indianapolis made him miss the Coca-Cola 600. Larson could be seen checking his watch from inside his car as he waited for Penske's command. He's starting second in Charlotte and started 19th in the Indy 500. © 2025 The Associated Press.

    "title": "Johnson says Medicaid work requirements have a \"moral component\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 25, 2025 / 3:44 PM EDT/ CBS News House Speaker Mike Johnson, whoshepherded President Trump's \"one big, beautiful bill\" through Congress, said Sunday that the Medicaid work requirements — which could affect his home state of Louisiana — have a \"moral component\" to them because people on Medicaid who \"refuse\" to work are \"defrauding the system.\" \"If you are able to work and you refuse to do so, you are defrauding the system,\"Johnson said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"You're cheating the system. And no one in the country believes that that's right. So there's a moral component to what we're doing. And when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.\" The GOP-controlled Housepassed the massive bill, which sets priorities for Mr. Trump's agenda for upcoming budgets, byjust one votein the early hours Thursday after an all-night session. The bill is now headed to the Senate, where several Republicans have already voiced concerns, including Sens. Josh Hawley and Rand Paul. The bill went through intense debate in two committees last week as an alliance of blue-state Republicans and fiscal hawks refused to budge. Given Republicans' razor-thin majority in the House, Mr. Trump went to the Hill on Tuesday to rally the holdouts in the GOP conference. To pay for some of Mr. Trump's tax reforms, such as extending his 2017 tax cuts and eliminating tax on tips, there are cuts to several programs. Republicans have insisted they are not cutting Medicaid, and reductions in the low-income entitlement program have become one of the most charged parts of the bill. In a closed-door session Tuesday with members of the Republican conference, sources in the room told CBS News Mr. Trump said, \"Don't f*** around with Medicaid.\" To save money on Medicaid, the final version of the bill puts work requirements on Medicaid, which Johnson has insisted will account for the bulk of any cost-cutting. An analysis by thehealthcare nonprofit KFFfound that 190,000 people in Louisiana, Johnson's home state, stand to lose Medicaid under new requirements. Johnson insisted on Sunday that \"we have not cut Medicaid, and we have not cut SNAP,\" the food stamp program. \"What we're doing … is working on fraud, waste and abuse, and everyone in Louisiana and around the country understands that that's a responsibility of Congress,\" Johnson said. He said there are 4.8 million Americans on Medicaid who are \"able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system.\" Calling it a \"moral component\" to put Americans to work, he added, \"when you make young men work, it's good for them, it's good for their dignity, it's good for their self-worth, and it's good for the community that they live in.\" Johnson also claimed some of those who are on Medicaid and SNAP are undocumented immigrants, although they are not eligible to receive food stamps or Medicaid. When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed back for Johnson to clarify that his position is that the estimated 190,000 Louisianans who stand to lose Medicaid coverage are \"lazy, not working? That they were undocumented? What about them? How do you defend that they will be losing their benefits?\" \"No. What we're talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they're gaming the system,\" Johnson said. \"And when we make them work, it'll be better for everybody, a win-win-win for all.\" Johnson said the Medicaid work requirements are \"not some onerous, burdensome thing,\" saying they require recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week — either working, be in job training programs or volunteering in the community. \"When the American people understand what we are doing here, they applaud it,\" Johnson said. \"This is a wildly popular thing, because we have to preserve the programs. What we're doing is strengthening Medicaid and SNAP so that they can exist, so that they'll be there for the people that desperately need it the most, and it's not being taken advantage of. And this is something that everybody in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, should agree to.\" But as the bill heads to the Senate for debate, the GOP's Hawley has called it \"both morally wrong and politically suicidal\" to slash Medicaid, indicating brewing opposition to it in that chamber. Hawley particularly took issue with a cost-sharing measure with Medicaid between federal and state governments, which he said would force those at or just over the federal poverty level to pay as much as $35 for a medical visit. Johnson pushed back on that claim, saying that the House included in the bill a \"modest state-sharing component, so that they'll pay attention to that, so that we can reduce fraud.\" But as Brennan noted, the bill still has to pass the Senate, and if Senators make the expected changes to the bill, it will have to go back to the House. Johnson said he had lunch with his Republican counterparts in the upper chamber on Tuesday, and he said he reminded them that they are a team. \"It's the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this ball over the goal line, so to speak,\" Johnson said. \"And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House.\" Caroline Linton is an associate managing editor on the political team for CBSNews.com.

    "title": "Health expert calls Trump's medical research cuts \"reckless destruction\"",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 25, 2025 / 10:27 AM EDT/ CBS News The National Institutes of Health is the world's largest source of funding for medical research. It has also undergonehuge budget cuts in recent weeks imposed by the Trump administration, which prompts thoughts from Dr. Timothy Johnson, long-time ABC News medical editor and founding editor of the Harvard Medical School Health Letter: Over the course of my long career in medical journalism, I had the great privilege of getting to know many of the leading medical researchers in this country. They were typically people of great integrity who had dedicated themselves to the often-frustrating and tedious task of painstaking research to find new cures and preventions for important medical problems. And the bottom line for many of them was that, without government support, they could never have achieved the discoveries that have helped us all. Which is why I am stunned bya recent reportthat states the Trump administration's National Institutes of Health has stopped payments on grants totaling more than $1.8 billion for nearly700 specific medical research projects. This sledgehammer approach will cause terrible damage to many outstanding research programs, and it will destroy the careers of many young medical scientists just starting their research. These are dedicated people who have already put in many years of difficult training and may be on the cusp of some major discoveries. And I believe it is possible that many of these suddenly-defunded researchers will find positions in other welcoming countries – a \"brain drain\" in reverse from the flow of many scientistsintothis country during and after World War II. So, why aren't more politicians insisting on a more surgical approach that would find legitimate savings without potentially destroying the research infrastructure that has served our country so well for decades? Put simply, we are facing a choice between smart decisions or reckless destruction that may affect our nation's health for generations to come. And if I may use a sophisticated medical term, it seems to me that the right choice is a \"no-brainer.\" Story produced by Liza Monasebian. Editor: Carol Ross. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "title": "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson says there's enough opposition to hold up Trump's 'big, beautiful' bill",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — As the Senate prepares to consider the sprawling domestic package that House Republicans passed last week, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he thinks there are “enough” Republicans to “stop the process” in order to prioritize stronger reductions in spending and the national deficit. The Wisconsin Republican has criticized the bill’s impact on the deficit, characterizing outsize spending as “mortgaging our children’s future.” The nonpartisanCongressional Budget Officehas estimated that the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years. Johnson said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” that congressional Republicans should examine spending “line by line, like DOGE has done” to find areas to eliminate. The senator’s criticism comes as the Senate is gearing up to consider changes to the House bill, which passed by a single vote, setting up another fight over government deficit levels, funding for programs and attempts to rein in spending ahead of Republicans’ goal to send a final version of the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4. Several Republicans in the Senate have expressed skepticism about aspects of the bill for what they view as inadequate spending cuts or shrinking Medicaid access and have promised to change it. Any changes to the bill would need to be approved by the House before it goes to Trump. Trump told reporters on Sunday that he expected the Senate to make \"fairly significant\" changes to the funding package, but remained confident the bill would ultimately pass both chambers and reach his desk. \"I want the Senate and the senators to change, you know, to make the changes they want, and we’ll go back to the House and we’ll see if we can get them,\" Trump said. \"In some cases, those changes maybe are something I’d agree with.\" Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said in an interview on “Fox News Sunday”that the current spending cuts in the bill “are wimpy and anemic,” adding that he “still would support the bill even with wimpy and anemic cuts if they weren’t going to explode the debt.” “The problem is the math doesn’t add up,” Paul said, adding that “they’re going to explode the debt.” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has also criticized potential Medicaid cuts. The bill, if passed in its current form, is expected to rescind health coverage for about 8.6 million people, according to estimates from theCongressional Budget Office. Hawley told NBC News shortly after the House passed the bill that “the Senate will basically write its own version of this bill, and I just want to make sure that there are no Medicaid benefit cuts.” Inan op-ed in The New York Timesearlier this month, Hawley accused a wing of the Republican Party of wanting “Republicans to build our big, beautiful bill around slashing health insurance for the working poor.” “But that argument is both morally wrong and politically suicidal,” Hawley said. When asked during a Sunday interview on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” to respond to Hawley’s comments, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said that “we are not cutting Medicaid” but instead “working in the elements of fraud, waste and abuse.” The House speaker repeatedly defended the bill’s impact on people who would lose Medicaid coverage, instead casting the bill as targeting waste, fraud and abuse among Medicaid users. He said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the Republican-led bill was not cutting Medicaid, arguing that “the numbers of Americans who are affected are those that are entwined in our work to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse.” The speaker pointed to “illegal aliens on Medicaid,” saying that “Medicaid is not intended for non-U.S. citizens.”Certainnon-U.S. citizens are allowed to enroll in government health care options. Johnson also criticized “young men, for example, who are on Medicaid and not working.” He argued that people were committing “fraud” by “choosing not to work when they can.” Anchor Jake Tapper asked Johnson whether he believed that if any of his constituents were to lose benefits like Medicaid, it would be because they should not have received those benefits “because they were committing waste, fraud or abuse.” “Yeah,” Johnson answered. “Look, my district, as every district in America, has people who are on the program who shouldn’t.” Democrats have seized on potential Medicaid cuts, blasting Republicans’ domestic policy bill and working to characterize the GOP as willing to cut health insurance options for poor people while increasing the wealth of Americans withhigher incomes. NBC Newspreviously reportedthat during negotiations over the bill last week, Trump visited House Republicans and instructed them, “Don’t f--- around with Medicaid,” according to two lawmakers present. The House speaker said during multiple Sunday-morning interviews that he has urged Senate Republicans to make as few changes to the bill as possible. The House and Senate will ultimately need to reconcile different versions of the bill before it heads to Trump’s desk to be signed into law. “I had lunch with my Senate Republican colleagues on Tuesday, their weekly luncheon, and I encouraged them to remember that we are one team,” Johnson said on CBS News. “It’s the Senate and the House Republicans together that will deliver this ball over the goal line, so to speak. And I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance.” The billpassed the House215-214, with two Republicans opposing the bill, one voting “present” and two missing the vote. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., criticized the bill last week, saying that “Trump promised to love and cherish Medicaid.” “Instead, his One Big Ugly Bill represents the largest healthcare cut in our country’s history,” Jeffries said in astatement. “Millions of people will lose their Medicaid coverage and hardworking American taxpayers will be forced to pay higher premiums, copays and deductibles.”",

    "title": "Trump lashes out at Putin after Russia’s massive drone-and-missile attack on Ukraine",
    "article_text": "UkrainianPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyycriticized the United States and the international community Sunday for remaining silent after Russia unleashed what Ukrainian officials described as the largestaerial assaulton the country since the war began. The silence, however, didn't last. President Donald Trumpsaid Sunday on Truth Socialthat Russian President Vladimir Putin is \"needlessly killing a lot of people.\" \"I’ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him,\" Trump wrote. \"He has gone absolutely CRAZY! He is needlessly killing a lot of people, and I’m not just talking about soldiers. Missiles and drones are being shot into Cities in Ukraine, for no reason whatsoever.\" Putin, Trump said, wants to take over all of Ukraine. But, he warned, \"it will lead to the downfall of Russia!” Russian forceslaunched a massive overnight barrage Saturday as 367 drones and missiles targeted more than 30 cities and villages across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. At least 12 people were killed, according to officials, including three children, in the northern region of Zhytomyr. “The silence of America, the silence of others in the world only encourages Putin,”Zelenskyywrote on Telegram. “Every such terrorist Russian strike is reason enough for new sanctions against Russia.” Trump said in his social media statement that Zelenskyy is not helping his country's cause by lashing out at the United States. “Everything out of his mouth causes problems, I don’t like it, and it better stop,\" Trump said, blaming the war on Zelenskyy, Putin and former President Joe Biden. I am only helping to put out the big and ugly fires, that have been started through Gross Incompetence and Hatred,\" Trump said. Saturday’s massive air raid follows a drone attack Friday that killed four people and coincided with the final day of alarge-scale prisoner exchangebetween Ukraine and Russia. Meanwhile, frustrations remain over shifting U.S. policy as Ukraine and its allies push for a ceasefire deal. Trump has called for an end to the war, but his administration has taken a softer line on Russia than previous ones, shifting American policy from supporting Ukraine toward accepting some of Russia’s account of the war. The approach marks a sharp departure from the full-throated support Ukraine enjoyed from Washington under Biden. While Ukraine and its European allies have pushed for a 30-day ceasefire as a step toward ending the three-year war, those efforts suffered a setback last week when Trump declined toimpose additional sanctions on Moscowfor not agreeing to an immediate pause in fighting. On Monday, Trump had a two-hour phone call with Putin, during which he appeared to havedropped his earlier insistence on a 30-day truce and suggested that he could walk away entirely from the negotiations to end a war that he once promised to end on “day one” of his second presidential term. Moving independently of Washington, the European Union and the United Kingdom announced a new round of sanctions last week, targeting Russia’s so-called “shadow fleet” — roughly 200 vessels used to transport Russian oil exports globally. The E.U. said these were the 17th set of Europeans sanctions imposed on Russia since it invaded its neighbor in 2022. In Washington, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers that the administration would continue to push an existing bill that could impose a 500% tariff on buyers of Russian oil and gas if there was no progress on a peace deal. But, he added that Trump “believes that right now, you start threatening sanctions, the Russians will stop talking, and there’s value in us being able to talk and drive them to get to the table.” While the bombs continue to fall on Ukraine, Zelenskyy posted on Telegram Sunday that the third phase of the “1,000-for-1,000” exchange agreement had been completed after two exchanges last week, with pictures of returning soldiers draped in Ukrainian flags. The swap, the latest of dozens of exchanges since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians, has not indicated an end to widespread fighting. Battles have continued along the roughly 620-mile front line, killing tens of thousands of soldiers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week that Moscow would give Ukraine a draft document outlining its conditions for a “sustainable, long-term, comprehensive” peace agreement, once the ongoing prisoner exchange had finished. Trump congratulated both sides after they struck the prisoner exchange deal in Istanbul. But after Russia’s largest attack yet, Kyiv remains wary of easing pressure. “Without pressure, nothing will change and Russia and its allies will only build up forces for such murders in Western countries,” Zelenskyy’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak wrote on Telegram. “Moscow will fight as long as it has the ability to produce weapons.”",

    "title": "U.S. citizen arrested and accused of trying to bomb an American Embassy office in Tel Aviv",
    "article_text": "A man was arrested at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York on Sunday following an alleged attempt to firebomb a branch office of theU.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, the Justice Department said in astatement. The man, named Joseph Neumeyer, is a dual American and German citizen and was detained in Israel on May 19 after a hostile confrontation in which Neumeyer spit on asecurity guard in front of the office earlier that day, according to the Justice Department. The guard tried and failed to detain Neumeyer, who ditched the backpack he was carrying to break free, the statement said. A search of the backpack he left behind at the embassy after the confrontation “revealed three rudimentary improvised incendiary devices commonly known as Molotov cocktails,” the statement added. Officials were able to track Neumeyer to his hotel, where he was arrested. The Justice Department also said that Neumeyer, 28, posted the following on social media: “Join me as I burn down the embassy in Tel Aviv. Death to America, death to Americans, and f--- the west.” He also made threats on social media to assassinate President Donald Trump, the statement added. It wasn't clear if Neumeyer has retained a lawyer. Representatives of the Federal Defenders of New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment Sunday night. Neumeyer claims in his social media profiles, verified by NBC News, that he is the founder and CEO of a company called Atlas Light Co. It was not immediately clear what the company does, and Neumeyer claims to have founded a number of startups. Recent postings on Facebook suggest discontent with the West, specifically with the U.S. and Trump. Neumeyer arrived in Israel last month but didn’t head to the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv until May 19, the Justice Department said. It was not clear where in the country he was staying or what he was doing there prior to last week. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The Department will not tolerate such violence and will prosecute this defendant to the fullest extent of the law,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement after Israel turned Neumeyer over to the U.S. on Sunday. FBI Director Kash Patel added in a statement, “This despicable and violent behavior will not be tolerated at home or abroad, and the FBI, working with our partners, will bring him to face justice for his dangerous actions.” Neumeyer, who was deported to the U.S. by Israeli authorities, could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. His arrest comes several days after two staffers who worked at the Israeli Embassy in Washingtonwere killedleaving an event at the Capital Jewish Museum. The suspect in that shooting, Elias Rodriguez, was later charged with two counts of first-degree murder. According to videos taken at the scene and posted to social media, Rodriguez shouted “Free, free Palestine” following his arrest. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke the day after the shooting, with Netanyahu condemning the act as a “horrifying antisemitic murder.”",

    "article_text": "For 9 minutes and 29 seconds on May 25, 2020, Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee and the weight of his body against George Floyd’s neck, killing him as people watched. The murder prompted vows to deal with America’s deep-seated racial injustices. Five years later, many lawmakers, companies and institutions have rowed back on those commitments, and in a previously nondescript area of Minneapolis,hardly anyone can agreeon whether things have changed for the better. “That’s a challenging question,” said Andrea Jenkins, the City Council member for Ward 8, where the tragedy occurred. “There have been a number of changes, and yet it feels like things are very much the same.” Samar Moseley, who drives a city bus in Minneapolis, said the “whole city is still suffering from PTSD after George Floyd.” Relations with the police are “easing up some, but there’s still tension,” he added. Charles Adams, a North Minneapolis police inspector who has been in law enforcement in the area for 40 years, said the incident “put us back to the 1960s.” Adams said that he was “surprised” by the number of Black recruits who have joined the force since then but that “the good news is that they say they want to be a part of the change.” President Donald Trump said Sunday that he agreed to anextension of the 50% tariff deadline on the European Unionuntil July 9. European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen said she had a “good call” with Trump but needed more time to “reach a good deal.” Trump’s threat to impose 50% tariffs on imports from the E.U. is just the latest attack. It comes amid a broader souring of relations and aftermonths of economic sparring. The E.U., home to nearly 450 million people, is the world’s largest trading bloc and one of Washington’s top commercial partners. It exported more than $600 billion in goods to the United States last year while importing goods worth around $370 billion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyycriticized the United Statesand the international community for remaining silent after Russia unleashed what Ukrainian officials described as the largest aerial assault on the country since the war began. Russian forces launched a massive overnight barrage Saturday night as 367 drones and missiles targeted more than 30 cities and villages across Ukraine, including the capital, Kyiv. “The silence of America, the silence of others in the world only encourages Putin,” Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram. “Every such terrorist Russian strike is reason enough for new sanctions against Russia.” The silence, however, didn’t last. Trump said Sunday night on Truth Social that Putin is “needlessly killing a lot of people” and “has gone absolutely CRAZY!\" The attack came shortly after a prisoner exchange in which each side released hundreds of detainees. Former Surgeon General Vivek Murthyaccused Congress of failing“in its responsibility to protect our kids” from the harms of social media, calling for legislation to force social media apps to include warning labels about their harms to children. Murthy told moderator Kristen Welker on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” that the current approach to social media is “the equivalent of putting our kids in cars with no seat belts, with no air bags, and having them drive on roads with no speed limits and no traffic lights. And that is just morally unacceptable.” Former Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., who is now a mental health advocate, told Welker he believes the United States “is falling down on its own responsibility as stewards to our children’s future” because of lack of action on the issue. A new biography sheds light onEleanor Roosevelt’s 30-year relationshipwith trailblazing journalist Lorena Hickok after decades of speculation. In her research for “Hick,” author Sarah Miller read about 3,500 of the letters the two women exchanged, sometimes twice daily, from 1932 until Roosevelt died in 1962. “They loved each other. They were physically affectionate with each other. It was a romance, for sure. Whether that included sexual intimacy is probably something we can’t know,” Miller said. While there appears to be consensus among historians that Hickok was romantically interested only in women, some past accounts have portrayed her correspondence with Roosevelt as a deeply intimate friendship, rather than a romance. “Why re-erect a symbol of something that hurt so many people?” Thefire that destroyed Louisiana’s Nottoway Plantationprompted a reckoning with the past and reignited the debate over how places born from slavery should be viewed — and how they should function today.",

    "title": "Alex Palou makes history as 1st Spanish driver to win the Indianapolis 500",
    "article_text": "INDIANAPOLIS — Alex Palou has become the first driver from Spain to winthe Indianapolis 500by holding off former Chip Ganassi Racing teammate Marcus Ericsson over the closing laps Sunday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Palou, who has won three IndyCar titles in four years — including the last two, came to the speedway with four wins through the first five races this season. But it was No. 6, “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing,” that he hadcircled on his calendar. Without an Indy 500 win, Palou said his career resume would never be complete. Palou stopped the car just beyond the Yard of Bricks, climbing out of it and nearly losing his balance as he raised his arms in triumph. He jumped down and took off in a run down the front stretch, pulling off his gloves and tossing them behind him, and ultimately was engulfed by his father, Ramon, and his Chip Ganassi Racing team in a jubilant celebration. Scott Dixon gave him a big hug, so did Dario Franchitti, with both Ganassi Indy 500 winners welcoming Palou into the exclusive club. “I cannot believe it. What an amazing day. What an amazing race,” Palou said. “I cannot believe it. It was tough. Tough conditions out there, especially if you were like, third or fourth in the pack. Even leading, the fuel consumption was super high, so they didn’t want me to lead. I wanted to lead, honestly, so yeah, made it happen.” Meanwhile, Ericsson climbed from his car and pressed his hands to his face at the disappointment of coming oh-so close to a second Indianapolis 500 victory. Ericsson, the 2022 Indy 500 winner, finished second for Andretti Global in a 1-2 finish for Honda. David Malukas was third for A.J. Foyt Racing and the highest-finishing Chevrolet. Josef Newgarden’s bid to win three consecutive Indy 500s ended with a fuel pump issue. He was trying to become the first driver to come from the back row to win because he and Team Penske teammate Will Power were dropped to the back of the fieldfor failing inspectionbefore qualifying. Power wound up 19th, the highest-finishing Penske driver on a miserable day for the organization owned by Roger Penske. He earlier this week fired his top three IndyCar executives for a second technical infraction in just over a year, and has had to defend the optics of his teams failing inspections when he also owns IndyCar, Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indy500. Penske has won the Indy 500 a record 20 times. It was Indy 500 win number six for Ganassi, who has been on a dominating wave since hiring Palou ahead of the 2021 season. Palou then won the championship that year, has added two more titles and now seems on pace for a fourth one. “The guy is just unbelievable — I don’t know what else to say,” Ganassi said. “It is an incredible thing — it’s going to make Alex Palou’s career, it is going to make his life, and it has certainly made mine.” Palou started the race tied with Pato O’Ward as the co-favorites, listed at +500 by BetMGM. O’Ward finished fourth — the fifth time in six career starts the Mexican has finished sixth or higher. Kyle Larson won’t complete “the double”after crashing outof the Indianapolis 500 before he headed to North Carolina to compete in the Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race.",

    "title": "Texas bill to require Ten Commandments in public schools moves closer to governor's desk",
    "article_text": "A bill that wouldrequire the Ten Commandmentsto be posted in every public school classroom in Texas cleared a key legislative hurdle Sunday andis closer to heading to Gov. Greg Abbott for approval. The state House of Representatives passed a version of the Ten Commandments bill in a82-46 votefollowing a week of debate and delay, when Democratic lawmakers attempted to introduce amendments, including allowing individual school districts to opt in and for the Ten Commandments to be in different languages. After the House passed the bill with an amendment on Sunday — requiring the state, rather than school districts, to defend any legal challenges to the law — it must now return to the Senate for approval. Advocates of the law celebrated the win after they initially assumed the bill would proceed directly to the governor once passed by the House. Abbott’s office did not immediately comment about its passage, but the Republican governor isexpected to signitinto law if it reaches his desk. The state Senate approved a previousversion of the legislation in March on a 20-11 party-line vote. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrickhad saidthe success of the bill,known as SB 10, was among his priorities for the current session, which ends next month, after similar legislation failed in 2023 because of time constraints. “By placing the Ten Commandments in our public school classrooms, we ensure our students receive the same foundational moral compass as our state and country’s forefathers,”Patrick said. Still, Texas’ Ten Commandments legislation is likely to face constitutional opposition, as it has in Louisiana, where a GOP-draftedlaw was signed last yearby Gov. Jeff Landry and wasquickly challengedby a coalition of parents of different religious beliefs. Under Texas’ bill, all public elementary or secondary schools would have to “display in a conspicuous place in each classroom of the school a durable poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments.” The displays would have to be at least 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall and include the text of the Ten Commandments as written in the bill. Once the bill is signed into law, schools “must accept any offer of privately donated” displays or may use district funds, starting in the 2025-26 school year. The legislation does not have an enforcement mechanism, and it’s unclear what might happen to schools or individual teachers who refuse to comply. According to a state House committee analysis, the bill itself also “does not expressly create a criminal offense.” State Sen. Phil King, the lead author of the bill, had said he was introducing the legislation because “the Ten Commandments are part of our Texas and American story.” But state Rep. James Talarico, a Democrat who is Christian, objected to the bill last week during an earlier vote, saying a display of such religious text may feel exclusionary to non-Christian students. “Forcing our religion down their throats is not love,” Talarico said. With Louisiana andmost recently Arkansasmandating the Ten Commandments in public schools, legal arguments over such laws could eventually wind up again before the U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1980 ruled that classroom displays of the Ten Commandments were unconstitutional. Louisiana has not fully implemented its law as officials await a federal appeals court ruling on its constitutionality. In November, alower court judge concludedthe state had not offered “any constitutional way to display the Ten Commandments.” Meanwhile, Texas House members on Friday approved anotherreligion-based billthat would permit school districts to adopt policies allowing for a period of prayer and reading of the Bible or “other religious text” with parental consent. Abbott is also expected to sign it into law. Emily Witt, a spokeswoman for the Texas Freedom Network, a grassroots group that advocates for religious freedom, said thewave of conservative-leaning legislationacross Texas and other states is part of a wider “coordinated strategy” to infuse the Bible in public school education. “The message this sends to kids is that they’re being told their religion doesn’t matter and isn’t as important as this one,” Witt said. “We worry that leads to bullying and otherism — all things in public schools that we try to prevent.” CLARIFICATION(May 25, 2025, 4:50 p.m. ET): This article was updated after publication to clarify that the legislation must go back to the state Senate for approval, rather than directly to the governor, as supporters of the law had initially indicated in a news release.",

The bishop of Rome is one of many titles held by the pope. On his way to the St. John Lateran Basilica for the final steps to take on the role of bishop of Rome, the pope stopped at Piazza Venezia in the center of Rome to meet with the mayor of the city, Roberto Gualtieri. Speaking before a crowd, Gualtieri said the city of Rome is ready to accompany the pontiff \"to affirm the paradigm of a new politics,\" and ended his speech by welcoming him: \"We are happy that Rome is now your city,\" as translated by Vatican News. The first pope from the United States responded to Gualtieri's remarks, affirming his commitment as bishop of Rome. The pope said: \"Today I can say in a special way that I am a Roman, with and for you,\" as the Vatican news service translated. Margaret Susan Thompson, a professor of history at Syracuse University whose research focuses on religion and politics, said Leo will not be \"particularly involved in the day-to-day governing or administrative responsibility\" as bishop of Rome.

Ina post on Truth Socialon Sunday, Trump said the home countries of some of Harvard's international students are \"not at all friendly to the United States\" and \"pay NOTHING toward their student's education.\" He added that the administration wants to \"to know who those foreign students are\" and that \"Harvard isn't exactly forthcoming.\" Harvard did not immediately reply to NPR's request for comment Sunday morning. Trump's latest attack against Harvard comes two days after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order blocking the administration from being able torevoke the university's ability to enrollinternational students. The university had argued that the Trump administration's revocation was a \"blatant violation of the First Amendment\" and punished the school for rejecting \"the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students.\" In April thefederal government frozemore than $2.2 billion in grants and contracts to Harvard after school officials rebuffed the administration's demands that it alter some of its policies, such as those related to hiring and admissions.

    "title": "Mumbai's iconic pav bread might soon be toast",
    "article_text": "By Omkar Khandekar A baker holds up a loaf of pav freshly baked at the Yazdani Bakery in Mumbai. A government plan to ban wood-fired ovens in bakeries as a way to curb pollution could lead to a price increase in the beloved pav — and erase its smoky flavor.Indranil Aditya for NPRhide caption MUMBAI, India — Every morning, when the city of Mumbai sleeps, the staff ofYazdani Bakerywake up to knead dough, cut it into little pieces and pop it into the oven. By dawn, they're ready with their most popular offering: a thousand pieces of pav, which flies off the shelves as soon as the bakery opens. Pav is a soft and fluffy bread, with a crusty top and a distinct smoky flavor. It resembles a Parker House roll except there is no egg in the pav's dough. The word originates from the Portuguese word for bread —pao. It arrived in India with Portuguese traders who sailed into nearby harbors more than 600 years ago and brought with them a taste of home. It became a street food fixture in the 19th century, when the port city was emerging as a textile hub, drawing workers from nearby towns and villages to its cotton spinning and weaving factories. \"Pav is what Bombay's working-class blue-collar workers were eating, especially those who were far from home without the infrastructure to create Indian food for them,\" says Mumbai-based food anthropologistKurush Dalal, referring to the city by its former name. A baker in Mumbai weighs dough that will become the beloved pav bread.Indranil Aditya for NPRhide caption Since then, Mumbai's population hasgrownten times over the past century to12 million. This teeming port city is home to Bollywood, stock markets, billionaire industrialists and millions of migrants, of collars blue and white, living in slums and skyscrapers. Mumbai's textile factories today are hulking shells of their past, overgrown by wild fig trees. But pav remains a working class staple. A stack of six — called aladi— costs less than 25 cents. But now, pav's survival is in peril. In February , the governmentannouncedthat it would ban wood-fired bakeries across the city in the next six months. The order came a few months after the Mumbai-based Bombay Environmental Action Group publisheda studyclaiming that over the course of a year, pollution from Mumbai's 1,000-odd wood-fired bakeries was as harmful to each resident assmoking400 cigarettes. But critics say this is a case of misplaced priorities — of picking on the little guy. \"The pollution that is emitted from these bakeries is nothing compared to the pollution that construction sites are contributing or the road repair sites are contributing,\" says former town council representativeMakarand Narwekar. Bakers at the Yazdani Bakery in Mumbai knead trays of dough.Indranil Aditya for NPRhide caption He points to the massive makeover being undertaken by Mumbai's civic body to remake the city's roads, which has only worsened dust and traffic. A study by the Indian climate-tech group Respirer Living Sciences found Mumbai's air was unsafe fornearly halfof 2024. Ravi Andhale, chief of the pollution control board, acknowledges that wood-fired bakeries aren't the worst offenders in Mumbai. According to the Bombay Environmental Action Group study they only contribute 3% of the city's particulate matter pollution – referring to matter in the air smaller than 10 micrometers in diameter). But \"just because your share is little — you should not do anything — is not acceptable,\" he says. And the lead author of the study which spotlighted how polluting wood-fired bakeries are says one reason why they're being targeted is that it's just easier to solve that little slice of the problem. \"As far as the pollution from construction, infrastructure and vehicles go, they have a lot of complexities,\" says Hema Ramani, anenvironmental consultantwho works on legal and policy issues. \"That's why we said let's look at faster, quicker, smaller transitions that can happen. Then you move on to the bigger ones.\" Ramani says she doesn't want the bakeries to shut shop, only switch to a cleaner fuel like natural gas or electricity. The government can help, she says, by subsidizing the equipment or transition costs. But Nasir Ansari, president of the Bombay Bakers Association, says that would increase the cost of the pav by more than a half. \"Pav is often the food of the working-class. Even a small price rise makes a huge difference. A few months ago, we had raised the price of a stack of six by three rupees\" — a couple of pennies. \"We still had customers asking me why I did that.\" A baker places dough into a wood-fired stove at Yazdani Bakery.Indranil Aditya for NPRhide caption It's not just about the cost, pav bakers say. The wood-fired bread is part of Mumbai's cosmopolitan heritage, a melange of indigenous and colonial traditions. This Portuguese-origin bread is now eaten with a fried potato snack called 'vada,' a buttery vegetable mash called 'bhaji', or spiced chicken or lamb mince calledkeema. \"They're also great vessels for mopping up all kinds of gravies and curries — and just about everything Indian,\" says Dalal. A baker carries loaves of fresh bread in the kitchen of Yazdani Bakery.Indranil Aditya for NPRhide caption Perzon Zend, owner of the Yazdani Bakery, says losing the wood-fired pav would take away something intangible from Mumbai's cosmopolitan heritage. He points to his own family history: Zend's ancestors came from Iran more than hundred years ago — and set up Mumbai's most iconic Iranian restaurants and bakeries — where their key product is a Portuguese-origin bread. It's been a great business for the family. He taps his potbelly to demonstrate. \"I definitely want clean air in Bombay,\" says Zend. \"But I don't want to be the smallest and the easiest target.\" And he thinks the method of baking is the key to success. \"You can't beat the wood-fire,\" he says. \"In America, you smoke the chops and that smokiness is everything. It's like that with pav too.\" Those made in electric ovens, he says, \"taste like cardboard.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Inside Ukraine's last maternity ward in a region surrounded by Russian forces",
    "article_text": "The roots of Russia's invasion of Ukraine go back decades and run deep. The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is — in the words of one U.S. official — a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. Eleanor Beardsley Anastasia, 24, with her daughter, born the previous day, in a room at the Sloviansk City Clinical Hospital, on March 28.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption SLOVIANSK, Ukraine — The squalling cries of newborns echo through the hallway of Sloviansk City Clinical Hospital in the beleaguered Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Sitting by the window in her room, young mother Anastasia cradles her 1-day-old daughter Vasilisa. While she's happy to share this private moment with NPR, she doesn't wish to share the family's surname. Anastasia also has an 18-month-old at home. Despite the war, the 25-year-old mother wants to stay in the town where she grew up and her entire family still lives. \"If things get really bad, of course we will leave,\" she says. \"But as long as it's bearable, it's always better to be at home than somewhere else.\" With Russian forces now occupying two-thirds of this province, Sloviansk has the last working maternity ward in Ukrainian controlled Donetsk. This industrial town, once known for its salt mines and mud bath spas, has been under constant Russian assault since 2014, when Kremlin-backed separatist forces briefly took control of the town. Today, Sloviansk is tired and tattered, but many residents say they are determined to hang on. A destroyed kindergarten No. 20 in the city of Sloviansk, Donetsk region.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Anastasia was 14 when the Russian-backed separatists took control for three months before being routed by Ukrainian forces. The town finds itself again under attack since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Her children are not yet old enough for her to have to explain the daily air raid sirens or why buildings lie in rubble. But she wants them to know peace. \"I don't care what kind of peace we have,\" Anastasia says. \"I just want my children to live healthy with nothing flying over their heads.\" Loading... Some Ukrainians in the mainly Russian-speaking eastern part of the country traditionally felt closer to Russia than to Ukraine, whose capital of Kyiv is more than 400 miles away in the north-central region. That has changed with the full-scale war. Dr. Valentina Hlushchenko, who is showing NPR around the hospital, says the question of whether the region should be part of Russia or Ukraine ripped families apart in 2014 when the conflict began. So they don't discuss it anymore. Ihor Kachaniuk, 24, meets his wife Victoria Kachaniuk, 29, after the birth of their son Kim at the Sloviansk City Clinical Hospital.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption \"We already experienced this pain in 2014 — it split husbands and wives, pitted brother against brother,\" she says. \"And since the full-scale invasion in 2022, it's been a complete catastrophe. So it's a closed topic. We don't have these conversations so as not to hurt or offend people. Everyone just tries to live their lives.\" Hlushchenko says people hold on in the town as long as they can for services, or their pensions. Going somewhere else could also mean having to pay rent. A large map of Ukraine hangs on the wall over hospital director Volodymyr Ivanenko's desk. He says when Russia invaded in 2022, many of the staff fled. But almost everyone has returned and now they're operating at 90% capacity, working through missile strikes and electricity and water cuts. \"We are a Ukrainian health institution and we must provide care to Ukrainians until the last moment,\" he says. \"Whether it's dangerous or not is another issue.\" Volodymyr Ivanenko, 69, director of Sloviansk City Clinical Hospital  in his office in front of the map of Ukraine.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption Ivanenko says several doctors were killed when a missile hit the hospital in 2023. But he says the hospital must continue its work. \"We know the consequences perfectly well, because almost every day we treat civilians and we see the nature of their injuries,\" he says. \"But it's a job, just like sitting in a trench. You have to live and work for something.\" Heavily pregnant Khrystyna Deshchenko is sitting in the hallway on a bench next to her husband, Valentyn. She says her contractions have started. The couple is from nearby Kramatorsk, where Russian missile strikes have killed hundreds of civilians over the past three years. The couple says they are very worried about the safety of their first child and believe the future does not bode well for Donetsk province. They say they plan to move to a safer place farther west, like the Kyiv suburbs. Khrystyna Deshchenko, 24, and Valentyn Deshchenko, 25, are waiting for the birth of their first child at the Sloviansk City Clinical Hospital.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption \"Here in the east things happen very fast,\" says Valentyn Deshchenko. \"Sometimes there is no time to even sound an alarm when a ballistic missile is fired. So life here can be a bit miserable.\" He says before President Trump was elected, he thought any peace deal with Russia would freeze territory along the contact line between the warring countries, leaving Ukraine in control of part of Donetsk province. But now he thinks Ukraine will lose it all. \"Trump and Russia will take it away. All our hope is gone,\" he says. Even amid war, the joyful sounds of children shouting and laughing float from a playground next to Sloviansk town hall. The building's entrance is buttressed by sandbags. A child rides a tricycle out front where giant portraits stand of the town's sons who have fallen in battle. Olena Hunchenko tightly grips the hand of her 1-year-old daughter, Zlata, who has just learned to walk. She explains what it's like to raise a child in Sloviansk. Olena Hunchenko with small children in the center of Sloviansk city, Donetsk region.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption \"Well, let's just say it's very dangerous,\" she says. \"Sometimes when it's loud, it's scary for the child. But we're still here.\" Hunchenko was born and raised in what she says used to be an idyllic small town. She says if the Russians ever do capture Sloviansk, her family would leave — especially because her husband is in the Ukrainian military. Before the war, Sloviansk had a population of around 140,000, but it has dropped dramatically since the full-scale invasion down to 57,000, according to the area's Ukrainian military administration. At one point, the front line was only a few miles from here. Today, the Russians have been pushed back at least 50 miles away. But Russian forces have been making incremental gains, slowly inching back toward Sloviansk. Five-year-old Artem is pretending to be a policeman, yelling out to another child to pull his car over to the side of the road and pay a fine for speeding. His father, Dmytro Kluchnikov, looks on, smiling. The 38-year-old grew up in Sloviansk. He says the family left briefly in 2022, moving to a town farther west. \"But it was expensive and they treated us like outsiders,\" he says. Here, everything is ours. There's no place like home.\" The conversation is suddenly pierced by the wail of air raid sirens. Dmytro Kluchnikov holds his son Artem in his arms at a playground in the center of Sloviansk.Anton Shtuka for NPRhide caption \"He knows the Russians are bombing us and sending drones,\"Kluchnikov says of his son. \"He hates them. They're the bad guys.\" He speaks in Ukrainian even though he says his Russian is stronger. But he doesn't want to speak what he calls the language of the invaders anymore. So will they stay if the Russians ever take Sloviansk? \"We understand they want all of Donetsk,\" he says. \"If for any reason they get it, we will leave.\" Kluchnikov says he is very angry about all the people the Russians have killed, including children. \"How can we accept these killers of civilians?\" he asks. \"No, absolutely not. We will never live in the country of the killers.\" The Alley of Memory memorial sits in front of the Sloviansk City Administration building.

    "article_text": "Michel Martin A mural of George Floyd marks the place where he was murdered by Minneapolis police near the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, Tues., May 20, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minn. During the past five years, the intersection, which has come to be known as George Floyd Square, has served as a memorial space for all those who have died at the hands of law enforcement.Tim Evans for NPRhide caption By now we all know what happened. A Black man named George Floyd was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a convenience store in Minneapolis. Police were called, and a white officer named Derek Chauvin killed Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nine and a half minutes while he was handcuffed face down in the street. Two other officers helped restrain Floyd. A fourth kept onlookers from intervening. All were eventually fired and sent to prison. Days of protests against police violence ensued. Many were peaceful, some were not. One estimate found it was the first \"civil disorder event\" to result in more than $1 billion in losses. Graffiti condemning the police and demanding racial justice cover defunct gas pumps at George Floyd Square.Tim Evans for NPRhide caption Five years later, many of us arestill trying to wrap our heads around whyit happened, and just as importantly, what those tragic and frightening words and days mean to us now. That's why a group of us fromMorning Editionspent the week in the Twin Cities, driving and walking around, listening and talking, asking people for their thoughts about what they think the events of May 2020 meant. We spoke with people from different backgrounds: ministers, activists, educators, a business owner who is still trying to make a living on the street where Floyd was killed and having a tough go of it. Rev. Dr. Jia Starr Brown, a longtime pastor, educator, and activist in the Twin Cities, poses for a portrait at the Say Their Names Cemetery near George Floyd Square.Tim Evans for NPRhide caption We talked with officials likeMayor Jacob Freyand Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. We spoke with the former police chief, Medaria Arradondo, known as Chief Rondo, who made the decision to pull his officers back from the Third Police Precinct and request the governor send in the National Guard as the protests became more violent. It's adecision that remains controversial: critics say he let the protests get out of hand; he says property was lost but lives were saved. We talked with attorney Benjamin Crump, a veteran of many police misconduct cases dating back years, whonegotiated a large settlement for Floyd's familyin a civil action, and lawyer Antonio Romanucci, who represented one of the bystanders who begged the police to get off Floyd's neck.

And that means all of us who chose to look have decisions to make about how we think about what happened here. After Floyd's death, there were lots of big gestures. Companies made donations. Governments made commitments. Some police departments reformed policies. Some states passed new laws. Lawsuits were filed. Settlements reached. But could this still happen again? It's a question that doesn't belong to just one city or town. It belongs, in one way or another, to all of us.

    "title": "Russia hits Ukraine with the largest drone-and-missile attack of the war so far",
    "article_text": "The roots of Russia's invasion of Ukraine go back decades and run deep. The current conflict is more than one country fighting to take over another; it is — in the words of one U.S. official — a shift in \"the world order.\"Here are some helpful stories to make sense of it all. By The Associated Press In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, firefighters try to put out a fire following a Russian attack in Kyiv region, Ukraine, Sunday, May 25, 2025.AP/Ukrainian Emergency Servicehide caption KYIV, Ukraine  — A massive Russian drone-and-missile attack targeted the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and other regions in the country for a second consecutive night, killing at least 12 people and injuring dozens, officials said early Sunday. The scale of the onslaught was stunning — Russia hit Ukraine with 367 drones and missiles, making this the largest single attack of the more than three-years-long war, according to Yuriy Ihnat, a spokesperson for Ukraine's Air Force. In all, Russia used 69 missiles of various types and 298 drones, including Iranian-designed Shahed drones, he told The Associated Press. It was \"the most massive strike in terms of the number of air attack weapons on the territory of Ukraine since the beginning of the full-scale invasion in 2022,\" Ihnat said. There was no immediate comment from Moscow. For Kyiv, the day was particularly somber as the city observes Kyiv Day, a national holiday that falls on the last Sunday of May commemorating its founding in the 5th century, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that Russian missiles and drones hit more than 30 cities and villages across Ukraine and urged Western partners to ramp up sanctions on Russia. That has been a long-standing demand of the Ukrainian leader but one that — despite warnings to Moscow by the United States and Europe — have not materialized in ways to deter Russia. Zelenskyy wrote on X that Sunday's targets included Kyiv, Zhytomyr, Khmelnytskyi, Ternopil, Chernihiv, Sumy, Odesa, Poltava, Dnipro, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv and Cherkasy regions. \"These were deliberate strikes on ordinary cities. Ordinary residential buildings were destroyed and damaged,\" he said. \"Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped. Sanctions will certainly help,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Determination matters now — the determination of the United States, of European countries, and of all those around the world who seek peace.\" In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, a local resident cries standing amid the rubble of her house ruined after Russia's air attack in Khmelnytskyi region, Ukraine, Sunday, May 25, 2025.AP/Ukrainian Emergency Servicehide caption The attack came on the third day of a planned prisoner swap between Russia and Ukraine, the only tangible outcome from peace talks in Istanbul earlier this month that have so far failed to produce a ceasefire. The exchange amounted to a rare moment of cooperation between the warring sides. Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 110 Ukrainian drones overnight. Sounds of explosions boomed throughout the night in Kyiv and the surrounding area as Ukrainian air defense forces persisted for hours in efforts to shoot down enemy drones and missiles. At least four people were killed and 16 were injured in the capital itself, according to Ukraine's security service. \"A difficult Sunday morning in Ukraine after a sleepless night. The most massive Russian air attack in many weeks lasted all night,\" Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on X. Fires broke out in homes and businesses, set off by falling drone debris. In the region of Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, three children were killed, aged 8, 12 and 17, according to the emergency service. Twelve were injured in the attacks, the service said. At least four people were killed in the Khmelnytskyi region, in western Ukraine. One man was killed in Mykolaiv region, in southern Ukraine. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a student dormitory in Holosiivskyi district was hit by a drone and one of the building's walls was on fire. In Dniprovskyi district, a private house was destroyed and in Shevchenkivskyi district, windows in a residential building were smashed. The scale of Russia's use of aerial weapons, the attacks over the past 48 hours have been among the most intense strikes on Ukraine since the February 2022 full-scale war. The last in a three-day prisoner swap was expected to take place later on Sunday. In the village of Markhalivka, just outside Kyiv, where several homes were burned down in the overnight strikes, the Fedorenkos watched their ruined home in tears. \"The street looks like Bakhmut, like Mariupol, it's just terrible,\" says 76-year-old Liubov Fedorenko, comparing their village to some of Ukraine's most devastated cities in the war. She told the AP how grateful she was her daughter had not joined them for the weekend with her family. \"I was trying to persuade my daughter to come to us,\" Fedorenko said, adding she told her daughter, \"After all, you live on the eighth floor in Kyiv, and here it's the ground floor.'\" \"She said, 'No, mum, I'm not coming.' And thank God she didn't come, because the rocket hit (the house) on the side where the children's rooms were,\" Fedorenko said. In this photo provided by the Ukrainian Emergency Service, firefighters try to put out a fire following a Russian attack in Kyiv region, Ukraine, Sunday, May 25, 2025.AP/Ukrainian Emergency Servicehide caption Ivan Fedorenko, 80, said he regrets letting their two dogs into the house after the air raid siren went off. \"They burned to death,\" he said. \"I want to bury them, but I'm not allowed yet.\" Zelenskyy and Russia's defense ministry said each side brought home 307 more soldiers the previous day, on Saturday, a day after each side released a total of 390 combatants and civilians. Once completed, the swap will amount to the largest exchange of prisoners in more than three years of war. \"We expect more to come tomorrow,\" Zelenskyy said on his official Telegram channel on Saturday. Russia's defense ministry also said it expected the exchange to be continued, though it did not give details. The previous night, explosions and anti-aircraft fire were heard throughout Kyiv as many sought shelter in subway stations as Russian drones and missiles targeted the Ukrainian capital. The ongoing POW exchange, the latest of dozens of swaps since the war began and the biggest involving Ukrainian civilians so far did not bring a halt in the fighting. Battles have continued along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed, and neither country has relented in its deep strikes.

    "article_text": "By Liz Baker Burned-out vehicles still line the reopened section of PCH, where unobstructed views of the Pacific Ocean expose where multi-story homes burned to the ground.Liz Baker/NPRhide caption MALIBU, CALIF.— It's dawn patrol at Surfrider Beach, a coveted time for eager surfers to paddle out for a chance to catch the world-famous right-hand point break wave. But on this overcast summer day, only a couple dozen people bob on their surfboards, waiting for the perfect swell. \"This is like having it empty,\" surfer Maria Shen says, about the turnout. \"We can, on a day that's a little bit bigger than this, have a hundred people trying to get the same wave.\" Since the Palisades Fire in January, the portion of the Pacific Coast Highway running through the burn scar has been closed to all but residents, emergency responders, and construction crews, speeding up the massive clean-up but inadvertently isolating the beach city of Malibu. That's all changed just in time for Memorial Day weekend, when city officials announced the reopening of Pacific Coast Highway, known locally as \"PCH\", just in time for the three-day weekend. \"Hallelujah, Memorial Day weekend and they opened up the road!\" rejoiced surfer Milton Willis, who has been living in Malibu for the last 5 years. He's glad PCH is reopening, even if it means more crowded waves, because it also means that the area is starting to heal from the fire that killed 12 people and burned over 23 thousand acres. \"It's tragic and you pray for the guys that lost their lives and lost their homes,\" Willis says. \"But you can see that progress is happening.\" Surfer Milton Willis stands on Surfrider Beach, a world-famous break that has been less-accessible since the January fires led to the PCH closure.Liz Baker/NPRhide caption That progress includes over 60% of lots cleared of debris by the Army Corps of Engineers. Still, twisted metal beams, rusted car carcasses, and charred palm trees remain  visible from PCH, which is itself a little worn down after months of use by heavy construction vehicles. \"Definitely spooky,\" says cyclist Alec Radtke, who risked punctured tires to be one of the first to cycle the reopened stretch, which he used to ride before the fires. This time, he noticed ocean vistas he had never seen before, where multistory buildings used to block the view. \"It was super bizarre,\" Radtke says of the experience. \"It was a little bit dusty; obviously a lot of heavy trucks. It looks like a lot of the structures have been sort of cleaned out but there's a lot of free-standing walls and empty debris, and that was definitely an emotional section of the ride.\" Locals have mixed emotions about the reopening, with some hopeful that Malibu will begin to return to business as usual, while others worry about traffic from lookie-loos.Liz Baker/NPRhide caption At the Malibu Country Mart, general manager Stephen McNelis says the shopping center has been \"kind of a ghost town.\" He's hopeful this weekend will be the start of a robust summer season. It wasn't just the Palisades Fire, but the Franklin Fire, which came right up to the complex in December. Businesses lost the pivotal Christmas holiday shopping season, then were hit again by the Palisades Fire and PCH closure one month later. \"We persevered and got through it,\" says McNelis, who noted that only few stores here went out of business. With PCH open again, \"I think it's just going to keep getting better.\" Frank Milliren, who works at a high-end shoe store in the plaza, isn't so sure. \"The fires took a tremendous toll on the business,\" he says. And he questions whether travelers on the reopened road will have the community's best interest at heart. \"A lot of that traffic will just be people taking in the terrible devastation,\" he says, echoing concerns from some locals that the PCH will bring lookie-loos, looters, and outsiders insensitive to the trauma locals are just beginning to grapple with. Emma Carroll works the opening shift at Malibu Village Books, in the Malibu Country Mart shopping center. The bookstore is visble from PCH, and Carroll is hopeful that renewed traffic will start to make up for five months of lost sales.Liz Baker/NPRhide caption \"A lot of my childhood friends who have lived in Malibu their whole lives, they've had to move out of town,\" says resident Emma Carroll. \"It's just a very different town now after everything that's happened.\" Carroll, who is a supervisor at Malibu Village Books, says the store lost a \"massive\" amount of money over the last five months. \"It has been so, so difficult for all of us in this shopping center,\" she says. \"Malibu business have been struggling, and we're all really eager to get some foot traffic in and spend the summer with some of these visitors.\" But she's \"very, very hopeful\" that this weekend will bring some much-needed customers. \"It's Memorial Day weekend,\" she laughs. \"Anything could happen.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Judge orders the Trump administration to return a Guatemalan man to the U.S.",
    "article_text": "By The Associated Press A military aircraft waits for migrants to board from a bus at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Tx., on Jan. 30, 2025, before deporting them to Guatemala.Christian Chavez/APhide caption A federal judge ordered the Trump administration late Friday to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man it deported to Mexico in spite of his fears of being harmed there. The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely \"lacked any semblance of due process.\" Mexico has since returned him to Guatemala, where he is in hiding, according to court documents. An earlier court proceeding that determined the man, identified by the initials O.C.G., risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala, but he also feared returning to Mexico. He presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom there while seeking asylum in the U.S. \"No one has ever suggested that O.C.G. poses any sort of security threat,\" Murphy wrote. \"In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped.\" Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said O.C.G. was in the country illegally, was \"granted withholding of removal to Guatemala\" and was instead sent to Mexico, which she said was \"a safe third option for him, pending his asylum claim.\" McLaughlin called the judge a \"federal activist judge\" and said the administration expects to be vindicated by a higher court. Murphy's order adds to astring of findingsby federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years working and raising a family. The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administrationto facilitate Abrego Garcia's returnto the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House's claim that it couldn't retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him. The Trump administration has tried to invoke the state secrets privilege, arguing that releasing details in open court — or even to the judge in private — about returning Abrego Garcia to the United States would jeopardize national security. In his Friday ruling, Murphy nodded to the dispute over the verb \"facilitate\" in that case and others, saying that returning O.C.G. to the U.S. is not that complicated. \"The Court notes that 'facilitate' in this context should carry less baggage than in several other notable cases,\" he wrote. \"O.C.G. is not held by any foreign government. Defendants have declined to make any argument that facilitating his return would be costly, burdensome, or otherwise impede the government's objectives.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "How farmers can help rescue water-loving birds",
    "article_text": "Not every farmer is thrilled to host birds. Some worry about the spread ofavian flu, others are concerned that the birds will eat too much of their valuable crops. But as an unstable climate delivers too little water, careening temperatures and chaotic storms, the fates of human food production and birds are ever more linked—with the same climate anomalies that harm birds hurting agriculture too. In some places, farmer cooperation is critical to the continued existence of whooping cranes and other wetland-dependent waterbird species, close toone-third of whichare experiencing declines. Numbers of waterfowl (think ducks and geese)have crashedby20 percent since 2014, and long-legged wading shorebirds like sandpipers have sufferedsteep population losses. Conservation-minded biologists, nonprofits, government agencies, and farmers themselves are amping up efforts to ensure that each species survives and thrives. With federal support in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, their work is more important (and threatened) than ever. Their collaborations, be they domestic or international, are highly specific, because different regions support different kinds of agriculture—grasslands, or deep or shallow wetlands, for example, favored by different kinds of birds. Key to the efforts is making it financially worthwhile for farmers to keep—or tweak—practices to meet bird forage and habitat needs. Traditional crawfish-and-rice farmsin Louisiana, as well as in Gentz’s corner of Texas, mimic naturalfreshwaterwetlandsthat are being lost to saltwater intrusionfrom sea level rise. Rice grows in fields that are flooded to keep weeds down; fields are drained for harvest by fall. They are then re-flooded to cover crawfish burrowed in the mud; these are harvested in early spring—and the cycle begins again. That second flooding coincides with fall migration—a genetic and learned behaviorthat determines where birds fly and when—and it lures massive numbers of egrets, herons, bitterns, and storks that dine on the crustaceans as well as ontadpoles, fish, and insects in the water. On a biodiverse crawfish-and-rice farm, “you can see 30, 40, 50 species of birds, amphibians, reptiles, everything,” says Elijah Wojohn, a shorebird conservation biologist at nonprofit Manomet Conservation Sciences in Massachusetts. In contrast, if farmers switch to less water-intensive corn and soybean production in response to climate pressures, “you’ll see raccoons, deer, crows, that’s about it.” Wojohn often relies on word-of-mouth to hook farmers on conservation; one learned to spot whimbrel, with their large, curved bills, got “fired up” about them and told all his farmer friends. Such farmer-to-farmer dialogue is how you change things among this sometimes change-averse group, Wojohn says. In the Mississippi Delta and in California, where rice is generally grown without crustaceans, conservation organizations like Ducks Unlimited have long boosted farmers’ income and staying power by helping them get paid to flood fields in winter for hunters. This attracts overwintering ducks and geese—considered an extra “crop”—that gobble leftover rice and pond plants; the birds alsohelp to decompose rice stalksso farmers don’t have to remove them. Ducks Unlimited’s goal is simple, says director of conservation innovation Scott Manley: Keep rice farmers farming rice. This is especially important as a changing climate makes that harder. 2024 saw a huge push, with the organization conserving 1 million acres for waterfowl. Some strategies can backfire. In Central New York, where dwindling winter ice has seen waterfowl lingering past their habitual migration times, wildlife managers and land trusts are buying less productive farmland to plant with native grasses; these give migratory fuel to ducks when not much else is growing. But there’s potential for this to produce too many birds for the land available back in their breeding areas, says Andrew Dixon, director of science and conservation at the Mohamed Bin Zayed Raptor Conservation Fund in Abu Dhabi, and coauthor ofan article about the genetics of bird migrationin the 2024 Annual Review of Animal Biosciences. This can damage ecosystems meant to serve them. Recently, conservation efforts spanning continents and thousands of miles have sprung up. One seeks to protect buff-breasted sandpipers. As they migrate 18,000 miles to and from the High Arctic where theynest, the birds experience extreme hunger—hyperphagia—that compels them to voraciously devour insects in short grasses where the bugs proliferate. But many stops along the birds’ round-trip route are threatened. There are water shortages affecting agriculture in Texas, where the birds forage at turf grass farms; grassland loss and degradation in Paraguay; and in Colombia, conversion of forage lands to exotic grasses and rice paddies these birds cannot use. Conservationists say it’s critical to protect habitat for “buffies” all along their route, and to ensure that the winters these small shorebirds spend around Uruguay’s coastal lagoons are a food fiesta. To that end, Manomet conservation specialist Joaquín Aldabe, in partnership with Uruguay’s agriculture ministry, has so far taught 40 local ranchers how to improve their cattle grazing practices. Rotationally moving the animals from pasture to pasture means grasses stay the right length for insects to flourish. There are no easy fixes in the North American northwest, wherebird conservation is in crisis. Extreme drought is causing breeding grounds, molting spots, and migration stopover sites to vanish. It is alsoendangering the livelihoods of farmers, who feel the push to sell land to developers. From Southern Oregon to Central California, conservation allies have provided monetary incentives for water-strapped grain farmers toleave behind harvest debristo improve survivability for the1 billion birdsthat pass through every year, and forranchers to flood-irrigate unused pastures. One treacherous leg of the northwest migration route is the parched Klamath Basin of Oregon and California. For three recent years, “we saw no migrating birds. I mean, the peak count was zero,” says John Vradenburg, supervisory biologist of the Klamath Basin National Wildlife Refuge Complex. He andmyriad private, public, and Indigenous partnersare working to conjure more water for the basin’s human and avian denizens, as perennial wetlands become seasonal wetlands, seasonal wetlands transition to temporary wetlands, and temporary wetlands turn to arid lands. Taking down four power dams and oneleveehas stretched the Klamath River’s water across the landscape, creatingnew streamsand connecting farm fields tolong-separated wetlands. But making the most of this requires expansive thinking. Wetland restoration—now endangered by loss of funding from the current administration—would help drought-afflicted farmers by keeping water tables high. But what if farmers could also receive extra money for their businesses via eco-credits, akin to carbon credits, for the work those wetlands do to filter-clean farm runoff? And what if wetlands could function as aquaculture incubators for juvenile fish, before stocking rivers? Klamath tribes are invested in restoring endangered c’waam and koptu sucker fish, and this could help them achieve that goal. As birds’ traditional resting and nesting spots become inhospitable, a more sobering question is whether improvements can happen rapidly enough. The blistering pace of climate change gives little chance for species to genetically adapt, although some are changing their behaviors. That means that the work of conservationists to find and secure adequate, supportive farmland and rangeland as the birds seek out new routes has become a sprint against time.

It released a week prior in Australia, South Korea, and other territories, so its international audience made up $127 million’s worth of that haul. By weekend’s end, its $63 million domestic take may jump up to $77 million, a new record for theMission: ImpossibleÂseries. Both films have received strongcriticaland audience reception, helped by growing momentum ahead of their releases. Nostalgia drives both movies:ÂLiloÂis based on Disney’s 23-year-old classic, andReckoningmay be the last film in the series, or just the last to star Tom Cruise’s Ethan Hunt. Regardless, audiences are going out in droves to see movies this weekend, including holdovers likeÂFinal Destination Bloodlines, Sinners,ÂandÂThunderbolts.Variety noted it’s been over a decade since people went to the theaters this much during Memorial Day, and a marked improvement from 2024’s weaker showing ofÂFuriosaÂandÂGarfield. And the summer season continues withÂBallerina,How to Train Your Dragon,ÂandÂ28 Years LaterÂin June, followed byÂSupermanÂandÂFantastic FourÂin July.

    "title": "Les Dilley, ‘Star Wars’ and ‘Indiana Jones’ Art Director, Dies at 84",
    "article_text": "Les Dilley, the award-winning art director and production designer on a number of films, passed away on May 20 at age 84 from Alzheimer’s complications. Born July 11, 1941 in Rhondda, Wales, Dilley began his film career with a construction and plastering apprenticeship at the Associated British Picture Corporation when he was 15. At age 23, he was a plaster worker on 1963’sFrom Russia With Love,Âthen an assistant art director onÂJesus Christ SuperstarÂandÂKelly’s Heroes. After being an art director for 1973’sÂThree Musketeersand its 1974 sequel, he joined the UK team forStar Wars: A New Hope,and helped to create a physical build for R2-D2, the sandcrawler, and Luke’s landspeeder. He proceeded to direct art for its sequel,Empire Strikes Back,along withÂRaiders of the Lost Ark, Alien, Superman,andAnÂ American Werewolf in London. His production designer credits includeÂThe Abyss,Exorcist III,ÂInvaders From Mars, Casper, Black Knight,andÂDeep Impact. WhileAbyss, Empire,ÂandÂAlienÂeach earned him Oscar nominations,New HopeandRaidersÂearned him wins for Best Art Direction, both shared with fellow art director Norman Reynolds, who passed in 2023. After working as a production designer on the British kids’ showTeacup TravelsÂended in 2017, Dilley retired. (IMDBandMubicredit him on a web series calledÂNew-Gen,Âwhich at time of writing, has yet to release.) In 2020, BAFTA’s Welsh branchâthe British Academy Cymru Awardsâhonored him with an Outstanding Contribution to Film and Television Award. There, he was heaped with praise from George Lucas, Ridley Scott, and others who’d worked with him over the years. Lucas described him as his “main contact with the art department, and an all-around great guy. […] If anybody deserves this award, it’s you.” Les Dilley’s survived by his wife Leslie and five children. In a statement, the family said his legacy “lives on in the many iconic films he helped bring to life for over six decades and in his family home he personally built as an homage to his work. His love for the motion picture business was evident to the very end. In addition to his incredible work ethic, quirky British humor, and love of life, he was a dedicated and loving husband, father, grandfather and friend to many. He will be greatly missed.” [viaThe Hollywood Reporter] Want more io9 news?

    "title": "After ‘Mission: Impossible’, What is Hollywood’s Action Future?",
    "article_text": "After nearly 30 years, three on-screen deaths, and at least a dozenwild stunts, Ethan Hunt andMission: Impossiblehave approached some kind of end withThe Final Reckoning. The question now is “what’s next?,” which has hovered over this franchise for years, and in several different ways. Tom Cruiseisthe series, and throughout the years, he’sreaffirmed his commitmentto these movies until his heart stops beating. Longtime fans know some of this served as a direct statement to Paramount: after Jeremy Renner was cast as William Brandt forGhost Protocol,Ârumorsbegan to swirl he’d take over as the series’ lead if (or, if the studio had its way, when) Cruise opted to retire from the franchise. That never materialized, but fromGhostÂand onward, Cruise has had another star on hand as a co-lead, including Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust (introduced inÂRogue Nation), Hayley Atwell’s Grace (Dead Reckoning), and Henry Cavill’s August Walker (Fallout). All four actorsâeven Cavill, at least until Walker’s villain revealâhave felt likeMission: Impossibletaking some kind of stab at getting audiences on board with possible candidates to step in for an aging Cruise. Each have been introduced as a foil or mirror to Ethan and get at least one stunt or action scene to make a case for themselves as a potential new lead. Whether that’s been the writers’ direct intent or not, the chances of a new protagonist coming in feel likely, even if it means some splitting the difference, like having them handle shootouts and fist fights while Ethan continues to pull off death-defying stunts, somethingFinal Reckoningalready does. After Ethan brings his latest team together, he splits off from them to basically perform the much-advertised deep sea stunt to investigate a shipwrecked submarine while his friends go to St. Matthew’s Island and fight against Russian special forces. This is a series of movies that continually builds upon its predecessors, so it stands to reason this could be the way forward if Cruise is adamant about leading these films until his own body dictates he can’t. Alternatively, Cruise now has a deal to develop and produce films for Warner Bros., including a film withAlejandroGonzÃ¡lezIÃ±Ã rrituand potentially anEdge of Tomorrowsequel. If he allowed it, Paramount could potentially keepMission: ImpossibleÂgoing without him for a movie or two so audiences have time to miss Ethan while getting invested in a new or returning set of characters. Then, it can be a proper event when Ethan returns, giving Cruise and the studio a legacy sequel potentially as momentous asTop Gun: MaverickÂwas just a few years ago. Failing that, we may get a new crop of action spy movies over the next few years, similar to the woman-fronted ones that tried to fill the empty space left by a nonexistent Black Widow movie until 2021.MissionÂis among the last of the genre’s big franchisesâthe others beingJason BourneandJames Bond, both of whichpossiblyÂhave new films in the works, but nothing concrete as of yet.Â (Fast & Furiousorbits the same area, but not quite the same way, and that next movie is currently TBD.) With such a vacuum, any actor or director could arguably come and make a name for themselves. Already, several actors seem to have been bitten by the action bug lately: following his directorial debut with last year’sMonkey Man,Dev Patel’s next project is the medieval action-thrillerThe Peasant. Simu Liu has his eyes on aÂSleeping DogsÂmoviethat’ll put his Shang-Chi training to good use, and in the most interesting of developments, Florence Pugh convinced Disney to let herjump off a skyscraperfor a stunt in Marvel’s current hitThunderbolts. That film’s focus on practical work, and Pugh’s determination to do it, speaks to a hunger among the current crop of stars to really get their hands dirty and do actual physical work. Cruise has advocated for younger actors to make themselves viable for such work andstudy old movies, even going so far as to create separate boot camps for his respectiveFinal ReckoningÂandÂTop Gun: MaverickÂcostars. A focus on practical work has been one ofÂMission’sÂgreatest strengths, and a number of actors, likePom Klementieff, seem to be taking Cruise’s ideas and insights to heart. Audiences also seem to be more than willing to check out a movie in theaters if it looks worthwhile andÂreal,Âwhich action movies tend to excel at. Whether studios will let that happen, and give actors and creatives the opportunities to provide those tactile, very real thrills, is another matter entirely. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Charlie Cox Thinks Fans Could Make a Daredevil Movie Happen",
    "article_text": "Since 2015,Daredevilhas dominated the small screen across his two shows on Netflix and Disney+. Fans havekept the character goingon TV for the past decade, and actor Charlie Cox thinks that same passion could get ol’ hornhead back on the big screen. In a recent interview at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation, Cox said he was the “worst person to ask” about the chances of a Daredevil movie, since he knows jack all about it. Any questions or demands should go to “the grown-ups,” aka Disney and Marvel. “Write letters, just everyone write letters,” he urged. For him, the show’s not too far removed from the cinematic experience, since the cast and crew got to watch the first two episodes of every season in theaters, something he thinks it absolutely “deserves” for everyone, not just the people who made it. Now, Cox could probably be lying his ass off, a thing he’spretty goodat doing when it comes to playing this character. If there were any time to bring him to the movies, fans think it’d be now:Deadpool & Wolverinereintroduced audiences to Jennifer Garner’s Elektra (from the 2003Daredeviland her own solo movie), and the recently delayedAvengers: DoomsdayÂandÂSecret WarsÂare looking to bring the old X-Men back for one last hurrah. And if not there, there’s always Spider-Man: Cox has already reprised the role for the animatedFriendly Neighborhood Spider-Man,ÂandÂSpider-Man: Brand New DayÂin 2026. Wherever Daredevil shows up next outside of his own showreturning in 2026, Cox is happy to tell Matt’s story and remains “so thrilled to be here.” And if this is any indication, fans are ready to follow him anywhere.

    "title": "Does Light Traveling Through Space Wear Out?",
    "article_text": "My telescope, set up for astrophotography in my light-polluted San Diego backyard, was pointed at a galaxy unfathomably far from Earth. My wife, Cristina, walked up just as the first space photo streamed to my tablet. It sparkled on the screen in front of us. âThatâs thePinwheel galaxy,â I said. The name is derived from its shapeâalbeit this pinwheel contains about a trillion stars. The light from the Pinwheel traveled for 25 million years across the universeâabout 150 quintillion milesâto get to my telescope. My wife wondered: âDoesnât light get tired during such a long journey?â Her curiosity triggered a thought-provoking conversation about light. Ultimately, why doesnât light wear out and lose energy over time? I am anastrophysicist, and one of the first things I learned in my studies is how light often behaves in ways that defy our intuitions.Â Light iselectromagnetic radiation: basically, an electric wave and a magnetic wave coupled together and traveling throughspace-time. Ithas no mass. That point is critical because the mass of an object, whether a speck of dust or a spaceship, limits the top speed it can travel through space. But because light is massless, itâs able to reach the maximum speed limit in a vacuumâabout 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second, oralmost 6 trillion miles per year(9.6 trillion kilometers). Nothing traveling through space is faster. To put that into perspective: In the time it takes you to blink your eyes, a particle of light travels around the circumference of the Earth more than twice. As incredibly fast as that is, space is incredibly spread out. Light from the Sun, which is 93 million miles (about 150 million kilometers) from Earth, takes just overeight minutes to reach us. In other words, the sunlight you see is eight minutes old.ÂAlpha Centauri, the nearest star to us after the Sun, is 26 trillion miles away (about 41 trillion kilometers). So by the time you see it in the night sky, its light is just over four years old. Or, as astronomers say, itâsfour light years away. With those enormous distances in mind, consider Cristinaâs question: How can light travel across the universe and not slowly lose energy? Actually, some light does lose energy. This happens whenit bounces off something, such as interstellar dust, and is scattered about.Â But most light just goes and goes, without colliding with anything. This is almost always the case becausespace is mostly emptyânothingness. So thereâs nothing in the way.Â When light travels unimpeded, it loses no energy. It can maintain that 186,000-mile-per-second speed forever. Hereâs another concept: Picture yourself as an astronauton board the International Space Station. Youâre orbiting at 17,000 miles (about 27,000 kilometers) per hour. Compared with someone on Earth, your wristwatch will tick 0.01 seconds slower over one year. Thatâs an example oftime dilationâtime moving atdifferent speeds under different conditions. If youâre moving really fast, or close to a large gravitational field, your clock will tick more slowly than someone moving slower than you, or who is further from a large gravitational field. To say it succinctly,time is relative. Now consider that light isinextricably connected to time. Picture sitting on aphoton, a fundamental particle of light; here, youâd experience maximum time dilation. Everyone on Earth would clock you at the speed of light, but from your reference frame, time would completely stop. Thatâs because the âclocksâ measuring time are in two different places going vastly different speeds: the photon moving at the speed of light, and the comparatively slowpoke speed of Earth going around the Sun. Whatâs more, when youâre traveling at or close to the speed of light, the distance between where you are and where youâre going gets shorter. That is, space itself becomes more compact in the direction of motionâso the faster you can go, the shorter your journey has to be. In other words, for the photon,space gets squished. Which brings us back to my picture of the Pinwheel galaxy. From the photonâs perspective, a star within the galaxy emitted it, and then a single pixel in my backyard camera absorbed it, at exactly the same time. Because space is squished, to the photon the journey was infinitely fast and infinitely short, a tiny fraction of a second. But from our perspective on Earth, the photon left the galaxy 25 million years ago and traveled 25 million light years across space until it landed on my tablet in my backyard. And there, on a cool spring night, its stunning image inspired a delightful conversation between a nerdy scientist and his curious wife.

    "title": "What Is the Future of ‘Star Wars Battlefront’?",
    "article_text": "Days ago, gamers andStar WarsÂfans startedvoicing their desirefor anotherStar Wars BattlefrontÂgame. DICE’sBattlefront IIfrom 2017 has received an extra surge of attention as of late; its player count is growing on PC, and the community aims to capitalize on the renewed popularity with aday-long global eventto increase its numbers “and showcase the enduring spirit of theBattlefrontcommunity.” This has all been spurred byStar Wars’May 4 holiday andÂAndorÂstarMuhannad Ben Amor(who played Wilmon) recently calling for another entry: “Grew up with BattlefrontII;been a veteran since day one, let’s hope aBattlefront IIIÂhappens.” Over nearly 20 years, the multiplayer shooter series has had two lives. Itsfirst two gameswere released during theStar Warsprequel era and made by the late Pandemic Studios, while the second, more recent pair come fromBattlefieldÂdeveloper DICE. Neither have made it to number three, but one version nearly happened; aBattlefront IIIfor the original series was in development from several developers, includingTimesplitterscreator Free Radical Design. Before EA took hold of theStar Warsgame license, LucasArts tried restarting the games with an online-only entry, a smaller scale multiplayer entry, and a fourth game set in an alternate reality whereObi-Wan and Luke were Sith Lords, but nothing came of these efforts. Once DICE stopped supporting itsÂBattlefront IIÂin 2020, theÂsub-series was once again MIA. The questions of whetherStar Wars Battlefrontcan come backâand why it should be brought backâare closely linked, and tricky to answer. Making games for this property has occasionally been a tough ask throughout the years. Some of the most famousStar WarsÂgames are the ones thatnever happened, like the Boba Fett-starring1313Âor third entries forÂKnights of the Old RepublicÂandÂForce Unleashed,Âtwo sub-series that existed alongsideBattlefront. Even EA’s had its troubles; it canceled a pirate-focused project fromVisceral Games and Motive Studios, and more recently killed afirst-person shootercentered on a Mandalorian that was in the works over at Respawn, creators of the acclaimedStar Wars JediÂgames. DICE is currently focused entirely onthe nextÂBattlefieldÂgame and several other EA studios are on hand as support, meaning anotherBattlefrontÂcouldn’t reasonably come from EA, let alone any time soon. Mats Holm, a former live producer onÂBattlefront II,Ârecently said as such on Reddit, instead suggesting aremasterof the previous game as a primer before developing a proper sequel, preferably with anyone from theprevious teamwho wanted to work on it. Said remaster would be the best potential “in,” but the problem there lies with EA: while the Pandemic-madeBattlefrontgameshave been remastered, Electronic Arts can be more selective than other publishers with what it chooses to remaster or remake. Since 2019’sFallen Order,ÂStar WarsÂhas kept its video game eye mostly focused on single-player titles, including Ubisoft’sStar Wars OutlawsÂand 2026’sZero CompanyÂfrom Bit Reactor. Other than the space combat-focusedStar Wars Squadrons,EA’s yet to recommit toStar Warsmultiplayer, possibly because the controversy aroundBattlefront II’sinitial monetization was sodisastrousand heavily criticized, it’s the reason why the publisher’s no longer the only one that can create licensed games for the franchise. And then there’sFortnite:thanks to the recent “Galactic Battle” tie-in event, numerous in-game skins for several franchise characters, and the plot-important audio log that revealsPalpatine somehow returnedforRise of Skywalker,ÂEpic Games’ battle royale has become the most important multiplayer shooter the franchise could have. Both previous incarnations ofÂStar Wars BattlefrontÂexisted at a time where they could be the only place where all of the franchise could exist.Battlefront IIwas already marketed as a unification point for all three trilogies, and as part of the game’s rehabilitation efforts,ÂDICE poured everything it had and then some into post-launch updates that incorporated maps, weapons, and characters from thesequelsand prequels,Rogue One,ÂandÂSolo. In the time since DICE ended support for the game in 2019,ÂStar WarsÂhasn’t just found itself linked toÂFortnite,Âit’s also not made consistent momentum that would help justify a realÂBattlefront IIIhappening. Come 2026,The Mandalorian & GroguÂwill likely get aFortniteÂtie-in of some kind, as will the Disney+ seriesMaul: Shadow LordÂand the 2027ÂStarfighterÂfilm. LikeÂAndor’sÂLonni Jung,ÂStar WarsÂhas become trapped inthe web of Epic Games, and it’s doubtful Disney will cease that partnership anytime soon. Hope for aÂStar Wars Battlefront IIIÂcould never truly die, no matter how much the odds are stacked against it. But asStar WarsÂenters a new phase of its life that promises more movies and shows, and hopes to explore a time during and after the sequels, one has to wonder how it would fit into the franchise’s designs, and who will be around for it at a time when online games, regardless of their size, are quick to be cast aside.

    "title": "This $300 ‘Toothbrush’ Is the Worst Thing I’ve Ever Shoved in My Mouth",
    "article_text": "Feno, the âsmart electric toothbrush,â promised to take a two-minute toothbrushing routine and bring it down to 30 or even 20 seconds by swabbing each of my teeth at once. The Feno Smartbrush makes brushing faster, but in exchange it requires you to shove an entire mouthpiece in your piehole twice a day just to cut down on a total of three minutes of brushing time. If there is one thing to take away from this review, it’s that even if tech works, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better than what we already have. The “toothbrush” has been at the side of my bathroom sink for more than three weeks. It has technically saved me time. I would even go as far as to say it may do the job of a regular toothbrush with less time to get there. Still, given the choice, I would rather reach for my non-motorized, dentist-recommended toothbrushâif only because I know it works. After consulting with the companies and non-affiliated dentists, Iâm more bemused that the Feno exists at all. This is a device thatcosts $300for the âFounderâs Editionâ bundle. The company recently said it would increase the price to $400,blaming tariffsfor the rising cost. As the time of this publishing, that new price hasn’t yet materialized. The box comes with three canisters of brand-specific Feno Foam toothpaste. After you run out, youâll need to spend $30 to get an extra three canisters. Feno also recommends replacing the mouthpiece every three months, costing another $30. Feno Smartbrush It may brush all your teeth for quicker cleans, but its too much of an unknown to recommend. Pros Cons My dentist gave me my last manual toothbrush for free. A tube of toothpaste was $5. Despite the price, the company behind the smart toothbrush has one compelling pitch. If people were honest with themselves, most folks do not do the recommended amount of brushing. I fit into that camp for most of my life, until the point I went to my dentist and found I needed to have multiple caps on my molars, requiring I spend a hefty chunk of change for the privilege of having my teeth ground down to nubs. Since then, Iâve become very sensitive to the state of my pearly whites. I try to do the full two minutes of brushing and floss every day, but the Feno is supposed to help by shortening the brushing time and helpfully counting you down with an on-screen timer. My dentist was skeptical about the deviceâs claims, especially whether it was offering proper back-and-forth brushing technique. The American Dental Association has a Seal of Acceptance tested by the organization for products that are recommended by dentists. Neither Fenoâs brush nor special toothpaste are on that list of products with the ADA seal. All I have to go on is Feno’s own claim that it’s doing what it needs to do to clean my teeth and remove plaque. For cleaning, the device makes use of pressure sensors alongside the mouthpieceâs 18,000 bristles, which Fenoclaims canhit 250 strokes per tooth in 20 seconds. Itâs using a sweeping motion along the teeth, which dentists recommend when brushing, but there’s no published science to say the Feno is particularly better than other, similar devices. Feno told me the company has scientific research pertaining to how effective the device is, but it’s pending scientific review and won’t be available until some unknown date. Feno revels in Silicon Valley startupsâ worst habits. Every time you turn it on, the smart toothbrush bombards you with a QR code to download an app for all its controls, rather than including those on-device. The Feno toothbrush can incite the same gag reflex you know if youâve ever played a contact sport requiring a mouth guard. The device is big enough that you have to open wide to fit the whole thing in at once. Brushing with the Feno is not an entirely passive experience, either. Fenoâs founder, Dr. Kenny Brown, told me his company recommends moving the brush side to side while the mouthpiece actuates. On its highest settings, the Feno rattled my jaw and made my entire head shake like a marionette piloted by a mad puppeteer. With those speeds, I could feel the mouthpiece rubbing the inner cheek raw. At normal speeds, the Feno was uncomfortable but still usable without any pain. Feno also advises some gums may bleed if you haven’t been doing proper brushing technique for too long, but I didn’t find the bristles were any more abrasive to my gums than a regular toothbrush. The device running on default settings for 30 seconds seems engineered for most mouths. The company claims its device works with regular toothpaste, but when I plastered some gel to the bristles and stuck it in my mouth, it resulted in a sludgy mess at the bottom of the mouthpiece that took far longer to clean than the typical quick rinse. The foam toothpaste doesnât leave your mouth full of the typical minty taste of fluoride and baking soda you normally associate with the feel of a clean mouth. As a point in favor of the Feno, that minty-fresh taste in your mouth isnât actually indicative of clean teeth, according to Dr. Edmond Hewlett, a professor at UCLAâs School of Dentistry and a consumer advisor for the American Dental Association. Brown told me the company plans for updated toothpaste that adds a lingering minty taste in the mouth, as apparently I wasnât the only one who spoke up on that lack of âcleanâ feeling. Knowing my dentist appointments are near for even more fillings, the Feno would not only need to be good, but even better at cleaning my teeth than the typical electric brush. Even if I felt it may be hitting all my teeth, the device didn’t leave me feeling clean, not least because I had no control over it. Even if the Feno full-mouth toothbrush wasnât uncomfortable, wasnât expensive, didnât require an app, and worked well with regular toothpaste, it would still be hard to make any claim it results in better cleaning than your regular $7 toothbrush you buy from any local pharmacist. Using the smart toothbrush, you canât tell whatâs happening to your teeth. You canât tell if it’s hitting all the nooks and crannies. Thatâs going to be a concern when everybody’s set of teeth is different. The Feno is supposedly designed so that all its bristles hit all different kinds of teeth at the correct 45-degree angle to the gums, but what really matters is if it adds anything to your brushing routine. âThe critical question of any device like this is if it’s better than a toothbrush,â Hewlett told me. âItâs clear that using a toothbrush properly is one of the most effective things a person can do themselves to preserve their teeth.â HealthReviewsteeth Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Water on Mars? Mysterious Dark Streaks Aren’t What Scientists Thought",
    "article_text": "In 1976, NASA’sViking missionsuccessfully landed the first spacecraft on Mars. When the mission began sending images from Mars’ surface back to Earth, scientists noted long, dark streaks on crater walls and cliff sides. To this day, some researchers suggest that the strange geographical features are the result of water flowâbut a recent study says otherwise. Planetary scientists from Brown University and the University of Bern have used artificial intelligence to reveal that the enigmatic Martian streaks likely result from wind and dust, not water flow. Their results have important implications for future Mars exploration, as well as humanity’s continuous search for habitable environments and life beyond Earth. Some slope streaks are long-lasting, while othersâcalled recurring slope lineae (RSL)âare more ephemeral, continuously appearing in the same places during Mars’ hottest times of the year. Although Mars is generally dry andcold(with temperatures as low as -225 degrees Fahrenheit, or -153 degrees Celsius) small amounts of water from potential ice, underground sources, or humidity could conceivably mix with enoughsaltto become liquid and flow down a slope. Because water is a key ingredient for life on Earth, such formations might represent habitable regions on the Red Planet, too. But some researchers aren’t convinced, arguing that dry processes could have created those features instead. To settle the matter, the researchers trained an algorithm on a dataset of confirmed slope streak sightings, as detailed in astudypublished Monday in the journal Nature Communications. They then used the algorithm to scan over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images and compose a map of Martian slope streaks. âOnce we had this global map, we could compare it to databases and catalogs of other things like temperature, wind speed, hydration, rock slide activity and other factors,â Valentin Bickel, co-author of the study and a University of Bern Center for Space and Habitability fellow, said in a Brown Universitystatement. âThen we could look for correlations over hundreds of thousands of cases to better understand the conditions under which these features form.â Simply put, their results do not link slope streaks and RSLs with features indicating the presence of liquid or even frost. Instead, the researchers discovered that both slope streaks and RSLs tend to develop in areas with high wind speed and dust deposition. In other words, they are likely caused by a dry process in which dust layers abruptly slide down a slope, triggered by external forces. Rather than seeing these results as yet another failure in our search for extraterrestrial life, the planetary scientists explain that the study still carries weight for future Mars explorations. If their research had confirmed the theory that slope streaks were caused by water, and that as a result the region might host some form of life, NASA would have actually avoided the area for the time being. That’s because scientists fear that spacecraft and rovers might still harbor terrestrial life, such as microbes, which could contaminate Martian habitats and interfere with our search for Martian life. âThatâs the advantage of this big data approach,â explained Adomas Valantinas, the other co-author of the study and a planetary scientist at Brown University who specializes in Martian geology. âIt helps us to rule out some hypotheses from orbit before we send spacecraft to explore.â In an industry that seems obsessedwith findingwater on Mars, the study stands as a reminder that not every scientific breakthrough needs to be about extraterrestrial life.

    "title": "An Archaeologist Sailed the Seas Using Only Viking Tech. Here’s What He Learned",
    "article_text": "Vikings were formidable Scandinavian warriors and sailors who, from around 800 to 1050 CE, raided, traded, and settled throughout northern Europe, Iceland, Greenland, and even as far as North America. Most of what scholars know about Viking maritime networks, however, has to do with their start and end points. After all, they could have taken any number of routes in between. To shed light on this gap, an archaeologist decided to follow in the Vikings’ footstepsâor, more accurately, their wake. In order to reconstruct their seafaring itineraries, Lund University archaeologist Greer Jarrett sailed functional Viking-like boats along the Norwegian coast in a series of experimental voyages. By experiencing these journeys firsthand, the archaeologist hoped to understand where it would have made most sense for Viking sailors to seek shelter along the way to their destination. In this way, he identified four natural harbors that could have served as pitstops hundreds of years ago. âA lot of the time, we only know about the starting and ending points of the trade that took place during the Viking Age. Major ports, such as Bergen and Trondheim in Norway, Ribe in Denmark, and Dublin in Ireland. The thing I am interested in is what happened on the journeys between these major trading centres,” Jarrett explained in astatement. “My hypothesis is that this decentralised network of ports, located on small islands and peninsulas, was central to making trade efficient during the Viking Age.â Between September 2021 and July 2022, Jarrett and his crew undertook 15 sailing trials and two approximately three-week-long trial voyages in seven different Nordic clinkerboats: traditional, small, open, wooden sailboats whose use in Nordic regions dates back almost 2,000 years. It wasn’t always smooth sailingâonce, the pole supporting the mainsail snapped over 15 miles (25 kilometers) from the coast, and they had to tie two oars together to secure the sail until they managed to return to land. Overall, they covered 1,494 nautical miles. The experimental archaeologist decided that possible “havens” along maritime itineraries should have provided fresh water, shelter from swells and winds, and a good view of the sea. Furthermore, they had to be reachable in low visibility, big enough to host several boats, approachable and exitable from different directions, and located in a “transition zone”: coastal points between exposed regions and inner areas. Along with these criteria, Jarrett’s investigation integrated a digital reconstruction of Viking Age sea levels, pre-established knowledge of large Viking maritime centers, and information about traditional 19th and early 20th century sailboat routes from sailors and fishermen. The archaeologist also clarified that his work regards long-range Viking expeditions rather than voyages for raiding and war purposes. “This studyâs emphasis on practical seafaring knowledge and experience seeks to counter the common academic bias towards terrestrial and textual sources and worldviews,” he wrote in thestudy, published earlier this month in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory. In this way he claims to have identified four potential Viking havens. These remote locations along the Norwegian coast each have varying degrees of pre-existing archaeological evidence indicating past human presence. Presumably, Jarrett is the first to suggest they may have also been pit stops along Viking maritime journeys. “The list of possible Viking Age havens,” he explained, indicating a diagram in the study, “is intended as a working document, which can shape and be shaped by future archaeological surveys and excavations.” It’s worth remembering that, even with digital reconstructions of the Viking-era seascape, experimental voyages can never provide evidence of Viking activity to the degree of direct archaeological evidence. Nevertheless, creative and practical approaches such as Jarrett’s stand as a reminder that sometimes the solution to a problem requires a different perspectiveâliterally. It remains to be seen whether his work will inspire future archaeological surveys. ArchaeologySailingVikings Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Space Marine 2 was a hit, makingmillions for Games Workshop, and guaranteeing the saga of Ultramarine Demetrian Titus would continue inSpace Marine 3. But it was also a boon to developers of other 40K games, like Darktide studio Fatshark and Rogue Trader studio Owlcat. \"We definitely saw a boost in player numbers after Space Marine 2\", said Mike Knight, Darktide narrative lead at Fatshark. \"It makes sense, people play a game and like it, so they look around for something else that's similar.\" Anton Emelianov, brand manager at Owlcat Games, agreed. \"Definitely. When one Warhammer game does well, it lifts the others. We saw a noticeable uptick in interest around Rogue Trader when Space Marine 2 launched—people wanted to explore the setting further, often in different genres.\" And they sure are different genres. The multiplayer-focused third-person action of Space Marine 2 is worlds away from the immersively singleplayer CRPG Rogue Trader, but I guess it's adjacent to co-op FPS Darktide. Though unless you're playing an ogryn, Darktide gives you more of the experience of being one of those lasgun-toting troopers Titus and his mates barrel past in Space Marine 2. It's cool that players want more from their 40K games than just space marines blowing stuff up, even if that's what shifts the most units. \"We've been making games set in the Warhammer/Warhammer 40,000 IPs for a while now\", Knight continues, \"and know that its lore is ripe for the kind of games we like to make. Space Marine 2's success is awesome, but only reinforces what we already know to be true. Warhammer is awesome and makes a great setting for games!\" \"It certainly reinforced what we already believed: Warhammer has a huge and ever-growing audience,\" says Emelianov, \"and there’s plenty of room for new stories within the setting. While our games are very different—and CRPGs are often seen as more of a niche genre—the success of Space Marine 2 is inspiring and motivates us to keep raising the bar.\" As part of the recent Warhammer Skulls event, Darktide and Rogue Trader crossed over, with Darktide's sapper shovel arriving as a weapon in Rogue Trader and the Rogue Trader's compass inspiring a new weapon trinket in Darktide.

    "article_text": "AMD's Frank Azor isn't forgetting the budget gamers out there When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Frank Azor, AMD's Chief Architect of Gaming Solutions and Gaming Marketing, shared a post onX (formerly Twitter)last week in response to a gaming account questioning why AMD is still offering GPUs with 8GB of VRAM in 2025. \"Majority of gamers are still playing at 1080p and have no use for more than 8GB of memory,\" Azor wrote. \"Most played games [worldwide] are mostly esports games.

We wouldn't build it if there wasn't a market for it. If 8GB isn't right for you then there's 16GB. Same GPU, no compromise, just memory…May 22, 2025 There's data to support Azor's claims—according tothe Steam Hardware Survey, over half of gamers (55.27%) are playing on 1080p monitors. The survey data also suggests plenty of people are holding out for more budget GPUs: One of the top five GPUs among Steam users in 2025 is still somehow the GTX 1650, which only has 4GB of VRAM. The number one GPU as of April is the RTX 4060 laptop version with 8GB of VRAM. Limited VRAM hasbecome a bit of a sore spotduring the current, Nvidia-led GPU doldrums, with 8GB already proving an issue in the biggest, most graphically advanced games. It's even an open question whether the5070's 12GB of VRAM is sufficiently \"future proof,\"and the $379 MSRP of the 8GB 5060 Ti is a hard sell before you even get to the endemic price bloat from AIB partners. But with a$299 MSRP, the 8GB RX 9060 XT is a different beast⁠—that is approaching a truly budget price. With so many gamers sticking to 1080p, and some of the biggest games in the world being less demanding \"esports\" picks like Marvel Rivals, or otherwise dark horse indie phenoms like Schedule One, REPO, and Palworld, the 9060 XT is shaping up to be an 8GB card that makes a good deal of sense, one on the more expensive side of \"budget.\" Azor's stance is in line with my personal gaming experience, too. I've been gaming on an 8GB Radeon RX 6600 for a couple of years now and have yet to run into performance issues, even running most of my games through a compatibility layer on Fedora Linux. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Most gamers don't need a top-of-the-line GPU, and for some time now, it's felt like all the buzz has been around Nvidia's prohibitively expensive 30, 40, and 5090 cards, while the sub-$350, 1080p set has had to settle for hand-me-downs and mediocrities. Those budget cards are not meant to be hooked up to high-end monitors, and the people who can afford a 1440p or 4K gaming monitor need to be realistic about the GPU they'll need to power it. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together There's no harm in offering budget-oriented GPUs for those who need that option. It serves to keep PC gaming more accessible for those who want to play less demanding games like Fortnite or Minecraft, or the treasure trove of fantastic indie and retro games on PC. If you're not in that crowd, there's always the 16GB version of the RX 9060 XT, along with plenty of other 12GB and 16GB cards.

Aside from combat barks and greetings, it was all walls of text in the '02 original. A truly wonderful, unexpected joy from this is hearing the poor VOs having to say Vvardenfell place names like \"Ashurnibibi.\" Do any Morrowind NPCs directly mention the nearby \"Ashalmimikala,\" or, even better, \"Addadshashanammu?\" God, I hope so. I also dig the way Skywind is blending both games' mechanics and user interfaces. The dialogue screen is a great combo of Skyrim and Morrowind, while I was chuffed to see the player whip out the Mark and Recall spells through Skyrim's favorites menu, dual wielded with a silver longsword. No fast travel here, only magic or taking theBug Bus. Ashurnibibi itself really impressed me visually: It felt like a culmination, a perfecting of the visual identity in Morrowind's original Daedric ruins, one of the strangest dungeon types Bethesda's ever made.

    "article_text": "The jury's still out on Alkahest. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As the self-appointed Fox Mulder of games about kicking goblins down flights of stairs, I want to believe thatfantasy hack 'n' slash Alkahestcan revive theunderappreciated swashbuckling brilliance of Dark Messiah: Might and Magic. The game debuted last year with a flashy announcement trailer that really sold me on the concept. But as reported by Andy last year, the trailer also attracted scepticism becauseit used a mixture of in-game assets and prerendered animations, with the developer acknowledging that \"some of the camera angles and animations have been crafted specifically for the trailer, for the sake of spectacle\". As Andy mentioned at the time, game trailers that are either wholly or partly pre-rendered are commonplace, especially in the early stages of a game's marketing. But developer Push On has since released a new teaser trailer that purportedly shows the game in action. Unfortunately, it looks very similar to the announcement trailer, which is causing another round of players to dismiss it as \"a cinematic disguised as gameplay\". The trailer, which is only a shade over forty seconds long, shows the player rushing toward a fortified structure partially built into a cliff-face, before hiding behind a shield that gets pierced by arrows. Sliding to close the last few yards, the player is launched into the air by a large crate landing on a cart he's standing on. Then, in midair, the player grabs a flying barrel and throws it into an enemy, before engaging in some slick sword-fighting with a couple of goblins. It's a flashy trailer, with virtually seamless combat animations and character transitions. But it's that seamlessness which has triggered the debate in the trailer's comments on YouTube. \"I hope people can recognize that this wasn't 'gameplay'. It's in-engine, and what was done might be what you can do in game, but this was preprogrammed. No one 'did' this with a controller. Still looks cool though,\" writes user TheTippsAttack. However, adarwinterdror7245 disagrees, saying \"the animations here look like gameplay animations with small slips and cuts typical when transitioning from one animation to the other\". Having now watched the trailer far too many times, I'm inclined to agree with adar. While the trailer is close to the quality of the original, with the midair barrel catch in particular making me question whether the animations were pre-rendered, the actual combat looks real-time to me. It isn't easy to tell, because there are a lot of canned animationswithinthe system, like the blade-lock between the player and the goblin. But the way the player slices at the goblin before sticking it with his sword, the movements between enemies, and the multiple kicks to the body he perform all seem like they're happening dynamically. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Putting aside these arguments, the abilities depicted in the trailer are hugely exciting. Your character appears to have an unseen archer sidekick who can be signalled to pepper enemies with arrows, which is a great way to dynamically create a sense of coordinated action. I'm also a big fan of the way your shield splinters and deforms under fire. I hope the kick has a touch more oomph in the final version though. I want to send those gobbos flying. In any case,I don't think this is a The Day Before situation, where all these flashy trailers are a front for a much lower-quality game. On top of my sense that the trailer is indeed gameplay, Alkahest has a publisher now—HypeTrain Digital—whose other signed games includeVoidtrain,Breathedge, and the upcomingPathologic 3. Alongside the combat, Alkahest's Steam page says it will feature an alchemy system, letting you craft magical potions and other concoctions. I hope one of these is a slippery ice throwable, as making orcs slide off cliffs was my second favourite thing to do in Dark Messiah after booting them into walls of spikes. There's no release date for Alkahest yet, but frankly, I'm happy for Push On to take as long as it needs to make this the spiritual successor Dark Messiah deserves. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Rick has been fascinated by PC gaming since he was seven years old, when he used to sneak into his dad's home office for covert sessions of Doom.

    "article_text": "Taken for a ride. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Helldivers 2's most recent update has put Super Earth in big trouble. A massive Illuminate invasion scythed straight through the outer planets belonging to humanity,striking right at the Heart of Democracy. Illuminate thralls stalk the streets while vast floating Leviathan creatures bombard brave Helldivers from below. In these dark times, Super Earth looks for a hero, one who will unite humanity in a shared cause and liberate Super Earth from the Illuminate menace. Indeed, the Helldivers await their equivalent of Dune's Lisan al-Gaib. And the good news is, they may just have found them. Over onr/Helldivers, the aptly named Helldivers 2 playerBeautiful-Injury7738 shared a videoof themselves riding one of the aforementioned Leviathans. Titled \"Leviathan Surfing\", the video depicts Beautiful-Injury standing atop a building, waving the flag of democracy as one of the giant creatures approaches, before using the game's recently added jetpack to hover over and land on the Leviathan's back. To be clear, you're not really supposed to do this, but Helldivers 2's commitment to mechanical consistency (and general disregard for Helldiver safety) means that you can. \"I spent longer than I would like to admit setting this up\", admits Beautiful-Injury. The video doesn't show the setup for the ride. But it's clear that Beautiful-Injury used the jetpack to summit one of the newly added skyscrapers that cover the surface of Super Earth. The trick appears to be finding a structure that is climbable while also being the appropriate height to safely land on the Leviathan's back. From there, it's a simple case of hanging on, which Beautiful-Injury manages for a full two minutes. This is trickier than it might sound, as while Leviathans don't actively try to throw you off, they do undulate while flying, making it easy to slide off and plummet to your death. On Reddit, the video immediately drew comparisons tothe sandworm-riding scene from last year's Dune: Part Two, with numerous fellow redditors declaring Beautiful-Injury to be Helldivers 2's very own Lisan al-Gaib. Sadly, our hero and saviour wasn't around for much longer. As the Leviathan drifted out of the combat zone, Beautiful-Injury was targeted by the anti-desertion artillery that prevents Helldivers from straying beyond the map, and ultimately blown to smithereens by the very people he was destined to lead. Honestly, you couldn't ask for a more fitting ending, and it's exactly what would have happened to Timothee Chalamet had Dune: Part Two been directed by Joel. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Meanwhile, the battle rumbles on. Harveydropped in to do his part for Super Earth a few days ago, and had a blast causing millions in property damage while attending a few ad-hoc Illuminate raves. The broader HD2 community, meanwhile,has fallen head over heels for the new NPC SEAF troops.

    "title": "Double Fine dev embarks on a quest to discover Full Throttle's true release date: 'Perhaps the best 30th birthday present I could give Full Throttle was a real birthday'",
    "article_text": "\"Our official anniversary date was simply impossible.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. LucasArts adventure gaming classicFull Throttlerecently celebrated its 30thbirthday. Exactlyhowrecently, you ask? Well, that's the question. During birthday preparations for Tim Schafer's beloved motorcycle odyssey, Schafer's studio Double Fine Productions realised it didn't know the precise date of Full Throttle's initial release. Consequently, Double Fine's Customer Support Specialist and amateur sleuth Peter Silk (which is a perfectdetective name, by the way) launched an investigation to discover the true release date. He detailed this enquiry in athoroughly engrossing article on the Double Fine website. Silk begins by outlining the problem, which is that, according to the Internet, Full Throttle has numerous original release dates. \"IMDb and the unofficial LucasArtsFandom.comsite both say April 30th, 1995. But then there are the ones that say April 20th, meanwhile Wikipedia says May 19th. Google likes to give any of these three answers, depending on how it feels on the day.\" Double Fine itself considers April 30, 1995 to be the release date. But Silk notes that there is no reliable source for this date, Moreover, April 30 landed on a Sunday in 1995, an unlikely day to release a game given shops were typically closed on Sundays in the nineties. Suspicious, Silk checked the files on the original release disc, and discovered they were still being modified as late as May 2nd, 1995, meaning the gamecould nothave been on shelves before that date. \"Our official anniversary date was simply impossible. So what’s the truth?\" Silk writes. \"Perhaps the best 30th birthday present I could give Full Throttle was arealbirthday.\" Silk's initial research took him to Scotland, or at least, an advert in Scottish newspaper The Daily Record from defunct high-street retailer Dixons. This advertised Full Throttle as available for £39.99 on Friday, May 19, 1995. It seems like a slam dunk. However, as Silk notes \"In the mid-90s it was extremely common for games to be released in Europe later than in the US, and stores frequently got dates wrong, because they weren't as widely known and communicated in the time before digital releases.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Silk then goes on to check \"every newspaper clipping in every country I could find,\" but none of them feature the game's actual release date. Even the full-page Full Throttle ad splashed across videogame magazines of the era didn't have the actual release date on it, instead stating \"Call 1800-STARWARS for availability\". Silk's investigation then hits a further snag, as he discovers that retailer CompUSA was expecting copies of Full Throttle as early as May 5th. But this delivery was delayed, with CompUSA not receiving copies until at least May 18. Given the delay, Silk theorises \"this might mean that the game didn't strictly have one street date, but that stores started selling it as and when they got their delayed copies delivered.\" In other words, Full Throttle's formal release date is elusive because it may never have had one in the first place. Unsatisfied with this answer, Silk comes up with an ingenious solution. Instead of looking for when the game started coming out in stores, he checks when players started asking for hints and tips for the game online. \"Before May 19th, 1995, nobody was asking forFull Throttlehints,\" Silk observes. \"However, after that date, they started to flood in.\" In their requests for assistance, these bewildered gamers help pinpoint May 19, 1995 as the day Full Throttle was properly released. \"Can it really be said that an adventure game truly exists in the hearts and minds of the public until that moment?\" Silk asks.

    "article_text": "OpenTESArena aims to make Bethesda's first Elder Scrolls more optimised and user friendly. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Confession time! I have never playedThe Elder Scrolls: Arena.I was the ripe old age of seven when it released, and my PC gaming debut was still several years away. I have toyed with the idea of going back to it. But I've always fretted it will simply be too crusty for me to properly enjoy. Even Morrowind, a game which I played and loved on launch, is a difficult adjustment in 2025, so the notion of grappling with a game two iterations older is a big hurdle to overcome. Yet retro gaming salvation may be at hand in the form of OpenTESArena. This is an \"open-source engine reimplementation\" for Bethesda's original Elder Scrolls game, one that aims to replace Arena's existing engine with bespoke tech that runs natively on Windows, Mac and Linux.As explained on the project's Github page:\"The goal is to replicate all aspects of the original game with a clean-room approach while making quality-of-life changes along the way.\" OpenTESArena has been in development for several years. But this week it released a major update.Primarily, the update integrates Jolt Physics, facilitating actions like climbing, jumping and swimming. Moreover, the update also adds hit registering, killable enemies, and item pickups, basically rounding out all the fundamental interactions you'd expect from a 3D, first-person RPG. The result, as you can see in the video above, is an Arena that looks like the original, but runs crisply at a high resolution and has smooth first-person controls. While I'm unsure if this is the plan for the final version, I'm also in favour of the HUD-less UI design. It instantly makes the game more approachable, removing a big icon-covered barrier to entry. It's worth noting that the underlying game is very barebones at this point, still lacking many key features like working enemy AI and functional RPG stats. There's also no sense of how much longer it will take to finish. Developer Afritz1 has been diligently plugging away at it for years. This makes me confident that they will see it through, but it seems likely that it will be another few years at least before that happens. The good news is there are plenty of other Elder Scrolls overhauls to keep you busy in the meantime.Daggerfall Unity successfully finishedporting Bethesda's second Elder Scrolls game to the Unity engine last year, while the series saw its biggest makeover yet with therecent release of Oblivion Remastered.Oblivion may well get a second remaster this year too, with Skyrim total conversion Skyblivion set to launch at some point in 2025. If the modders can stopgoing on dates with Bethesda, that is. The dream, of course, remains a proper remake of Morrowind, Bethesda's strangest and most interesting RPG.The Skywind project is still committed to rebuilding The Elder Scrolls 3in the Skyrim engine, but it has no set launch date.

    "article_text": "CD Projekt Red went from being an underdog to the biggest deal around, and that had consequences. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Witcher games are one of the clearest examples of improvement over a series in videogame history. No backsliding here: The Witcher was a mess, The Witcher 2 was genuinely quite decent, and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was a masterpiece.The Witcher 3's success put CD Projekt Red on Sony's speed-dial, but it had other consequences as well. To celebrate its 10th anniversary, all this week we're looking back on The Witcher 3—and looking ahead to its upcoming sequel, too.Keep checking backfor more features and retrospectives, as well as in-depth interviews with the developers who brought the game to life. \"It gave us confidence that we can deliver a truly ambitious and engrossing RPG of a big scale,\" says Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO and member of the board, speaking to PC Gamer's Joshua Wolens. \"And that we can punch above our weight and we can get head to head with the big ones. I remember, I was like, really, really afraid of the standard that Dragon Age: Inquisition's going to set,\" Nowakowski recalls. While the two did duke it out for RPG of the Year awards (\"I thought it was a fantastic game,\" Nowakowski says of the competitor), The Witcher 3 was such a smash it changed expectations atCD ProjektRed. \"That gave us confidence,\" Nowakowski says. \"Maybe in many ways even too much confidence looking back, to be honest, because I think that was the beginning of a bit of magical thinking for the company, which only stopped after Cyberpunk.\" Or as Adam Badowski, CD Projekt Red's other joint CEO and member of the board puts it, \"We turn from underdog to the company that is visible in the industry.\" The idea of magical thinking brings to mindBioWare magic, the idea that a troubled videogame will inevitably come together during the final stage of development because that's what happened last time. And while the concept's been torn apart repeatedly, it persisted because so many videogames do come together at the last moment. Even a classic likeThief: The Dark Project wasn't fun to play until it was almost finished. \"I do remember, for The Witcher 3 specifically, seeing a version of the game that was put together, I think it was like February, 2015?\" Nowakowski recalls. \"I remember I walked up to Adam and said, 'How are we in a good shape? Because that looks really not that great.' You know, like, 'Don't worry. We're gonna make the final push with the patch. That's gonna be a day-zero patch.' I remember talking to some of the key tech people, and they were tired—exhausted, to be honest—but it's OK. We're gonna make it happen. And they did. Of course there were a lot of patches afterwards, but the whole thing was like a force of nature. Lots of chaos, and a lot of final-moment efforts over there, without I think proper planning.\" The fact The Witcher 3 came together in that final push didn't help the way the studio thought about things. \"Everybody felt I think for a few moments that whenever something's going on, we're gonna have a magic fairy at the end that's gonna come down and sprinkle some dust, and things are gonna be OK,\" Nowakowski says. \"I'm of course exaggerating, but there is some truth in that. So that's a negative change. The positive change was that confidence, which I think helped us to build the ambition, which I still think is a big value of the company.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Cyberpunk 2077's development demonstrated both the benefits of ambition, and the risks of overconfidence. Even as the studio got bigger, Nowakowski says, \"A lot of things were developed in almost isolation, as weird as it may sound, so we sometimes didn't see the actual effects of how it actually interacts until it was put together.\" If those things developed in isolation don't magically come together, you end up with a game full of disconnected systems, and sidequests that feel like they don't mesh with the main questline. Which is to say, you end up with Cyberpunk 2077. The Witcher games were developed in a similar way, Nowakowski says, but the issues that resulted were easier to fix. \"It was probably never fine,\" he says, \"but it worked when the scope of the games were smaller. Like for Witcher 1 and 2. But I think at The Witcher 3, we could already hear the boat is creaking a little bit.\" Following the launch of Cyberpunk 2077, the studio worked to tear down that isolation. \"I don't want it to sound like it was all chaos, you know, burning cart on fire, because that would also not be true,\" Nowakowski says. \"We had great producers, and there was a lot of planning involved that made sense.\" But the processes at CD Projekt Red in need of addressing finally were, \"and that's a big change that happened after Cyberpunk.\" When you're spending$81 million to make a game like The Witcher 3, and$320 million on Cyberpunk 2077's launch version, you don't get to be the underdog any more. It can be hard to let go of the idea you're the upstart rebels disrupting an industry and approach work more responsibly, though. \"It was cool to be underdog,\" says Michał Platkow-Gilewski, VP of PR and communication. \"Yeah, it's sexier.\" The Witcher 4: What we know about Ciri's storyWitcher 3 mods: Good huntingThe Witcher books: Where to startWitcher 3 console commands: Cheat deathThe Witcher season 4: Hemsworth's debut Jody's first computer was a Commodore 64, so he remembers having to use a code wheel to play Pool of Radiance.

Make sure you take a look at our tips if you need a fresh angle on your daily guesses, or click your way to the May 25 (1436) answer whenever you need to win. Wow, what a turnaround. My opening row revealed one strong green letter, right in the middle. Great stuff—I had an anchor to build everything that came after around. My second attempt at a win gave me… nothing, really. Just four different grey letters around the same green. After that? A perfect winning row—just the thing for a Sunday morning. This is a way of illegally obtaining money or goods, although technically nothing's stolen in the traditional sense. This is more of a trick, a con. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. If you've decided to play Wordle but you're not sure where to start, I'll help set you on the path to your first winning streak. Make all your guesses count and become a Wordle winner with these quick tips: You're not racing against the clock so there's no reason to rush. In fact, it's not a bad idea to treat the game like a casual newspaper crossword and come back to it later if you're coming up blank.

Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer isn't likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Here are some recent Wordle answers: There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and you'll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong wordlike ALIVE—or any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you don't waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once you've typed your guess and hit Enter, you'll see which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first row—just don't forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and don't forget letters can repeat too (eg: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography.

FirstAvowed, thenOblivion Remastered—it's shaping up to be a banner year for fans of first-person RPGs and it's only getting better. Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon released last week, joining the year's clearly very rich crop of first person explore-and-slash gaming. Set in the dark fantasy world of Tainted Grail, inspired by Arthurian legends and set after the fall of Arthur's kingdom, The Fall of Avalon calls itself \"a love letter to open-world FPP RPGs.\" It's something like 50-70 hours long, and claims a branching narrative with proper voice-acted characters. PC Gamer's got a review of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon on the way. For now, user reviews are pretty positive: 87% positive of 4, 797 total on Steam as of press time. Interestingly enough it seems like Tainted Grail has a lot of character variety out there. The developers describe an alchemist-berserker, a blacksmith-mage-necromancer, and even that stalwart genre archetype the stealth archer as options. Always good to have options when the story branches, as the devs say this one does, across three distinct open world zones—the delight of replay is key to the genre, ain't it? In addition to the normal edition, The Fall of Avalon has a \"supporter\" edition that has an artbook, the soundtrack, an artbook, and—no joke—horse armor. Just likebig brother Oblivion! You can findTainted Grail: The Fall of Avalonon Steam for $45, though it has a demo to try first.

    "title": "Intel just greenlit a monstrous dual-GPU video card with 48GB of RAM just for AI - and here it is",
    "article_text": "Maxsun’s new 192GB GPU rig is real, and it might make Nvidia sweat on pricing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. At Computex 2025, Maxsun unveiled a striking new entry in the AI hardware space: theIntelArc Pro B60 Dual GPU, a graphics card pairing two 24GB B60 chips for a combined 48GB of memory. Servethehomeclaims Maxsun envisions these cards powering denseworkstationbuilds with up to four per system, yielding as much as 192GB of GPU memory in a desktop-class machine. This development appears to have Intel's implicit approval, suggesting the company is looking to gain traction in the AI GPU market. The Arc Pro B60 Dual GPU is not designed for gaming. Instead, it focuses on AI, graphics, and virtualization tasks, offering a power-efficient profile. Each card draws between 240W and 300W, keeping power and thermal demands within reach for standard workstation setups. Unlike some alternatives, this card uses a blower-style cooler rather than a passive solution, helping it remain compatible with conventional workstation designs. That matters for users who want high-end performance without building custom cases or cooling systems. Still, the architecture has trade-offs. The card relies on x8 PCIe lanes per GPU, bifurcated from a x16 connector. This simplifies design and installation but limits bandwidth compared to full x16 cards. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Each GPU also includes just one DisplayPort and one HDMI output. That design choice keeps multi-GPU setups manageable and avoids hitting OS-level limits, older Windows versions, for example, may have trouble handling more than 32 active display outputs in a single system. The card’s most intriguing feature may be its pricing. With single-GPU B60 cards reportedly starting around $375 MSRP, the dual-GPU version could land near $1,000. If that estimate holds, Maxsun’s card would represent a major shift in value. For comparison,Nvidia’s RTX 6000 Ada, with the same 48GB of VRAM, sells for over $5,500. Two of those cards can push costs north of $18,000. Even so, Intel’s performance in professional applications remains an open question. Many creative professionals still favor Nvidia for its mature drivers and better software optimization.

    "title": "Samsung’s prototype XR glasses hint at the future of smart frames, and I'm closer to all-in than ever before",
    "article_text": "It was a short, rushed demo, but a compelling one When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After many months of speculation, Google finally showed off its still-early-dayAndroid XR smart glasses prototype. It was an impressive live demo, with a live translation portion that went off well but not without hitches. Still, it got the crowd atGoogle I/Ogoing, and right after that opening keynote wrapped, I strolled around the Shoreline Amphitheater to find a pair to try. Much likemy time with Project Moohan, the prototype Android XR headset that Google andSamsungare working on, I only spent about five minutes with these prototype glasses. And no, it wasn’t a sleek frame made by Warby Parker or a wild one from Gentle Monsters – instead, it was the pair Google demoed on-stage, the prototype Android XR glasses made by Samsung. As you can see above, much likeMeta Ray-Bansand unlikeSnapchat Spectacles(the first gen), these prototypes look like standard black frames. They're a bit thicker on either the left or right stems, but they’re also loaded with tech – though not in a way that screams it from the outside. It was a short, pretty rushed demo, but certainly a compelling one. The tech here is mostly hidden – there is a screen baked into the lens, which, when worn, appears as a little box when it’s showing something larger. Otherwise, when I first turned the glasses on, I saw the time and the weather hovering at the top of my field of vision. When I pressed the button on the right stem to capture a photo, it almost flashed transparently larger in my field of vision. Neat and a bit more present way of capturing than on the screen-less Meta Ray-Bans. These are both cool, and during the keynote, Google also shared that the screens could be used for messaging, calls, and translating as well, but I didn’t get to try that. While I couldn’t ask for directions myself, a Google rep within my demo was able to toss up what navigation would like, and this feature has me more excited about smart glasses with a screen built-in. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Why? Well, it was that the experience of navigating doesn’t get in the way of my field of view – I can simply still look straight forward and see at the top that in 500-feet or 50-feet that I need to make a right onto a specific avenue. I don’t need to look down at my phone or glance at my wrist, it’s all housed in just one device. If I need more details or want to see my route, I could glance down to see a mini version of the map, which moved as I moved my head. If I wore these in NYC, I could walk normally and glance at the top to see directions, but when safely stopped and not in the way of others, I could look down to see my full route. That’s pretty neat to me. The projected screen itself had good-enough quality, though I’m not sure how it performs in direct sunlight, as I tested these in a little room that Google had constructed. It’s important to remember that this is still a prototype – Google has several brands onboard to produce these, but there isn’t an exact timeframe. Developers will be able to start developing and testing by the end of the year, though. This year, the Project Moohan headset, which also runs Android XR, will arrive. Samsung will ship the headset in a to-be-revealed final version, which could build support from third parties and let Google get more feedback on the platform. Gemini, Google’s very wise AI assistant, blew me away on Project Moohan and was equally compelling on the Android XR glasses. I asked it for the weather, and got it to give me an audio report of the next few days, had it analyze a replica of a painting, and even look at a book, tell me the reviews, and where I could purchase it. That power of having Gemini in my frame has me really excited for the future of the category – it’s the audio responses, the connection to the Google ecosystem, and how it plays with the onboard screen. It remains to be seen how Samsung’s final design might look, but it will likely sit alongside several other Android XR-powered smart glasses from the likes of Warby Parker, X-Real, and Gentle Monster, among others. I’ve long worn Meta Ray-Bans and enjoy those for snapping unique shots or recording POVs like walking my dog Rosie or riding an attraction at a Disney Park. Similarly, I really enjoyed the original version of the Snapchat Spectacles, but the appeal wore off. Those both did only a short – or in the case of the Spectacles, very short – list of functions, but Android XR as a platform feels a heck of a lot more powerful, even from a short five-minute window. While the design didn’t sell me on Samsung’s prototype, I have high hopes for the Warby Parker ones. Seeing how Gemini’s smarts can fit into such a small frame and how a screen can be genuinely useful but not overly distracting really has me excited. I have a feeling not all of the Android XR glasses will appeal to everyone, but with enough entries, I’m sure one of them will pair form with function in a correct balance. Gemini in glasses feels less like the future, and considering this new entry, my eyes are set tosee what Meta's does nextand whatApple's much-rumored entryinto the world of smart glasses will look like.

    "article_text": "Twopan Nano SSD packs 512GB of high-speed storage When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Twopan has launched the Nano SSD, a compact USB-C storage device with a built-in fingerprint reader, a feature we’d love to see more storage makers offer. Weighing just 5g and the size of a stick of gum, the Twopan Nano SSD measures 20 x 13 x 5mm and offers 512GB of high-speed storage in a keychain-friendly design. The product’s main appeal is, naturally, the biometric security it offers. The device supports up to 20 fingerprints and doesn't require apps or software. Twopan says plug it in and it just works. The Nano SSD connects via a USB-C 3.1 Gen 1 port and will work with devices like iPhone 15/16 Pro, MacBook Pro, iPad Air, Steam Deck, PS5, andCanonandSonycameras that support USB-C file transfer. It supports direct4Kand HD recording on the newest iPhone Pro models using HEVC (H.265) at 60fps, making it a good choice for content creators working in high-resolution formats. It is also compatible with Android phones fromSamsungand Google, offering wide usability without the need for adapters or extra cables. Twopan says it fits into phone cases that are 3mm thick or less, making it even easier to use on the go without removing protection. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Despite its tiny size, the Nano SSD delivers up to 450MB/s read and write speeds. It’s water and dust resistant with an IP65 rating and is drop-tested for up to 10 meters. The casing is made from aluminum and shockproof plastic, offering additional durability for users who travel or work outdoors.

    "title": "After Western Digital, Teamgroup introduces another PCIe Gen5 64TB SSD, and this one will almost certainly be a bargain",
    "article_text": "Solidigm and Western Digital get some serious competition in the large-capacity SSD race When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a market where storage capacities and speeds are constantly evolving to meet the needs of AI and cloud infrastructure, another player has stepped forward with a bold offering. TeamGroup has announced its entry into the 64TB SSD space with the T-CREATE MASTER Ai I5U U.2 PCIe 5.0 SSD, a high-capacity solid-state drive built with enterprise workloads in mind. This launch comes about a year after Western Digitalteased a similar PCIe Gen5 modelfor AI applications, and five years after Nimbus Data introduced the first 64TB SSD, theExaDrive NL series. Unlike consumer SSDs competing for a spot among thebest portable drives, TeamGroup’s latest entry is aimed squarely at enterprise environments. With support for the U.2 PCIe 5.0 interface and storage capacity maxing out at 64TB, the I5U is positioned as a tool for cloud-based databases and edge computing. According to TeamGroup, it is “designed specifically for cloud infrastructure and database applications” and optimized for the demands of “large language models” and intensive AI-driven workloads. PCIe Gen5 has become the benchmark for future-proof performance in both consumer and enterprise sectors, but claims such as “ultra-fast PCIe Gen5 speeds with enterprise-grade endurance” should be treated with caution. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Until third-party benchmarks emerge, it’s difficult to evaluate the drive’s real-world reliability and performance. Past efforts to identify thebest SSDs based purely on theoretical throughput have often ignored key factors like thermal performance, latency under load, and sustained write consistency, all of which are critical in large-scale deployments. TeamGroup’s entry also arrives amid a broader trend of high-capacity SSDs hitting the market. FromSolidigm’s 61.44TB D5-P5336toMicron’s 6.144TB 6550 Ion SSD, competition in the ultra-high-capacity segment is heating up. One element that remains unclear for TeamGroup’s I5U is pricing. Enterprise-grade drives at this scale rarely come cheap, but TeamGroup is known for value-oriented options. This raises speculation that its 64TB SSD might come closer to affordability than previous alternatives. While it's unlikely to ever replace thebest external HDDsin terms of raw cost per gigabyte, it signals that ultra-high-capacity SSDs are edging closer to broader adoption.

As spotted by tipster@tarunvats33(viaAndroid Central), a message sent through the Samsung Members app on Galaxy devices gives instructions for joining the One UI 8 beta program, suggesting it's going to be opened up in the near future. One UI 8 is Samsung's take onAndroid 16, and it makes sense for Samsung to try to get as close to Google's software update cycle as possible. Google has hinted at a June launch for Android 16, withrumors pointing toTuesday, June 3 as the big day. Samsung hasn't said anything officially about dates or availability, but it seems likely that theSamsung Galaxy S25series will be the first devices eligible to be signed up for the beta program, for those who want to try it ahead of the full release.

It's possible the feature will be part of the Samsung Health app, or a standalone app. Based on screenshots posted to social media, the coach uses the tracking capabilities of your phone or smartwatch to analyze your current running level, and then makes personalized recommendations about improvements. \"Running Coach uses 'level up' assessments to determine your fitness level and adjust your running program accordingly,\" one of the information screens says. \"This helps track your progress and keep the risk of injury low as you gradually improve your fitness.\" Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

However, I didn’t see CARD GAMES WITH FIRST LETTER CHANGED; kudos if you’re one of those clever people who did. ITEMS IN A LINEN CLOSET was easier to spot, although I had “white wash load” in my mind, as that’s when I tend to see them together rather than a designated area. I made my mistake with DIAMETRIC, thinking that POLAR didn’t fit. I took a stab in the dark with SLIP, thinking the group had something to do with evasion or trickery before seeing sense. How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

    "title": "Nespresso's pistachio vanilla coffee capsules are delicious over ice, and I can't stop drinking them",
    "article_text": "Nespresso's tastiest flavor yet? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Pistachio is the hottest flavor of 2025, and if you've walked past a high street coffee shop recently, you'll almost certainly have seen ads for green-tinted lattes in the window. The trend started last year, when pistachio-filledDubai chocolate(initially created to satisfy pregnancy cravings) began appearing in social media videos, and now Nespresso has got in on the act with a vanilla and pistachio-flavored coffee pod. I spotted the green and cream-coloredNespresso Vertuo Vanilla Pistachiocapsules on the Nespresso website a couple of weeks ago, and couldn't resist adding a pack to my order. So what are they like, and can they compete with the likes of Starbucks? First, a word on serving. Each Vertuo pod produces a double shot of flavored espresso, and is intended to be enjoyed as a long drink over ice. I wouldn't recommend drinking the shot straight – although it's based on sweet arabica beans that would probably be delicious alone, the natural vanilla and pistachio flavor is pretty powerful, allowing it to withstand being diluted. I inserted a pod into my trustyNespresso Vertuo Pop(one of thebest Nespresso machinesaround if you have a small kitchen), attached the drip tray platform to raise my measuring cup to the appropriate height, locked the lid and hit the brew button. A few seconds later, I had a sweet-smelling double espresso ready to be poured over a generous helping of ice. I'm fond of an iced latte, so I finished my drink with cold foam made using theDe'Longhi Primadonna Aromatic, which I'm currently testing. If you don't have a milk frother for your Nespresso machine, take a look at the Nespresso Aeroccino 4, which is a compact standalone device that can produce hot or cold foam using dairy or plant-based milk. I tried the Vanilla Pistachio Nespresso coffee as an iced caffe latte and an iced latte macchiato. Overall, I'd recommend the first option, as the potent flavor benefits from being combined thoroughly with the milk. There's no need to worry about watering down the taste. When you get the balance right, the result is one of the tastiest Nespresso drinks I've tried so far. Sometimes flavored coffees can have a bitter or artificial-tasting edge, but that's not the case here. With plenty of ice and cold milk, you get a refreshing and well-rounded flavor that's tasty but not excessively sweet. If you feel like something more dessert-like, Nespresso has a recipe for aniced pistachio vanilla oat latteusing the capsules, which includes marshmallows for extra indulgence. It's delicious, but I also picked up a pack ofNespresso's Coconut Vanilla podswith my order, so I'm interested to see how the two compare. These are also intended to be served cold over ice, but unlike the pistachio pods, they brew a long black coffee to be savored like cold brew. Will they be as refreshing? I'll find out soon.

    "title": "Acer targets $4,999 Apple Pro Display XDR with a more affordable alternative, and it even has a remote control",
    "article_text": "Smart Dial remote promises effortless control When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Acerhas introduced the ProCreator PE0, a high-endportable monitordesigned to compete with Apple’s $4,999 Pro Display XDR, but at what appears to be a more affordable price point. This supposedlybusiness monitorfeatures a 6K resolution panel (6016 × 3384), matching the specification ofApple’s Pro Display XDR. The display uses QD-OLEDtechnology, combining quantum dot and OLED features. It supports true 10-bit color depth, VESA DisplayHDR True Black 600 certification, and ultra-high contrast. Acer states that the PE0 is Calman Verified and factory-calibrated to Delta E <1, with support for 99% DCI-P3 and 99%AdobeRGB color gamuts. These are professional-grade metrics, making it a strong contender for users seeking thebest monitor for Mac Mini, particularly those working in photography or color grading. The panel also offers a 240Hz refresh rate and 0.01ms response time, specifications rarely found in professional monitors that prioritize image fidelity over speed. Acer promotes this as enabling “fluid motion” for creative tasks, though such specs are more commonly associated with gaming displays. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! The PE0 also supportsAMDFreeSync Premium Pro andNvidiaG-SYNC, which may help reduce screen tearing and improve visual stability during video playback. That said, concerns remain around OLED panel longevity and the potential for image retention, especially in static-use cases like photo editing or layout design. Real-world performance will ultimately depend on factors like long-term calibration stability and panel uniformity, areas where Apple’s Pro Display XDR has set a high bar. A standout feature of the PE0 is its built-in Smart Dial remote, which lets users adjust on-screen settings like brightness and volume without reaching behind the monitor. It also supports Acer’s Creator Hub software, MPP 2.0 tilt-enabled styluses, and touchscreen functionality. As of writing, the ProCreator PE0's price has not been announced. However, other models in the series - such as the PE320QXT, PE270XT, PE320QK X, and PE160WU - are priced at $1,999.99, $1,099.99, $1,499.99, and $599.99, respectively - so we'd expect the PE0 to follow a similar pricing structure.

    "article_text": "It's DJI rumor season When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. DJIis of course well established as making many of thebest dronesyou can currently buy, with theDJI Mavic 4 Prothe latest to be introduced earlier this month. Now new leaks suggest another three models are on the way very soon. First up is the DJI Mini 5 Pro, the successor to theDJI Mini 4 Prolaunched in September 2023. As spotted by@MauroTandoiandNotebookcheck, this new drone has been registered at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US – a required step for any electronics gadget that's going on sale there. It looks as though the sub-250 gram device is going to come with a bigger battery than the model it's replacing, while also offering faster charging speeds. Otherwise, this filing doesn't tell us much about the upgrades that are coming. There hasbeen speculationthat the DJI Mini 5 Pro would show up sometime in September – perhaps alongside a follow-up to theDJI Osmo Action 5 Pro– but FCC registration suggests the launch will actually come around sooner. 😉New Avata…#dji #avata3 pic.twitter.com/bdqM2xzdcGMay 23, 2025 Next up, well-known tipster@Quadro_News(again viaNotebookcheck) has posted a video of what seems to be the DJI Avata 3 being tested. This would replace theDJI Avata 2, which was launched back in April 2024. We're expecting to see a larger camera sensor on the upgraded version of this drone, and the video hints at a revised propeller design too. However, we don't get any footage of the device actually up in the air. Lastly for now, there's also a mention of the DJI Neo 2, replacing the originalDJI Neothat was introduced in September 2024. This is mentioned by tipster@OsitaLV, alongside the Avata 3 and the Mini 5 Pro – so there's a lot to look forward to. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. We don't have much to go off when it comes to launch dates for the DJI Avata 3 and the DJI Neo 2, though the drones they're succeeding aren't as old as the DJI Mini 4 Pro. That suggests these other two models may show up later in the year. Dave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

    "title": "AMD has a problem: Chinese vendor goes rogue and puts Ryzen AI CPUs in server racks instead of EPYC processors",
    "article_text": "MS-S1 Max is the AI rebel server AMD didn’t want, but might have to live with When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Minisforum has announced what it calls a game-changer for AI deployment in compact computing environments: the MS-S1 Max, a 2U rackmount system powered byAMD’s Ryzen AI Max+ 395. Minisforumsays this system is designed to \"revolutionize your AI workflow,\" but it marks an unusual departure from established norms. While its 3.2-liter form factor and all-in-one design are drawing praise for efficiency, the core configuration raises uncomfortable questions for AMD. Minisforum has opted not to use AMD’s EPYC processors, designed explicitly for server tasks, and instead fitted what is effectively a mobile-class chip into a server chassis. Although the MS-S1 Max is marketed as thebest SMB serverand even hints at broader enterprise ambitions, it’s difficult to ignore that this is a repurposing of hardware intended for a different context. The Ryzen AI Max+ 395 is not a server CPU by design. It’s optimized for client workloads, featuring integrated Radeon graphics and an AI NPU. What it offers, however, is a cost-effective and power-efficient solution for companies seeking local AI inference or the ability to run large models like DeepSeek 70B without the overhead of traditional infrastructure. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! That edge makes it appealing to universities, labs, and AI startups, but it also turns the system into a wildcard in AMD’s carefully managed product segmentation. This unconventional use could complicate AMD’s broader strategy. EPYC chips are built for reliability, scalability, and intensive server workloads, and they command higher margins. A surge ofmini PCmakers embedding consumer-grade Ryzen chips into rackmount systems might blur the line between consumer and enterprise offerings. Still, the MS-S1 Max’s value proposition is hard to ignore. By delivering strong on-chip graphics and directing substantial memory bandwidth to its GPU, it offers a local AI engine at a fraction of the cost of traditional server gear. That said, the catch lies in support, reliability, and long-term performance. Ryzen chips, while powerful, lack ECC memory support and validated server-grade features. This makes them a questionable fit for mission-critical deployments, and puts AMD in a tough position. If demand grows, AMD may be forced to either restrict such uses or embrace them, potentially undermining its EPYC business. Thismobile workstationis expected to launch in the second half of the year.

    "title": "Amazon tribe sues NYT over ‘porn addicts’ claim – media",
    "article_text": "A remote South American tribe has sued the New York Times, TMZ, and Yahoo for defamation following a series of stories alleging that the indigenous community devolved into porn addiction and other first-world social issues after receiving internet access,Courthouse News Service(CNS) has reported. The Marubo people live in around two dozen remote villages in the far west of Brazil’s Javari River Valley, with the entire tribe’s population estimated at about 2,000. In 2022, twenty Starlink satellite internet antennas were donated to the tribe, enabling easier communication between distant settlements and providing access to the broader internet. In 2024, a New York Times reporter and photographer visited the Marubo and later published an article describing teenagers as“glued to their phones”and“minors watching pornography.”Additional reports by TMZ and others, aggregated by Yahoo News, republished or reworded parts of the story and claimed the tribe had become“addicted”to sexually explicit content. On Tuesday, community leader Enoque Marubo and Brazilian activist Flora Dutra – who played a key role in connecting the tribe to the internet – filed a lawsuit in a Los Angeles court against the NYT, TMZ, and Yahoo News, accusing them of defamation and related offenses. “The New York Times portrayed the Marubo people as a community unable to handle basic exposure to the internet, highlighting allegations that their youth had become consumed by pornography shortly after receiving access,”CNS quoted the plaintiffs as saying. The statements were described as“inflammatory”and suggested that“the Marubo people had descended into moral and social decline.” The reporter and photographer were invited to stay in one of the villages for a week but left after less than two days –“barely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community,”the lawsuit claimed. The TMZ story, which included footage of Dutra delivering Starlink devices to the Marubo, allegedly led to her receiving death threats and the collapse of her co-founded startup, NAVI Global, which had once been valued at $3 million. The New York Times journalist later published a follow-up piece titled“No, a Remote Amazon Tribe Did Not Get Addicted to Porn.”The newspaper has since insisted that the original article never explicitly made such a claim. According to CNS, the Marubo people and Dutra are seeking $180 million in damages, including $100 million in punitive damages.",

    "title": "Europe will be ‘destroyed’ – Merkel",
    "article_text": "Tighter national migration and border control policies could spell doom for the European Union, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned, following Berlin’s recent move to curb the influx of asylum seekers. Merkel made the remarks at the ‘Southwestern Press Forum’ event in Neu-Ulm last week, where she appeared to present her memoir,Freedom. “I do not believe we can decisively combat illegal migration at the German-Austrian or German-Polish border… I have always advocated European solutions,”Merkel said when asked about the latest measures adopted by Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s cabinet. The new policies, introduced earlier this month by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, prohibit asylum applications at all German land borders – marking a sharp reversal of Merkel’s 2015 open-border stance. Exceptions are made for children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable individuals. According to Merkel, the move threatens both freedom of movement within the EU and the integrity of the Schengen zone, which allows visa-free travel across most of the bloc. She insisted that any immigration and travel reforms should be agreed upon at the EU level. “Otherwise, we could see Europe destroyed,”she warned. Merkel’s open-door policy in 2015 was met with fierce political backlash, with critics branding it“disastrous”after more than a million migrants were allowed into Germany during the peak of the 2015–16 refugee crisis. Germany remains the EU’s top destination for asylum seekers. In 2023, it received over 237,000 asylum applications – roughly a quarter of the bloc’s total, according to EUstatistics. Merz had pledged to tighten border controls during his campaign ahead of February’s snap elections, amid surging public support for the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD), known for its hardline anti-immigration stance. The AfD ultimately secured second place with 20.8% of the national vote but was excluded from coalition talks and government formation by mainstream parties. Earlier this month, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency (BfV) officially designated the AfD a“confirmed extremist entity.”The classification was temporarily suspended following legal challenges and mounting public backlash, but senior officials – including members of the ruling coalition – have continued to seek legal grounds to pursue a formal ban on the party. Earlier this week, German police warned that officers may only be able to enforce the new regulations for“a few more weeks”due to mounting pressure on personnel deployed at the borders. This comes despite the government deploying an additional 3,000 officers to support the 11,000 already stationed at key crossings.",

    "title": "German politician urges talks on restoring Nord Stream",
    "article_text": "Germany should consider adopting a“positive approach”toward Moscow that would including restoring the Nord Stream gas pipelines, Michael Kretschmer, the prime minister of the state of Saxony in eastern Germany, has argued. The current hostile policy has been unproductive and has only harmed Germany’s economy, the politician, who also serves as one of the deputy heads of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party, said in an interview with Die Zeit on Sunday. “Nord Stream is a possible opening for a conversation with Russia,”Kretschmer suggested, adding that such talks would benefit both nations. The German economy requires at least one-fifth of its gas supplies to come from Russia to function normally, he claimed. He also pointed out that various companies had begun relocating due to high production costs and energy prices. If the situation in the economy does not improve, Germany, not Russia, will have to“change [its] course in one or two years,”he warned. Kretschmer’s stance contrasts sharply with that of his party leader and federal chancellor, Friedrich Merz. Earlier this week, as part of a new sanctions push, Merz expressed support for an EU plan to ban any use of the Nord Stream gas pipelines and to block attempts to revive energy trade with Russia. The head of Saxony considers such an approach counterproductive.“As long as we say that we don’t want anything, we don’t want gas supplies, we only impose sanctions, no one will talk to us,”he argued. The Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipeline systems were built under the Baltic Sea to deliver Russian natural gas directly to Germany. Each system consisting of two pipelines was capable of delivering up to 55 billion cubic meters of gas a year. Three out of the pipelines' four lines were destroyed by underwater explosions in September 2022 in an act of sabotage that Russia believes was orchestrated by Western intelligence agencies. European gas prices surged after the Ukraine conflict escalated in 2022 as pipeline gas imports from Russia mostly ceased due to sanctions and the Nord Stream sabotage. In 2021, Russian pipeline gas accounted for 32% of the total demand of the EU and UK, while Germany relied on Russia for 55% of its consumption, according to the European Council.",

    "article_text": "A German association bringing together companies linked to electric car production has filed for bankruptcy, the newspaper Die Welt reported on Sunday, citing court data. The organization represents a total of 450 companies from various parts of the world, including Mitsubishi and Kia, and acts as a lobbying group for them. Founded 16 years ago, the German Federal eMobility Association (BEM) describes itself as a network of stakeholders along the entire electric car value chain and claims it is“actively driving the transition to a sustainable mobility and energy system based on renewable energy.” According to Die Welt, its members have a turnover of $114 billion and employ around a million people in total. It also reportedly has its own parliamentary advisory board. Now, the“struggling”association has been assigned a provisional insolvency administrator by the Berlin-Charlottenburg insolvency court, the daily reported. It did not elaborate on the reasons that prompted the association to take this step. A BEM board member, Markus Emmert, declined to comment on the matter in response to a request by Die Welt. Germany’s automotive sector has long been mired in stagnation. In March, Bosch, the world’s largest automotive supplier by revenue, announced additional job cuts potentially affecting thousands of employees. Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung attributed the decision to the sluggish global economy, the stagnating automotive sector, as well as increasing competition from China. The industry has also been seeing a slower than expected transition to electric vehicles, according to Hartung. Shutdowns and bankruptcies have also been affecting major German car manufacturers. In January, Reuters reported that Chinese car giants were eyeing Volkswagen factories in Germany that had been slated for closure. The previous government led by former Chancellor Olaf Scholz set a goal of having 15 million fully electric cars on Germany’s roads by 2030. However, according to the Federal Motor Transport Authority, as of January 1, only 1.6 million such vehicles were registered, accounting for just 3.3% of the nation’s passenger car fleet. Electric car sales collapsed after Scholz’s cabinet decided to end government subsidies for EV purchases following the budget crisis in 2023. Earlier this year, Handelsblatt Research Institute (HRI) warned that the German economy is on track for its longest post-war recession. A third consecutive year of contraction is projected for 2025.",

    "title": "US de facto financing persecution of Christians in Ukraine – Tucker Carlson",
    "article_text": "The US is essentially facilitating the persecution of Christians in Ukraine by supporting the Kiev government, which has been waging a purge campaign against the nation’s canonical Orthodox church, American journalist Tucker Carlson has said. Carlson made the statement during an interview with a former Ukrainian MP, Vadim Novinsky, released on Friday. “Every day, churches and temples are seized by soldiers with machine guns who come in, throw out priests, beat believers, children, old people, women…”the former lawmaker stated, adding that“it is happening all over Ukraine.” “I think very few Americans understand the degree to which the Ukrainian government under [Vladimir] Zelensky has persecuted the Ukrainian Orthodox Church,”Carlson said. The former Fox News host then asked Novinsky what he would like to say to the American lawmakers who have nevertheless approved financial aid to Kiev.“The Speaker of the House of the United States Congress is a man who describes himself as a Christian and he has been paying for this,”the journalist said, referring to Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican. The former Ukrainian MP replied that he would like to see the US aid going directly to ordinary Ukrainians and not the authorities, who“live in parallel realities.” US government agencies appropriated a total of $182.8 billion on various forms of assistance to Kiev between 2022 and the end of 2024, according to Ukraine Oversight, an official portal that tracks such expenditures. Last week, US President Donald Trump stated he was concerned that billions of dollars were being wasted on aid to Ukraine. He said Congress was“very upset about it”and that lawmakers were asking where all the money was going. Kiev has accused the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) of maintaining ties to Russia even though it declared independence from the Moscow Patriarchate in May 2022. The crackdown has included numerous arrests of clergymen and church raids, one of the most notorious of which took place in the catacombs of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, where holy relics are kept. Last year, Zelensky signed legislation allowing the state to ban religious organizations affiliated with governments that Kiev deems“aggressors,”effectively targeting the UOC. Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Moscow would not abandon the Orthodox believers in Ukraine and vowed to make sure that“their lawful rights are respected.”",

    "title": "The idea of ‘Eurasia’ is much more viable than ‘Europe’ – here’s why",
    "article_text": "For a Eurasian state, total isolation from Western Europe is not only undesirable, it is likely impossible. For those genuinely committed to the project of a cooperative and developmental Eurasian space, the key political challenge is finding a way to manage external influences – chiefly from the NATO bloc in Europe and North America – that cannot be eliminated, even in theory. The task ahead is to mitigate the risks posed by these actors, while extracting whatever limited benefits can be found in their inevitable presence, all without allowing external pressure to provoke internal splits within Eurasia. Even as Russia strengthens its cooperation with partners to the south and east, the enduring economic and technological capacities of the EU and the US cannot be ignored. History demonstrates that relatively closed zones of cooperation emerge only under two conditions: either through total external opposition, or under the hegemony of a dominant power willing to bear the costs of leadership. Neither of these applies to Greater Eurasia. First, the states of Eurasia have no interest in detaching themselves from the global economy. Second, there is no Eurasian hegemon prepared to sacrifice its own development to dominate the continent. Third, no one is suggesting Eurasia should become an isolated bloc. The US, EU, and key Middle Eastern states will continue to play important roles in the global economy. Regardless of political hostilities, they still provide market access, technology, and trade. Some see the EU as a model of regional self-containment – a“garden,”to quote one of its more misguided recent metaphors. But even Western Europe’s famed unity has relied heavily on continued openness to the US and, to a lesser degree, China. Only with respect to Russia and the Global South has the EU pursued genuine exclusion. Even then, the strategy remains incomplete and largely rhetorical. The West’s attempt to encircle itself with legal and institutional“fences”has created a fragile enclosure, but one constantly tested by global realities. Meanwhile, Russia and its partners have been left outside this structure, prompting renewed thinking about the viability of an open Eurasia as an alternative. Could Eurasia construct a self-sufficient development community? Theoretically, yes. But unlike Europe after World War II, Eurasia lacks a single leader prepared to organise such an effort. The United States attempted something similar with its global leadership in the second half of the 20th century, but even Washington now appears exhausted by the effort. American voters have repeatedly signaled their preference for reducing overseas commitments. China, while economically formidable, is unlikely to assume a leadership role in Eurasia. Its political culture does not favour hegemonic ambitions abroad, and the risks of taking responsibility for a region this vast would likely outweigh any conceivable gains. Moreover, Russia, China, and India are roughly comparable in power and have no appetite for a zero-sum struggle to dominate the continent. The success of BRICS and the SCO underscores this reality: mutual respect, not dominance, is the basis of Eurasian cooperation. Instead of trying to copy the Western European model or isolate themselves from the West entirely, Eurasian states should seek to engage the global economy pragmatically. Sanctions against Russia, even those of unprecedented scale, have not dismantled international trade. The global economy has proved remarkably resilient. Middle-sized and smaller countries require open markets to grow; major powers like Russia, China, and India need them to deploy their immense logistical and industrial capacities. It would be unrealistic – and counterproductive – for Eurasian powers to sever links with the world economy. The real goal should be to neutralise the political toxicity of Western Europe and the United States, while ensuring that their presence does not fracture Eurasian unity. This requires careful coordination, strategic patience, and shared vision among like-minded partners. If the objective is to prevent the leading Western European countries from hindering the development of Russia and its partners, then the strategy must be subtle. Direct confrontation or blanket isolationism won’t work. The EU cannot be eliminated from the equation, and the US will remain a global factor for the foreseeable future. The question is not how to remove them entirely, but how to reduce their negative influence and prevent external powers from sowing discord within Eurasia. The path forward lies in building a resilient, open Eurasian platform that can absorb external shocks without disintegrating. It should engage globally, but on its own terms. This is not a utopian vision – it is a practical necessity. This article was first published byValdai Discussion Club, translated and edited by the RT team.",

    "title": "Trump’s tariff threat could cost Germany €200 billion – study",
    "article_text": "The German economy could lose up to €200 billion by the end of 2028 if tariffs of 50% remain in place until the end of US President Donald Trump’s term in office, according to a German Economic Institute (IW) report published on Friday. The US is Germany’s main trading partner, with total goods exchange valued at €253 billion ($287 billion) in 2024, according to official data. At €17.7 billion, Germany’s export surplus in the trade of goods with the US was the highest among all of its trading partners in the first quarter of 2025. The Federal Statistical Office also reported that exports to the US exceeded imports by almost 75%. From 2025 to 2028, German economic output would on average be 1.1% lower than without the increased tariffs, the IW report said. If the EU retaliates with similar countermeasures, the total damage could increase to €250 billion by 2028. In a post on Truth Social on Friday, Trump claimed that the EU was originally formed“for the primary purpose of taking advantage of the US on trade.”He went on to say that the bloc is“very difficult to deal with.” He accused the EU of imposing harmful economic policies, taxes, and regulations, as well as launching“unfair and unjustified lawsuits against American companies,”which he said have contributed to a“totally unacceptable”trade deficit. According to the US Trade Representative’s office, the deficit currently stands at around $240 billion per year. Trump went on to announce that, due to stalled negotiations, he is recommending a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU, effective June 1, 2025. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed the criticism later that day on Fox News, saying he believes the president views the EU’s proposals as falling short of the standards set by other major trading partners. “I’m not going to negotiate on TV, but I hope this serves as a wake-up call for the EU,”he said. The EU is committed to securing a trade agreement with the US based on mutual respect rather than threats, EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic wrote on X on Friday. He added that“EU-US trade is unmatched and must be guided by mutual respect,”but that the bloc is ready to defend its interests.",

    "title": "Western Europe considers buying US arms for Ukraine – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "Western European leaders are looking into the possibility of purchasing American weapons and giving them to Ukraine once the arms transfers approved by the previous administration of US President Joe Biden run out, Bloomberg has reported on Saturday. US President Donald Trump reiterated earlier this week that Washington could“walk away”from the Ukraine conflict if the American-brokered talks between Moscow and Kiev do not deliver any meaningful results.“This is a European situation. It should have remained a European situation,”he said. A proposal to buy arms from the US for Ukraine so that it could continue fighting Russia is currently“gaining more credence”in the EU and UK amid concerns that American deliveries would cease in summer, Bloomberg reports. “The idea is that if Trump refuses to send US weapons to Ukraine, Europe will,”people familiar with the matter explained to the agency. The heads of the European NATO member-states believe that if they will also be able to persuade Trump to continue providing intelligence to Kiev then“Vladimir Zelensky may be able to hang on,”the sources said. Earlier this month, French President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged that France had reached the limits of its capacity to supply domestically-produced weapons to Ukraine.“We cannot give what we do not have, and we cannot pluck our own army. We gave everything we could, tripled production,”he stated. In March 2024, then-Vice President of the European Commission Josep Borrell described the strain on the EU’s weapons stockpiles, noting that after two years of military support to Kiev,“existing stocks are depleted and the conflict has evolved from a war of stocks to a war of production.”He also pointed out that the European defense industry meets only around 40% of its own needs, meaning that member states import the majority of their military equipment. Since returning to office in January 2025, President Trump has not announced any new US-funded military aid packages to Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly warned that Western arms deliveries to Ukraine will not stop its military objectives but will prolong the conflict and raise the risk of NATO confrontation. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov earlier said the Trump administration“wants peace,”unlike Western Europe, which seeks to prolong the fighting. On Saturday, the Foreign Ministry reaffirmed Moscow’s commitment to a peaceful resolution despite increased Ukrainian drone strikes.",

    "title": "Biden appears in public after cancer diagnosis announcement (VIDEO)",
    "article_text": "Former US President Joe Biden has made his first public appearance since revealing he has stage 4 prostate cancer. His office confirmed on May 18 that the 82-year-old was diagnosed with an aggressive, hormone-sensitive prostate cancer that spread to his bones. Speaking to reporters at Bradley International Airport in Connecticut on Friday, where he attended his grandson’s graduation, Biden said he was“feeling great”despite the diagnosis. The former president was accompanied by former First Lady Jill Biden. Medical experts have questioned how such advanced cancer had gone unnoticed, noting that a Gleason score of 9 is typically caught through routine screening. A Biden spokesperson said on Tuesday that the former president had not been tested for the illness in over a decade, adding that his last known PSA test was in 2014 and that he had never received a prostate cancer diagnosis before last week. A post shared by WTNH News 8 (@wtnh8) President Donald Trump claimed Biden’s aides used his condition to push unauthorized policies, calling it“treason at the highest level.”Vice President J.D. Vance questioned whether Biden was capable of leading.“I don’t think he was able to do a good job for the American people,”he said. Republican Senators Ron Johnson and John Cornyn have called for investigations into whether Biden’s condition was concealed while he was in office. Johnson told Axios that he plans to seek testimony from a“couple dozen people”who had or should have“direct contact”with Biden. Cornyn released a letter to US Attorney General Pam Bondi calling for an investigation into whether the public was deliberately misled. The disclosure comes as a new book, ‘Original Sin’, alleges that Biden’s staff concealed signs of mental decline during his presidency. The report has renewed criticism of his decision to run in 2024, before he withdrew following a poor debate performance. The former president has denied claims that he suffered from mental decline, saying:“there’s nothing to sustain that.”Separately, following the Democratic Party’s defeat in the 2024 presidential election, Biden said he could have won the election had he remained in the race.",

    "title": "Romanian presidential candidate calls for protests without Ukraine-style ‘bloodbath’",
    "article_text": "Romanian presidential candidate George Simion has called on supporters to engage in peaceful protest against what he claims was a fraudulent election, warning that the country narrowly avoided a“bloodbath”caused by“demonic plans”allegedly orchestrated by his Western-backed political opponents. The conservative EU critic lost a run-off vote last Sunday to pro-Brussels Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan by a single-digit margin. Simion has contested the outcome, alleging“external interferences by state and non-state actors,”but Romania’s Constitutional Court rejected his petition. In a video message to supportersstreamedon social media Friday night, the leader of the Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) described Dan as a“puppet of France”who won the election through manipulation and fearmongering after“mobilizing the entire Soros network, all the NGOs”to undermine his campaign. “This fight is not lost,”Simion told supporters, claiming that“the right of Romanians to take to the streets”must be exercised – while stressing that any demonstrations must remain peaceful. “Make it peaceful. I will say this every time, because they want to put us in prison,”he said, alleging that his political opponents were attempting to provoke violence in order to justify a crackdown on the opposition. “That’s what they wanted on election night,”he said, claiming that the opposing camp planned to manipulate his supporters into a“bloodbath”akin to Ukraine’s 2014 coup – and allegedly had“some people who participated in the Euromaidan in Kiev.” They had the crowd prepared – to have Romanians turn against each other again and for a civil war to erupt in Romania. “Bloodbath. This was bound to happen. We were supposed to take to the streets… And I am glad about the decision made to avoid bloodshed. We were one step away from the country being torn apart due to the demonic plans they had,”he added. Simion said he has stayed away from protests and would continue to do so to avoid escalating tensions, but urged supporters to“fight in the name of truth, democracy, freedom, peace, and in the name of God.” “We are not getting anywhere. I advise you to join the AUR party or another sovereignist party, to participate with organizations, unions, your civic groups to hold protests, get involved, take to the streets, and demonstrate. Fight for Romania, because they are truly afraid of us,”he said. The contested election followed the annulment of the previous vote, in which independent candidate Calin Georgescu led the first round with 23% of the vote. Romania’s Constitutional Court overturned the results, citing electoral irregularities and allegations of foreign interference – including claims of Russian involvement, which Moscow has denied. The Kremlin described Romania’s election as“strange, at the very least,”noting that the declared winner did not secure victory until the second attempt, after the frontrunner was disqualified. Telegram founder Pavel Durov claimed on Sunday that Nicolas Lerner, the head of French foreign intelligence, personally urged him to censor conservative voices on the platform ahead of the election.",

    "title": "Trump extends EU tariff deadline until Jul 9",
    "article_text": "World World US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One as he departs for New Jersey, at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on May 23, 2025. (Photo: Reuters/Nathan Howard) MORRISTOWN, New Jersey: United States President Donald Trump said on Sunday (May 25) that he would pause histhreatened 50 per cent tariffson the European Union until Jul 9, after a \"very nice call\" with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. Trump had threatened on Friday to invoke the steep tariffs as soon as Jun 1, saying talks with the EU over his previous levies were \"going nowhere\". Von der Leyen \"just called me ... and she asked for an extension on the Jun 1st date, and she said she wants to get down to serious negotiation\", Trump told reporters before boarding Air Force One in Morristown, New Jersey. \"And I agreed to do that,\" he added. Von der Leyen had earlier said on X that she held a \"good call\" with Trump, but that \"to reach a good deal, we would need the time until Jul 9\". \"Europe is ready to advance talks swiftly and decisively,\" said the president of the European Commission, which conducts trade policy for the 27-nation bloc. Brussels and Washington have been negotiating in a bid to avert an all-out transatlantic trade war, and had agreed to suspend tariff action on both sides until July. But Trump's threat on Friday dramatically raised the stakes. The US leader said on Friday he was \"not looking for a deal\" with the EU, repeating his oft-stated view that the bloc was created to \"take advantage\" of the US. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil separately on Sunday called for \"serious negotiations\" with Washington, saying he had spoken with his US counterpart Scott Bessent about the matter. \"We don't need any further provocations, but serious negotiations,\" Klingbeil, who is also Germany's vice chancellor, told Bild newspaper. \"The US tariffs endanger the US economy just as much as the German and European economy,\" Klingbeil warned. Trump has hit the bloc with three sets of tariffs: 25 per cent on steel and aluminium and on automobiles, followed by a 20 per cent \"reciprocal\" levy on all imports - which has been suspended pending talks, though a baseline 10 per cent remains in force. The EU's trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, who held talks with his US counterparts on Friday, responded to Trump's latest outburst by saying the bloc was \"committed to securing a deal\" but that trade ties should be based on \"mutual respect, not threats\". Brussels has announced plans to hit US goods worth nearly €100 billion (US$113 billion) with tariffs if negotiations fail to produce a deal. The US trade deficit in goods with the EU was US$236 billion in 2024. But when taking account of services, where American firms are dominant, the European Commission calculates that the US trade deficit stood at €50 billion.

    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts If a task takes less than a minute, do it immediately. Clearing small items right away helps prevent mental clutter and gives you a quick win for your workday, says our guest. Looking for a job or trying to nail it at your current one? Host Tiffany Ang and career counsellor Gerald Tan help navigate your important - and sometimes thorny - work life questions. Unresolved tasks can quietly build up, creating mental clutter that affects focus and well-being. CNA TODAY journalist Amanda Yeap shares what she has learnt about the science behind the Zeigarnik Effect and practical tips on how to regain control over your work life. Here is an excerpt from the conversation: Tiffany Ang, host:We talked about writing lists. I think that has been very helpful for me, because I almost “list-dump\" my thoughts out of my head. I have an ideas list, I have a task list. Basically, the idea is that I just want my brain to be as free as possible. Besides lists, are there any other ways that we can use to cope with the Zeigarnik Effect? Amanda Yeap, CNA TODAY journalist:One expert broke it down like this. When it's all in your mind, you just feel, “Oh no, there are so many things.” Tiffany:Yeah, that is good point. I always thought that if it's on the list, it needs to be done. But it doesn't have to be ... Amanda:So throwing it out, outsourcing, asking for help or delegating (tasks), or even just doing it. At least you’ve already kickstarted the process. Maybe some tasks are so huge that it's impossible to get them done in a single step. Tiffany:That's why breaking it down into different steps helps, right? Because you know, “Okay, at least I have completed two out of three steps, and the last step is just this.” And I can maybe move (other tasks) to the next month, or I can do this tomorrow. I don't have to do it today, but at least you kind of break it down and set goals. Otherwise, you get caught in this incessant loop of, “Oh my goodness, am I in a matrix? It’s coming back!” Amanda:Yeah, it's actually quite common that some tabs are just there in your mind, but you don't act on them, or you just procrastinate, even though it would do you some good to get the task done. To trick yourself into doing that, really, is to just start that first step ... There's also something interesting, it's called the One-Minute Rule. This will be relatable when you're breaking down a huge task into different steps to take. So if a task takes under a minute to complete, do it immediately. This will help close small loops and prevent build up. Listen to more episodeshere. A new episode of Work It drops every Monday.

    "title": "Ways for women: 7 job interview tips every stay-at-home mum needs to know before going back to work",
    "article_text": "Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Entertainment Women Women Women People Women Wellness Wellness Wellness Experiences Living Living People Style & Beauty Style & Beauty Obsessions Style & Beauty Dining Experiences Dining Dining Travel Travel Experiences Travel Women Women Getting through a job interview successfully could be a big hurdle for stay-at-home mums rejoining the workforce. Here’s how to display confidence, project professionalism and sell yourself, in this instalment of the Ways for Women series, featuring tips for women to navigate life, relationships and health. The right preparation will help you zone in on what you need to do to ace a job interview – even if you’ve been out of the job market for a period. (Art: Jasper Loh) This audio is generated by an AI tool. Once you’ve made the decision to go back to work after being astay-at-home-mum (SAHM), it’s time to get busy with job applications. It’s normal to be nervous about taking this big step, regardless of how long you’ve been out of the workforce. You might be keen to get back to full-time work but the key is not to rush into anything. This phase involves a lot more than just applying for jobs, going for interviews and accepting the first or best offer. “Too often, women returning to work jump right back in,” said Sher-li Torrey,founderand director ofMums@WorkSingapore, a career portal that provides working mums with support, assistance and advice. “Take a step back – write down the reasons why you want to go back to work, list what you have to offer a company as well as what you have learned or how you have grown during your career break. “When you know yourself well, you tend to be more confident when questioned in an interview setting,” she added. Once you’re ready to face the professional world once again,concentrate on the job interviews. The right preparation will help you zone in on what you need to do to ace it. It sounds simple enough agreeing to an interview then showing up for it but there are several things you should know beforehand. Find out if the interview will be conducted in-person or online and add it to your calendar. You’re a busy mum, so this will ensure you don’t double book and that you have childcare arrangements sorted in advance. Give yourself a buffer for the interview to run late so that you won’t have to leave the meeting early to pick up your child or run an important errand, for example. Find out if it’s a one-on-one session or if you’ll be facing a panel. Or is it just a chat with someone from the human resources department or will you be speaking with your potential boss? If your interview is going to be over the phone or via a weblink, make sure you get out of mum mode for that duration. Figure out which part of the house will give you the most peace and quiet to get into a professional headspace for the interview. Finding out all you can about the company you’ll be interviewing with is probably the most important step in your prep. Torrey advised that you know as much as you can before your interview. “Read up on the corporate website and the less formal sites such as Quora, Glassdoor and, of course,LinkedIn,” she said. “If you have friends or acquaintances in the company, ask them about the work culture and also the team you’ll potentially be joining.” The company aside, take the time to find out more about your job role and what is required of you. This ensures there are no doubts about your responsibilities and you’ll be able to think about how your skills can match this job as you prepare your answers. Torrey suggested meeting with friends or ex-colleagues who are currently working in your industry. This is so you can get updated on what has changed since you were last in the workforce. “Ask them for advice on what’s happening in the industry and find out what skills tend to be preferred,” she said. “Having people you are comfortable with share knowledge you should know helps make you feel less fearful of taking the next step.” If your industry has online boards, get onto them to find out if there are any new technologies you need to know or any changes in corporate culture. Being able to answer interview questions confidently is not natural to most of us, said Torrey. Therefore, in a stressful situation like a job interview, we need to be prepared with our answers – “having some mock interview practice definitely helps”. Prepare what you’ll say for standard interview questions, such as what are your strengths and weaknesses, why do you want this job and what can you bring to this job. Jot down things about yourself you really want to get across, such as your skills and how they can be applied to scenarios that may pop up in your job scope. Also, you might think it will come naturally to you but you should include simple things like practising smiling and making eye contact. Use a mirror or take videos of yourself doing mock interviews then pay attention to your body language when you rewatch them. Being nervous could make you forget to smile or you might be over-compensating by smiling too much. You could also simply be out of practice when it comes to communicating professionally so these small touches will help. And, if it’s a phone interview, remember to smile as you talk even though the interviewer won’t be able to see you. Your voice will certainly come across as more friendly this way. From her experience atMums@WorkSingapore, Torrey said managers are most concerned about “relevancy and balance” when it comes to hiring back-to-work mums. “How up-to-date are her skills? How well can she cope with new working environments, such as hybrid versus full-time office roles? How technologically savvy is she? “They’ll also ask if she has figured out how she willbalance her time between work and family, as well as how ready and supportive her family is in partnering her journey back to work,” she added. Your interviewer would already be aware of your career break as it would be in your resume so rather than saying, “I had a career break”,  focus on what you did during this break to up-skill and focus your conversation around your potential. “Often, experienced hires talk about how much experience they have in particular skills but this can be a challenge for those with a career break,” said Torrey. “So speak in ‘potential terms’ – much like how fresh graduates would advocate for themselves in a job interview.” Torrey added that employers look for attitude, rather than playing down the fact that you did stop work for some time. So highlight what you are going to bring to the table going forward. It might seem like a trivial issue but the truth is, you need to look professional in this interview. How you dress largelydepends on your industry and type of company. Your outfit can range from business casual to business formal but Torrey points out that the rule of thumb is: “You don’t get penalised for over-dressing but you can get some biased opinions from under-dressing”. You should project two levels of confidence – about your decision to be astay-at-home mumand your professional qualifications. You need to show your potential employer that you can do the job. Tell them how you’ve been keeping up with your industry’s advancements, mention if you’ve done volunteer work or attended networking events. Finally, don’t be afraid to ask questions. Find out about professional development opportunities, ask about working styles, what a typical day is like for a person in that position or what are the career prospects for someone in this job. Anything relevant to the job that isn’t in the job ad is fair game here. It shows you’re interested in the job and gives you the information you need to decide if it’s really the one for you.

It's a man singing a folk song, like the ones that Lionel grew up with. He soon finds himself standing over the man, who has handsome curls and cheekbones, and is somewhat abrupt. His name is David (Josh O'Connor). Little do either of them know that this moment will alter the trajectory of their lives. The History of Sound, the new film fromLivingandMoffiedirector Oliver Hermanus which just premiered at theCannes Film Festival, concerns the forbidden love that blossoms between the two men thereafter. As that fateful night goes on, they bond over their shared affection for the folk standards. Lionel, who describes an ability to “taste” and “see” music, and so presumably has a form of synesthesia, feels it strongest. They drink and sing into the early hours of the morning, before stumbling out into the street. Eventually, they find themselves in David's unshowy apartment, where they have sex. Their secretive relationship continues on-and-off over the following years, chiefly interrupted when David is called up to serve in World War I. He later disappears entirely; across the second half of the film, Lionel is left to pick up the pieces, traveling Europe as a means of escape, but also to find purpose, leveraging his musical talents to sing in Italy and teach in England. It makes for a surprisingly challenging watch, much more cold and reserved than you might expect of a period gay romance, not least one revolving around the age-old tragic trope of star-crossed lovers. Nevertheless, Mescal and O'Connor do admirable work to elevate the material; the latter has a knack for conveying the subtlest of emotions with a split-second glance or the flicker of an eyelash. They are intimate, and there are intimate scenes, but Hermanus largely opts to spare the details. The most we see is the silhouette of a backside, or bodies interwoven under the covers. It's a choice that will probably strike some as controversial. There has been a push, in recent years,for queer cinema to be more sexually authentic—and, in tandem with that desire for raw honesty, sexually explicit. Conversely,The History of Soundmakes the divisively tameCall Me by Your Nameseem positively pornographic. (The horniest moment in the film comesbeforetheir first sexual encounter, when David spits a stream of water onto Lionel's tongue, and into his mouth.) The online debate as to whether sex scenes are “necessary” has now gone on for what feels like an age—as tediously as an unsatisfying hookup that refuses to reach its climax—but at least, in this case, they would add a bit of warmth to a film that could do with it. Nonetheless, whenThe History of Sounddoes stop holding you at arm's length, it becomes much more poignant, particularly when it leans into its core themes of lost love, past regrets, and the roads not travelled. Though not the most novel concerns in a film about queer love in a homophobic world, you'd need a cold heart not to be at least a little moved. Interestingly, the biggest emotional wallop comes in the film's epilogue, when we revisit Lionel as an aging music master in the 1980s, now played byAdaptation's Chris Cooper. Without spoiling anything, it's a cathartic conclusion that reminds us of another, universal truth: you never forget your first love. This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "title": "These Rare Nike Kobe Sneakers Are a Mashup of Other Rare Nike Kobe Sneakers",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you’ve ever had trouble deciding what sneaker colorway to lace up before walking out the door, the Nike ‘What The?’ series is for you. It has its origins in the legendarySB Dunk line, dating back to 2007. Dunks had been running the table on the sneaker industry for about five years at that stage, with a number of legendary colorways dropping in a frantic flurry of creativity. The premise of the‘What the Dunk?’ editionwas simple: stitch together bits and pieces of some of the most iconic prior Dunk makeups, including theStaple PigeonsandHUFs, into a hectic hodgepodge. What should have been ugly as sin turned out to be a gift sent from sneaker heaven. The ‘What The?’ concept took a five-year hiatus after lightning first struck. But in 2012, the idea made its way tothe Kobe line, then on its seventh iteration under the Swoosh. It was an instant hit and soon became a staple of Nike basketball, becoming a regular installment in Kobe, LeBron, and Kevin Durant’s signature lines. It peaked with the Kobe 9, already an iconic basketball silhouette in and of itself. Featuring a pronounced ankle bootie put in place to give Bryant extra support in his return from Achilles surgery, it stood out in a line defined by low-tops and featured a bevy of memorable colorways during its run. Nike Kobe 9 Elite High Protro ‘What The Kobe?’ The ‘What The Kobe?’ 9 comes out on top in Kobe’s selection, because unlike other installments it somehow looks intentionally composed. You could argue that defeats the purpose of the colorway, but there’s something to the way the colors are blocked across the silhouette that looks uniform without sacrificing the delightful chaos fans love from the ‘What The’ line. It comes down to the consistency of the hues, with pastel greens, blues, and reds jiving perfectly with the white and silver featured on so much of the shoe. It’s less patchwork and more tie-dye—in fact, the Kobe sheath logo on the tongue and the sockliner both feature a print that, at a glance, might as wellbetie-dye. As Nike and the Bryant estate continue to navigate what the Kobe line looks like in the wake of the Mamba’s passing, there’s a clear focus on preserving the integrity of the classics while also moving forward and making the shoes more accessible to fans than they have been recently. Last year saw mostly new Kobes hit shelves, and while there have been some killer new versions launched in 2025, it’s always nice to see a classic brought back for the next generation. The Nike Kobe 9 Elite High Protro ‘What The Kobe?’ dropped last week for the first time since its original release in 2015 and, predictably, sold out instantaneously. You can still grab yourself a pair right now forcloseto retail, however, via sites likeFlight Club,GOAT, andStockX.",

    "title": "Trump Warns Against Trophy Wives During West Point Graduation",
    "article_text": "Donald Trumpwarned graduates of the United States Military Academy at West Point to stay away from “trophy wives” on Saturday in a meandering speech. At one point, Trump began talking about different contacts from the real estate world. He mentionedWilliam Levitt, who was credited with creating what we now think of as the modern suburb, and the “tremendous amount of money” he made. But, Trump bemoaned, when he sold his company and “he had nothing to do,” Levitt ended up getting a divorce and “found a new wife.” “Could you say a trophy wife? I guess we can say a trophy wife. It didn't work out too well. But it doesn't—and that doesn't work out too well, I must tell you. A lot of trophy wives, it doesn't work out, but it made him happy for a little while at least,” Trump said to the crowd of West Point graduates. “But he found a new wife. He sold his little boat and he got a big yacht.” The president has been married three times—first toIvana Trumpin 1977, then toMarla Maplesin 1993, andlastlytoMelania Trumpin 2005. US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump attend the inaugural parade inside Capital One Arena, in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025. During the commencement address to the group of about 1,000 cadets, Trump tookcreditfor the country’s military might, oneagainsaid he was investigated “more than the great late Alphonse Capone,” aimed at diversity initiatives and claimed that political leaders in the past were \u0000“abusing our soldiers with absurd ideological experiments here and at home,” criticized transgender athletes, and, of course, recalled the time he spoke with Levitt at a cocktail party filled with “the biggest people in New York, the biggest people in the country.” “I was doing well, I was, I don't know, I was invited to the party, so I had to be doing well,” Trump recalled of the night. “I was very, very young, but I made a name in real estate.” Levittown, William’s creation, for decades restricted Black people from moving in. “The tenant agrees not to permit the premises to be used or occupied by any other persons than members of the Caucasian race,” a lease from 1948read. The Trump family's real estate business also kept Black New Yorkers out of its buildings,accordingto two separate 1970s lawsuits by the Justice Department. Trump and Levitt have more in common than their real estate jobs. Trump’s talk of “trophy wives” at the West Point commencement has received backlash in part because of his own relationships with his three wives. As The Daily Beastpointedout, “All three women were significantly younger than him, and aged between 28 and 34 at the time they were married, having also worked as professional models prior to getting engaged.” Donald Trump and his first wife, Ivana Trump, introduce the press to preview the recently refurbished 300-foot yacht, The Trump Princess in July 1988 in New York, New York. For decades, Trump has been engrossed in how the women around himlook—from women who work for him, to his own daughter, to his current wife. In 2005, less than three months after marrying Melania, Trump was asked byHoward Sternif he would stay with her if she were disfigured in a car crash.

    "title": "Gavin Newsom Mingles With Rock Stars at BottleRock Music Fest",
    "article_text": "GovernorGavin Newsomwas living the California dream this weekend. The formermayor of San Franciscoheaded to the northern edges of the Bay Area Saturday for BottleRock, a three-day music festival geared primarily to the elder Millennial and Gen X set (see: last year'sBradley Cooper/Pearl Jam collab), which is arguably the high-profile politician's target demo. Or is it? Depends on the day, I suppose. Gavin Newsom, wholaunched a podcastearlier this year on which he has platformed legitimately problematic people such asconservative activist and anti-vaxxerCharlie Kirkandrecently imprisonedallegedbooster of the January 6 attemptto overthrow democracySteve Bannon, was hanging out backstage at the fest on Saturday, alongside folks includingMarsha Vlasic, the talent manager for musicianNeil Young. It is perhaps Vlasic's presence that spurred Newsom to tell aSan Francisco Chroniclestaffer that \"Neil Young has shown incredible integrity,\" a reference to the “Rocking in the Free World” singer's repeated statements of opposition to the policies of PresidentDonald Trump. Neil Young and Joan Baez perform during the ‘Fighting Oligarchy’ tour at Grand Park on April 12, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. An estimated 36,000 people attended the rally where U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) spoke. “This is an incredibly important moment in U.S. history,” Newsom said. “It’s about free expression and being accountable. We can’t afford to be timid.” Young has opposed Trump's use of his anti-GOP anthemat campaign events since 2015, when the then-reality star launched his initial grab for the White House. He had to repeat himself in 2020, when Trump's campaign rolled the song out again,this time at a rallyat Mount Rushmore (a monument, by the way, thatTrump may or may not wishto be added to—though, glass half full, it'll sure be tougher to carve Trump's mug on that cliff if he gets his way andtanks all our National Parks). Young escalated his criticism of Trump last week after the president appeared topick a social media fightwith Young contemporaryBruce Springsteen. \"I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us,\"Young wrote online. \"You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That's your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING. Think about saving America from the mess you made. \"Taylor Swiftis right. So is Bruce. You know how I feel. You are more worried about yourself than AMERICA…You are forgetting your real job. You work for us.\" Then-San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom (R) and his then-fiance (now wife) Jennifer Siebel wave to the crowd during the 38th Annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender (LGBT) Pride Celebration & Parade on Market Street June 29, 2008 in San Francisco, California. The parade was a special celebration this year after the California Supreme Court recently ruled on June 16, 2008 that same sex couples can legally marry in the State of California. Newsom has taken his own principled stand against Trump in the past, but that tone has considerably in 2025. Take, for example, Newsom's speech after hesuccessfully defeated a recall attemptin 2021 in which he said his triumph was a referendum on California's—and, presumably, his—values. “We said yes to vaccines,\" Newsom said from the podium. \"We said yes to people’s right to vote without fear of fake fraud and voter suppression. We said yes to women’s fundamental constitutional right to decide for herself what she does with her body, her faith, her future. We said yes to diversity. We said yes to inclusion. We said yes to pluralism. We said yes to all those things that we hold dear as Californians and, I would argue, as Americans.” That's the same guy who, after Trump was reelected, sat with Charlie Kirk—analleged antisemitewho says womenshouldn't use birth control—and failed to question those or other past statements made by theTurning Point USAfounder. In fact, heagreed withKirk's anti-trans remarksaround the straw man misdirection oftransgender women who play sports. Newsombroke important ground in 2004when he instructed San Francisco officials to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples just months into his first term as mayor. It was a risky move, and one that likely slowed his political ascent, withNewsom once complainingthatBarack Obamaworked to avoid sharing a stage with Newsom lest he be linked to the San Franciscan's work toward marriage equality. Nearly 20 years later, it's Newsom who's edging toward the national stage—and,perhaps necessarily, away from the forward-thinking positions he once took. I wonder if his praise of Young yesterday is tinged with a little bit of jealousy, perhaps as he remembers a time when he happily told bigots that “the future is coming, whether you like it or not,\" instead ofkissing up to them. A time when Newsom was, in his words, far less timid. Mariska Hargitay Was “Living a Lie” for 30 Years.
