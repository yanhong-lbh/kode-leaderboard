Since high school, it's long been assumed thatCooper Flaggwould be the top selection of this year's NBA Draft. Now he knows where he (likely) will be heading. The Dallas Mavericks won theNBA Draftlottery on Monday, meaning they currently own the first overall selection. Dallas had an 8.5% chance to pick top-four and a 1.8% to win the lottery. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Duke Blue Devils forward Cooper Flagg(Bob Donnan-Imagn Images) The Mavs' season turned into turmoil when they traded Luka Dončić to the Los Angeles Lakers, prompting fan hatred to general manager Nico Harrison, who needed heightened security throughout the rest of the season. But all of a sudden, all seems OK in Dallas. The Utah Jazz, with an NBA-worst 17-65 record, had the best odds at the top pick, but they dropped all the way to No. 5. Utah has never selected No. 1 nor have they ever improved their draft standing. Since the NBA changed its lottery system in 2019, the team with the best odds has never selected first. Duke Blue Devils forward Cooper Flagg(Rob Kinnan-Imagn Images) MICHAEL JORDAN TO JOIN NBC AS 'SPECIAL CONTRIBUTOR' FOR NBA COVERAGE Flagg heightened his own expectations by declaring for Duke in high school, and then he lived up to the billing. Flagg led Duke this season in almost every statistical category, including points (709), rebounds (278), assists (155), steals (52) and blocks per game (1.4). He averaged 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 4.2 assists and 1.4 steals per game, but his best showing was in January when he set an ACC freshman record with a 42-point performance against Notre Dame.

    "title": "Newsom unveils aggressive plan to clear homeless encampments across California: 'No more excuses'",
    "article_text": "Homeless squatters have taken over a luxury RV parking lot in City of Industry, Calif. Massive fires and crime, including burglaries, have since plagued the area. (Fox 11 Los Angeles) California Gov. Gavin Newsomreleased details about his multibillion-dollar plan to tackle the homeless crisis in the Golden State and is pushing cities and counties to take \"immediate action.\" On Monday, Newsom shared a model ordinance for cities and counties to \"immediately address dangerous and unhealthy encampments and connect people experiencing homelessness with shelter and services.\" \"There’s nothing compassionate about letting people die on the streets,\" Newsom said in a news release. DEM CITY USES 'BAIT-AND-SWITCH' TACTIC TO APPROVE HOMELESS SHELTER, LOCALS ERUPT \"Local leaders asked for resources – we delivered the largest state investment in history. They asked for legal clarity – the courts delivered. Now, we’re giving them a model they can put to work immediately, with urgency and with humanity, to resolve encampments and connect people to shelter, housing, and care. The time for inaction is over. There are no more excuses,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. The ordinance is backed in part by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, Newsom's office announced, adding that the governor is \"calling on all local governments to act without delay.\" Gov. Gavin Newsom; people at a homeless encampment in California(Getty Images) Newsom is also encouraging local leaders to use their authority, affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, to address encampments. \"The Governor is calling on every local government to adopt and implement local policies without delay,\" Newsom's office said. Newsom's office said this model ordinance draws from the state’s \"proven and workable approach,\" an approach that between July 2021 and May 2025 cleared more than 16,000 encampments and more than 311,873 cubic yards of debris from sites along the state right-of-way. \"These results demonstrate that the policy is both effective and scalable, offering a sound, adoptable framework for jurisdictions to resolve encampments with urgency and dignity,\" Newsom said. PROGRESSIVE JOURNALIST SAYS NEWSOM MUST TAKE 'ACCOUNTABILITY' FOR HOW HE 'DESTROYED' CALIFORNIA California Gov. Gavin Newsom(MediaNews Group/East Bay Times via Getty Images) Monday's announcement is in addition to the release of $3.3 billion in voter-approved Proposition 1 funding, which Newsom's office said will be made available later today to communities statewide. Those funds are being used to expand behavioral health housing and treatment options for the \"most seriously ill and homeless in California.\" \"This model ordinance is not intended to be comprehensive or to impose a one-size-fits-all approach for every city. Tailoring is expected and appropriate to account for local differences and priorities,\" Newsom's office said. The guidance doesn’t say whether criminal penalties should be enforced but instead would leave it up to cities to enforce how severely those who violate the ban should be punished. Newsom's office said all local approaches should reflect three basic principles, which include: Newsom's announcement comes following theSupreme Court's decisionin Grants Pass v. Johnson in 2024, which found laws restricting sleeping in public areas did not violate the constitutional restriction against \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" DEM MAYOR FED UP WITH HOMELESS CRISIS PROPOSES JAILING VAGRANTS WHO REFUSE HOUSING A homeless encampment is seen on the sidewalk of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles on May 9, 2024.(Toby Canham for Fox News Digital) Newsom had encouraged the Supreme Courtto take up the case, claiming court decisions preventing the government from punishing vagrants occupying public spaces had created an \"unsurmountable roadblock\" to addressing the crisis. Newsom's office told Fox News Digital that the governor has \"actively held communities accountable who do not follow state law to address homelessness\", sharing an example of when the state sued the City of Norwalk in 2024 for \"its unlawful ban on homeless shelters.\" The governor's office added that while the nation’s unsheltered homelessness last year went up by nearly 7%, California’s increase was only 0.45% and was lower than 44 other states. \"Governor Newsom is the first governor to actively address this issue in our state, and he is reversing a crisis that was decades in the making,\" Newsom's office said. In addition tocleaning up homeless encampments, Newsom's office also announced $3.3 billion in grant funding to create over 5,000 residential treatment beds and more than 21,800 outpatient treatment slots for behavioral healthcare services. \"Californians demanded swift action to address our state’s behavioral health crisis when they voted for Prop 1 in March 2024,\" Newsom's office said. \"Today, we’re delivering our biggest win yet. These launch-ready projects will build and expand residential beds and treatment slots for those who need help. Whether it’s crisis stabilization, inpatient services, or long-term treatment, we’re ensuring that individuals can access the right care at the right time,\" the statement continued. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP When fully awarded, Newsom's office said funding from Proposition 1 bonds is estimated to create 6,800 residential treatment beds and 26,700 outpatient treatment slots for behavioral health and will build on other major behavioral healthinitiatives in California. \"Today marks a critical milestone in our commitment to transforming California’s behavioral health system,\" said Kim Johnson, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency. \"Through these awards, we are investing in bold, community-driven solutions that expand access to care, promote equity, and meet people where they are. These projects are a reflection of our values and vision for a healthier, more compassionate California.\" Newsom's office also said the Department of Housing and Community Development will oversee up to $2 billion in Proposition 1 funds to build permanent supportive housing for veterans and others who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and have mental health or substance-use disorder challenges. \"This is a generational investment in California’s behavioral health future. We are not just building facilities. We are building hope, dignity, and pathways to healing for thousands of Californians,\" said Michelle Baass, director of the state Department of Health Care Services, in a statement.

    "article_text": "Fox News contributor Bill Bennett joins ‘Fox News @ Night’ to discuss Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s letter condemning Harvard University. Harvard UniversityPresident Alan Garber on Monday sent a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon criticizing the Trump administration's actions against the school while noting both groups share \"common ground\" on a number of issues. \"We share common ground on a number of critical issues, including the importance of ending antisemitism and other bigotry on campus,\" Garber said. \"Like you, I believe that Harvard must foster an academic environment that encourages freedom of thought and expression, and that we should embrace a multiplicity of viewpoints rather than focusing our attention on narrow orthodoxies.\" However, Harvard's goals are undermined and threatened \"by the federal government’s overreach into the constitutional freedoms of private universities and its continuing disregard of Harvard’s compliance with the law,\" Garber said.

Where do many of these ‘students’ come from, who are they, how do they get into Harvard, or even into our country – and why is there so much HATE?\" ISRAEL'S PRESIDENT RELEASES BLISTERING STATEMENT ON US UNIVERSITY ENCAMPMENTS: 'RESURGENCE OF ANTISEMITISM' Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon sent a scathing letter to Harvard University President Alan Garber, advising him to not apply for federal grants because they will not be provided.(Getty Images) \"These are questions that must be answered, among many more, but the biggest question of all is, why will Harvard not give straightforward answers to the American public?\" she added. The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in funding to the university and threatened to revoke itstax-exempt status. TRUMP SAYS HE'LL REVOKE HARVARD'S TAX-EXEMPT STATUS In his letter, Garber listed some of the actions Harvard has taken to address issues on campus, including installing new deans and clarifying the school's discipline structures and procedures. He noted that Harvard, like many universities, has work to do to foster intellectual diversity on campus. Garber also pushed back on McMahon's claims that Harvard is a \"partisan\" institution.

    "article_text": "Sunny Hostin showed newfound support for Pope Leo XIV on \"The View\" Monday after learning about his Black and Haitian background from his grandparents. \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin revealed Monday she now \"loves\"Pope Leo XIVafter discovering his \"Black\" background. Hostin had previously expressed concerns about the new pontiff on Friday after his comments referencing the \"homosexual lifestyle\" resurfaced. On Monday, she spoke more optimistically about Pope Leo after learning his maternal grandparents were described as \"people of color\" on documents, with his grandfather’s original birthplace listed as Haiti. \"There’s one other thing that's very interesting to me because President Trump, as you remember, calledHaiti a certain type of country,\" Hostin said. \"As it turns out, our new American pope has Haitian and Black roots! So, we actually have a Black pope, apparently. It's a chef's kiss for me.\" After Pope Leo was announced on Thursday, Hostin said she was\"concerned\" about the LGBTQ communitybased on a statement he made in 2012 as a bishop where he described how pop culture had fostered \"sympathy for beliefs and practices that are at odds with the gospel,\" including the \"homosexual lifestyle\" and \"alternative families comprised of same-sex partners and their adopted children.\" VATICAN GOES VIRAL: TIKTOKERS FASCINATED BY POPE ELECTION Pope Leo XIV prays over members of the international media in the Paul VI Hall at the Vatican on May 12, 2025.(Domenico Stinellis) Hostin on Monday said she was more encouraged by Pope Leo based on comments from 2023 which she thought showed he had completely changed his position. \"He said, you know, he believes what Pope Francis believed is that a church is a church for everyone. The church is very inclusive. So, I'm liking this guy a lot! I'm loving the pope,\" Hostin said. Her co-hosts Ana Navarro and Whoopi Goldberg also praised Pope Leo after he gave a speech earlier that morning voicing support for imprisoned journalists. \"He said he stands in solidarity with journalists who are imprisoned for reporting the truth and urged them to avoid ideological or partisan language. I like that. I'm digging him,\" Goldberg said. \"I love that one of his first acts was to meet with journalists and defend theright of journaliststo be journalists and uncover the truth,\" Navarro added. \"And I think it's so timely that we have an American pope because we are going through things in this country, and it is good to show the world that not all American leaders are the same.

    "title": "FDA says ‘dangerous’ substance known as ‘gas station heroin’ poses major risk to young people",
    "article_text": "Chris Martin, police chief of the Brewer Police Department in Maine, told Fox News Digital that drug dealers have brought an increase in crime to his state. The head of the U.S.Food and Drug Administration(FDA) is sounding the alarm on a dangerous drug referred to as \"gas station heroin,\" that can lead to serious harm, including death. FDA Commissioner Martin A. Makary sent a letter to his colleagues last week to draw their attention to what he called a \"dangerous and growing health trend\" facing the nation and young people. Makary said there is an increasing number of adverse events involving products that contain tianeptine. Tianeptine, often called \"gas station heroin,\" is sold in gas stations through a variety of products, despite the drug not being approved by the FDA. \"I am very concerned,\" Makary wrote. \"I want the public to be especially aware of this dangerous product and the serious and continuing risk it poses to America’s youth.\" ‘GAS STATION HEROIN’ IS GROWING THREAT IN NEW JERSEY, HEALTH OFFICIALS WARN: ‘DANGEROUS AND ADDICTIVE’ The \"supplement\" commonly goes by the brand names ZaZa or Tianna Red.(Dekalb County Sheriff's Office) The products are typically sold at convenience stores, gas stations, vape shops and online retailers, and go by names like Tianaa, ZaZa, Neptune’s Fix, Pegasus and TD Red. Makary said the FDA is following the distribution and sale of products that contain tianeptine but called on his colleagues to disseminate information about the drug while appreciating the magnitude of its underlying danger. Tianeptine is licensed and marketed in some countries as an atypical antidepressant, and in countries where it is approved, the typical labeled dose to treat depression is 12.5 mg orally, three times per day, Makary said. When higher doses are taken, they canproduce euphoria.Some countries have taken steps to restrict how tianeptine is prescribed or dispensed and have even revised the labels to warn people of its potential addiction. TEEN DRUG OVERDOSES HIT RECORD HIGH, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY FENTANYL POISONING, SAYS NEW REPORT The FDA is warning about the dangers of tianeptine.(REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo) In the U.S., though, tianeptine is not listed as part of the Controlled Substances Act. The drug is often taken recreationally, though if stopped abruptly, users could experience withdrawal symptoms similar to those associated with opioid withdrawal – craving, sweating, diarrhea and more. If tianeptine is ingested, Makary wrote, adverse events could include agitation, coma, confusion, death, drowsiness, hypertension, nausea, respiratory depression, sweating, tachycardia and vomiting. Two years ago, New Jersey health officials warned that two products sold as dietary supplements in gas stations and online – Neptune’s Elixir and ZaZa Red – had caused a spike in illnesses. WHAT IS KETAMINE, THE DRUG THAT KILLED MATTHEW PERRY ON OCTOBER 28? New Jersey health officials raised concerns in 2023 about Neptune’s Fix Elixir, a product containing tianeptine, after a cluster of illnesses was reported in connection with the product.(FDA's Office of Regulatory Affairs, Health Fraud Branch) Between June and November 2023, there were 20 reported cases of tianeptine causing \"severe clinical effects\" in New Jersey, as noted in a Feb. 1 alert from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In 2023, the FDA posted an alert warning of the dangers of Neptune’s Fix or any other product containing tianeptine. \"FDA has received severe adverse event reports after use of Neptune’s Fix products, including seizures and loss of consciousness leading to hospitalization,\" the agency stated. \"FDA considers tianeptine to be a substance that does not meet the statutory definition of a dietary ingredient and is an unsafe food additive. The FDA is aware of severalserious adverse eventreports associated with tianeptine.\" On Jan. 28, 2024, Neptune Resources, LLC, the maker of Neptune’s Fix, issued a voluntary recall of its products due to the presence of tianeptine — but experts are warning that other products may also contain the drug. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Anyone who is using tianeptine or a product containing tianeptine and is experiencing withdrawal symptoms can call the National Poison Control Center at 1-800-222-1222 or seek emergencymedical assistance, experts advised.

    "article_text": "Acclaimed director Martin Scorsese explains the significance of Mary Magdalene and her story for ‘The Saints,’ streaming exclusively on Fox Nation. WARNING: This article contains graphic images. Reader discretion is advised. The well-preserved body of an early modern saint was put on display in Spain on Sunday, months after she was discovered\"miraculously incorrupt\"last year. St. Teresa of Jesus, also calledSt. Teresa of Avila,was a Discalced Carmelite nun who was born in 1515 and died in 1582. This weekend, her body was put on public display in Alba de Tormes, Spain, for the first time since 1914. Pictures show Catholics visibly taken aback by the display, which was part of the opening ceremony of public veneration, on Sunday. DOZENS OF ANCIENT SKELETONS FOUND IN HEART OF BUSTLING CITY: 'HARD TO IMAGINE' Observers were seen covering their mouths, crying and praying at the sight of the Spanish saint. The body of St. Teresa was dressed in a nun's habit during the showing. Though the remains appeared mostly skeletal, certain areas appeared extremely well-preserved, including her foot. Catholics were taken aback at the remains of St. Teresa of Avila, which went on display on May 11.(Manuel Angel Laya/Europa Press / Getty Images) In September, officials from the Diocese of Avila opened St. Teresa's tomb and reported that she appeared exactly the same as when her tomb was first exhumed in 1914. \"The uncovered parts, which are the face and foot, are the same as they were in 1914,\" Fr. Marco Chiesa said at the time. EXPERTS SHOCKED BY ANCIENT KING ARTHUR MANUSCRIPT FOUND TUCKED INSIDE BOOK: 'SURVIVED THE CENTURIES' \"There is no color, there is no skin color, because the skin is mummified, but it is seen, especially in the middle of the face.\" He added, \"[It] looks good. Expert doctors see Teresa's face almost clearly.\" St. Teresa's tomb was opened for the first time in 1914; her corpse had not been on display since then.(Manuel Angel Laya/Europa Press via Getty Images) Researchers were also able to uncover insight into the female saint's medical history, as she had suffered from chronic pain that eventually rendered her immobile. Chiesa found calcareous spines, or heel spurs, that \"made walking almost impossible\" for St. Teresa.

Carmelites opened the tomb of St. Teresa of Avila last year, and found her corpse to be in \"incorrupt\" condition.(CESAR MANSO/AFP via Getty Images) Officials believe that St. Teresa remained in such extraordinary condition due to the dry atmosphere of her tomb.

    "title": "Federal judge allows IRS to share illegal alien data with DHS in court win for Trump",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Brooke Taylor reports on ICE Texas capturing over 400 migrants in a week-long operation. A federal judge on Monday denied an injunction request to prevent the Department of Homeland Security and Internal Revenue Service from partnering to permit U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement (ICE) to access taxpayer information to locateillegal immigrantssubject to deportation. The order by U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich came amid a lawsuit by Centro de Trabajadores Unidos and other immigrant-rights groups against Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \"Plaintiffs Centro de Trabajadores Unidos, Immigrant Solidarity DuPage, Somos Un Pueblo Unido, and Inclusive Action for the City bring this action seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from sharing personal tax information with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement purposes. Before the Court is the plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, Dkt. 28. For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny the motion.\" \"At its core, this case presents a narrow legal issue: Does the Memorandum of Understanding between the IRS and DHS violate the Internal Revenue Code? It does not,\" the order continued. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS FEDERAL JUDGE IT MIGHT INVOKE STATE SECRETS ACT ON HIGH-PROFILE DEPORTATION CASE An agreement between the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been filed with a court to allow authorities to further target illegal immigrants subject to deportation.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images / Department of Homeland Security) Nonprofits Centro de Trabajadores Unidos and Immigrant Solidarity DuPage, representing immigrant workers in the Chicago area, brought the lawsuit against Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent, the IRS, and Commissioner of Internal Revenue Melanie Krause, seeking to block the disclosure of personal information of taxpayers and other confidential tax records to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement purposes. In a statement to Fox News Digital, Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary of public affairs, said information sharing across all federal agencies to identify illegal immigrants is essential in order to \"determine what public safety and terror threats may exist so we can neutralize them, scrub these individuals from voter rolls, as well as identify what public benefits these aliens are using at taxpayer expense.\" \"Under President Trump’s leadership, the government is finally doing what it should have all along—sharing information across the federal government to solve problems,\" she said. \"Biden not only allowed millions of illegal aliens—including gang members, suspected terrorists, and violent criminals—to flood into our country, but he also lost them due to incompetence and improper processing.\" The IRS (Internal Revenue Service) headquarters building in Washington DC(Getty Images) \"Information sharing across agencies is essential to identify who is in our country and determine what public safety and terror threats may exist so we can neutralize them, scrub these individuals from voter rolls, as well as identify what public benefits these aliens are using at taxpayer expense. \"Today’s ruling is a victory for the American people and for commonsense.\" An earlier memorandum of understanding between DHS and the IRS outlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer data information is protected while allowing law enforcement to pursue criminal violations, a senior Treasury Department official said at the time the deal was reached in April. The deal allows DHS to ask the IRS to confirm the home addresses of illegal immigrants suspected of violating deportation orders. The IRS can share data to aid criminal investigations but is prohibited from sharing information related to civil matters, such as facilitating deportations. TheTreasury Departmentis committed to protecting the privacy of law-abiding taxpayers, but a criminal exception obligates the agency to assist law enforcement, the official told Fox News Digital at the time. Coronavirus / Covid-19 USA Economic Stimulus Checks or Tax Refund stock photo(iStock) Fox News Digital has reached out to the IRS, DHS and the legal team for the groups involved in the lawsuit. The deal would allow ICE to submit the names and addresses of illegal immigrants to the IRS, who could then cross-check thoseimmigrants' tax recordsand provide the immigration agency with current address information. \"The Court agrees that requesting and receiving information for civil enforcement purposes would constitute a cognizable injury, but none of the organizations have established that such an injury is imminent,\" Friedrich wrote. \"As the plaintiffs acknowledge, the Memorandum only allows sharing information for criminal investigations.\" Treasury Secretary Scott Kenneth Homer Bessent and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem(Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As the Memorandum provides, its purpose is to establish procedures enabling \"requests for addresses of persons subject to criminal investigation,\" the order said.

    "title": "Pentagon ceases gender transition treatments as it moves to boot trans troops",
    "article_text": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that transgender troops have between 30 and 60 days to leave the military or be removed in the wake of a victory for the Pentagon ban at the Supreme Court. (@SecDef via X) The Pentagonis immediately halting all gender transition treatments for transgender troops as it moves to remove them from the military, according to a new memo. \"I am directing you to take the necessary steps to immediately implement this guidance,\" Stephen Ferrara, the acting assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, wrote in a memo dated May 9. Now the Pentagon will only cover mental health and counseling for gender dysphoria. All other gender dysphoria-related treatments will be referred to the private sector. All scheduled and plannedtransgender surgerieswill be canceled, but cross-sex hormone therapy for service members that began prior to the memo may be continued until they separate to prevent health complications. Last week, transgender troops were given between 30 and 60 days to leave or risk being removed \"involuntarily.\" PETE HEGSETH DIRECTS MILITARY ACADEMIES THAT ALL FUTURE ADMISSIONS WILL BE BASED SOLELY ON MERIT Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a deadline for troops to separate last week.(Allison Robbert/AFP/Getty Images) Active-duty service members have until June 6, one month after the court’s ruling, to leave the military. Reservists have until July 7. The development follows aSupreme Court orderthat allowed a previously blocked ban on transgender military service to move forward. The Supreme Court’s decision effectively paused a lower court's injunction, clearing the way for the Defense Department to implement the policy. Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the ruling allows the department to resume policies focused on \"Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness.\" Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethadded in that memo that those diagnosed with or showing symptoms consistent with gender dysphoria may choose to leave voluntarily. If they do not, they may face mandatory separation. PETE HEGSETH SAYS WEST POINT PROFESSOR WHO RESIGNED OVER TRUMP ADMIN EDUCATION OVERHAUL ‘WILL NOT BE MISSED’ President Donald Trump directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to remove transgender troops from the military.(Getty Images) The Supreme Court did not rule on the underlying legal arguments but allowed President Donald Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order barring transgender individuals from military service to take effect. A lower court had temporarily blocked the policy, but Trump administration officials argued that delaying its implementation could harm operational readiness. Officials defending the policy have said it supports the military’s need for unit cohesion, readiness, discipline and cost efficiency. Trump’s executive order also directed the Pentagon to revise its medical standards to emphasize combat preparedness and eliminate the use of gender identity-based pronouns within the department. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The blanket ban on transgender individuals serving in the military had previously been lifted under President Barack Obama in 2014. The latest policy shift comes as Pentagon leadership under Hegseth moves to dismantle mostdiversity, equity and inclusion(DEI) initiatives. Last month, he stated that 99.9% of DEI-related policies had been removed. He also announced changes to fitness standards to ensure male and female troops are held to the same requirements for combat readiness.",

    "title": "Church fights New Jersey town over plans to seize property and turn it into park",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV celebrates his first Mass as pontiff in the Sistine Chapel, addressing the more than 1.4 billion members of the Catholic Church he now leads. A Christianchurch is fighting a New Jerseytown for attempting to seize their property, alongside other land, and turn it into a waterfront park. Christ Episcopal Church is fighting plans from Toms River, NJ officials to seize their church property, alongside three other town marinas, as part of the township's plans to revitalize the downtown community. Bishop Sally French, in a letter to parishioners, told churchgoers that on April 30, about a day before a scheduled town meeting, officials were alerted by a concerned community member that the church's property had been \"added to a proposal for an eminent domain ordinance.\" The church, which has been a part of the community for 160 years, says the action comes amid trying to build a homeless shelter on their property. \"As a Christian leader and a resident ofNew Jersey, I am troubled by the township’s move to block the faithful ministry of Christ Church and their care for those in need, and I am saddened that the mayor and township council are prioritizing pickleball courts over responding to hunger and homelessness,\" Bishop Sally French said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"I ask that Toms River lift the burden these proceedings have placed on our parish and diocese, and I pray that we can move forward in serving our neighbors.\" (iStock) PSAKI BOMBS: MSNBC'S NEWEST PRIMETIME PROGRAM SHEDS 53% OF VIEWERS FROM KEY DEMO IN SECOND EPISODE Republican Mayor Rodrick told Fox News Digital he feels the plan is in the best interest of the constituents because children do not have a playground in the immediate area. The town ordinance allows officials to enter into negotiations to secure the areas or acquire them by eminent domain should the church not want to sell the property. \"We have about 20,000 residents, 5,000 households within a stone's throw of the Episcopal church,\" he said. \"The property is very large, it's a 10-acre parcel and has a tremendous amount of parking and the parking, we would never be allowed to make that much parking on a property that size anymore. It would be very difficult... so it would be great for the kids in the local area and the families in that area to have a park that they can walk to with their kids and a playground. We're also interested in doing a skate park there.\" Rodrick argued that the project, which he believes would benefit both residents and businesses, is part of a larger plan to \"redevelop downtown\" and make it more of a \"destination\" for residents. The agenda would \"enhance business downtown\" by bringing more customers to the area. He also spoke to Fox News Digital about how he is proud of his budget as mayor, explaining they were \"DOGE before DOGE was cool\" as they cut the budget from $146 million to $135 million. The Episcopalianchurchhas a different take on the matter, with the bishop offering her full support to the community church. \"The people of Christ Episcopal Church have my support and gratitude for their Gospel ministry of feeding the hungry and providing shelter to unhoused people,\" she said. \"Jesus tells us to care for the poor and vulnerable as we would care for him, and the people of Christ Church are putting that commandment into action.\" Should the town acquire the property, Rodrick says the church would have time to purchase another property or may choose to consolidate churches according to the church leader’s digression, pointing to there possibly being a silver lining to consolidation for the church due to the high value of the property compared to liabilities. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Nationwide, the Episcopal church is in steep decline. I think they lost 40,000 members last year. A lot of these Protestant churches have seen big decreases in membership. They still have a lot of these legacy costs and pensions for their pastors that they need to make payments on and it costs a lot of money. So, if you have 75 people put $10 in, and you bring in $3,000 a month, do you know what it must cost to heat a 20,000-square-foot church? So, they could probably benefit from some consolidation and many of the smaller Protestant denominations are doing that.\" The church is standing alongside \"approximately 150 church members, community members, clergy\" and others in their fight against the ordinance, according to the website. \"Christ Church Toms River is a vital resource in the community,\" Mother Lisa Hoffman, rector of Christ Church in Toms River, told Fox News Digital. \"Our outreach includes nearly 20 12-step meetings per week. While the members of Christ Church are disappointed with this situation, we are determined to protect our Gospel ministry.\" As for next steps, the council has already voted four to three and \"anticipates\" it will pass for a second time four to three, according to the mayor.",

The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) announced on Monday that it will disband and disarm following its more than four-decade insurgency against theTurkish statethat has resulted in the deaths of over 40,000 people at the hands of PKK militants and Turkey’s military. The PKK has sought to create an independent Kurdish state on Turkish soil, where the Kurds make up some 20% of Turkey's 86 million population. The U.S., the European Union and Turkey have classified the PKK as a terrorist organization.

    "article_text": "Debra Tice is back in Syria for the first time for over 10 years searching for her son who has been missing since 2012. The family of journalist and U.S. Marine Corps veteran Austin Tice, who has been missing in Syria for more than 12 years, said reports that his body has been found are false. The report initiated in regional media outlets, and appeared briefly on FoxNews.com Sunday. While an international search effort organized by Qatar to find captives once held by ISIS has turned up remains in Syria, there is no evidence that any are Tice’s. Those most familiar with his case say he was not held by ISIS and was not in the area where remains were found. His family said in December that they have strong reason to believe he is alive. \"We appreciate whatever mission is ongoing to help families of ISIS victims find closure,\" said a spokesman for the Tice family. \"However, an initial and erroneous report that Austin Tice was identified among the remains was quickly and completely contradicted.\" Tice, 43, who was a freelancer photographer and journalist, was kidnapped in Damascus in August of 2012. A former captain in the Marines who served in Afghanistan, he had gone to Syria as an independent journalist in May 2012, before his final year at Georgetown Law School. No group has taken credit for his abduction. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading to Tice’s safe return. This article was written by Fox News staff.",

Before leaving for his trip, Trump reiterated his stance on Iran's nuclear goals while addressing reporters at the White House, where he said, \"You can't have a nuclear weapon, but I think that they are talking intelligently. We're in the midst of talking to them, and they're right now acting very intelligent. We want Iran to be wealthy and wonderful and happy and great, but they can't have … nuclear weapons. Very simple. So I think they understand that.\" A day before the start of talks, Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei welcomed chants of \"Death to America\" in Tehran. \"Your judgment is right,\" Khamenei told a crowd of supporters who called for the destruction of the U.S. TRUMP HALTS MILITARY STRIKES ON HOUTHIS BUT EXPERT WARNS IRAN-BACKED TERRORIST GROUP REMAINS MAJOR THREAT Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei said the nuclear talks were \"difficult but useful.\" A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations, offered a little bit more, describing them as being both indirect and direct, The Associated Press reported. An \"agreement was reached to move forward with the talks to continue working through technical elements,\"the U.S. official said. \"We are encouraged by today’s outcome and look forward to our next meeting, which will happen in the near future.\" Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei attends Nowruz events in Tehran, Iran, on March 21, 2025.(Photo by Iranian Leader Press Office / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) President Trump announced a 60-day time frame to reach an agreement with Iran over its illegal atomic weapons program. The first U.S. negotiating session with Iran commenced on April 12. Mardo Soghom, an Iran analyst and journalist, noted prior to the start of talks several months ago that Iran’s regime will go to great lengths to preserve its right to enrich uranium—the material required for a nuclear weapon. The Trump administration vehemently opposes a uranium enrichment program on Iranian soil. \"Iran is trying to save its enrichment operation at a lower level and also not accepting any pressure to halt its anti-Israel stance. Khamenei's speech [Saturday] highlighted that second point. But at this point, the main issue is dismantling Iran's uranium enrichment,\" Soghom told Fox News Digital. Khamenei also lashed out at Israel during his Saturday speech in Tehran, declaring about Israel’s war campaign to root out Iran-backed Hamas terrorists from the Gaza Strip that \"The people of Gaza are not facing Israel alone—they are facing America and Britain.\" Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran, told Fox News Digital that \"The Iranians, like last round, sound more downcast than the U.S. side, describing talks as difficult.\" In 2018, PresidentTrump withdrew from former President Barack Obama’s 2015nuclear deal with Iran, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), because the accord failed to prevent Tehran from building a nuclear weapons device, according to the first Trump administration. TRUMP REINSTATES ‘MAXIMUM PRESSURE’ CAMPAIGN AGAINST IRAN U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, left, shakes hands with Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi in Muscat, Oman, April 12, 2025.(Oman News Agency/ Handout via Reuters) President Trump’s Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff recently stressed that Iran cannot have an enrichment program during an interview withBreitbart Newsprior to Sunday’s bargaining session. Witkoff said \"First of all, we’re never doing a JCPOA deal where sanctions come off and there’s no sunsetting of their obligations. That doesn’t make sense. That was a mismatched procedure in JCPOA. We believe that they cannot have enrichment, they cannot have centrifuges, they cannot have anything that allows them to build a weapon. We believe in all of that. That was not JCPOA. JCPOA had sunset provisions that burned off the obligations and burned off the sanctions relief at inappropriate times. It’s never going to happen in this deal.\" Brodsky said that \"All in all, both sides want to keep the process moving. The Iranians will usually say and do enough to earn another meeting as they stand to lose more by this process breaking down than the U.S. government. The negotiating process is as important to the Iranians as the agreement itself as the process offers insulation from the impact of sanctions—with the rial strengthening since talks started—and protection from a military strike. \"This is why Iran will want these negotiations to continue for as long as possible. They will try to wear out and exhaust U.S. negotiators into concessions, which the Trump administration should reject. As President Trump said in a different context, Tehran does not have the cards here.\" IRAN'S LEADER WARNS US COULD RECEIVE ‘SEVERE SLAPS’ FOLLOWING TRUMP'S THREATS TO HOUTHIS President Donald Trump arrives on Air Force One at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland, on Sunday, May 4, 2025.(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta) The hot-button issue of uranium enrichment has plagued talks with Iran over the last few decades. The Europeans faced intense criticism when they agreed—independent of the U.S.—to allowthe Islamic Republicto enrich uranium during the nascent phase of atomic talks during the early years of this century. Brodsky said \"The original sin of U.S. decision-making on Iran’s nuclear program was when the Obama administration changed the U.S. position from zero enrichment to tolerating enrichment at 3.67%. That laid the groundwork for Iran to retain the capability to continue to use its nuclear program to extort the United States and ultimately build a nuclear weapon.\" The nuclear expert noted, \"That should end today, and recent comments from President Trump, Special Envoy Witkoff, and Secretary Rubio hopefully signal that this era is over. House and Senate Republicans were also very clear on this point over the last week. The Iranians say they want a durable deal. But a JCPOA 2.0—tolerating enrichment at 3.67% and no dismantlement of nuclear facilities—would not be one. \"The Iranians are engaged in all kinds of gimmicks to dress up a variation of the same concessions they offered toPresident Obama. That should be unacceptable to American negotiators.\" An Iranian military truck carries surface-to-air missiles past a portrait of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during a parade on the occasion of the country's annual army day on April 18, 2018 in Tehran, Iran.(ATTA KENARE/AFP via Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The anti-American news outlet, Kayhan, that serves as the mouthpiece for Khamenei, published a full-page screed against Trump where it stated, \"He is a framework based on narcissism, superiority delusions, and threat-based tactics.\" The talks on Sunday ran for some three hours in Muscat, the capital of Oman.

    "title": "'Activist' judges keep trying to curb Trump’s agenda – here’s how he could push back",
    "article_text": "FOX News' John Roberts analyzes President Biden's address to the nation and what was missing from his speech. PresidentDonald Trumpand his allies have railed against federal judges for blocking key executive orders in his second term, accusing so-called \"activist\" judges of overstepping their authority and blocking him from delivering on some of his top policy priorities. Some of Trump’s most sweeping executive orders and actions have been blocked or paused by federal courts to allow for a full hearing on the merits. But the system of checks and balances also means these rulings can be reviewed – either through appeals to the Supreme Court or by Congress, which has the power to pass laws or expand certain executive branch authorities. It's all part of an expressly designed system of government that affords each branch, including the presidency, plenty of options for review. The Framers \"made clear that no one in our system of government was meant to be king– the president included – and not just in name only,\" U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell of the District of Columbia said in a ruling earlier this year. But that's not to say Trump is without options. Here's how he could seek to push back against the wave of court actions. 100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT President Donald Trump delivers a speech marking his 100th day in office in Warren, Michigan, on April 29, 2025. (Jim Watson/AFP via Getty) Since taking office, Trump's executive orders have been challenged by hundreds of lawsuits in federal court, though not all have been successful, and some remain in the earlier stages of review. Plaintiffs have sought to block the dismantling of certain federal agencies, to restore board heads and inspectors general fired by Trump, and to restrict the access of Elon Musk's government efficiency agency, DOGE, among other things. Butlike the groups filing the lawsuits,the Trump administration also has the ability to appeal any lower court decisions it views as unfavorable or going beyond the scope of the federal court. In the interim, it can seek an emergency stay to restore the executive order until the case can be heard on its merits. The Supreme Court has agreed to do so in several major cases. It sided with Trump in removing two federal board members he had fired earlier this year, and which a lower court had reversed. Last week, the Supreme Court lifteda lower court orderthat paused Trump's ban on transgender military members from taking effect – allowing his order and related policies to proceed, at least for now. BOASBERG GRILLS DOJ OVER REMARKS FROM TRUMP AND NOEM, FLOATS MOVING MIGRANTS TO GITMO IN ACTION-PACKED HEARING President Donald Trump speaks to the media after signing executive orders in the Oval Office at the White House on April 23, 2025.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) The Trump administration can seek more lasting change by working with the Republican majorities in both houses of Congress to codify its biggest policy priorities, shielding the level of review currently afforded to the courts in the absence of any legislation. According to theCode of Federal Regulationsand the Federal Register, a president’s executive order can be revoked or modified only by the president or via the legislative branch, if the president was acting on authority that had been granted by Congress. Plaintiffs in federal court have alleged that Trump's recent executive actions are beyond the scope of what has been authorized by Congress – and, in the absence of clearly written laws, federal judges do have broad authority to interpret the lawfulness of the executive's actions. Critics of the courts havepushed for Congressto curtail this power – either by stripping the funding for federal courts, impeaching judges or eliminating judicial seats, among other things. \"When federal judges take off their judicial robes and climb into the political arena and throw political punches, they should expect powerful political counterpunches from the Article III project,\" Mike Davis, the founder and president of the Article III Project, or A3P, told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"And when the federal judiciary loses its legitimacy, it loses everything,\" Davis said. But these steps are highly controversial, and it's unclear if they could garner the broad support needed from both the House and Senate. HERE'S WHY DOZENS OF LAWSUITS SEEKING TO QUASH TRUMP'S EARLY ACTIONS AS PRESIDENT ARE FAILING President Donald Trump shakes hands with Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts as Melania Trump, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump look on after being sworn in during inauguration ceremonies in the Rotunda of the Capitol on Jan. 20, 2025.(Chip Somodevilla/Pool via Reuters/File) Options available to the White House are more limited by the Constitution. The president can appoint federal judges, but he cannot fire them. The executive branch is also responsible for enforcing court rulings and may either slow-roll or de-prioritize decisions the president disagrees with. Meanwhile, Trump allies have also sought to push back on the power of the courts in other, more unorthodox ways. The America First Legal Foundation, a pro-Trump legal group founded by White House aide Stephen Miller in between Trump's first and second terms, filed a lawsuit againstSupreme CourtChief Justice John Roberts, in his capacity as the official head of the U.S. Judicial Conference, and Robert J. Conrad, the director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, earlier this month. The lawsuit accuses both parties of performing certain regulatory actions that go beyond the scope of the \"core functions\" of the judiciary – and which they argue should put them under the thumb of the executive branch. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"An American president is not a king – not even an 'elected' one – and his power to remove federal officers and honest civil servants like plaintiff is not absolute,\" Howell said in a case involving the reinstatement of two fired federal board members earlier this year.

    "article_text": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at a Cabinet meeting at the White House April 30, 2025, that the Trump administration is seeking out various countries to advance efforts to deport illegal immigrants. The identity of a Trump administration official who was allegedly targeted by the Biden administration's State Department in a \"disinformation\" dossier remains a mystery nearly two weeks after Secretary of StateMarco Rubiorevealed details on the file. Rubio revealed at the most recent Trump administration Cabinet meeting April 30 that an unidentified Trump administration official who was present had been the subject of a State Department dossier detailing alleged promotion of social media \"disinformation.\" Rubio, the State Department and the White House have not yet identified which official the Biden administration targeted. Fox News Digital has reached out repeatedly to the White House regarding the identity of the official, including on Monday, but did not receive replies. When asked for an update on the identity of the Trump official, the State Department directed Fox News Digital to Rubio's April 30 remark, detailing that, \"We are going to be turning over these dossiers to the individuals, and they’ll decide whether they want to disclose it or not.\" RUBIO REVEALS OBSCURE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION OFFICE KEPT 'DISINFORMATION' DOSSIER ON TRUMP OFFICIAL The Trump administration has not revealed which administration official was targeted by the Biden administration's State Department in a \"disinformation\" dossier compiling previous social media posts that identified them as \"purveyors of disinformation.\"(Getty Images) Rubio said during the April 30 Cabinet meeting that a little-known, now-defunct office within the State Department called the Global Engagement Center (GEC) had compiled disinformation dossiers on Americans across the country as part of an effort to \"censor\" free speech, including an individual who has since joined the Trump administration. \"We had an office in the Department of State whose job it was to censor Americans,\" Rubio said during the meeting. \"And, by the way, I'm not going to say who it is. I'll leave it up to them. There's at least one person at this table today who had a dossier in that building of social media posts to identify them as purveyors of disinformation. We have these dossiers. We are going to be turning those over to these individuals.\" Vice PresidentJD Vanceinterjected, asking, \"Was it me or Elon (Musk)? We can follow up when the media is gone,\" which drew laughter from the Cabinet. RUBIO OVERHAULING 'BLOATED' STATE DEPARTMENT IN SWEEPING REFORM Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during a Cabinet meeting April 30.(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) \"But just think about that. The Department of State of the United States had set up an office to monitor the social media posts and commentary of American citizens, to identify them as vectors of disinformation,\" Rubio continued. \"When we know that the best way to combat disinformation is freedom of speech and transparency.\" Though Rubio did not identify whichTrump officialthe Biden administration kept a dossier on, Elon Musk has previously railed against the Global Engagement Center. \"The worst offender in US government censorship & media manipulation is an obscure agency called GEC,\" Musk posted to X in January 2023. That was more than a year before Musk endorsed Trump in the 2024 presidential race and became a fixture of the administration in his temporary role with the Department of Government Efficiency. \"They are a threat to our democracy,\" Musk added. RUBIO ANNOUNCES CLOSURE OF STATE DEPARTMENT EFFORT THAT 'WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD ALREADY' Former PresidentBarack Obamaestablished the Global Engagement Center in 2016 through an executive order aimed at coordinating counterterrorism messaging to foreign nations before it expanded its scope to also include countering foreign propaganda and disinformation,State Department documents show. Conservatives have slammed the office as a political weapon to silence free speech, including Rubio in an April op-ed when he cited a 2020 GEC report claiming that a \"Russian disinformation apparatus\" was behind public speculation that the coronavirus was an \"engineered bioweapon\" or was created by \"research conducted at the Wuhan institute.\" Marco Rubio said during the April 30 Cabinet meeting that a little-known, now-defunct office within the State Department called the Global Engagement Center (GEC) had compiled disinformation dossiers on Americans across the country as part of an effort to \"censor\" free speech.(Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency) In the years following the pandemic, the Department of Energy under the Biden administration and former FBI Director Christopher Wray said evidence indicated that COVID-19 was the result of a lab leak, while the Trump administration's CIA reported earlier in 2025 that a lab leak was thelikely origin of the virus. TWITTER BOSS ELON MUSK ACCUSES GOVERNMENT AGENCY OF BEING ‘WORST OFFENDER IN US GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP’ In 2024, lawmakers did not approve new funding for the office in the National Defense Authorization Act, and it was scheduled to terminate on Dec. 23, 2024. The Biden administration, however, shuffled staffers and rebranded the office. It became the Counter Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference Hub just days before Trump's inauguration, the New York Postreported in January. Rubio announced in April that the office would officially shutter.

    "title": "No millionaire tax hike in Trump's 'big, beautiful bill'",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram has the latest on President Donald Trump’s potential millionaire tax amid House Republican efforts to cut taxes on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ House Republicans have seemingly dropped plans for a new millionaire's tax hike to pay for other priorities in PresidentDonald Trump's\"big, beautiful bill.\" The Ways and Means Committee, the House's tax-writing panel, released nearly 400 pages of legislation on Monday, setting the stage for permanently extending Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), as well as a host of other new Trump tax priorities. That includes no taxes on tipped and overtime wages, both of which are accomplished via new tax deductions. For Trump's promise to cut taxes on seniors' Social Security, the legislation temporarily increases the standard tax deduction that seniors are allowed to take, effective the end of last year through the beginning of 2029. ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION The U.S. Capitol and President Donald Trump(Getty Images/AP Images) It would alsoraise the debt limitby $4 trillion – something Trump specifically asked Republican lawmakers to deal with before the U.S. runs out of cash to pay its debts sometime this summer, risking a national credit default. Notably absent from the sweeping piece of legislation is a proposal floated last week that would have established a new tax bracket for people making $2.5 million per year or more, taxing them at 39.6% – which was the top tax rate before TCJA lowered it to 37%. Conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity and the Heritage Foundation fiercely fought any notion of a tax increase on the wealthy. It was also publicly opposed by a number of leading Republican figures like former Speaker Newt Gingrich and ex-Vice President Mike Pence, along with Pence's interest group, Advancing American Freedom. Several House GOP lawmakers told Fox News Digital last week they could not support a millionaire's tax hike. Two people familiar with discussions told Fox News Digital on Monday that they did not expect it to be included before the bill advanced through committee on Tuesday. But Republicans find other cost-savings in the legislation, including stripping tax-exempt status from \"terrorist-supporting organizations\" and using artificial intelligence (AI) software to identify and root out improper Medicare payments. The bill would also dramatically reduce tax breaks for professional sports team owners, a measure known as amortization, which allows those owners to write off a portion of their purchase price. Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., leads the House Ways and Means Committee.(Tom Williams) Republicans also target large private colleges and universities, including Ivy Leagues, with higher excise taxes, which are federal duties paid on net earnings of the schools' investments. That rate is currently 1.4%. But the legislation would bring it to as high as 21% for the largest schools, like Harvard University and Yale University – as Trump continues to battle the Ivy League over their funding. The Ways and Means Committee is expected to advance its portion of the legislation on Tuesday afternoon. It's just one part of Trump's so-called \"one big, beautiful bill,\" which Republicans are working to pass via the budget reconciliation process. By lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, it allows the party controlling Congress and the White House to entirely skirt the minority and pass sweeping pieces of legislation – provided they deal with the national debt, taxes or spending. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY Trump wants Republicans to use it to pass his agenda on taxes, the border, immigration, energy and defense. Meanwhile, the U.S. is currently more than $36 trillion in debt. House Republicans have pledged to find between $1.5 trillion and $2 trillion in cost savings in other areas to offset the cost of Trump's new priorities and put the U.S. on a better fiscal path. The tax legislation also increases the maximum allowed child tax credit (CTC) from $2,000 to $2,500, and includes added tax relief for small business owners who file their company under individual income tax brackets. It also includes a modest victory for blue state Republicans in increasing the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap from $10,000 to $30,000 for both single filers and married couples. Married taxpayers filing separately get a cap of $15,000. That maximum amount gets phased out if a person's income exceeds $400,000, back down to $10,000 once a person's income hits $500,000. SALT deductions are primarily aimed at helping people in high-cost-of-living areas, particularly people in the suburbs of Democratic strongholds like New York and Los Angeles. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Republicans representing those areas have said increasing the $10,000 SALT deduction cap is critical to them remaining in office – and therefore to the GOP keeping the House majority. Several SALT Caucus Republicans balked at a $30,000 cap last week, blasting it as insufficient. It's not clear if they will hold up the final bill over it. At least one member of their group, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital she could agree to the new threshold. The Monday release comes after Republicansunveiled a portionof their tax plan over the weekend. Other details like SALT deduction caps and potential new tax brackets were still being worked out.

    "article_text": "Members of the clergy protested in front of an ICE facility in Newark, New Jersey on Monday, May 12. Agitators were seen clashing with police and several people were arrested. Dozens of clergy members protested outside anICE facilityin Newark, N.J., on Monday, saying they would continue to block the gates accessing the facility until they are arrested. The group is composed of roughly 50 clergy members from Faith in N.J. and Faith in Action. They linked arms outside the main gate of Delaney Hall Detention Center as they chanted and sang songs. Several speakers also said prayers for the inmates inside the facility and condemned their detention. The clergy members say they have \"volunteered\" to be arrested and that they will attempt to enter the ICE facility. NEWARK MAYOR ARRESTED AS DEM CONGRESS MEMBERS STORM NEW JERSEY ICE PRISON TO CONDUCT ‘OVERSIGHT VISIT’ Security personnel stand in front of Delaney Hall, a recently re-opened immigration detention center, in Newark, N.J.(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) An ambulance was turned away from entering a gated area that the protesters were blocking on Monday because authorities feared the protesters might rush in if the gate were opened. One protester told Fox News nobody called the ambulance, calling it a tactic to get them to move. \"There was no danger there,\" he said. \"We're not going to be moved. We'll be here as long as it takes until people start to realize this is not acceptable.\" By around 5 p.m., events began to flare up as employees of the facility attempted to drive out of the gated area. Police moved protesters out of the way, though the protesters would resist and oppose to being touched. At least two protesters were arrested by Newark police during the event. Newark Public Safety Director Emanuel Miranda said the two individuals who were arrested face obstruction and resisting arrest charges. One officer suffered a minor laceration to the arm during the incident, though he will remain on duty. No other injuries were reported. WHITE HOUSE BLASTS DEMS ‘CROSSING THE LINE’ BY STORMING ICE FACILITY In response to Fox News' reporting on the events on Monday, Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin asked, \"Who do they want released from Delaney Hall? The child rapists, murderers, drug traffickers, MS-13 gang members or known terrorists?\" \"This was a cheap political stunt by the Democrats and by these protesters,\" she said. \"We're not having it. They put law enforcement officers at risk. They put our staff in the facility at risk and put the detainees at risk. You saw that they didn't even let an ambulance through. This is not something that this administration is going to put up with. And that's part of the reason that this mayor was arrested. You can't just storm a detention facility and assault law enforcement officers with impunity.\" McLaughlin's comments come after the ICE director told Fox that 75% of the detainees at the facility have either committed a crime, are convicted of a crime, or have pending criminal charges. Recent polling shows an overwhelming majority of Americans, 83%, support deporting at least some illegal immigrants, according to thePew Research Center. Roughly 32% of Americans say they support deporting all illegal immigrants, and of those who only support deporting some, 97% are in favor of removing any who have committed violent crimes. ICE FACILITY DEMOCRATS ‘STORMED’ HOLDS CHILD RAPISTS, MURDERERS: OFFICIALS A trio ofDemocratic lawmakerswho participated in the \"storming\" of Delaney Hall last week doubled down on their actions this week, arguing the Trump administration is \"weaponizing law enforcement.\" Members of Congress bust into ICE detention facility in New Jersey.(X / @RepBonnie) The protest comes days afterDemocratic lawmakersand protesters on Friday stormed the gate of the facility. Meanwhile, McLaughlin has said the detention center is housing \"murderers, terrorists, child rapists and MS-13 gang members.\" The Department of Homeland Security posted on social media about the identities of several inmates. \"The allegations by Newark politicians that Delaney does not have the proper permitting is false. Meet who the New Jersey lawmakers are fighting for,\" the DHS wrote. Reps. LaMonica McIver, Bonnie Watson Coleman and Rob Menendez, all Democrats from New Jersey, made the comments during a joint appearance on CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday. \"Chaos ensued when someone on the phone above the leaders of ICE who were with us at that facility instructed them to go out of the facility, go to the private property and lock the mayor of the largest city in the state of New Jersey up,\" Coleman said. \"That's absurd. That's un-American. That's scary. That's determination to intimidate people in this country,\" she added, claiming the administration is \"lying at all levels.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was also present and was arrested and charged with trespassing.

    "article_text": "Health and Human Services secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. calls out Democrats being paid off by pharmaceutical companies preventing drug price cuts. EXCLUSIVE:The chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee is accusing Democrats of lying about PresidentDonald Trump's\"big, beautiful bill.\" Chairman Brett Guthrie, R-Ky., told Fox News Digital on Monday he believed Democrats had been waging a \"fear campaign to scare Americans\" ever since Republicans began discussions about the budget reconciliation process. \"Now, Democrats are pedaling incorrect reports that include policies that aren’t even in the bill,\" Guthrie said. \"This bill refocuses Medicaid on mothers, children, people with disabilities, and the elderly – not illegal immigrants and capable adults who choose not to work.\" ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION House Energy & Commerce Committee Chairman Brett Guthrie has accused Democrats of fearmongering on Medicaid.(Getty Images) The Kentucky Republican was specifically referring to his panel's portion of Trump's bill, the text of which wasreleased late on Sunday night. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which has broad jurisdiction, including over federal health programs, telecommunications and energy, was tasked with finding at least $880 billion in spending cuts to pay for other priorities in the bill. It's the largest share of any of the 11 committees involved in the reconciliation process – some of which have been given additional funding to enact Trump's priorities on tax cuts, defense, immigration and the border. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), however, said on Monday the legislation would likely achieve even more savings than its $880 billion benchmark. Guthrie himself told Republicans on a lawmaker-only call on Sunday night that the committee found \"north of $900 billion\" in savings, a source told Fox News Digital. Democrats immediately seized on the legislation as what they saw as a smoking gun of Republican plans to cut Medicaid. But the details released on Sunday night appear to show House GOP leaders veered away from the much more severe cuts to the low-income healthcare program that some conservative lawmakers were pushing. Ranking member Rep. Frank Pallone accused Republicans of trying to gut Medicaid.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) The legislation would put a new 80-hour-per-month work requirement on certain able-bodied adults receiving Medicaid, aged 19 through 64. It would also put guardrails on states spending funds on their expanded Medicaid populations. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) allowed states to expand Medicaid coverage to adults who make up to 138% of the poverty level. More specifically, states that provide Medicaid coverage to illegal immigrants could see their federal Medicaid reimbursement dollars diminished, putting more of that cost on the state itself. The bill would also require states with expanded Medicaid populations to perform eligibility checks every six months to ensure the system is not being abused. State Medicaid plans would be affected by a moratorium on any new state provider taxes, while freezing current rates where they are. State provider taxes are state-imposed fees on healthcare providers that help those states get more federal funding for Medicaid. BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY New Jersey Rep. Frank Pallone, the top Democrat on the committee, released a CBO projection requested by his own party that said at least 13.7 million people would lose health insurance based on a draft of Republicans' Medicaid proposals. \"Let’s be clear, Republican leadership released this bill under cover of night because they don’t want people to know their true intentions,\" Pallone said. \"This is not trimming fat from around the edges, it’s cutting to the bone. The overwhelming majority of the savings in this bill will come from taking healthcare away from millions of Americans.

The U.S.-chartered flight touched down at Dulles Airportin Virginiaon Monday afternoon, when Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau welcomed the group of Afrikaners. \"Faced with undeniable government-sponsored racial discrimination in South Africa, the first Afrikaner refugees have arrived in the United States,\" a senior State Department official said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital. \"The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program was intended for situations like this. Under President Trump's strong leadership, the State Department has helped to provide a new life for these refugees in America, where they will live in freedom, safety, and opportunity.\" TRUMP TO BRING WHITE AFRIKANERS TO US AS REFUGEES FROM SOUTH AFRICA, IN WAKE OF EXPROPRIATION LEGISLATION Katia Beeden, life coach and campaigner for White South Africans who want to apply for U.S. refugee status, poses for a picture at her residence in Fish Hoek, Cape Town, South Africa, on April 8, 2025.(REUTERS/Shafiek Tassiem/File Photo) PresidentDonald Trumpfirst initiated their resettlement with an executive order entitled, \"Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa,\" directing the State Department to bump up Afrikaners to the front of the line for resettlement. South Africans are now able to submit a statement of interest with the U.S. embassy in Pretoria, which will review the documents and contact those who are eligible for the interview process. Trump has virtually halted the refugee program for those from war- and famine-ravaged nations like Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. White South Africans say they have been denied jobs and targeted for violence on account of their race. Trump’s executive order came in response to a law passed by the South African government allowing it to take private land for public use, sometimes without compensation. Trump claimed the law would be used to target South Africa’s White minority Afrikaner group, descended from Dutch and other European settlers who arrived more than 300 years ago.

The Afrikaners’ arrival comes as Trump tries to push back on the racial politics of South Africa, where adviser Elon Musk grew up during apartheid.

Since apartheid ended in the 1990s, South Africa has sought to atone for segregationist policies, including with the land redistribution law signed in January. The policy came after a 2017 audit found that White South Africans owned three-quarters of individually-owned farms and agricultural property, while making up 7% of the population. Black South Africans had been denied the right to own prime agricultural land during the apartheid era.",

Arizona Democratic Sen.Ruben Gallegounveiled a border security and immigration reform plan that was immediately endorsed by several House Democrats. Gallego, the son of Mexican and Colombian immigrants, offered a \"five-pillar\" framework he said expresses his commitment to securing the southern border. \"We don’t have to choose between border security andimmigration reform,\" Gallego said. \"We can and should do both.\" STABLECOIN BILL, INITIALLY BIPARTISAN, HITS SNAG AS DEMS SPLINTER ICE officer and Sen.

It’s time to push forward and enact a plan that works,\" Gallego said. Typically seen as a Republican issue, Gallego’s border security plan combines GOP priorities like staffing-up the Border Patrol, with Democrats’ favored \"pathway to citizenship\" for select migrants, in part for economic benefit. Gallego’s plan also outlines asylum process reform by \"expedit[ing]\" people’s passage through the system and also seeking to enforce that other countries do their \"fair share\" to resettle asylum seekers and combat cartel violence and economic instability in their home areas.

    "title": "Federal judge's order for Trump to return deported migrant temporarily halted on appeal",
    "article_text": "Attorney Mehek Cooke explains why the Trump administration is using the Alien Enemies Act, and why federal judges have a range of opinions of the matter. A U.S. appeals court will reviewthe Trump administration's bidto avoid returning a 20-year-old Venezuelan asylum seeker who was deported to El Salvador earlier this year, keeping him in Salvadoran custody for now. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed last week to take up Trump's appeal – staying through May 15 a lower court's ruling that required the Trump administration to immediately return him to U.S. soil. The appeals court alsoordered plaintiffsin the case to submit their response to the court before noon on Monday. The Trump administration will have through 9 a.m. Tuesday to respond. At issue is the case of Daniel Lozano-Camargo, a 20-year-old Venezuelan national previously referred to in court documents as \"Cristian,\" who wasdeported to El Salvador in Marchin the Trump administration's early wave of Alien Enemies Act removals. FEDERAL JUDGE ORDERS RETURN OF DEPORTED MIGRANT TO US, REJECTING TRUMP REQUEST More than 250 individuals deported from the U.S. to El Salvador arrive by plane to the country, including alleged members of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, and members of the MS-13 gang, to be processed in the country's CECOT maximum security prison.(El Salvador Presidency / Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, a Trump appointee,ruled in Aprilthat his deportation violated an agreement the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) struck in 2024 with Lozano-Camargo and a group of young asylum seekers who had entered the U.S. as unaccompanied children. Under that agreement, DHS agreed not to deport the migrants in question until their requests for asylum could be fully adjudicated in U.S. court. Last month, Gallagher said Lozano-Camargo’s deportation was a \"breach of contract,\" since his asylum case had not yet been heard, and ordered the U.S. government to facilitate his release. A federal judge had ordered President Donald Trump's administration to facilitate the return of a migrant deported to El Salvador.(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) She reiterated that decision in court last week, rejecting a new filing from the Justice Department that said it had determined Lozano-Camargo was eligible for removal under the law, citing his earlierarrest and conviction for cocaine possessionin Houston this year. Justice Department officials claimed in earlier court documents that Lozano-Camargo was a member of a \"violent terrorist gang\" but have not linked him to Tren de Aragua. Portions of their most recent court filing have been redacted. Gallagher had specifically ordered the Trump administration to make a \"good faith request to the government of El Salvador\" to \"release Cristian, [or Lozano-Camargo], to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States to await the adjudication of his asylum application on the merits by USCIS,\" which it had not done. BOASBERG GRILLS DOJ OVER REMARKS FROM TRUMP AND NOEM, FLOATS MOVING MIGRANTS TO GITMO IN ACTION-PACKED HEARING A person holds up a sign referencing the Centre for Terrorism Confinement prison in El Salvador during a May Day demonstration against President Donald Trump and his immigration policies in Houston on May 1, 2025.(RONALDO SCHEMIDT / AFP) Gallagher emphasized in court last week that her decision has nothing to do with the strength of his asylum request, and is based solely on due process protections. \"I don’t think that this is a case about whether or not Cristian is going to eventually get asylum,\" shetold lawyers for the Trump administration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Process is important. We don’t skip to the end and say, ‘We all know how this is going to end so we’ll just skip that part,'\" she said. \"Whether he ultimately receives asylum is not the issue. The issue is – and has always been – one of process.\" Still, Gallagher agreed to stay her ruling for 48 hours, giving the administration time to appeal it to the higher court, which it did.

    "title": "Senate parliamentarian: Who is the unelected official getting say on Trump's 'big, beautiful bill?'",
    "article_text": "Bluestack Strategies founder Maura Gillespie joins ‘The Fox Report’ to break down Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s, R-Ga., announcement that she will not pursue a Senate run, and what it means for her political future. House and Senate Republicans have been working for months on a sweeping piece of legislation addressing a litany of PresidentDonald Trump's agenda items. Such a bill is possible via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party controlling Congress and the White House to pass broad policy overhauls while totally sidelining the minority. It lowers the Senate’s threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51, lining it up with the House’s simple majority rules. However, one of the caveats is that the measures tucked into the bill must deal with taxes, spending or the national debt. One key person gets the final say over what is relevant to that sphere – the Senate parliamentarian. The parliamentarian, who heads the Senate’s parliamentarian office, is a nonpartisan, unelected role appointed by the Senate majority leader. It does not have a fixed term. ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough will be advising Senate Republicans on President Donald Trump's \"big, beautiful bill.\"(Getty Images/Reuters) The person’s role is to advise the Senate and its staff on the chamber’s rules and precedent. The normally low-profile role has been thrust into the spotlight several times in congressional history, however, particularly surrounding reconciliation. \"At the end of the day, it really is a judgment call. And sometimes you're making a judgment call where you're relying on similar situations or maybe analogous situations where we dealt with reconciliation in the past, maybe other times you're dealing with a completely novel issue, and you’re having to figure it out,\" one former senior Senate aide described to Fox News Digital. \"Or maybe, and this happens a lot, people are trying get things through, debating or citing past provisions of previous reconciliation bills…saying ‘Hey, this provision is very similar, and this got through.’\" The Senate parliamentarian leads the \"Byrd bath,\" a key part of the reconciliation process where the legislation is carefully examined, and any measures found not relevant to the contours of reconciliation are stripped out. Notably, progressive Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., called for the firing of the Senate parliamentarian in 2021 when sheforced Senate Democratsto scuttle their $15 per hour minimum wage effort from their reconciliation bill at the time. That same parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, who was appointed by the late former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., is still serving today and has largely garnered bipartisan respect for her handling of the role. Congressional Republicans are using the budget reconciliation process.(Fox News Digital) MacDonough, appointed in 2012, is the first woman in the job. She was a part of the parliamentarian’s office before that and briefly served as an attorney in the Department of Justice, according to NPR. \"I would say that this particular parliamentarian sees herself more as, almost an administrative law judge, and I think that she has generally viewed some of the things that the Senate has been allowed to get away with in reconciliation as a departure from precedent,\" said Paul Winfree, president of the Economic Policy Innovation Center and a former Senate Budget Committee staffer himself, told Fox News Digital. \"I think that she has more of a ‘small-c’ conservative approach to what is allowable. At the same time, a lot of what is considered to be allowable under reconciliation is dependent on estimates that are produced by the Congressional Budget Office or the joint tax committee.\" When asked if any of the current public reconciliation plans could face issues with the parliamentarian, both people who spoke with Fox News Digital floated an accounting maneuver that would largely obscure the cost of permanently extending Trump’s 2017Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That scoring method, known as current policy baseline, would zero out the cost of extending the 2017 tax cuts by measuring it as an extension of the current economic conditions, rather than factoring in how much less the government is taking in via tax revenues with the cuts in effect. Senate Republicans have signaled they believe they have the legal basis for moving forward with that calculation, however, without the parliamentarian’s say. \"We think the law is very clear, and ultimately the budget committee chairman makes that determination,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters last month. HOUSE REPUBLICANS RELEASE TAX PLAN FOR TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' Senate Majority Leader Sen. John Thune said Republicans can use the current policy baseline for scoring tax cuts.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) The Senate GOP aide who spoke with Fox News Digital said, \"If that were to have fallen out or just, you didn't know what was going to happen, that would just affect so many provisions in the bill.\" \"Because all of a sudden, you know, all these things start scoring [as an increase to the deficit]…and things become more problematic with your instructions,\" the former aide said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Winfree, however, said Republicans have appeared to be mindful overall with how they have written the text so far. \"They’ve actually been pretty conservative in how they’ve approached the language,\" he said. He said it was \"possible some of the immigration provisions could get a second look,\" but that even then, he believed it would \"ultimately be okay.\" Republican leaders have said they hope to have a bill on Trump’s desk by Fourth of July.

    "article_text": "Scott Feltman, executive vice president of One Israel Fund said some believe President Trump may want to help Israel become independent so it won’t have to rely on U.S. support in case it’s faced with a more hostile administration in the future. PresidentDonald Trumpwill visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week to advance a flurry of high-stakes negotiations, but his trip comes as cracks seem to have appeared in his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. On the agenda are reviving hostage talks with Israel and Hamas, exploring an off-ramp for the Russia-Ukraine war and potentially a civil nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia, even if the kingdom refuses to normalize ties with Israel. However, an apparent chill betweenTrump and Netanyahuhas grabbed the attention of Middle East watchers. Yanir Cozin, a correspondent for Israeli Army Radio, claimed this week that Trump had \"cut contact\" with the Israeli leader. That report has not been independently confirmed, but it aligns with an emerging perception in Israeli political circles that the Trump-Netanyahu axis may be fraying. 4TH ROUND OF US-IRAN TALKS ENDS AS TRUMP SET TO EMBARK ON HISTORIC MIDDLE EAST TOUR President Donald Trump, right, meets with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a meeting where Trump announced nuclear talks with Iran, Washington, D.C., April 7, 2025( REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt) \"There's always a method to the president's madness, so to speak,\" said Scott Feltman, executive vice president of the One Israel Fund. \"There is a prevailing thought that [Trump] very much wants Israel to stand on its own two feet… To some extent, he may be giving the prime minister a little bit of tough love.\" Sourcestold ReutersTrump is prepared to move forward with a civil nuclear deal with Riyadh even if Saudi Arabia holds off on normalizing relations with Israel – a dramatic shift from both his first administration and Biden’s, which had tied such deals to broader normalization goals. For Israel, that shift may be unsettling. Riyadh has long insisted on the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition for full ties with Israel, an outcome Netanyahu has rejected. Over the weekend, it was revealed Trump was in talks with Doha officials about a potential deal for Qatar toloan the U.S. a jetto replace Air Force One. Israeli supporters have long been skeptical of Qatar, claiming it has ties to Hamas. Meanwhile, frustration in Jerusalem grew this week when the U.S. reached a ceasefire agreement with Yemen’s Houthi militants. The deal, brokered without Israeli input, required the Houthis to halt attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes but made no mention of their assaults on Israel. \"Trump, to a large extent, basically threw Israel under the bus,\" said Avi Melamed, a former Israeli intelligence official and regional analyst. \"I think the Israeli government is puzzled, embarrassed … particularly in the context of the Houthis.\" Netanyahu made clear Israel would not rely on the U.S. to handle the Houthi threat. \"Israel will defend itself by its own forces,\" he said Thursday, with Defense Minister Israel Katz echoing that position. TRUMP SAYS LAST LIVING AMERICAN HOSTAGE EDAN ALEXANDER WILL BE RELEASED BY HAMAS U.S. and Saudi flags flutter on the major highways of Riyadh ahead of the arrival of President Donald Trump to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on May 12, 2025.(REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed) Despite the rhetoric, the U.S. continues to support Israel’s defenses. On Friday, a U.S. THAAD missile system intercepted rockets fired toward Israel by Houthi forces. \"The United States isn’t required to get permission from Israel to make some type of arrangement that would get the Houthis from firing on our ships,\" U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee told Israel’s Channel 12 this week. However, Huckabee shot down any report of tensions between the two world leaders. \"It’s reckless & irresponsible for press to allege that @POTUS and @IsraeliPM are not getting along,\"Huckabeesaid in a post on X. \"Bibi has spent more time with @realDonaldTrump than I have in past 3 months & I’m his ambassador! The relationship between US & Israel remains STRONG!\" \"Israel has had no better friend in its history than President Trump. We continue to work closely with our ally Israel to ensure remaining hostages in Gaza are freed, Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon, and to strengthen regional security in the Middle East,\" National Security Council spokesman James Hewitt told Fox News Digital in response to the reports of tensions. \"It’s reckless & irresponsible for press to allege that @POTUS and @IsraeliPM are not getting along,\" U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, left, said.(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Other experts caution against reading too much into the friction. \"The Israelis never had any false impressions that the U.S. was striking the Houthis to defend Israel,\" said Gregg Roman of the Middle East Forum. \"It was to protect global commerce... And it’s not like the U.S. has abandoned Israel.\" Roman also downplayed tensions over the potential Saudi nuclear deal. \"I think a saferSaudi Arabia, at the end of the day, will lead to a safer Israel.\" Adding to the regional uncertainty is Netanyahu’s silence on Iran. While his government has tallied recent gains against Iranian proxies – Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Assad regime – he has so far refrained from weighing in publicly on nuclear negotiations with Tehran. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Still, Netanyahu says he remains in close contact with the Trump team about Iran. \"I said to President Trump that I hope that this is what the negotiators will do,\" he recently told reporters. \"We’re in close contact with the United States. But I said one way or the other—Iran will not have nuclear weapons.\" Trump \"is not scheduled to visit Israel on this trip, and I actually think that that might very well be a good thing, because he may find that he hears from the Sunni states that they're just as upset about the path that is taking place right now with negotiations with Iran,\" said Feltman.\"They have just as much to lose from a nuclear Iranian regime.\"",

The Department of Homeland Security issued subpoenas to the government of California on Monday seeking records related to alleged disbursements of federal funds to illegal immigrants. ICE's Homeland Security Investigations [HSI] office inLos Angelesfiled the subpoenas this week, targeting the state's Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants [CAPI].

DHS Sec.Kristi Noemcriticized California politicians in a statement, saying, \"Radical left politicians in California prioritize illegal aliens over our own citizens, including by giving illegal aliens access to cash benefits.

PresidentDonald Trumpdeclared Monday that the U.S. \"will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma\" as he signed an executive order implementing what his administration is calling \"most favored nations drug pricing.\" \"The principle is simple – whatever the lowest price paid for a drug in other developed countries, that is the price that Americans will pay,\" Trump said at the White House. \"Some prescription drug and pharmaceutical prices will be reduced almost immediately by 50 to 80 to 90%.\" Trump said that \"starting today, the United States will no longer subsidize thehealthcareof foreign countries, which is what we were doing. We're subsidizing others’ healthcare, the countries where they paid a small fraction of what for the same drug that what we pay many, many times more for and will no longer tolerate profiteering and price gouging from Big Pharma.\" \"Even though the United States is home to only 4% of the world's population, pharmaceutical companies make more than two thirds of their profits in America. So think of that with 4% of the population, the pharmaceutical companies make most of their money. Most of their profits from America. That's not a good thing,\" Trump continued. TRUMP SAYS HE WILL SLASH DRUG PRICES WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER President Donald Trump, accompanied by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., left, speaks during a swearing-in ceremony for Dr. Mehmet Oz as the Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator in the Oval Office at the White House on April 18, 2025.(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) \"I think, by the way, pharmaceutical – I have great respect for these companies and for the people that run them. I really do, and I think they did one of the greatest jobs in history for their company, convincing people for many years that this was a fair system. Nobody really understood why, but I figured it out. For years, pharmaceutical and drug companies have said that research and development costs were what they are, and for no reason whatsoever, they had to be borne by America alone,\" Trump said. \"Not anymore, they don't.\" TheWhite House saidthat the executive order \"directs the U.S. Trade Representative and Secretary of Commerce to take action to ensure foreign countries are not engaged in practices that purposefully and unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes in the United States. \"The Order instructs the Administration to communicate price targets to pharmaceutical manufacturers to establish that America, the largest purchaser and funder of prescription drugs in the world, gets the best deal,\" the White House said. \"The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a mechanism through which American patients can buy their drugs directly from manufacturers who sell to Americans at a ‘Most-Favored-Nation’ price, bypassing middlemen,\" the White House added. \"If drug manufacturers fail to offer most-favored-nation pricing, the Order directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to: (1) propose rules that impose most-favored-nation pricing; and (2) take other aggressive measures to significantly reduce the cost of prescription drugs to the American consumer and end anticompetitive practices.\" Health and Human Services SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.said alongside Trump, \"I never thought that this would happen in my lifetime.\" \"I have a couple of kids who are Democrats, are big Bernie Sanders fans. And when I told them that this was going to happen, they had tears in their eyes. Because they thought, this is never going to happen,\" he said. \"And we finally have a president who is willing to stand up for the American people.\" MAHA CAUCUS MEMBER PLEDGES HEARINGS INTO ‘CORRUPTION’ OF A PUBLIC HEALTH SECTOR ‘CAPTURED BY BIG PHARMA’ Bottles of medicine ride on a belt at a mail-in pharmacy warehouse in Florence, New Jersey, in July 2018.(AP/Julio Cortez) Trump said earlier this morning that drug prices would be \"cut by 59%.\" The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America trade group opposes the order, saying, \"This Foreign First Pricing scheme is a bad deal for American patients.\" \"Importing foreign prices will cut billions of dollars from Medicare with no guarantee that it helps patients or improves their access to medicines,\" the group’s president, Stephen Ubl, said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. \"It will jeopardize the hundreds of billions our member companies are planning to invest in America, making us more reliant on China for innovative medicines.\" President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, D.C.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"To lower costs for Americans, we need to address the real reasons U.S. patients are paying more for their medicines. We are the only country in the world that lets PBMs, insurers and hospitals take 50% of every dollar spent on medicines,\" Ubl also said. \"In fact, hospital markups in 340B and the rebates and fees paid to middlemen in the U.S. often exceed the total cost of medicines oversees. Giving more of this money to patients will lower their medicine costs and reduce the gap with European prices.\" Fox News Digital’s Greg Wehner contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt discusses President Donald Trump's 90-day tariff deal with China, his visit to the Middle East, Qatar's jet offer and an executive order to slash drug prices. PresidentDonald Trumpdefended the U.S. preparing to accept a jumbo jet gift from Qatar's royal family to serve as a temporary Air Force One as Boeing failed to roll out a new Air Force One fleet in a timely manner. \"We're very disappointed that it's taking Boeing so long to build a new Air Force One,\" Trump said during a press conference on drug prices Monday morning. \"You know, we have an Air Force One that's 40 years old. And if you take a look at that, compared to the new plane of the equivalent, you know, stature at the time, it's not even the same ballgame.\" \"When I first came in, I signed an order to get (the new Air Force One fleet) built,\" he continued. \"I took it over from the Obama administration, they had originally agreed. I got the price down much lower. And then, when the election didn't exactly work out the way that it should have, a lot of work was not done on the plane because a lot of people didn't know they made change orders. That was so stupid, so ridiculous. And it ended up being a total mess, a real mess.\" Reports spread Sunday morning that the Trump administration was expected to accept a $400 million Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar's royal family. ABC News reported that Trump would use the jet until the end of his term, when it would be given to his presidential library. QATAR OFFERS TRUMP JUMBO JET TO SERVE AS AIR FORCE ONE President Donald Trump defended the U.S. accepting a jumbo jet gift from Qatar's royal family to serve as a temporary Air Force One as Boeing failed to roll out a new Air Force One fleet in a timely manner.(Evan Vucci/The Associated Press) Trump confirmed Sunday evening on Truth Social that the Department of Defense would receive the 747 as a gift, while railing against Democrats as \"world class losers\" for criticizing the gift. \"So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,\" Trump wrote. \"Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA.\" He continued in the press conference Monday that when he returned to office in January, his administration informed him construction on two new Air Force Ones was \"way behind\" on the schedule for completion. TRUMP TEASES 'VERY, VERY BIG ANNOUNCEMENT' AHEAD OF MIDDLE EAST TRIP, CARNEY SAYS HE'S 'ON EDGE OF MY SEAT' \"If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they're building the other ones. I think that was a very nice gesture. Now, I could be a stupid person to say, 'Oh, no, we don't want a free plane.' We give free things, we'll take one, two, and it helps us out. Because again, we're talking about we have a 40-year-old aircraft. The money we spend, the maintenance we spend on those planes to keep them tippy-top is astronomical,\" he added, calling the gift a \"great gesture from Qatar.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also brushed off concern over the Qatari royal family donating a Boeing jumbo jet to the U.S. Department of Defense, arguing on Monday there will be no quid pro quo arrangement and that the donation is under legal review to ensure full compliance with the law. Air Force One departs the tarmac.(Getty Images) \"The Qatari Government has graciously offered to donate aplane to theDepartment of Defense,\" Leavitt said on \"Fox & Friends\" Monday morning. \"The legal details of that are still being worked out. But, of course, any donation to this government is always done in full compliance with the law, and we commit ourselves to the utmost transparency, and we will continue to do that.\" TRUMP STAFFERS LOAD BOXES OF ITEMS SEIZED BY FBI IN 2022 MAR-A-LAGO RAID ONTO AIR FORCE ONE When asked if the administration was worried that accepting the gift could lead to a quid pro quo situation where Qatar expects something in return, Leavitt shot down such a narrative. \"Absolutely not because they know President Trump, and they know he only works with the interests of the American public in mind,\" Leavitt responded. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump step off Air Force One.(Getty Images) Rep. Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., wrote to the Government Accountability Office on Sunday, calling for an ethics investigation into the gift, claiming it would be the single most expensive gift ever received by a U.S. president. \"I am writing to express alarm over reports that President Donald Trump is poised to accept a luxury aircraft — a Boeing 747-8 — from thegovernment of Qatar,\"Torres wrote. \"The plane, so opulent it has been described as a ‘palace in the sky,’ is set to be made available to President Trump for official use as Air Force One and then for private use once he leaves office.\" \"This ‘flying grift’ is merely the latest chapter in a tawdry tale of presidential profiteering unprecedented in American history,\" Torres added. A Boeing 747-8 sits on the tarmac.(Getty Images) Presidents have for decades circumvented the Emoluments Clause — which prohibits federal elected officials from accepting gifts from foreign governments or monarchs — by classifying gifts they receive while in office as gifts to the office of the president. Those gifts are then cataloged and stored as part of their presidential libraries after leaving office. While presidents maintain some level of access to the items in their libraries, they do not own them directly and must purchase them from the federal government in order to secure private ownership. Leavitt said in a comment to Fox Digital Monday morning that all gifts received by a foreign government would be above board and in compliance with the law.

A Trump administration official confirmed to Fox News Digital that the plane will not be presented to the president nor accepted by Trump during his trip abroad. The current Air Force One fleet includes two aging planes, both of which are more than 30 years old and have been eyed for replacement since at least the Obama administration.

Trump in 2018 awarded Boeing a $3.9 billion fixed-price agreement to manufacture two new jets. The construction of the jets, however, is not expected to be completed until 2029. \"Boeing is proud to build the next generation of Air Force One, providing American Presidents with a flying White House at outstanding value to taxpayers,\" Boeing said in 2018 after ironing out a deal with Trump for the creation of the new fleet. \"President Trump negotiated a good deal on behalf of the American people.\" \"The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar's Ministry of Defense and the U.S. Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,\" Qatari embassy official Ali Al-Ansaritold ABC NewsSunday.

China has agreed to \"open itself up to American business\" following trade negotiations between Washington, D.C., and Beijing on Saturday, according to PresidentDonald Trump. The arrangement was arguably the most significant development stemming from the trade negotiations, Trump told reporters Monday atthe White House. Plans have yet to be finalized and \"papered,\" but Trump said that China is on board with the agreement. \"The biggest thing to me is the opening up,\" Trump told reporters Monday during an announcement regarding an executive order on drug prices in the U.S. \"It would be, I think it would be fantastic for our businesses if we could go in and compete and compete with China.

We don't. I mean, they have very few restrictions. and they didn't open their country to us, never made sense to them. It's not fair. And they've agreed to open China fully open…and I think it's going to be fantastic.\" Treasury SecretaryScott Bessent launched trade negotiationswith China in Geneva on Saturday, resulting in a deal that would temporarily ease up on tariffs for 90 days. Specifically, the trade deal stipulates that the U.S. will cut down its tariffs against Chinese imports from 145% to 30%. Likewise, China will reduce its tariffs against U.S. imports from 125% to 10%. However, tariffs against someChinese importswill not lighten up, according to Trump. Existing tariffs against cars, steel and aluminum will still remain in place, he said. Meanwhile, Bessent signaled that more talks with China would occur in the near future and that both Washington and Beijing would like to continue advancing negotiations. \"I would imagine that in the next few weeks, we will be meeting again to get rolling on a more fulsome agreement,\" Bessent said in an interview Monday morning with CNBC.

Bessent previously warned that the tariffs could cost China up to 10 million jobs, and said that it was up to Beijing whether it would loosen up the tariffs or not. \"I think that over time we will see that the Chinese tariffs are unsustainable for China,\" Bessent told reporters at the White House on April 29. \"I've seen some very large numbers over the past few days that show if these numbers stay on, Chinese could lose 10 million jobs very quickly.

    "article_text": "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the 'Decoding Broken Hearts' initiative on 'Special Report.' A simple selfie could hold hidden clues to one’s biological age — and even how long they’ll live. That’s according to researchers from Mass General Brigham, who developed a deep-learning algorithm called FaceAge. Using a photo of someone’s face, theartificial intelligence toolgenerates predictions of the subject’s biological age, which is the rate at which they are aging as opposed to their chronological age. MUSIC CONDUCTOR WITH PARKINSON’S SEES SYMPTOMS IMPROVE WITH DEEP BRAIN STIMULATION FaceAge also predicts survival outcomes forpeople with cancer, according to a press release from MGB. A simple selfie could hold hidden clues to one’s biological age — and even how long they’ll live.(iStock) The AI tool was trained on 58,851 photos of \"presumed healthy individuals from public datasets,\" the release stated. To test the tool’s accuracy, the researchers used it to analyze photos of 6,196 cancer patients taken beforeradiotherapy treatment. Among the people with cancer, the tool generated a higher biological age that was about five years higher than their chronological age. PARALYZED MAN WITH ALS IS THIRD TO RECEIVE NEURALINK IMPLANT, CAN TYPE WITH BRAIN The researchers also tested the tool’s ability to predict thelife expectancyof 100 people receiving palliative care based on their photos, then compared it to 10 clinicians’ predictions. FaceAge was found to be more accurate than the clinicians’ predictions. The researchers’ findings were published in The Lancet Digital Health. Mass General Brigham developed a deep-learning algorithm called FaceAge, which generates predictions of the subject’s biological age from a photo.(Mass General Brigham) \"We can use artificial intelligence to estimate a person’s biological age from face pictures, and our study shows that information can be clinically meaningful,\" said co-senior and corresponding author Hugo Aerts, PhD, director of the Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) program at Mass General Brigham, in the release. \"This work demonstrates that a photo like a simple selfie contains important information that could help to inform clinical decision-making and care plans forpatients and clinicians,\" he went on. WOMAN SAYS CHATGPT SAVED HER LIFE BY HELPING DETECT CANCER, WHICH DOCTORS MISSED \"How old someone looks compared to their chronological age really matters — individuals with FaceAges that are younger than their chronological ages do significantly better after cancer therapy.\" The goal is for the tool to help eliminate any bias that may influence a doctor’s care decisions based on the perception of a patient’s appearance and age. \"While FaceAge may outperform clinicians in some survival predictions, it should augment human judgment, not override it.\" The researchers noted thatmore researchis needed before the tool could be rolled out for clinical use. Future studies will include different hospitals and cancer patients at various stages of the disease, according to the release. Researchers will also evaluate FaceAge’s ability to predict diseases, general health status and lifespan. To test the tool’s accuracy, the researchers used it to analyze photos of 6,196 cancer patients taken before radiotherapy treatment.(iStock) \"This opens the door to a whole new realm of biomarker discovery from photographs, and its potential goes far beyondcancer careor predicting age,\" said co-senior author Ray Mak, MD, a faculty member in the AIM program at Mass General Brigham, in the release. \"As we increasingly think of different chronic diseases as diseases of aging, it becomes even more important to be able to accurately predict an individual’s aging trajectory. I hope we can ultimately use this technology as an early detection system in a variety of applications, within a strong regulatory and ethical framework, to help save lives.\" Dr. Harvey Castro, a board-certified emergency medicine physician and national speaker on artificial intelligence based in Dallas, Texas, was not involved in FaceAge’s development but shared his comments on the tool. ARE FULL-BODY SCANS WORTH THE MONEY? DOCTORS SHARE WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW \"As an emergency physician and AI futurist, I see both the promise and peril of AI tools like FaceAge,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"What excites me is that FaceAge structures the clinical instinct we call the ‘eyeball test’ — a gut sense of how sick someone looks. Now,machine learningcan quantify that assessment with surprising accuracy.\" Among the people with cancer, the tool generated a higher biological age that was about five years higher than their chronological age.(iStock) Castro predicts that FaceAge could help doctors better personalize treatment plans or prioritize palliative care in oncology — \"where resilience matters more than a birthdate.\" The doctor emphasized, however, that caution is key.

Sinner has won three grand slams, all of which have come since the 2024 Australian Open, and has quickly turned himself into the best player on the planet. At age 23, Sinner has skyrocketed through the world rankings, and has won back-to-back grand slams. But it doesn't sound like he's visiting Pope Leo XIV any time soon. Pope Leo XIV delivers the Regina Caeli prayer from the main central loggia balcony of St Peter's basilica in the Vatican, on May 11, 2025.(Alberto Pizzoli/AFP via Getty Images) In the pope's defense, he does have a halfway decent excuse to exclude Sinner. Back in February, he was given athree-month suspensionby the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) after twice testing positive for a banned anabolic steroid nearly a year ago. The ban came just weeks after the Italian tennis pro won his third Grand Slam title – the suspension, though, avoided any Grand Slams. It was found that Sinner had not intentionally used abanned substancefor competitive gain. Sinner tested positive for low levels of metabolite of clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid that can be used for ophthalmological and dermatological use, in March 2024. Eight days after the Indian Wells tournament, Sinner tested positive again in an out-of-competition sample. According to the ITIA’s initial findings, Sinner explained that he had tested positive after receiving a massage from a trainer who had used an over-the-counter spray that contained clostebol to treat a small wound after cutting his own finger.

    "title": "Over 2,800 websites used to spread AMOS malware",
    "article_text": "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says hackers are using CAPTCHAs to infect your PC with malware. Ransomware gangs once thrived on infected email attachments and bogus invoices, but security-savvy users and hardened mail gateways have weakened those tactics. Attackers are now focusing on a subtler trick that targets the small checkbox labeled \"I'm not a robot\" that most people click without thinking. A widespread campaign known as MacReaper has compromised more than 2,800 legitimate websites and redirects visitors to an infection process designed specifically for Apple computers. The operation relies on visual trust signals, including a convincing fake of Google’s reCAPTCHA, along with hidden clipboard code that ends with the installation of Atomic macOS Stealer malware, a data-harvesting infostealer distributed through Telegram. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A woman working on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) When a Mac user visits one of the compromised websites, they don't see the page they were expecting. Instead, the site displays a full-screen imitation of Google's familiar reCAPTCHA box. This fake reCAPTCHA appears harmless, simply asking the user to click \"I'm not a robot.\" However, when the user clicks the box, a hidden command is silently copied to their clipboard. Immediately afterward, the page displays a friendly message, complete with familiar macOS keyboard shortcut visuals, explicitly instructing the user to open Terminal and paste what they've just copied. If the user follows these instructions, the command downloads and runs the malicious file known as Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS). This trick is specifically targeted at Mac users. The website checks the visitor's operating system and only activates the attack if it detects macOS. For Windows or Linux users, the site behaves normally. Researchers have dubbed this infection method \"ClickFix,\" referencing the single click that initiates the attack chain. At the center of this campaign is AMOS, a sophisticated piece of malware that has become notorious in cybercrime circles. AMOS is available for rent on Telegram, with some versions costing attackers up to $3,000 per month. Once installed, AMOS can steal a wide array of sensitive data: it can extract Wi-Fi and app passwords stored in Keychain, collect browser cookies and autofill data, list system information and scan through personal folders such as Desktop and Documents. It is also capable of identifying and targeting more than 50 types of cryptocurrency wallets. Fake reCAPTCHA (Cyber Security News)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MacReaper challenges two widely held beliefs. The first is that everyday CAPTCHA checks are just harmless speed bumps. The second is that macOS provides a level of built-in security that keeps most attackers at bay. In reality, a single click can expose Keychain credentials, active browser sessions and cryptocurrency wallets. These are exactly the kinds of targets that attract credential-stuffing groups and profit-driven cybercriminals. Because the attack is triggered by the user, many network monitoring tools treat the traffic as normal, leaving security teams with little to investigate. In environments where Macs and Windows machines share identity systems, one compromised Mac can open access to single sign-on portals, cloud storage and even production codebases. A woman working on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS To protect yourself from the evolving threat of the MacReaper attack, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures. 1) Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts:Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to copy commands or paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it's likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it. 2) Don't click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:Many MacReaper attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company's official website instead of clicking any links inside the email. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 3) Enable two-factor authentication:Enabletwo-factor authenticationwhenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password. 4) Keep devices updated:Regularlyupdating your operating system, browser and security softwareensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected. 5) Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:If you've interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don't recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 6) Invest in a personal data removal service:Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from MacReaper or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. MASSIVE SECURITY FLAW PUTS MOST POPULAR BROWSERS AT RISK ON MAC MacReaper makes it clear that the most durable exploits aren't zero-days but borrowed moments of trust, an authentic-looking CAPTCHA, a helpful-sounding fix, a clipboard that does what it's told. As Apple tightens the technical screws with Rapid Security Responses and notarization, expect adversaries to double down on such psychological levers. The counter-strategy is to hard-bake healthy skepticism into user behavior and to instrument Macs with the same telemetry layers enterprises already expect from Windows. Security, in other words, has finally become a platform-agnostic muscle, and complacency is the riskiest operating system of all.

    "title": "Hackers can steal money and make your bank account look intact",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says business email compromise scams are a serious threat. Hackers have become increasingly sophisticated in targeting bank accounts, sometimes stealing money without the account holder realizing it right away. This raises an unsettling concern among many: could someone actually drain your bank account while making it appear as though your balance remains untouched? As Bruce from Phoenix asks, \"Is it true that hackers can wipe out your bank account but make it look like the money is still there?\" The short answer is yes, though it’s rare and requires a high level of skill. Still, even the possibility is alarming, especially when you consider how easily people can fall victim to common tactics hackers use to gain access to accounts in the first place. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! A hacker at work(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) There’s a long list of methods cybercriminals use to get into people’s financial accounts, and most of them don’t involve \"hacking\" in the Hollywood sense. Instead, they rely on tricking you into handing over sensitive information. Here are some of the most common techniques. Fake banking apps and mobile trojans:Some apps are designed to look exactly like your bank’s official app, but they’re actually fakes. If you enter your login info, it goes straight to the scammer. Even more advanced aremobile banking trojans, which hide inside seemingly unrelated apps. Once installed, the trojan watches for when you open your real banking app and then quickly overlays a fake login screen. If you type in your credentials, the trojan grabs them and sends them off to the attacker. Phishing scams:Scammerssend emails or textsthat appear to be from your bank, asking you to verify a transaction or log in to resolve an issue. These messages often include links to websites that look identical to your bank’s site but are actually fakes. The giveaway is often a small detail, like a misspelled URL. For example, \"captial0ne.com\" instead of \"capitalone.com.\" Keyloggers:Keyloggersare a type of malware that silently records everything you type. If one gets onto your device, it can capture your banking username, password and anything else you type, all without you knowing. Man-in-the-middle attacks:Theseattackshappen when hackers intercept the data being transmitted between you and your bank’s website. This is especially risky if you’re onpublic Wi-Fi.You may think you're logging in securely, but a hacker could be watching everything or even redirecting you to a fake version of your bank's site. SIM swapping:SIMswappingis where a scammer contacts your phone provider, pretends to be you and asks to transfer your number to a new SIM card. If successful, they receive your text messages, including any verification codes sent by your bank. This gives them access to your account, even if two-factor authentication is turned on. A person using a bank card to shop via laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) SNEAKY SCAMMERS DRAIN BANK ACCOUNT IN SINISTER PHONE PHISHING SCHEME This is where it gets unsettling. In rare cases, hackers can actually make it look like your bank balance hasn’t changed, even though they’ve already taken the money. How? By targeting the display layer of your banking app or web interface. If malware is installed on your device, it can manipulate what shows up on the screen. That means your balance might look normal, while your actual funds are long gone. This type of attack is extremely rare and usually requires access to a compromised or jailbroken device, but it’s technically possible and just sophisticated enough to delay you from realizing what happened. Bank alert notification on smartphone(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) PREVENTING THIS INSIDIOUS EMAIL FORWARDING SCAM THAT WILL DRAIN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT The good news? You don’t need to be a cybersecurity expert to protect yourself. Just following these key steps can dramatically reduce your risk. 1) Use official apps only:Cybercriminals will try to trick you with fake banking apps and mobile trojans that overlay fake login screens, so it’s critical to download banking apps exclusively from the Apple App Store or Google Play. Never install apps from links in emails or texts. 2) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): SIM-swapping attacks can hijack your phone number and intercept SMS codes, so enable app-based2FAto block unauthorized logins even if hackers obtain your password. 3) Get text or app alerts:Hackers can manipulate your account’s display to hide stolen funds, so set up real-time transaction alerts to expose unauthorized withdrawals immediately, especially for microtransactions used to test your account. 4) Use strong, unique passwords:Phishing scams and keyloggers often harvest weak or reused credentials, so use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about mybest expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here. 5) Avoid clicking suspicious links and install strong antivirus software:Scammers impersonate banks with phishing emails/texts containing misspelled URLs (e.g., \"captial0ne.com\"), so always navigate directly to your bank’s official website or app instead of clicking embedded links. Strong antivirus software helps protect your devices from fake apps, keyloggers and other threats. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 6) Check your accounts regularly:Don’t just glance at your balance. Review recent transactions at least once a week to catch any suspicious activity. 7) Avoid public Wi-Fi for banking:Hackers exploit unsecured networks to launch man-in-the-middle attacks and spoof banking sites, so use a VPN to encrypt your connection if you must bank on public Wi-Fi. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on yourWindows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 8) Use a personal data removal service:Data brokers sell your contact details and personal information, which hackers can use for targeted phishing attacks or SIM swap scams. These services automatically remove your data from broker databases, reducing the risk of social engineering attempts that could compromise your bank account. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren’t cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It’s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. GOT A BANK TRANSFER ALERT TEXT? IT MIGHT BE A SCAM. HERE'S WHAT TO DO Hackers don’t need to break into your bank’s system; they just need to trick you. Whether it’s phishing, malware or SIM swaps, the goal is always the same: get access to your login and verification codes. Fortunately, you can make it much harder for them by using secure habits and staying alert. Your money belongs with you, not in the hands of a scammer.

    "title": "Hybrid airship slashes emissions by 80%",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says AT² Aerospace’s Z1 hybrid airship uses helium lift, low fuel, no runways. The tragic Hindenburg disaster of 1937, which resulted in the death of 36 people and effectively ended passenger airship travel, cast a long-lasting shadow over lighter-than-air technology. For many decades, airships were largely confined to niche roles such as advertising and surveillance. However, a groundbreaking spin-off from Lockheed Martin to AT² Aerospace is now reviving the airship concept with a modern twist: hybrid airships designed specifically for eco-friendly cargo transport. Most recently, AT² Aerospace announced two purchase orders for their airships, one from Straightline Aviation and one from Arctic Airships. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Z1 hybrid airship (AT² Aerospace)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) At the center of this revival is theZ1 hybrid airship, a massive vessel capable of carrying up to 23.5 tons (21 metric tons) of cargo while minimizing environmental impacts and significantly reducing fuel consumption compared to traditional aircraft. Unlike the hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, which was highly flammable, the Z1 relies on helium for lift, a nonflammable gas, providing buoyancy for the majority of the airship's weight, combined with aerodynamic design and advanced propulsion systems. Z1 hybrid airship (AT² Aerospace)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) MASSIVE AIRSHIP COULD SHAKE UP CARGO TRANSPORT The Z1 combines lighter-than-air buoyancy with advanced engineering innovations. Notably, the aircraft features a tri-lobe hull design, a hallmark of Lockheed Martin's earlier airship projects. This design includes a raised central lobe flanked by two side lobes, which enhances lift efficiency and stability. Its Air Cushion Landing System allows it to take off and land on virtually any flat surface, including sand, ice, water or uneven terrain, eliminating the need for traditional runways. The Z1 uses vectored thrust propulsion and advanced onboard systems for weather prediction and route planning, enabling it to travel more than 1,400 nautical miles at speeds of up to 60 knots. The hybrid lift system merges helium's natural buoyancy with vectored thrust from the engines, optimizing both efficiency and control. This innovative design reduces fuel consumption to just one-fifth of what a heavy-lift helicopter would use, making the Z1 especially suited for transporting goods to remote and difficult-to-access areas such as the Arctic or the Amazon rainforest. Z1 hybrid airship (AT² Aerospace)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) ZERO EMISSIONS HYDROGEN ELECTRIC JET DISRUPTS CONVENTIONAL FLIGHTS The Z1 addresses two pressing challenges in modern transportation. First, it offers a practical solution for accessing remote regions where traditional cargo planes and helicopters face high costs and infrastructure limitations. Its ability to land without airstrips unlocks affordable transport options for industries like mining, disaster relief and medical supply delivery in isolated communities. Second, the Z1 contributes to the urgent global need to reduce carbon emissions. Transports such as cars, trucks, trains, ships and airplanes currently account for over 40% of worldwide carbon emissions, and the Z1's low fuel consumption and ability to overfly environmentally sensitive areas quietly present a scalable alternative for freight transport with minimized environmental impact. Z1 hybrid airship (AT² Aerospace)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) IS THIS 656-FOOT AIRYACHT THE LUXURY TRANSPORTATION OF THE FUTURE? The recent $50 million order from Straightline Aviation demonstrates strong confidence in the Z1's commercial potential, with the first delivery expected by 2028. Arctic Airships has also placed orders for two airships, targeting operations in Alaska's challenging terrain. \"Our hybrid airships will transform cargo transport by providing an environmentally responsible solution while maintaining operational efficiency,\" said Dr. Bob Boyd, CEO of AT² Aerospace. He went on to say, \"Our aircraft not only optimizes cargo movement in challenging terrains but also aligns with the industry's increasing focus on environmental responsibility and cost efficiency.\" SUBSCRIBE TO KURT'S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Z1 hybrid airship (AT² Aerospace)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The Z1 hybrid airship is a real, practical answer to the challenges we face in logistics and the environment today. By blending tried-and-true lighter-than-air technology with advanced, fuel-efficient propulsion, AT² Aerospace is showing us a whole new way to think about sustainable transport. It is encouraging to see that when it comes to moving cargo responsibly, the sky really is no longer the limit. In a world racing to cut carbon emissions, can hybrid airships and sustainable fuels realistically transform aviation before climate impacts worsen? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

    "title": "HUGH HEWITT: Will Pope Leo XIV reverse the anti-American vibe from the last pope?",
    "article_text": "OutKick writer Mary Katharine Ham and Democratic strategist Kevin Walling join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss the election of Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope in history, and the U.S. trade deal with the U.K. Many Catholics around the world must marvel at the wild diversity of reactions to the election of Pope Leo XIV within the United States. Something approaching half of the hot takes from American media on the day ofPope Leo’s elevationthat traveled abroad from X were on baseball and deep dish pizza. Another subset of reactions are Villanova alums getting elbows into the ribs of their Notre Dame pals accompanied by some knowing and approving nods from their friends who are Boston College, Holy Cross or Georgetown alums. There’s baseball, and there is \"American Catholic inside baseball.\" Whatever theCatholic faithfulin Africa think of Cubs-White Sox chatter, or what the new pope’s old Peruvian diocesan flock makes of the dissection in the American Catholic media of \"Bishop Bob’s\" choice of the name Leo and whatever \"Rerum Novarum\" is, it’s a good bet that most of the world’s 1.4 billion Catholics are in a \"wait and see\" mode, relieved that it didn’t take long —perhaps a little side-eyed at the choice of an American but reassured by the obvious love for him from his Peruvian \"family\"— and that everyone with a red hat appears to be happy even as the tens of thousands in St. Peter’s Square thundered their applause. But for the generation of boomers around his age of 69, the astonished reaction is at the very idea that one of our number is the heir to Saint Peter’s mission as the \"rock\" upon which Christ’s church would be built. POPE LEO XIV CALLS THIS A CHALLENGE TO ‘HUMAN DIGNITY’ IN FIRST ADDRESS TO CARDINALS The new pope is half a year older than I am, and thus an \"OK Boomer\"American Catholic, though one with a missionary’s heart and a zeal to serve the poor. He will not, however, be able to (or perhaps want to) escape his 1960s’ and 1970s’ upbringing, will get \"Laugh In\" references, Farah Fawcett posters, Saturday Night Fever (especially John Travolta’s older brother who quit the priesthood and the shock that sent though the family) and Jaws. That’s all new for a pope, I think. I have no idea which, if any, American media he reads now or if he follows the MLB standings or the NFL draft. But he most certainly is, very much, a \"Wonder Years\" kid —a reference to the 1988 TV series about being an American kid of the ‘60s starring Fred Savage and Danica McKellar that began in 1988 and ran six years. Pope Leowill almost certainly have been an altar boy when the big switch from Latin to English for the Mass was made, a rug-pull which left those of us who did the work to memorize the Latin beyond \"mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa\" but didn’t get to use it for long, if at all, feeling aggrieved. Pope Leo knows the big stuff —he’s a canon lawyer after all— but also the small stuff of American Catholicism such as that altar boys in America usually got tipped at weddings, forgotten at funerals and that Stations of the Cross on Good Fridays are a big deal. If Chicago parochial schools were like those in Ohio, the classes were big, often 40 or more, but the sisters and their lay colleagues kept order. (Yes, they did, and not with much difficulty.)  The stage play \"Late Night Catechism\" nails those days and those schools, and if that \"one sister\" show puts on a run near you, it’s a better read on the new pope’s upbringing than anything in the American press. In our youth, priests came to dinner and had a few drinks before, during and after. They were good men, normal guys, but significant figures to be respected and the house cleaned before they came. \"Father\" usually handed out the report cards in elementary school. There was, in two words, \"deference and respect\" when in their presence, and order before and during their visits or appearances, whether on playgrounds, gyms or school PTA or parish council meetings. As a young professional in the Beltway in the early ‘80s, my friends from the old school gathered to welcome the monsignor when he came to town…because that is what you did for the priests and sisters who ran the church (and the schools and the hospitals) in the enveloping culture of American Catholicism which cocooned youth in those turbulent years. The awful scandals concerning the abuse of children certainly happened, and are crimes which have scarred so many, but the original \"men in black\" were then and now overwhelmingly good men and true to their sacrificial vows. Leo the XIValmost certainly recalls where he was when St. John Paul the Great was shot. He will remember it with a clarity that still shocks. And I guess he will revere St. John Paul the Great. Because that saint worked with Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Margaret Thatcher to help Lech Walesa bring down first the communist governments of the Warsaw Pact along with the Wall and then the entire \"Evil Empire.\" What Pope Leo thinks of his predecessor’s deal with the Chinese Communist Party I do not know, but I pray he conveys to General Secretary Xi Jinping that the imprisoned dissident, and devout Catholic, Jimmy Lai, should be freed and sent to the United Kingdom for treatment quickly or opposition from the \"invisible divisions\" of the pope will become very visible, very quickly. I pray as well that he corrects for Pope Francis’ inexplicable antagonism towards some of the great leaders of American Catholicism of the last quarter-century and elevates Archbishops Charles Chaput and José Horacio Gomez to the College of Cardinals as Francis ought to have done more than a decade ago. The palpable anti-American vibe of Francis was as unnecessary as it was divisive. (Chaput, a Native American now retired as Archbishop of Philadelphia, and Gomez, born in Mexico and leading the Los Angeles diocese, reflect the modern American faithful at least as much as anyone else in the College. The former pope, may he rest in peace, carried an unprovoked hostility towards them just as he did to the Latin Mass and its enthusiasts, and even towards the U.S. Church as a whole, an enmity as inexplicable as the many ambiguities that the casual off-handed remarks of the last pope created across continents, dioceses and orders. Bringing Chaput to Rome and leaning on Gomez for guidance on West Coast Catholicism as well as Archbishop Cordileone in San Francisco would be so very, very welcomed and an easy measure that proclaims \"reconciliation.\" Of course Leo won’t exclude the \"progressive\" Americans in the Church leadership, but some balance, please. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION On understanding Pope Leo: I’d wager he knows the lyrics of at least one, if not all, of the theme songs of Gilligan’s Island, Green Acres or Mister Ed. I’d love to know the titles in his album collection gathering dust somewhere in a brother’s attic unless Leo sold it —he might have— to give the proceeds to the poor. I don’t think the babies of the American Baby Boom rise in the universal Church unless they had the common touch that came from the common culture of the time. Most Catholics of all sorts and ages in America, but especially those taught by the parochial schools of that era, carry a knowledge of the obligation owed by the well-off to the poor. My parish —and I would not be surprised if his old one (reportedly closed now)— sponsored at least one refugee family from South Vietnam, resettled across the U.S. after their flight following the fall of Saigon in 1975. It was an early lesson on the Church’s welcome to the refugees who have had to flee tyranny. If the new pope learned to gamble for small stakes at the summer parish carnivals that continue to this day it would be the rule, not the exception. Is he a Villanova Wildcats basketball nut like most Villanova grads I’ve ever met? Who knows what math majors do, but he probably has filled in his share of brackets, understands batting averages and perhaps watched Saturday Night Live more than a few times. What a great (and evangelical) thing it would be to see the pope courtside at a Final Four down the road, though the pressure on the young men from Villanova would skyrocket (as might vocations in the U.S.) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The not merely \"conventional\" wisdom, but the actual \"universally held belief\" that an American could not be elected pope fell like many such convictions over the decades for many reasons we can only guess at. But perhaps the perfect candidate emerged who could please both those cardinals who wanted some, if not complete, continuity with Francis’ preference for the migrant and the desperately poor, but also one who assuaged some, if not all, the concerns of those cardinals who recognized a widening divide with American Catholicism, a divide that could become the sort of rupture that, if expanded instead of bridged, could become permanent and even schismatic. Who knows? Nobody. Not even Pope Leo XIV, I would guess, surrounded as he is by a world on fire and a Vatican deep in financial chaos. Every opinion will be premature until after one or two consistories —those occasions when popes add to the men in the College of Cardinals. Pope Leo could do a lot to repair breaches in the Church with some early selections there which heal divisions while also continuing the embrace begun by St. John Paul the Great and continued by Benedict and Francis of a global Church that holds up the divinity of Jesus Christ first and always and usually recalls and broadcasts that the Beatitudes are the quick hack on the whole of the Gospels.

Momentum to eliminate government waste is sweeping the nation — from Washington’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) toparallel initiatives in Texas.In that spirit, we recently met to discuss Senate Bill 19 (SB19), which state Senator Mayes Middleton authored, and Lt. Governor Dan Patrick designated a top legislative priority. It would make Texasthe first state to banthe use of public funds for lobbying — essential to restore republican principles and defund corrupt, anti-taxpayer special interests. We are a government of the people, by the people and for the people, which makes using the people’s money to push special interests untenable. What exactly is taxpayer-funded lobbying?In recent years, Texas has seen a surge of local governments, school districts and associations — such as the Texas Association of School Boards — hiring lobbyists with your tax dollars to wine, dine and entertain legislators in an effort to influence legislation. PROTESTERS WEIGH IN ON ELON MUSK'S SPACEX HOME BECOMING NEWEST CITY IN SOUTH TEXAS Under Texas law, \"lobbying\" refers to registered Austin lobbyists hired or contracted to influence legislation. Despite taxpayers’ expectation that government entities act in the public’s interest, local governments, school districts and associations regularly hire lobbyists to thwart the will of voters. The Texas legislature is battling to free Texas residents from having to fund groups that lobby against the will of voters. FILE: Texas state Capitol in Austin, Texas.(Tamir Kalifa/Getty Images) Your tax dollars are being used to lobby for divisive, left-wing causes. Progressive politicians backed by radicals like billionaire George Soros use hundreds of millions of dollars to try and force their agenda on the Texas legislature to kill common-sense policies and push the state left. For example, taxpayer-funded lobbyists in Texas spend public funds to oppose bans on men entering women's restrooms. Worse still, many unelected bureaucrats and regulators are captured by the very industries they oversee, using tax dollars on lobbyists who entrench oligopolies and crush competition. Unsurprisingly, taxpayer-funded lobbyists also oppose tax relief and instead support increasing sales taxes, gas taxes and raising vehicle registration fees. They’ve lobbied against common-sense issues such as border security, voter ID, teacher pay raises, election integrity with citizenship verification and parental choice in education. At a time when Texas faces real problems in public safety, infrastructure and essential services, spending upwards of $100 million annually on lobbyists is indefensible. The public overwhelmingly agrees. A recent public opinion poll reveals that 81% of Texans oppose the practice and would prefer that the Texas legislature abolish it. Rather than waste money arming ideological opponents to fight for causes Texans reject, Texas leaders should boldly pursue a better future: investing valuable tax dollars in roads or law enforcement or, better yet, offering Texans tax relief. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Crucially, SB19 in no way silences local governments. Local officials can still call, write and testify before the legislature — precisely as our founders intended. Cities, and indeed all local governments, were created to serve the people, and the people are tired of having their voices drowned out by hired guns using their own tax dollars against them. A ban on taxpayer-funded lobbying encourages direct representation and communication. It in no way prevents local elected officials or their staff from communicating with the legislature, traveling to Austin, or incurring related expenses to make their voice heard. Your tax dollars are being used to lobby for divisive, left-wing causes. Progressive politicians backed by radicals like billionaire George Soros use hundreds of millions of dollars to try and force their agenda on the Texas legislature to kill common-sense policies and push the state left. All government is created by the people, who grant it powers to represent us. By funding lobbyists who push agendas voters reject, local governments violate the consent of the governed and break the core principle of representation from which the American and Texas constitutions derive their authority. In effect, entrenched bureaucrats create a self-sustaining cycle of influence that subverts genuine democracy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP By continuing to allow public funds to flow into the hands of progressive special interests that undermine the very principles Texans hold dear, we risk eroding the constitutional foundations on which our state and nation were built. As part of this broader struggle, taxpayer-funded lobbying is the USAID of Texas, but the DOGE initiative — including SB19 — aims to defund this egregious waste. By passing SB19, we will strengthen public trust and ensure tax dollars serve Texans’ real needs, not the interests of bureaucrats and their hired guns. This session, we hope you will join us in the call to finally ban taxpayer-funded lobbying once and for all.

    "title": "We can’t defund our way to prosperity. We need to support our schools, nurses and firefighters",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. At the dawn of what was billed as a new American \"Golden Age,\" PresidentDonald Trumpstood before the nation and proclaimed, \"The American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.\" That was January 20, 2025. Now, just a few months into this new chapter, it's worth asking: What does a thriving American Dream actually require? It’s not built on speeches or slogans, but on the everyday systems that support working families — schools, hospitals, firehouses and other vital services that keep our communities strong and our local economies growing. Take a walk through any thriving town or city in America. You will find not just businesses booming and cranes dotting the skyline. You'll find hospitals staffed by highly skilled nurses, public schools filled with ambitious children, public health departments tracking outbreaks before they spread and fire departments ready to respond within minutes. TRUMP ADMIN REINSTATES 9/11 SURVIVORS PROGRAM STAFF FOLLOWING HHS REORGANIZATION PLAN You'll also find community colleges and public universities acting as launch pads for young adults entering the workforce. These are not just services. They are the living, breathing organs of a healthy, functioning economy. Fire departments and other first responders are the backbone of a functioning society. This isn’t just theory. It’s personal. My mother, a retired NICU nurse, spent decades caring for the smallest lives at Jackson Memorial Hospital inMiami. She was a proud member of SEIU Local 1991. Like many Jamaican-American women in healthcare, she wasn’t just a registered nurse — she was a community builder, a public servant and the backbone of our neighborhood.Her union carddidn’t just signify fair pay; it represented dignity, stability and a stake in America’s future. Policymakers across the political spectrum often talk about revitalizing American industry and rebuilding the middle class. Many Americans — especially those in the political middle, who feel disconnected from the extremes of both parties — are simply looking for practical solutions. They’re not chasing culture wars or partisan fights; they want what works:good jobs, strong schools, and safe, stable communities. But manufacturing doesn’t happen in a vacuum. You can’t build a factory in a town where the hospital has closed, the school is underfunded, the firehouse is short-staffed, and the technical college has shuttered because of federal budget cuts. Just ask any titan of industry. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 449,000 job openings in the manufacturing sector as of March 2025. These are real jobs that require real people with real skills. Yet, we lack the workforce to fill them. Why? Because we’ve spent the past decade underfunding the very institutions that grow, train and sustain that workforce. One bipartisan bright spot iscareer and technical education (CTE).As a recent New York Times opinion piece by AFT President Randi Weingarten highlighted, CTE is having a moment. Bringing together leaders like Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and business leaders like Satya Nadella, theCEO of Microsoft, CTE could catalyze the kind of revitalization many Americans are calling for. To make that a reality, it must expand with the support of our most significant national resource: the federal government. A robust, federally supported career and technical education system could help resolve nursing shortages, address crises in emergency services and build a new generation of skilled tradespeople. But education doesn’t just begin at age 18. Public schools are the first rung on the ladder. Yet, under the latest federal budget proposal, funding forpublic K-12 schoolsis set to take a massive hit. One billion dollars for student mental health services? Gone. Programs aimed at closing achievement gaps and supporting students with disabilities? Slashed. This isn’t belt-tightening. This is misaligned priority-setting. Education remains an essential part of a successful economy. And career and technical education has bipartisan support.(iStock) Our schools are already overwhelmed. Teachers are leaving the profession in droves. School nurses, counselors and support staff are being cut or forced to cover multiple roles. In some districts, students show up to class hungry, traumatized and with nowhere to turn. And the federal government’s answer is to cut more? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION We can’t build a 21st Century workforce without 21st Century schools. We can’t have a strong manufacturing base without strong community colleges. We can’t train the next generation of emergency responders if we’re defunding the very programs that would prepare them. A factory job may require technical skill, but the journey to that skill begins in a kindergarten classroom. When some lawmakers talk about \"freedom,\" they often forget that freedom is meaningless without infrastructure. What good is the freedom to choose your doctor if there are no doctors in your town? What does school choice mean if your local public school is being bled dry by underinvestment and neglect? America’s prosperity has always rested on a simple formula: invest in people, invest in places, and the profits will follow. The towns that are thriving today are those that never stopped believing in that equation. They fought to keep their schools open, their hospitals staffed, their libraries funded and their civic fabric intact. But manufacturing doesn’t happen in a vacuum. You can’t build a factory in a town where the hospital has closed, the school is underfunded, the firehouse is short-staffed, and the technical college has shuttered because of federal budget cuts. Just ask any titan of industry. If we truly want to restore American greatness, we must recognize that it isn’t built solely on tax breaks andtariffs. It’s built in the maternity wards, classrooms, firehouses and community colleges that serve as the foundation of working-class life. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Cutting for the sake of cutting isn’t policy. It’s performance art. And forworking familieslike the one I grew up in, it’s not just shortsighted — it’s dangerous. To restore the American Dream, we need more than rhetoric. We need reinvestment. In schools. In hospitals. In people. In hope. That’s the kind of manufacturing America still knows how to do — and it starts right in our backyard.

    "title": "Defunding PBS and NPR could make them even worse",
    "article_text": "NPR CEO Katherine Maher was pressed on Sunday on whether NPR was biased in their news coverage as implied in President Trump's executive order slashing taxpayer funds to NPR and PBS. President Donald Trumphas now made good on his threat to defund public media— to cut off the $535 million a year that public radio and television receive from the federal government. He’s not wrong that, too often, they’ve been vehicles for biased journalism — both by commission (all diversity and \"reproductive choice\" stories all the time) or omission (not covering the Hunter Biden laptop story). But as satisfying as it might be to zero out the budget of theCorporation for Public Broadcasting —where I once served on the board of directors and tried to warn my colleagues about the threat that liberal bias posed — Trump’s move could backfire. PBS and NPR could emerge both financially stronger and insulated from public accountability. Cutting off federal funds will not put public media out of business. Both PBS and NPR are federally chartered non-profit organizations which will continue to exist. So will some 1,000 local public broadcasting TV and radio stations. At the national level, don’t be surprised if liberal foundations — Gates, MacArthur, Robert Wood Johnson, Carnegie and Ford (which helped invent public broadcasting) — step up to fill what will not be that big a budget gap. The bull market of recent years has swelled the endowments of all. PBS, NPR BLAST 'BLATANTLY UNLAWFUL' TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER HALTING PUBLIC FUNDING, VOW CHALLENGES These types of foundations already provide the systems with financial support, including for specific types of programming. Incredibly, the Rockefeller Foundation, whose endowment is based on oil industry profits, is funding NPR’s \"climate desk\" reporting staff. The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative has contributed to the same cause, while the Walton Family Foundation has done the same for NPR and the PBS News Hour, targeting its support for \"environmental journalism\" The loss of federal funding for NPR and PBS would also eliminate congressional oversight. FILE: Capitol Building, NPR and PBS.(llison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images; Eva Marie Uzcategui/Bloomberg via Getty Images) This is a very worrisome way in which the federal funds vacuum can be filled — by liberal donors effectively buying the type of stories that should be included in the \"news.\" As anyone who has worked as a journalist knows, the decision about what to cover is more consequential and fundamental than the coverage style itself. This is the essential point in sociologist Herbert Gans seminal 1979 book about CBS, \"Deciding What’s News.\" Absent federal funding, Congress would no longer have any standing to call public media executives to account, as Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene did in March. The leverage of threatened cuts can be more powerful than the loss of funding itself. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Consider the fact that, in a recent week, the \"PBS News Hour\" has seen fit to include among its guests both the Manhattan Institute’s Chris Rufo — who has led the charge against university DEI programs — Oren Cass, head of American Compass, a key Trump-friendly policy thinker with close ties to Vice-President JD Vance, and Christopher Scalia of the American Enterprise Institute, author of the new book, \"Thirteen Novels Conservatives Will Love.\" The \"News Hour\" was likely feeling pressure to become more politically diverse. That’s a good thing. Better than an abrupt threat to public media funding would be a change in the rules governing it, per the Public Broadcasting Act. As matters stand, public media serves mainly liberal audiences in blue states and college towns. Congress should insist that the services show that they can serve the country at large — meaning they’d have to adjust their programming and news content to attract a geographically and politically diverse audience. Annual hearings on that count would help. In other words, attach constructive strings tothe federal funding —requiring annual reports about who’s watching and listening, including their cities and states and their political affiliations. Turn the diversity metrics on their head to hold NPR/PBS’s feet to the fire. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP At the same time, local stations, which currently have to pay NPR dues and pony up to carry \"All Things Considered,\" should get to keep the $267 million in \"community service grants\" — half of CPB funding. They should be required to use the funds to cover their local governments at a time when the closing of newspapers is creating news deserts. NPR listeners in New York, Boston, Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas and Los Angeles already get more local news — yes, sometimes with a progressive slant — than they otherwise would. Make no mistake. Public media deserves much of the criticism it’s received — and has not shown an openness to change that it should, especially in terms of the topics and locales of its journalism. I learned that firsthand during my time on the CPB board, when my criticisms, not dissimilar to those of Trump, were ignored and I was marginalized, including by being stripped of committee assignments and pushed to resign. But defunding it, although it looks like a conservative victory, could leave NPR and PBS still standing — and immune from accountability.

    "title": "Trump’s healthcare order will help fix healthcare for everyone",
    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. One ofPresident Donald Trump's most significant achievementsduring his first 100 days in office was his executive order requiring \"radical\" healthcare price transparency. The order doubles down on his first-term hospital and health insurance price transparency rules requiring the publication of actual prices of care and coverage, including discounted cash and negotiated insurance rates. This informationprotects patients from overchargesand empowers them to reduce inflated costs through choice and competition. The executive order requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of the Treasury to issue rules strengthening, standardizing and enforcing systemwide price transparency by the end of this month. Trump's healthcare price transparency effort will revolutionize healthcareand the entire economy.It's a pro-worker, pro-growth, free-market policy to boost worker paychecks and business earnings. 5.5 MILLION PATIENTS' INFORMATION EXPOSED BY MAJOR HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH When employers and unions can access actual prices throughout the healthcare system, they can spot wide price variations for the same care, expose middle players driving up costs and design affordable health plans. They can share their savings with workers in the form of lower premiums and higher wages. President Donald Trump''s healthcare Executive Order is aimed at a billing transparency. (AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein) Under the status quo, healthcare is fundamentally un-American. It is the only economic sector where consumers cannot see real prices before they buy. No functioning market can exist under these conditions. As a result, prices for the same care can range by 10 times, even at the same hospital. For instance, C-sections varyfrom $6,000 to $60,000and MRIs from $450 to $6,500. That isn't a marketplace — it's Russian Roulette that allows Big Health to profiteer off patients' misery. For decades, health insurers have hidden prices and claims information, facilitating spread pricing that robs workers and employers. Employer-sponsored family health plans now cost $25,600 annually and increase by double-digits each year. Research shows that about the same amount of compensation gains for average workers since 2000 has gone to premiums as paychecks, a major cause of wage stagnation. Unfortunately, hospitals and health insurers haven't complied with Trump's first-term rules. According to a recent study by PatientRightsAdvocate.org, only 21.1% of hospitals nationwide are fully complying with the hospital rule. The Biden administration didn't meaningfully enforce the rule, issuing only 25 financial penalties on the thousands of hospitals that didn't comply. Biden also rolled back the rule, allowing the posting of unaccountable estimates in lieu of actual prices needed to shop. And health insurers have buried their data disclosures in massive files full of meaningless \"ghost codes\" that crash computers and are nearly impossible to parse. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Trump's new order increases enforcement to boost compliance, requires actual prices — not estimates — so patients can shop with financial certainty, expands transparency requirements throughout the healthcare system, and standardizes data disclosures, so consumers can make meaningful price comparisons. It gives people prices before they receive care. Trump's order will also enact overdue requirements for health insurers to provide Advanced Explanations of Benefits (AEOBs), required by the bipartisan No Surprises Act that passed at the end of 2020. AEOBs let patients know exactly what they'll owe — including their out-of-pocket patient responsibility — giving them financial peace of mind. Under the status quo, healthcare is fundamentally un-American. It is the only economic sector where consumers cannot see real prices before they buy. They also empower employers and unions to audit their health plans and verify claims payments match provider bills and posted prices. Employers and unions can then eliminate spread pricing that — as the New York Times reported last year — often requires their health plans to pay far more to middle players than providers. Drawing on a JAMA study concluding that 25% of U.S. healthcare spending ($4.9 trillion in 2023) is waste, overcharges, and fraud, economists estimate systemwide price transparency can generate approximately $1 trillion of savings. Putting $1 trillion a year in overbilling back into the productive economy, including worker paychecks and business investment, will result in an enormous annual economic stimulus. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Healthcare price transparency is the most important microeconomic reform in American history. It creates a functional, competitive marketplace that restores choice, accountability and trust. When prices are clear, markets work. When markets work, costs fall. And when costs fall, wages rise. President Trump's executive order — and the ensuing federal rules issued later in May —will finally make healthcare price transparency a reality. They will solidify Trump's legacy as the president who fixed American healthcare. Cynthia A. Fisher is a life sciences entrepreneur, and founder and chairman ofPatientRightsAdvocate.org. Arthur B.

    "title": "Silicon, steel and megawatts: Can America create the infrastructure needed to win the AI race?",
    "article_text": "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the 'Decoding Broken Hearts' initiative on 'Special Report.' This week’s Senate hearing on U.S. competitiveness inartificial intelligencemade it clear that we are not just in an AI race with China and the rest of the world. We are in a race to build the foundation of the 21st century global economy while strengthening our national security. That foundation is made of silicon, steel and megawatts. America’s ability tolead in AIhinges on a simple but urgent question – can we build the computing infrastructure fast enough to unleash AI’s full potential and drive a competitive advantage? The emerging AI cloud computing infrastructure is not like the general-purpose cloud that still powers most of the digital world. Thenew world of AIdemands a complete reimagining of digital infrastructure. AI workloads involve trillions of simultaneous calculations, demanding unprecedented computing power, advanced cooling systems, cutting-edge chip technology, ultra-high-speed networking and accelerated storage. Today’s general purpose clouds weren’t designed for this. We cannot run the 21st century economy with 20th century infrastructure. RANDY TRAVIS STAGES STUNNING COMEBACK WITH HELP FROM AI AFTER DEVASTING STROKE China is aggressively investing inAI infrastructureas a matter of national strategy, recognizing that technological dominance will enable it to compete with the U.S. for influence around the world. If we want to keep America in the lead, we must act with the same urgency, and build here. At CoreWeave, we operate over 250,000 GPUs in more than 30 data centers, powering the next generation of AI models. But infrastructure at this scale doesn’t appear overnight. Because of the massive capital investments required to build this specialized cloud platform and the entire AI ecosystem, long-term strategic planning and policies are needed to ensure the U.S. maintains its preeminent position and wins the future. These policies include a transparent regulatory process across all jurisdictions, expediting the development of abundant and affordable power, ensuring access to global markets and partnerships to develop the skilled and trained domestic workforce required to meet the growing AI demand while creating good-paying jobs for the future. Without these, the U.S. risks losing its current edge in AI to nations moving faster and with more clarity of purpose. Our private sector is moving rapidly to meet the challenge. But we do not do this in a vacuum. Public policies must keep up to create the necessary enabling environment for success. Overly burdensome and fragmented regulation across all jurisdictions create uncertainty that can chill investment. Careful reforms to the energy permitting process can bring the electrons online needed to bring more intelligence to the world. Similarly, we understand the critical importance of crafting export controls to protect national security. We believe that policies can be developed which accomplish this while enabling U.S. firms the ability to compete for the relentless demand for AI in global markets. If we want to shape thefuture of AI, we must ensure it is developed here on American soil. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION And it means creating the public-private partnerships to train and create the workforce that is required – we need more plumbers, electricians and engineers. Earlier this year, CoreWeave joined Princeton University, Microsoft and the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to launch the New Jersey AI Hub – a model for how academia, industry and government can work together to build the future. We need ten more just like it. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Business and all of the U.S. can benefit from accessing the vast scientific and technological resources of our national laboratory system. These labs have played an enormous role in contributing to the computing resources and energy technologies that have enabled our AI infrastructure. Let’s use this genius that is sometimes taken for granted. More basic and fundamental science, and increased research and development are investments that pay off for all of us. There is a $20 trillion opportunity on the table by 2030, according to IDC. The nation that builds the infrastructure for AI will reap the benefits in economic growth and enhanced national security, while creating fundamental breakthroughs in areas such as healthcare and education. But that future is not guaranteed. It will go to the country that moves fastest, builds the boldest and works together. While the U.S. has a head start, this is a generational moment. Maintaining that lead over our competitors requires treating AI infrastructure like the strategic asset it is – by prioritizing jobs and investment right here at home. This is not just a tech issue. It’s an American issue. Michael Intrator is the CEO of CoreWeave.",

As soon as within a year, progress from reasoning models could slow down, according to the report’s findings. Reasoning models such as OpenAI’so3have led to substantial gains on AI benchmarks in recent months, particularly benchmarks measuring math and programming skills. The models can apply more computing to problems, which can improve their performance, with the downside being that they take longer than conventional models to complete tasks. Reasoning models are developed by first training a conventional model on a massive amount of data, then applying a technique called reinforcement learning, which effectively gives the model “feedback” on its solutions to difficult problems. So far, frontier AI labs like OpenAI haven’t applied an enormous amount of computing power to the reinforcement learning stage of reasoning model training, according to Epoch. That’s changing. OpenAI has said that it applied around 10x more computing to train o3 than its predecessor, o1, and Epoch speculates that most of this computing was devoted to reinforcement learning. And OpenAI researcher Dan Roberts recently revealed that the company’s future plans call forprioritizing reinforcement learningto use far more computing power, even more than for the initial model training. But there’s still an upper bound to how much computing can be applied to reinforcement learning, per Epoch. Josh You, an analyst at Epoch and the author of the analysis, explains that performance gains from standard AI model training are currently quadrupling every year, while performance gains from reinforcement learning are growing tenfold every 3-5 months. The progress of reasoning training will “probably converge with the overall frontier by 2026,” he continues. Epoch’s analysis makes a number of assumptions, and draws in part on public comments from AI company executives. But it also makes the case that scaling reasoning models may prove to be challenging for reasons besides computing, including high overhead costs for research. “If there’s a persistent overhead cost required for research, reasoning models might not scale as far as expected,” writes You. “Rapid compute scaling is potentially a very important ingredient in reasoning model progress, so it’s worth tracking this closely.” Any indication that reasoning models may reach some sort of limit in the near future is likely to worry the AI industry, which has invested enormous resources developing these types of models. Already, studies have shown that reasoning models, which can beincredibly expensive to run, have serious flaws, like a tendency tohallucinate morethan certain conventional models.

This $80-per-year subscription will introduce AI tools to build custom routes and provide real-time trail condition forecasts, trail traffic heatmaps, and a feature that lets you identify trees and plants using your phone’s camera. The new option will initially roll out in the next few weeks to select members and will be available globally to all users by June. AllTrails users can sign up forearly access on its website. A longtime popular app for outdoor enthusiasts, AllTrails raised a growthround of $150 millionin 2021 when the COVID pandemic saw people rekindling their relationship with nature amid lockdowns and social distancing measures. Unfortunately for the company, Apple entered AllTrails’ market just ahead of naming it App of the Year byadding support for topographic mapswith trailheads, contour lines, hill shading, elevation gains, and more in Apple Maps in the U.S. The following year,Apple encroached even further, with features like offline maps, custom routes, and tools to explore national parks and other trails outside the U.S. AllTrails’ latest update, then, can be seen as the company fighting back with a selection of features targeted at its most engaged and most active members. The new AI-powered feature in the Peak membership, for instance, lets users build their ideal trail either by starting from scratch or customizing existing trails. Smart-routing functionality uses AI to change a trail by making it shorter, less steep, or even “more scenic,” among other things. The new trail conditions forecast will provide information about the temperature, precipitation, snow depth, and more, essentially putting a weather app inside AllTrails. There are also alerts for things like air quality and mosquito activity. A later update will add terrain and ground conditions, like pavement, gravel, or mud. The added heatmap option can help hikers and bikers who hate getting stuck on crowded trails, as well as those who prefer a crowd for safety purposes, like when hiking alone. To work, the app’s access to millions of users’ activity provides it with traffic data to make estimates, similar to how Google Maps uses data to predict when a store, restaurant, bar, or other venue is the most “busy.” This summer, Peak members will also gain access to an Outdoor Lens feature, which lets them instantly identify a tree, plant, or flower and log it in the app. Over time, more identification features will be added to the Lens, the company notes. In addition to Peak’s launch, AllTrails is rolling out updates to its Base and Plus memberships. Base is the company’s free offering with trail maps, community reviews, and navigation, while Plus adds offline access, wrong-turn alerts, 3D trail previews, and live trail activity sharing. Across all tiers, AllTrails has over 80 million registered users. Both will receive a feature called Points of Interest, which adds more than 500,000 mapped viewpoints, landmarks, and trail amenities to the app. Plus subscribers, meanwhile, will also gain a feature called Offline Area, which lets them download a customized area for offline exploration that includes high-resolution maps and other details.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation wants the additional information about Full Self-Driving (Supervised) — or “FSD” — in order to “understand how Tesla plans to evaluate its vehicles and driving automation technologies for use on public roads,”according to the letterpublished Monday and firstreported by Reuters. Tesla hasn’t been quiet about plans to launch a paid ride-hailing robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, using its own fleet vehicles this coming June. But it appears that Tesla’s April 23 post on X captured the attention of federal regulators. Thatpost, which is cited in the letter, read:“FSD Supervised ride-hailing service is live for an early set of employees in Austin & San Francisco Bay Area. We’ve completed over 1.5k trips & 15k miles of driving. This service helps us develop & validate FSD networks, the mobile app, vehicle allocation, mission control & remote assistance operations.” NHTSA opened its investigation into Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving (Supervised)” software in October after four reported crashes in low-visibility situations. Tesla’s FSD software is an advanced driver-assistance system that requires the driver to keep their hands on the wheel even as it handles some of the driving operations like braking and steering in certain environments and conditions. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the robotaxis will use the yet-to-be-released “unsupervised” version of its Full Self-Driving software. In its May letter, the agency sent Tesla a series of questions squarely aimed at determining whether the automated driving system in its planned robotaxis is the same — or similar — to FSD Supervised.

Slate crossed the milestone over the weekend, just a little more than two weeks after coming out of stealth mode andunveiling the truckat an event in Los Angeles, California. The company has said the truck will start below $20,000 after applying the $7,500 federal EV tax credit and plans to build the vehicles at a former printing plant in Warsaw, Indiana, as TechCrunchfirst reported. “We are truly humbled by America’s response to Slate’s brand launch and the launch of our truck,” Slate’s chief commercial officer Jeremy Snyder said in a statement to TechCrunch. “We are excited for what the future holds.” Collecting 100,000 reservations so quickly is one sign of how much interest there has been in Slate since it revealed the truck, but it’s no guarantee those reservations will translate to sales. The company is only asking prospective buyers to plop down $50 to reserve their place in line to eventually order the truck; the fee is refundable. Many other EV startups have touted reservations in the past only to fail to live up to the expectations of such big, round numbers. Fisker filed for bankruptcy having sold just a few thousand Ocean SUVs despite onceclaimingmore than 60,000 reservations. Lordstown Motors, meanwhile, waschargedby the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for misleading investors about the number of “preorders” for its own electric pickup truck. (Lordstown Motors similarly filed for bankruptcy and ultimately settled with the SEC.) Slate has big goals for its truck, which — for a currently undisclosed price — can also be transformed into an SUV. The company says it will have capacity to make as many as 150,000 vehicles by the end of 2027 at the Indiana factory. And it has big backers helping Slate try to reach that goal, includingJeff Bezos(through his family office, Bezos Expeditions), Guggenheim Partners CEO Mark Walter, and VC firm General Catalyst.

We’reexpecting Google I/O 2025 to focus on AIa lot (seriously, a lot). Google’s family of AI models,Gemini, will likely take center stage during Google I/O 2025 as Pichai and Hassabis continue their push for dominance over OpenAI, xAI, Anthropic, and other well-funded competitors. We’re also expecting updates around DeepMind’s projects, such as its multimodal AI systemProject Astra. At last year’s Google I/O, the company teased a pair of smart glasses powered by Project Astra. A key theme at Google I/O 2025 will be how AI is infiltrating all of Google’s products. For example, Google’s head of Search, Elizabeth Reid, isgiving a talk on the AI stage about how generative AI is “revolutionizing search.” Other Google executives are scheduled to speak at the event abouthow scientists are using AI, howAI agents will use apps for users, and howWaymo’s autonomous vehicles use AIto navigate the physical world.

Previously, the satellite features were available to those running an iPhone 14 or later. The emergency satellite system for iPhone is designed to be used at critical times when a cellular signal or Wi-Fi is not available, as it lets people contact emergency services, send a text by satellite, share information with their emergency contacts, or call forroadside assistance. The iOS 18.5 update is focused on providing access tocarriers’ satellite services, like those from T-Mobile (with Starlink). You can check to see if you have access to this feature from the Cellular menu under the iPhone’s Settings. To date, the feature has beencredited with saving lives, rescuers say, includinghelping lostandinjured hikers,saving people from wildfires, and more. While the expansion of satellite emergency services to iPhone 13 owners is the most notable addition with iOS 18.5, iPhone users are also receiving a good handful of smaller updates. This includes the addition of a new feature for Screen Time, Apple’s parental control software, which alerts parents if their child correctly enters the parent’s passcode to access Screen Time permissions. Among the other improvements is an updated Mail app, which makes it easier to access the “All Mail” category as its own tab; a new Pride wallpaper; and an easier way to subscribe to content from the Apple TV app on a smart TV or connected device. Plus, Apple has fixed a bug where the Apple Vision Pro app would launch with a black screen if downloaded from the App Store, as well as other bugs with Siri, enterprise apps not launching, and more. iOS 18.5 was released alongside iPadOS 18.5, which largely addresses bug fixes; visionOS 2.5; watchOS 11.5; and security-focused updates for macOS Ventura 13.7.6 (22H625) and macOS Sonoma 14.7.6.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Buzzwords that are stretched to the point of being meaningless are as old as the tech industry itself. The top current one is “AI agent” and its variants, like “agentic.” So, unsurprisingly,no one really knows what an AI agent is. Even people with software engineering backgrounds who work for Andreessen Horowitz, one of the premier venture capital firms madly funding AI startups, say that there’s no agreed-upon definition. Three a16z infrastructure investment partners — Guido Appenzeller, Matt Bornstein, and Yoko Li — tried to come up with their own definition of agent during a recent podcast episode called“What Is an AI Agent?” For perspective, a16z, backer of such hot AI companies as OpenAI and Anysphere (maker of Cursor), is so gung-ho on the AI opportunity that it’s reportedly attempting to raise a $20 billion mega-fund to invest even more heavily in the sector, sources toldReuterslast month. Back in September, two other a16z VCs explained the firm’s excitement, writing onits corporate blog:“We believe every white-collar role will have an AI copilot. Some of these roles will be fully automated with AI agents.” To cash in on the buzz, “a continuum” of AI startups are describing their products as agents, Appenzeller says. “The simplest thing that I’ve heard being called an agent is basically just a clever prompt on top of some kind of knowledge base,” he said. This so-called agent takes a question from a human, then fetches a “canned” response, such as with IT help desk support. But lately, companiesthat make agents, orwant to make them, have been describing them as human worker replacements. To really do that, their AI software would have to be “something close to AGI,” Appenzeller says, which means “it needs to persist over long periods of time” and “it needs to work independently on problems.” Yet such a thing “doesn’t work yet,” both he and Li said. The reality is that getting this nascent AI agent tech to work reliably well has been a surprisingly hard journey, Jaspar Carmichael-Jack, the CEO of sales AI agent company Artisan, told TechCrunch last month. Carmichael-Jack is still hiring humans, despite his startup’s viral “stop hiring humans” ad campaign. For an AI to become a true human worker replacement, there are significant technical issues to solve,such as persistent long-term memory(and costs associated with that), andstomping out hallucinations. Because no company wants to hire an employee — human or artificial — who can’t remember a previous conversation and who also randomly lies. During the podcast, the a16z trio did land on a solid definition of what’s possible today. As Li described, an AI agent is a reasoning, multi-step LLM with a dynamic decision tree. In other words, she said, an agent isn’t a bot that just does a task when asked; it must also be able to make decisions about the task and take action autonomously, like grab a list of prospects from a database, decide which ones to email, and write the emails. Or write code and decide where to insert it. As for whether agents could actually replace humans in the foreseeable future, all three VCs agreed they could be used to handle some tasks humans do now, just like automation has always done. But this may actually lead to companies hiring more human workers, not fewer, as productivity rises. Bornstein said he can’t envision a time — given the current state of agents — when humans will be unnecessary. From “our perch in Silicon Valley,” the tech industry can “forget” that most people have jobs that require human creativity and “thinking,” he described. To replace humans with a bot, “I’m just not sure that even is kind-of theoretically possible,” he said. Still, such human replacement rhetoric — often done for marketing/business model and/or pricing reasons — is “a big reason for the confusion we’re experiencing now,” Bornstein says. The upshot is, if those seeing all the most cutting-edge uses of AI agents are skeptical about the boldest claims AI agent companies are making today, that’s probably a good sign the rest of us should be, too.

Gerald Connolly, ranking member of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, has initiated an investigation into whether expense management startup Ramp is receiving preferential treatment in its bid fora $25 million government contract. Connolly sent aletterto General Services Administration (GSA) Acting Administrator Stephen Ehikian demanding information and documents related to the GSA’sreported plansto award a contract for a pilot program to Ramp. News of the probe was first reported byProPublica. Among Connolly’s biggest concerns are that Ramp allegedly has “zero federal contracting experience” and its investors include a number of Trump allies and supporters. Those investors include Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund, Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures, Thrive Capital (founded by Josh Kushner, brother of Trump’s son-in-law Jared), vocal Trump supporter8VC’s Joe Lonsdale, and Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida and brother of former Republican President George W. Bush. Rabois, according to Connolly’s letter, raised more than $1 million for Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. Connolly is requesting several things from the GSA, including a detailed list of all meetings between any GSA official and any Ramp representative, and all communications between any GSA official, contractor, or subcontractor and any Ramp representative. The government’s internal expense card program, dubbed SmartPay, is a $700 billion program. Currently, Citibank and US Bank, two of the nation’s largest suppliers of credit cards, are the official banks of the currentSmartPay contract. In April, Ramp’s head of communications, Lindsay McKinley, confirmed to TechCrunch that the startup was “competing in a standard procurement process for a SmartPay pilot program based on the strength of our solution.” She claimed that the startup Ramp sawa public post on Xshared by the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE, on February 18 that said “the US government currently has ~4.6M active credit cards/accounts, which processed ~90M unique transactions for  ~$40B of spend in FY24.” A former customer, Ramp claims, introduced Ramp to GSA a few days later. However, Connolly alleges that Ramp reportedly began contacting entities in the payment industry about special bank identification numbers required to process government payments before a request for information (RFI) related to the contract was publicly announced. He also claimed that a GSA employee recently stated that Ramp was the “favorite” to win this business. Ramp did not have any comment on Connolly’s investigation. In March, Rampdoubled its valuationto $13 billion after a $150 million secondary share sale. Since its inception in 2019, the startup has raised over $1 billion in equity financing and $700 million in committed debt funding.

For its “Lunch with the FT” series, the paper joined Altman in his kitchen. He prepared a garlicky pasta and salad, taking a rare break from his demanding job ofadvocating for the disruption of American copyright law. Altman uses Graza olive oil, which comes in beautifully branded squeeze bottles that are popular on social media (he is a millennial, after all). But Altman’s preference for over-priced, “trendy” oil is not the crime — the crime is that he appears to fundamentally misunderstand Graza’s schtick. The company sells distinctly marked “sizzle” and “drizzle” varieties of its olive oil for sautéing and finishing dishes, respectively. To be fair, Spanish olive cultivation isn’t exactly common knowledge. But if you are so dedicated to the art of cooking that you stock two types of olive oil on your kitchen counter, you would probably know that one bottle is far pricier than the other because it’s meant to be used as a post-cooking “drizzle,” not a frying oil. Altman used the “drizzle” finishing oil in his sauté pan, even though the “sizzle” oil was just inches away. It’s like taking fresh basil and cooking it down in a pan as though it’s spinach: It’s a waste of precious earthly material. At that rate, you might as well just throw some dollar bills in the pan… which is notnotthe playbook of Silicon Valley startups, incidentally. OpenAI raised a record-setting$40 billionin a new funding round this year, yet it continues to bleed money, reportedly losing about$5 billionlast year. It’s not clear how the company will turn a profit with such monumental costs. OpenAI was at one pointlosing moneyon its $200-per-month ChatGPT Pro plan. Altman’s culinary faux pas probably can’t shed much light on OpenAI’s financials. But if you’re the kind of person who wastes pricey cooking oil, it could be that you’re burning VC money, too.

Growing market volatility and cheaper AI services have made banks, private equity investors, and asset managers wary of investing in Stargate, an OpenAI-led project that aims to raise up to $500 million for AI infrastructure in the U.S. and overseas. SoftBank, which in January said it would contribute significant capital to Stargate, has yet to develop a financing template or begin detailed discussions with potential backers, according to Bloomberg. Tariffs could greatly increase the cost of data center buildouts. Per an analysis by TD Cowen cited by Bloomberg, hiked prices for server racks, cooling systems, chips, and other components could contribute to overall build cost rises of 5-15% on average. Investors are also growing wary of an overcapacity spike. As Bloomberg notes, tech giants including Microsoft and Amazon have adjusted their data center strategies, in some cases pulling back on construction projects.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us General Motors has turned to Sterling Anderson, a veteran of the autonomous vehicle industry, to oversee its entire product line of gas-powered and electric vehicles, in a newly created job that will touch nearly every department at the U.S. automaker. The new VP of global product and chief product officer position will cover the entire lifecycle of GM’s portfolio and include hardware, software, services, and user experience. Anderson, who will report to GM President Mark Reuss, starts in the new position June 2. He will based in the company’s Mountain View Tech Center in California. Anderson made headlines last week after announcing he wasresigning from Aurora,the autonomous vehicle company he co-founded with two other pioneers in the AV sector. His resignation, which includes from the Aurora board, came just a week after the company launched itscommercial self-driving truck servicein Texas. Anderson told TechCrunch he had not anticipated leaving Aurora, but the more conversations he had with GM leadership, including Chair and CEO Mary Barra, the more he “appreciated the potential for what we could do there.” “The scope of what we’ll do at GM is expansive,” he noted in a recent interview. “It’s an ability to affect millions of people’s lives for the better, including with just magical experiences in their vehicles that also improve the safety and efficacy of our roadways.” Anderson’s role covers every nook and cranny at GM, which under Barra has pushed to modernize and electrify its portfolio of vehicles. He will lead vehicle and manufacturing engineering, battery, and software and services product management teams. That means Kurt Kelty, who heads battery, propulsion, and sustainability and also hailed from Tesla, will report to Anderson. The automaker’s heads of global manufacturing and product engineering, software and services, vehicle product programs, safety, and integration will also report to Anderson. “Our customers are expecting more from our vehicles than ever before,” Reuss said in a statement. “We have an opportunity to evolve the way we build from the ground up, with tighter integration between software and hardware, shorter development cycles, and an unwavering focus on a seamless customer experience. Sterling brings decades of leadership in automotive engineering and transformative software innovation to his new role and is the right leader to help GM continue leading now and into the future.” Anderson said he would not have left Aurora, where he was chief product officer, if the company had not recently met its major driverless self-driving truck service milestone. Anderson wouldn’t say what was on his initial to-do list at GM, noting he would focus on understanding the company, its culture, and products. Anderson said there was “a pretty long list of things” that he is very interested in understanding better. However, GM shareholders, customers, and employees shouldn’t expect extreme departures from the company’s current path. He noted that his areas of interest are all in line with the vision Barra has laid out, such as the need for rapid iteration and software-defined vehicle platforms that provide customers with services and updates for the vehicle through its lifetime. Anderson was director of Tesla’s Autopilot program when he left to co-found Aurora in 2017 alongside CEO Chris Urmson, the former head of the Google self-driving project, and Drew Bagnell, who was leading Uber’s autonomy and perception team. The pedigree of the trio gave Aurora immediate buzz, helping it attract high-profile investors like Sequoia Capital, Amazon, and T. Rowe Price Associates, as well as a slew of partnerships. Anderson holds master’s and PhD degrees in robotics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us It sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but it actually comes from a lab in Maryland. In 2018, Liangbing Hu, a materials scientist at the University of Maryland,devised a wayto turnordinary woodinto a material stronger than steel. It seemed like yet another headline-grabbing discovery that wouldn’t make it out of the lab. “All these people came to him,” said Alex Lau, CEO ofInventWood, “He’s like, OK, this is amazing, but I’m a university professor. I don’t know quite what to do about it.” Rather than give up, Hu spent the next few years refining the technology, reducing the time it took to make the material from more than a week to a few hours. Soon, it was ready to commercialize, and he licensed the technology to InventWood. Now, the startup’s first batches of Superwood will be produced starting this summer. “Right now, coming out of this first-of-a-kind commercial plant — so it’s a smaller plant — we’re focused on skin applications,” Lau said. “Eventually we want to get to the bones of the building. Ninety percent of the carbon impact from buildings is concrete and steel in the construction of the building.” To build the factory, InventWood has raised $15 million in the first close of a Series A round. The round was led by the Grantham Foundation with participation from Baruch Future Ventures, Builders VC, and Muus Climate Partners, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. InventWood’s Superwood product starts with regular timber, which is mostly composed of two compounds, cellulose and lignin. The goal is to strengthen the cellulose already present in the wood. “The cellulose nanocrystal is actually stronger than a carbon fiber,” Lau said. The company treats it with “food industry” chemicals to modify the molecular structure of the wood, he said, and then compresses the result to increase the hydrogen bonds between cellulose molecules. “We might densify the material by 4x and you might think, ‘Oh, it’ll be four times strong, because it has four times the fiber.’ But it’s actually more like 10 times stronger because of all these extra bonds that get created,” Lau said. The result is a material that has 50% more tensile strength than steel with a strength-to-weight ratio that’s 10 times better, the company said. It’s also Class A fire rated, or highly resistant to flame, and resistant to rot and pests. With some polymer impregnated, it can be stabilized for outdoor use like siding, decking, or roofing. InventWood’s first products will be facade materials for commercial and high-end residential buildings, Lau said. Compressing the material also concentrates the colors. “You end up with something that looks like these richer, tropical hardwoods,” he added. Ultimately, InventWood is planning to use wood chips to create structural beams of any dimension that won’t need finishing. “Imagine your I-beams look like this,” Lau said, holding up a sample of Superwood. “They’re beautiful, like walnut, ipe. These are the natural colors. We haven’t stained any of this.” Topics Senior Reporter, Climate Experts from OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere deliver exclusive insights across a must-attend industry event that you can attend for just $292.

    "title": "This American VC is betting on European defense tech; that’s still very unusual",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us VCs are known to move in herds, which is why Eric Slesinger stands out a bit. While most American investors chase AI startups or U.S.-based defense tech startups, the former CIA officer is hunting for defense tech deals in Europe. In fact, Slesinger, founder of201 Ventures, recently closed a $22 million fund focused on seed-stage European defense tech startups. His path from developing gadgets and software for CIA agents to becoming perhaps the only American VC exclusively investing in European defense tech also appears to be a prescient one. What would compel someone to leave “the best first job ever” at the CIA to pursue this specific ambition? As Slesinger told TechCrunch in a recentStrictlyVC Download podcast interview, the answer came from identifying a critical shift that many missed. “I left because I noticed that the private sector was increasingly playing a role in this competition that I previously had understood really to just be a government to government competition,” Slesinger explained. “What became obvious more so every day was that the private sector was playing such a big role here.” With degrees from Stanford in mechanical engineering and Harvard Business School, Slesinger’s background helped prepare him to bridge the gap between defense technology and commercial ventures. But it was his willingness to go against conventional wisdom that has made him interesting to investors, founders, andtech reportersalike. “I have always enjoyed going where other people tend to not want to go,” said Slesinger. “That was why I enjoyed the work at the CIA so much. A couple of things that people there used to say was, ‘go where others don’t go and do what they can’t do.’” As for what U.S. VCs were missing, from Slesinger’s point of view there were three things. First, “Europe has individual entrepreneurs that are just as hungry, just as high conviction, and just as smart as anywhere else in the world.” Second, “European governments waited way too long to rethink what the arrangement on their own security meant, and therefore hadn’t actually taken a critical eye towards it.” And third, “Europe was quickly being seen and will, in my opinion, continue to be the site of serious gray zone competition,” meaning activities by state or non-state actors that fall between traditional peace and outright war. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of Slesinger’s European venture has been the cultural resistance he says he encountered regarding defense investments. In 2022, after moving from the U.S. to Madrid, he started the European Defense Investor Network, which now includes entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers. In a 2023Medium post, Slesinger wrote about how his European VC colleagues were afraid to talk about their defense-related investments. Unlike in America, he told TechCrunch, defense tech investing in Europe “was seen as uncouth, something that should be done but not spoken about, and certainly not spoken about in polite company at the dinner table.” (Slesinger quickly added, “I’m exaggerating a little bit, but there’s a kernel of truth there.”) He says that cultural hesitance resulted in “many founders thinking about it, deciding not to build a company in the [defense] space.” Now that’s changing. The NATO Innovation Fund — the world’s first multi-sovereign venture capital fund, backed by 24 NATO allies and launched in the summer of 2022 after the Russia-Ukraine war broke out — has helped. Indeed, it’s a significant backer of 201 Ventures. So has the attention garnered by up-and-coming defense tech startups on the continent, including Munich-based Helsing, which is developing AI for use on battlefields and is currently valued at more than$5 billionby its investors. Another up-and-comer in Slesinger’s portfolio is Delian Alliance Industries, an Athens-based outfit developing surveillance towers to detect autonomous threats. Delian has so far raisedseed fundingbut is a hot ticket that’s surely being actively courted by VCs. With eight investments to date, 201 Ventures focuses on technologies that address that gray zone competition because, in Slesinger’s words, it’s “happening at scale in Europe, and it will for the next couple of decades.” These market dislocations, he said, “whether they’re price inefficiencies or a government playing a larger role in a market that it might otherwise if not for wanting a sovereign capability . . .these gray zone dislocations actually are a good form of alpha.” In addition to Delian, another of Slesinger’s bets isPolar Mist, a Swedish startup producing maritime drones with advanced navigation capabilities. Other focus areas include hypersonics and subsurface mapping. One challenge in funding defense tech startups is the longer development timeline compared to traditional venture investments. Slesinger acknowledged this tension in his chat with TechCrunch: “If you have a 10-year-venture-fund life cycle, that’s a real thing that we sort of have to do things to try to accelerate or bend a little bit.” Slesinger also thinks that “European companies ought to be doing more lobbying at much earlier stages.” Both raise questions about whether his gamble will pay off for investors. At the same time, his early vision for a more autonomous European defense ecosystem is becoming embraced by a whole lot of other investors these days as geopolitical tensions rise and Europe rethinks its security arrangements. Data published earlier this year by the NATO Innovation Fund and the research group Dealroom showed that European startups working on defense and related tech raised 24% more capital in 2024 than in 2023, hitting$5.2 billion— surpassing even AI funding. With President Donald Trump returning to office in January and casting doubt on the U.S.’s commitment to European defense, that figure is likely to climb even higher.

The company is considering instead linking the price hikes to other developments, which might include new features and designs, the report said, citing anonymous supply chain sources. Increased tariffs are expected tocost Apple $900 million in the third quarter, though the company has so far not confirmed if the U.S.-China trade war could impact the prices of its products. The company is also now importinga larger portion of its iPhones from India, rather than China, to mitigate tariffs. The U.S. and China on Monday, however, agreed topause their respective reciprocal tariffson each other for 90 days to allow time for further discussions.

The company plans to release a “mostly glass, curved iPhone” with no cutouts on the iPhone’s 20th anniversary, Bloomberg reported.

    "article_text": "Counter-terrorism police are investigating after two properties linked to Sir Keir Starmer were damaged in suspected arson attacks. Emergency services were called to a fire at the prime minister's private home in Kentish Town, north London, in the early hours of Monday. There was damage to the property's entrance but nobody was hurt,  the Metropolitan Police said. And just after 03:00 BST on Sunday, emergency services were called to a small fire at the front door of a house converted into flats in nearby Islington, a property that is also linked to Sir Keir. One person was assisted to safety via an internal staircase by crews wearing breathing apparatus, London Fire Brigade said. Police are also looking into a car fire as part of the probe. All three fires are being treated as suspicious and inquiries are ongoing. The prime minister - who lives at his official residence in Downing Street - is understood to still own the Kentish Town property which he lived at before the general election, but it has been rented out since then. Sir Keir has thanked the emergency services for their work, his official spokesman said. He added the matter was \"subject to a live investigation so I can't comment further\", and declined to provide any further details on who was in the property when the fire started. Police earlier said that counter-terrorism officers were leading the probe \"as a precaution and due to the property having previous connections with a high-profile public figure\". On the Kentish Town property fire,  London Fire Brigade (LFB) said it had been called to a \"small fire\" at 01:11 BST on Monday that was under control about 20 minutes later. It said about 10 firefighters and two fire appliances from Kentish Town Fire Station attended the incident. A Metropolitan Police statement said: \"Officers attended the scene. Damage was caused to the property's entrance, nobody was hurt. \"The fire is being investigated and cordons remain in place while enquiries continue.\" It later emerged that just before 03:00 on Thursday, firefighters were called to a small car fire on the same street. The fire was brought under control by 03:30. At just after 03:00 on Sunday, firefighters were called to the Islington fire. The Kentish Town house has previously been targeted by protesters. Last year,three people were found guiltyof public order offences after staging a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside it. On Monday afternoon, investigators could still be seen outside the property with local residents being allowed through the tape as they returned home from work. Robin Windsor, who died last year, was a star of the BBC TV show Strictly Come Dancing. The Bakerloo, Waterloo & City and Mildmay lines are among the routes affected. Kobi Macharia Dooly was found with multiple knife wounds in his cot, the court hears. Higgins Homes PLC and four men will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 16 June.

    "title": "Chris Mason: Starmer's robust language nods to immigration failures",
    "article_text": "It is perhaps little wonder immigration is as politically charged an issue as it is, when you consider two things. Firstly,as I wrote here, the numbers point to it being the stand-out UK social and demographic change of the 21st century. And secondly, it is also one of the biggest and most transparent political failings, when you compare rhetoric to reality. There were the projections made by Sir Tony Blair's government two decades ago that allowing unlimited migration from central and eastern Europe would tempt modest numbers of people to move here – and huge numbers turned up. In the 2010s, the Conservatives repeatedly promised to cut net migration to the tens of thousands a year, and repeatedly failed. The numbers then rocketed after Brexit, the very act that meant UK governments were entirely responsible for immigration policy for the first time in a generation. Most people miss most political debates most of the time, but some are sufficiently totemic they are not just noticed but make the political weather. The arguments over immigration are one of them – and what I have just set out tells you why. This is the generational context within which this prime minister's promises perch. It is a longevity of failure that senior politicians of various political persuasions privately accept – perhaps more so than any other single issue – has seeded a cynicism and a disillusion with how we are governed. Sir Keir Starmer's language felt like an acknowledgement of that central point: here was a Labour prime minister, a former human rights lawyer, claiming \"we risk becoming an island of strangers.\" It is a phrase some, particularly on the left, regard as repulsive. Others counter that it is a widely held perception which it is high time those in high office shared. Labour wrestle with the many practical and political trade-offs around immigration policy, just as other parties in government have as well. In practical terms, staffing care homes, building new houses – can these things be done without an influx of folk from abroad? Interestingly, Sir Keir took issue with the long-standing view of many that immigration helps drive or at least prop up economic growth. The other context here is the insurgency of Reform UK. Nigel Farage argues, as he has for years and years, that politicians have been far too slow to get how much immigration matters to so many people. Labour are acutely aware of Farage's capacity to communicate in a way that resonates with those who feel successive governments have not just ignored them on this issue, but belittled and demeaned their views too. That is why the prime minister is using the language he is now. And there is another thing going on here too. This is a week of muscular language and intent, firstly primarily on legal migration now, and in a few days on illegal migration too. By next week the focus will switch to an anticipated new deal between the UK and the European Union, and within it, the likelihood of a youth mobility plan – meaning young people from the UK can travel more freely around Europe, and those from the EU can come here. Ministers will insist this doesn't amount to freedom of movement, nor immigration – because visits in both directions will be strictly age and time limited. But you can be certain there will be a row about it. These then are the short, medium and long-term reasons why the prime minister and his team know that their plan for delivering a sustained downward trend to the net migration numbers is absolutely crucial to their credibility.

    "title": "MSPs to vote on assisted dying in Scotland",
    "article_text": "For the third time in Scottish parliamentary history, MSPs are to vote on plans to legalise assisted dying. The ballot, which would allow terminally-ill adults to seek medical help to end their lives, comes after MPsvoted in favour of similar proposalsfor England and Wales. Supporters describe the Holyrood bill as a progressive move to ease the suffering of dying Scots. Opponents say it would fail to safeguard some of the most vulnerable people in society. The proposed legislation would allow a patient to request medical assistance to end their life - but only if they had a terminal illness and had been ruled mentally fit to make the decision by two doctors. Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur, who tabled the bill,recently saidthe minimum age of people who could seek an assisted death would rise from 16 to 18. The Scottish Parliament will hold a free vote on the bill - which means MSPs will not be instructed on how to vote by their parties or the government. The stage one vote is on the general principles of the bill. A simple majority of votes in favour (more \"yes\" votes than \"no\" votes) would allow it to progress to stage two, where MSPs could propose changes. Another vote on the final draft of the bill would be held before it could become legislation. If MSPs do not back the bill at stage one, it will fall. The ballot, which will follow a debate in the chamber, is expected to be close. Dozens of MSPs have declared support or opposition to the bill, though many others are thought to be waiting to hear arguments in parliament before making up their mind. The Scottish government is officially neutral on the matter. First Minister John Swinney and Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes, however, have said they will not support the bill. Former first ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf are also opposed, as is Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar. In a post on Instagram, Sturgeon warned of the potential for \"internal coercion\", which she described as \"a feeling on the part of terminally-ill individuals that others might be better off if they were no longer here\". She also raised concerns about trying to define terminal illness in legislation. Sturgeon added: \"If assisted dying is an option, I worry that many people will choose to die more prematurely than they need to.\" Labour MSP Pam Duncan-Glancy, the first permanent wheelchair user to be elected to Holyrood, has been among the most vocal critics of the bill. Speaking on the eve of the vote, McArthur said the legislation had \"strict eligibility criteria\" with people able to make a choice \"in a way that is robustly safeguarded\". The Orkney MSP said: \"My bill would put in place safeguards that don't currently exist, a situation that leaves many terminally-ill people more vulnerable and more likely to take matters into their own hands.\" He added: \"Scotland cannot put off this conversation. And parliament cannot continue to leave this issue in the 'too difficult' box. \"It must, at the very least, allow time for amendments to be considered to see if a bill can be agreed that commands majority support and public confidence.\" His bill has been backed by Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton, ex-Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw and Scottish Greens co-leaders Lorna Slater and Patrick Harvie. Social Justice Secretary Shirley Anne-Somerville and Scottish Conservative deputy leader Rachael Hamilton have also said they will vote for the proposals at stage one. Health Secretary Neil Gray, who will speak for the government during the debate, said he would abstain from the vote to maintain neutrality. A bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales passed its first stage at Westminster in November. The proposals face months of debate, scrutiny and possible amendments, as well as final approval from the Commons and the Lords, before they could become law. The most recent Holyrood vote on assisted dying, in 2015, was defeated at stage one by 82 votes to 36. That bill was tabled by the late independent MSP Margo MacDonald, who died in 2014 after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Following her death, the bill was taken up by Harvie, who will again argue in favour of a law change in this year's debate. Former first minister described it as the \"most difficult decision\" of her career as an MSP. MSPs will vote this week on whether or not to allow terminally ill adults to seek medical help to end their lives. After two failed recruitment rounds a candidate for Scotland's first ever patient safety commissioner has been found. The former first minister said there were not enough safeguards protecting vulnerable people ahead of a vote at Holyrood next week. The move follows the UK Supreme Court's landmark ruling over the definition of a woman.",

    "title": "Diddy used fame and violence to abuse women, trial hears",
    "article_text": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs used fame and violence to sexually abuse women, prosecutors have said in opening statements at the hip-hop mogul's trial, while the rapper's attorneys defended his \"swinger\" lifestyle. The 55-year-old has pleaded not guilty to charges including racketeering, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The court also heard from prosecutors' first witnesses, including a security guard from a hotel where Mr Combs is seen in a now-viral video beating his ex-girlfriend in 2016. His testimony was followed by a man who said Mr Combs abused his ex-girlfriend during paid sexual encounters with the couple. Warning: This story contains details that some readers may find distressing. After seating a panel of 12 jurors and six alternates on Monday morning, the government and Mr Combs' lawyers outlined their cases. Prosecutor Emily Johnson accused Mr Combs of using his celebrity status and a \"loyal\" inner circle of employees to sexually abuse women and run a criminal enterprise. She focused on the two central alleged victims in the case - Mr Combs' former girlfriend, Cassandra Ventura, and another unnamed former girlfriend. Prosecutors told the court that Mr Combs had used violence and threatened Ms Ventura's music career to force her to perform non-consensual, humiliating sexual acts with male prostitutes during so-called \"freak-offs\" filmed by Mr Combs. The defendant \"had the power to ruin her [Ms Ventura's] life\", Ms Johnson said. As prosecutors described the allegations against Mr Combs, he sat in a grey sweater and trousers with a blank stare and his hands folded on his lap. At the heart of the government's case is a surveillance video that shows Mr Combs beating Ms Ventura and dragging her by the hair in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Lawyers for Mr Combs said the video was evidence of Mr Combs' \"flawed\" character, but not of a larger criminal enterprise. \"Domestic violence is not sex trafficking,\" said Teny Geragos, Mr Combs' attorney. Ms Geragos said Mr Combs has a \"bit of a different sex life\" - and shifted the focus to the women accusing him, calling them \"capable, strong women\" who chose to stay with the rapper. They had \"the freedom to make the choices that they made\", Ms Geragos argued. Prosecutors' first witness, a former security guard named Israel Florez, worked at the hotel, the site of a surveillance video showing Mr Combs attacking his ex-girlfriend. The clip, which CNN released last year, was played for jurors on Monday. Mr Florez told jurors that morning on 5 March 2016 at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles he received a call about a \"woman in distress\" on the sixth floor. He said he found Mr Combs there in a towel, slouched on a chair with a \"devilish\" look on his face, and a broken vase on the floor. Ms Ventura sat cowering in the corner with her face covered, Mr Florez said. Mr Florez told prosecutors that Ms Ventura kept saying she wanted to leave, but Mr Combs told her she could not. He testified that Ms Ventura had a purple eye, but did not want to call police and she eventually left in a black SUV. Mr Florez alleged that later, to \"make it go away\", Mr Combs tried to hand him a wad of cash, but he declined. Attorneys for Mr Combs tried to poke holes in Mr Florez's claims, asking why he did not include certain details - like Ms Ventura's purple eye  - in an incident report he filed afterwards. His testimony was followed by Daniel Phillip, a former manager of male strippers, who said he met Mr Combs and Ms Ventura after his boss asked him to fill in as a stripper for a bachelorette party. But, Mr Phillip said, he was greeted at a hotel instead by Ms Ventura, who told him it was her birthday and her husband wanted to give her a gift. Mr Phillip told the court he would go on to have sex with Ms Ventura on several occasions - encounters that lasted as long as 10 hours, sometimes under the influence of drugs - as Mr Combs watched and filmed. He alleged that he witnessed Mr Combs attack Ms Ventura at least twice, including one time when he dragged her by her hair as she screamed \"I'm sorry\". Mr Combs then came back in the room with Ms Ventura and asked the two to have sex again in front of him, Mr Phillip said. \"I was shocked,\" he said. \"It came out of nowhere. I was terrified.\" Mr Phillip claimed on the stand that he did not call the police for fear that Mr Combs was \"someone with unlimited power\" and that he could \"lose his life\" for reporting it. The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday when Ms Ventura is expected to testify. At the crowded courthouse on Monday, Mr Combs' children - including his daughters - were seen holding hands. His mother also was photographed walking out of court along with his publicist. A prosecutor says one of the alleged victims was blindfolded and thrown into the back of a car at gunpoint. Santos' downfall included him being the first member of Congress to be expelled in more than 20 years. The 65-year-old suspect is also charged with visa fraud while seeking to become a US citizen in 2003. Officials said there were no injuries reported but that high levels of carbon monoxide were discovered in nearby buildings. Federal housing officials accused Letitia James, who won a real estate case against Trump in 2023, of mortgage fraud.",

    "article_text": "Rachael Blackmore was given an honorary MBE in 2023, for services to UK sport Grand National-winning jockey Rachael Blackmore has retired from racing with immediate effect. In 2021, the Irishwoman became the first female jockey to winthe world's most famous steeplechase, which was first run in 1839. Blackmore won aboard the Henry de Bromhead-trained Minella Times in the colours of owner JP McManus. \"I feel the time is right. I'm sad but I'm also incredibly grateful for what my life has been for the past 16 years,\" Blackmore, 35, said. \"It is daunting, not being able to say that I am a jockey anymore. Who even am I now! But I feel so incredibly lucky to have had the career I've had.\" Blackmore won the BBC's Sports Personality's World Sport Star of the Year for 2021 following her trailblazing victory at Aintree which came 44 years after Charlotte Brew became the first woman to ride in the National. Blackmore - humble pioneer who transformed racing 'Beyond belief' - Blackmore on National triumph Prior to her Grand National triumph, Blackmore had already become the first female jockey to win the Champion Hurdle aboard Honeysuckle, that same year. In 2022, she secured another first when steering A Plus Tard to win the Cheltenham Gold Cup - one of 18 festival winners she would ride at the Prestbury Park course. \"I just feel so lucky, to have been legged up on the horses I have, and to have experienced success I never even dreamt could be possible,\" she added. \"To have been in the right place at the right time with the right people, and to have gotten on the right horses - because it doesn't matter how good you are without them. \"They have given me the best days of my life and to them I am most grateful.\" The daughter of a dairy farmer and a school teacher, Blackmore rode ponies as a child near her home in Killenaule, County Tipperary. Blackmore had once hoped to become a vet, gaining a degree in equine science and combining her studies with riding. She rode her first winner as an amateur in February 2011 at Thurles before turning professional in 2015, but it was her success on Minella Times which secured her place in history. \"I don't feel male or female - I don't even feel human!\" Blackmore said, immediately after her win by six-and-a-half lengths at Aintree four years ago. BlackmoreÂ broughtÂ theÂ curtainÂ downÂ byÂ ridingÂ MaÂ BelleÂ EtoileÂ to victory at Cork last Saturday - the 575th winner of her 4,566-race career as a professional jockey. Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin led the tributes and called Blackmore \"a sportsperson of a generation\" who has \"blazed a trail for others to follow\". Barry Geraghty said his fellow Grand National-winning jockey was \"an ultra-talented horsewoman\" who was one of \"the most committed jockeys you could ever ride against\". Former jockey and Racing TV pundit Jane Mangan said: \"We can only consider ourselves lucky to have witnessed her achievements in our lifetime. She didn't just break glass ceilings - she painted the whole damn sky.\" Frank Berry, racing manager for JP McManus who owned Grand National winner Minella Times, said Blackmore has had an \"unbelievable career\". \"She's done all things that everyone wants to do. Rachael won all the big races and she's retiring in one piece. I'm delighted for her,\" Irish trainer John 'Shark' Hanlon, who provided Blackmore with her first winner, Stowaway Peal, in 2011 said Blackmore was an \"amazing woman\". \"I'm delighted she went out on her own terms. She won't leave racing because she loves horses, like us all,\" he said. Instinct, timing, tactical awareness and strength all played a part in her story. But also the ability to bounce back from falls and injury, plus sheer hard graft. Rachael Blackmore was a game changer who was among the best of her generation. When she rode six winners to be leading jockey at the 2021 Cheltenham Festival, she may not have returned to grand fanfare at a meeting held behind closed doors because of Covid-19 restrictions, but the impact was still felt. Her tally was more than the entire British training contingent. Before Blackmore, and fellow jockeys Lizzie Kelly and Bryony Frost, successes for female jockeys at Cheltenham were a rarity and largely came through amateur riders Katie Walsh and Nina Carberry. With Walsh, Carberry and Kelly now retired and Frost moving to France after finding opportunities limited since winning a bullying case against fellow jockey Robbie Dunne, it will be interesting to see if other women can rise to the fore in jump racing. Just two days ago, Hollie Doyle passed Hayley Turner's record for winners by a female jockey on the Flat, but Blackmore was only of only two professional women - the other being Isabel Williams - riding at this year's Cheltenham Festival.

    "title": "Top UK Special Forces general oversaw blocking of Afghan 'war-crime' witnesses to Britain",
    "article_text": "A top general who failed to report evidence of alleged SAS war crimes in Afghanistan later oversaw the rejection of hundreds of UK resettlement applications from Afghan commandos who served with the elite regiment, BBC Panorama can reveal. Gen Sir Gwyn Jenkins led UK Special Forces (UKSF) in Afghanistan at a time when alleged war crimes were committed. He later appointed a UKSF officer under his command, who had also served in Afghanistan, to assess the Afghan commando applications after special forces headquarters was given a controversial veto over them. Thousands of applications from individuals with credible evidence of service with Afghan Special Forces, including the units known as the Triples, were then rejected, leaving many of the former commandos at the mercy of the Taliban. The rejections are controversial because they came at a time when a judge-led public inquiry in the UK had begun investigating the SAS for alleged war crimes on operations on which the Triples were present. If the Afghan commandos were in the UK, they could be called as witnesses - but the inquiry has no power to compel testimony from foreign nationals who are overseas. Some of those denied visas were subsequently tortured and killed by the Taliban, according to former colleagues, family members and lawyers. According to internal emails and testimony from within the Ministry of Defence (MoD), obtained by Panorama, the UK Special Forces officer appointed by Gen Jenkins stood over civil service caseworkers from the resettlement scheme and instructed them to reject the Triples applications, one after another, on what sources described as spurious grounds. A senior government source close to the process told the BBC that the UK Special Forces officer \"would never have acted without direction\", adding that \"everything would have gone through Gwyn Jenkins\". At the time, in 2021-22, Gen Jenkins was the head of all UK Special Forces. He is now the chief strategic adviser to the Defence Secretary John Healey and is tipped to take over as First Sea Lord - the head of the Royal Navy. Gen Jenkins was made aware of allegations that the SAS was committing extrajudicial killings in Afghanistan, but he failed to report the allegations to military police - Panorama has previously revealed - despite a legal obligation to do so. The suspected unlawful killings continued. Panorama has now heard eyewitnesstestimony from veterans who served in UK Special Forces detailing alleged war crimes stretching over more than a decadeand involving the SBS as well as the SAS. Gen Jenkins did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on this story. The MoD responded on his behalf. It said in a statement that there is no evidence it has tried to prevent former Afghan troops giving evidence to the Inquiry and that \"anyone can provide evidence… no matter where in the world they are\". The MoD added that it was \"fully committed to delivering on our pledge to relocate and resettle eligible Afghans and their families to the UK\". \"Each resettlement application is decided on its own merits against the criteria outlined in the ARAP [Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy] and immigration rules,\" the statement said. The rejections of the Triples applications left caseworkers from the ARAP scheme questioning the validity of the process, given that many of the applications contained compelling evidence of service alongside British special forces. One applicant was rejected even though they had submitted photos of themselves serving alongside Gen Jenkins. Hundreds of rejections have since been overturned following a government review. A letter obtained by Panorama shows that concerns were raised among cabinet ministers in January 2024 over the existence of the UK Special Forces' veto over the Triples applications. The then Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer wrote to senior Conservatives to say the role of UKSF in denying the applications was \"deeply inappropriate\" and \"a significant conflict of interest, that should be obvious to all\". He had been compelled to write, he added, because he had been shown evidence \"that 5 members of these units have been killed having been rejected for resettlement\". Mr Mercer, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan before becoming an MP, went on to warn that the role of UKSF in the process had a \"very high chance of being exposed by the Afghan Inquiry\", which could \"lead to serious questions of all those Ministers involved in the process\". The Triples units - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations targeting Taliban leaders in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK. But, according to MoD documents obtained by Panorama, thousands of ARAP applications containing credible evidence of service alongside UK Special Forces were subsequently rejected. BBC Panorama first revealed last year that it had been UK Special Forces - the very force that trained and served with the Triples - that rejected them. \"We heard some of our Triples were already killed by the Taliban,\" said Jumakhan Joya, a former Afghan special forces commanding officer. \"Some of them are in jail in a Taliban prison. Some of them have already been disabled by the Taliban. They're breaking their hands, their legs, their head,\" he said. Mr Joya told the BBC he believed that the existence of the public inquiry was the \"only reason\" their applications had been vetoed. The rejections and reported reprisals have outraged some former members of British special forces. \"What's happened is horrendous. It is a betrayal and it shames us all,\" one former UK Special Forces officer told Panorama. Asked by Panorama about the government's rejection of Triples' applications, Bruce Houlder KC, who as a former director of service prosecutions was responsible for bringing charges against members of the armed forces, said the government must have known the Triples would have \"highly relevant\" evidence that would be \"much easier to obtain\" if they were in the UK. \"I can't think of any fair reason why we should exclude people from their right to live in this country, which is extended to others, simply because they might be in possession of information which would embarrass special forces,\" Mr Houlder said. \"If that is the reason, it's disreputable and it can't be supported in any way.\" Do you have information about this story that you want to share?

    "title": "The view on immigration from a town transformed by it",
    "article_text": "It's fair to say Oldham is no stranger to immigration. It has transformed the town, a place that has witnessed a faster than average population rise between the last two Censuses (2011 – 2021) and where almost one in five residents (17.8%) were born outside the UK. So what do the prime minister's words mean here, when he warned that without changes to cut migration, the UK was at risk of becoming an \"island of strangers\"? Yorkshire Street runs straight through the town centre, and it's here where we met John and John. Between them they've been repairing roads in Oldham for more than 50 years. They welcome the government's pledge to reduce migration. \"We're a bit overrun aren't we, with the NHS and everything,\" the younger John explains. \"You can't get doctors or dentist. And housing for young people, you can't get on the market.\" The reason he gives for struggling to access these services is simple: \"There's just too many people.\" But he recognises the country depends on overseas labour - \"the country needs it don't it\" - says the older John. \"Where does the country go from here. In another 10, 15 years it's going to be a different place completely isn't it. \" Concerns about the pace of change are not limited to those born and bred in this part of the Pennines. Hussein was born in Pakistan and moved here forty years ago. He now runs a thriving mobile phone shop at Tommyfield indoor market. He tells the BBC he is so frustrated with rising immigration he voted for Brexit in 2016 and has since written to Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner about his concerns. \"We are already short of jobs,\" he tells us. \"If we are getting professionals from outside, what are you going to do about the professionals in this country? It means they're going to hurt the working class.\" Back on Yorkshire Street, we caught up with Michelle Delaney in the doorway of her charity, Project Pearl. \"This used to be a pub, that used to be a pub, that up there was a pub and it's now a takeaway place,\" she says, pointing to at least half a dozen chicken shops, plus the same number again of Eastern European mini marts and Middle Eastern-run barbers. But Michelle is not worried about the post-Covid change on her high street. Her big concern is who will staff care homes and hospitals. \"What will we do if we haven't got the nurses, and the doctors, the carers and all the others to do the jobs that they do, like they did with my Mum and my husband when they were ill,\" she tells us. \"How will we manage?\" And it's that question causing deep concern at Pennine Social Care on Union Street. Directors Violet Gutu and Elliot Sparks simply do not know how they will cope. Violet explains that 99% of her work depends on \"foreign workers.\" \"We have tried local recruitment but we've failed in many cases,\" she says. From their brightly painted offices, this care provision agency and charity works in multiple areas to support those with disabilities and mental health crises – from providing support workers or carers, to throwing the doors open for training and creative activities. Without their care, Elliot and Violet both say these vulnerable children and adults would be left to struggle almost completely alone. \"The effects could be quite catastrophic.\" \"The rules change but the responsibilities don't,\" Elliot explained. \"We rely on good staff, with good hearts, who've given up their lives, their families to come here and take care of our vulnerable people.\" Violet, who came to the UK herself from Zimbabwe over twenty years ago, became emotional when explaining how proud she is of her staff. \"So long as you're an immigrant there's no appreciation for you whatsoever. There's always backlash.\" The challenge for the government is to addressdeep public concernson immigration in the UK, without threatening public services. The government has outlined plans to \"significantly\" cut immigration - what are the challenges it faces? The government says its proposals will reduce record levels of migration to the UK in recent years. Plans to ban the recruitment of care workers from overseas are among efforts to curb near record net migration. The prime minister refused to set a cap on immigration but has promised it will fall “significantly”. The prime minister promises numbers will fall 'significantly' under Labour.",

    "title": "What are the challenges the government's immigration plan faces?",
    "article_text": "When it comes to reducing UK immigration, there have been plenty of promises and targets from successive governments over the last 15 years, but the numbers remain high. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is now pledging to \"take back control of our borders\", promising tighter rules to bring down the numbers \"significantly\". BBC Verify examines the measures set out by the government and the challenges ahead. Migration levels have hit \"unprecedented levels\" in recent years,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Net migration to the UK - total permanent arrivals minus total permanent departures - reached a record 906,000 in the year ending in June 2023 and then fell to 728,000 in the year ending in June 2024. The continued high levels persist, despite previous government efforts to bring the numbers down. For example, in 2010 the Conservatives pledged to reduce net migration to the \"tens of thousands\". Annual net migration is expected to come down to about 315,000 by the end of the Parliament. That's according to the central forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the independent body that scrutinises the public finances. That estimate, however, would still be higher than most years in the past decade. The vast majority of migrants come to the UK for study or work. And many of the work visas have been for people coming to do jobs in health and social care. However, applications for health and social care visas have come down sharply in the past two years after the rules were tightened by the last Conservative government and this decline will ultimately feed into the official net migration statistics in the coming years. There's been much discussion about the link between immigration and economic growth. TheWhite Paper- which sets out the government's plan - says the UK economy needs to wean itself off a reliance on cheap overseas labour. While taking questions from journalists, the prime minister claimed the idea immigration leads to higher economic growth \"doesn't hold\". Economists do not agree about the exact impact that simply adding more people to an economy has on growth and prosperity. New arrivals might increase the country's overall level of economic activity - measured by GDP. But on a per-person basis, GDP could be stagnant or falling. Also a larger population puts more pressure on demand for public services and housing. However, if immigrants are filling important gaps in the labour market which would otherwise not be filled - especially jobs that require specific skills - then economists generally think that immigrants can boost GDP per head and general prosperity. TheOBR saysthat increased migration generally increases economic growth but \"the size of this impact and the effect on per person living standards is highly uncertain\". The OBR's point about growth per person is important because the government has made growth of this measure a key priority. Growth per personfell in 2023 and was flat in 2024. There are gaps in our labour market which have been substantially filled by migrants in recent years, most notably social care. And there were still estimated to be131,000 vacant postsin adult social care in England in 2023. Care providers argue stopping them recruiting from overseas will likely make that gap bigger. Non-immigrants could theoretically fill many of these posts and working-age people who are economically inactive could potentially be deployed in this sector if they could be encouraged and helped into work. Yet the main barrier to recruitment in social care has been the level of pay, which is currently too low to attract sufficient numbers of British workers. Amy Clark, commercial director of a Cornwall care home chain, told the BBC that the measures could cause challenges because \"recruiting locally is very, very difficult\". The government could increase the levels of pay in social care, but that would leave them under pressure to increase grants to local authorities and potentially raise taxes to fund it. Problems with social care recruitment were also highlighted by Madeleine Sumption, deputy chair of the Migration Advisory Committee. \"We've seen widespread reports of exploitation, people coming in who are quite vulnerable earning very low wages. \"So I am not surprised the government has chosen to close overseas recruitment because it's caused them so much difficulty,\" she said. Overseas students have been a major contributor to levels of net migration in recent years. But they are also a significant source of funding for UK universities. A large reduction in overseas students numbers would undermine the finances of many universities and a number are already in severe financial difficulties. The government wants to monitor more closely how universities recruit international students. It is also proposing a limit on the time international students can remain in the UK after graduating. Foreign students would only have 18 months to look for a job, down from 2-3 years previously. Universities UK - which represents 141 universities - has urged the government \"to think carefully\" about the impact of its measures. If overseas student numbers did fall, the government could make up the shortfall in universities' revenue by increasing central government grants but, again, that could require an increase in taxes. Alternatively, it could further increase domestic students' tuition fees, although that would also be contentious. The government says it still wants to attract high-skilled individuals \"who play by the rules and contribute to the economy\". However, the PM also stressed that some parts of the economy are \"addicted\" to importing cheap labour, rather than investing in training UK workers. As an example, Sir Keir said the number of engineering apprenticeships had fallen in recent years, while visas for overseas workers in this area had gone up. Figures in the government's new immigration plan show that the number of UK work visas issued for engineering professionals rose from 3,427 in 2021 to 5,495 in 2024. Meanwhile, the number of new apprenticeships in engineering in England fell from 26,970 in 2021-22 to 18,520 in 2024-25. But if the government wants many more home-trained engineers that will likely come with a cost in terms of a higher training budget. While that investment could come partly from firms, it could also mean more public spending and possibly tax rises. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, total public spending on adult education and skills hasfallen by 24% in real terms since 2010. Reacting to the government's proposals, Make UK - which represents manufacturers - said firms are being forced to recruit overseas staff because domestic skills training is \"fundamentally flawed\". \"Without access to skilled labour in the UK, manufacturers cannot take advantage of the opportunities presented by the recent trade agreements with India and the US and deliver the growth we all want to see and the economy needs\", said CEO Stephen Phipson.

    "title": "The humble pioneer who was first female jockey to win Grand National and changed racing",
    "article_text": "Rachael Blackmore won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Grand National in a glittering career \"I don't feel male or female right now. I don't even feel human.\" A memorable line from Rachael Blackmore after she became the first female jockey to win the Grand National when triumphing on Minella Times in 2021. As she retires from the saddle aged 35, Blackmore can rightly be called a game changer who was among the best of her generation. In a sport in which male and female riders compete on a level playing field, punters did not focus on whether she was a man or woman. She was just a top jockey. The self-effacing pioneer went about setting landmarks with a quiet humility as the first woman to: Win the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, with Honeysuckle, in 2021 Become the Cheltenham Festival meeting's leading rider, in the same year Win the National a few weeks later Land the Cheltenham Gold Cup, with A Plus Tard in 2022 Trailblazing jockey Blackmore retires from racing 'Beyond belief' - Blackmore on National triumph The daughter of a dairy farmer and a school teacher, she rode ponies as a child near her home in Killenaule, County Tipperary, in the Republic of Ireland. Blackmore gained a degree in equine science with hopes of becoming a vet but combined her studies with riding out and competing as an amateur. Her first winner came aboard Stowaway Pearl for John 'Shark' Hanlon at Thurles in 2011, and she turned professional four years later. Much of her success came through an association with trainer Henry de Bromhead, while some of her early opportunities can be attributed to Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his Gigginstown House Stud team. \"We identified Rachael early on as a very good jockey - not a female jockey - and we put her on all the Gigginstown Horses with Henry and Joseph [O'Brien],\" he said after her National victory. \"Her hard work and intelligence has done all the rest.\" Blackmore won on Allaho, Sir Gerhard, Telmesomethinggirl, Honeysuckle, Quilixios and Bob Olinger at the 2021 Cheltenham Festival Instinct, timing, tactical awareness and strength all played a part in her story. But also the ability to bounce back from falls and injury, plus sheer hard graft. When she rode six winners to be leading jockey at the 2021 Cheltenham Festival, she may not have returned to grand fanfare at a meeting held behind closed doors because of Covid-19 restrictions, but the impact was still felt. Her tally was more than the entire British training contingent. Before Blackmore, and fellow jockeys Lizzie Kelly and Bryony Frost, successes for female jockeys at Cheltenham were a rarity and largely came through amateur riders Katie Walsh and Nina Carberry. With Walsh, Carberry and Kelly now retired and Frost moving to France after finding opportunities limited since winning a bullying case against fellow jockey Robbie Dunne, it will be interesting to see if other women can rise to the fore in jump racing. Just two days ago,Hollie Doyle passed Hayley Turner's recordfor winners by a female jockey on the Flat, but Blackmore was one of only two professional women - the other being Isabel Williams - riding at this year's Cheltenham Festival. Rachael Blackmore won the Grand National in 2021 on Minella Times While Blackmore has not outlined the reasons for her retirement, Walsh and Carberry stopped at similar ages. They ended their careers with winners at Ireland's showpiece Punchestown Festival and maybe Blackmore intended to do the same, but she unusually ended the recent meeting without a victory. She suffered a bad neck injury in a fall earlier this season and only returned to action in December after three months out. Blackmore took success for women to another level, competing for a historic Irish champion jockey title before twice finishing runner-up to Paul Townend. Her achievements transcended racing. Victory in the National, watched by an estimated 500 million people worldwide, made headlines around the globe, and she was voted World Sport Star at the 2021 BBC Sports Personality awards. \"The support has been incredible. I got such a kick out of being on that list of nominees,\" she said. Those nominees included tennis star Novak Djokovic, boxing great Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and American football quarterback Tom Brady. Blackmore, whose partner Brian Hayes is also a jockey, did not revel in the limelight - she preferred to get on with the business of riding winners - but spoke thoughtfully when interviewed. De Bromhead said she was a great support after his 13-year-old son Jack died in a riding accident in September 2022. The pair's victory with Honeysuckle in the horse's swansong in the Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham in March 2023 sparked jubilant and emotional scenes. Spectators grabbed every vantage point to cheer the winner into the paddock. The roars were for the trainer and horse, but the rider too. Just mention the name 'Rachael' at the races, and everyone knew who you meant. With Honeysuckle in the winner's enclosure, a rainbow appeared on the horizon. \"We all wish a very special kid could be here today but he's watching down on us,\" said Blackmore. Her partnership with Honeysuckle was  a great match. Seventeen wins from 19 races, including four at the Cheltenham Festival. All with the same jockey on board. Blackmore will be remembered for a series of firsts, and potentially paving the way for others. \"Ah, look, it's brilliant, but I won't be the last. I'm delighted for myself anyway,\" she said after winning the National. \"I just hope it shows it doesn't matter, male or female. Plenty of people have gone before me and done that - Katie Walsh was third here on Seabass. All those things help girls coming along, but I don't think it's a major talking point any more.\" When Blackmore won the Gold Cup on A Plus Tard, she earned praise from the Cheltenham Festival's all-time leading rider Ruby Walsh. \"She's inspiring kids everywhere. It's incredible the interest she's driving in the sport. You need role models like that for the sport and the industry, she's box office,\" he said. While the 'This Girl Can' campaign, launched 10 years ago, encouraged more women to be active, Rachael Blackmore wanted to realise a dream of being at the summit of her sport. This girl did.

    "title": "Faisal Islam: US and China step back from beyond brink",
    "article_text": "It's a ceasefire on the main front of the global trade war. Global markets are rising again, and container ships can set sail across the Pacific. The progress made in US-China talks in Switzerland was far greater than expected. The prohibitive triple-digit tariffs are now down to just moderately high levels, at least for three months. The details were a little complicated, perhaps by design to enable both sides to save face. The bottom line is this: the retaliatory tit-for-tat rise in tariff rates has been cancelled, and the so-called \"reciprocal\" tariff rate of 34% is lowered for at least 90 days to 10%. The rates applying now are 30% from the US (which includes an existing 20% component aimed at curbing the illegal trade in fentanyl), and 10% from China. The world's two biggest economies have stepped back from beyond the brink. Who blinked first? Therow-back started a month ago, as investors sold US government debt aggressively after the reciprocal tariff rates were first revealed. The ascent of the US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to lead trade negotiations was the start of the process. Trade hardliner Pete Navarro has been clearly sidelined. It was Bessent who was in Switzerland with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng at the weekend. The US pushed back strongly against the idea of countries retaliating against their tariffs. China did the most and currently has the same baseline 10% tariff as the rest of the world. So the US now has the problem. Why would any ally who did not retaliate expect to get worse than China, who did? There was also nothing agreed on the longer-term challenges to the relationship, for example Chinese exchange rate policy. So this does also affect the rest of the world profoundly. In the first instance this ceasefire is much better news than expected. It is not an end to the trade war, but it is a very significant truce. China was facing a 2008-style factory shutdown and potential significant unemployment. It should be averted now. At these tariff levels, prices will go up somewhat, but the trade will flow. Some uncertainty will remain, given the temporary nature of some of this. The toy shop owner I met last month in Arizona, who will not publish prices in her Christmas catalogues, may still have that uncertainty, but probably can now count on the container ships sailing with her products onboard. At the time the retaliatory tariffs were released, the US administration strongly suggested that the buyer countries always win trade wars. The seller or deficit countries such as China, need their buyer more than the other way round. This has not proven to be the case. The potential financial market turmoil proved to be an equal and opposite source of pressure on the US. The situation has improved, but the situation is far from over. And even the trade shock we have seen so far will have consequences. China will attempt to project to the rest of the world that it is now the more reliable economic partner. The US will have to decide how much it can contain China's rise in advanced technology, from microchips to electric vehicles to artificial intelligence. It may find it has some patching up to do with the rest of the world too. Trade wars and volatile markets have contributed to a gold rush, but investors shouldn't put all their eggs in this one basket, warn experts The president promises sweeping price cuts \"almost immediately\", but experts say these are unlikely. Shares jump as markets welcome news of a major de-escalation of the trade conflict between the two nations. The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Tariffs are a key part of the US president's political vision but economists fear a global trade war.",

    "title": "Dozens of white South Africans arrive in US under Trump refugee plan",
    "article_text": "A group of 59 white South Africans has arrived in the US, where they are to be granted refugee status. President Donald Trump has said the refugee applications for the country's Afrikaner minority had been expedited as they were victims of \"racial discrimination\". The South African government said the group were not suffering any such persecution that would merit refugee status. The Trump administration has halted all other refugee admissions, including for applicants from warzones. Human Rights Watch described the move as a cruel racial twist, saying that thousands of people - many black and Afghan refugees - had been denied refuge in the US. The group of white South Africans, who landed at Dulles airport near Washington DC on Monday, received a warm welcome from US authorities. Some held young children and waved small American flags in the arrival area adorned with red, white and blue balloons on the walls. The processing of refugees in the US often takes months, even years, but this group has been fast tracked. UNHCR - the United Nations refugee agency - confirmed to the BBC it wasn't involved in the vetting, as is usually the case. Asked directly on Monday why the Afrikaners' refugee applications had been processed faster than other groups, Trump said a \"genocide\" was taking place and that \"white farmers\" specifically were being targeted. \"Farmers are being killed, they happen to be white, but whether they're white or black makes no difference to me.\" But South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said he told Trump during a phone call the US assessment of the situation was \"not true\". \"A refugee is someone who has to leave their country out of fear of political persecution, religious persecution, or economic persecution,\" Ramaphosa said. \"And they don't fit that bill.\" In response to a question from the BBC at Dulles airport, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said: \"It is not surprising, unfortunately, that a country from which refugees come does not concede that they are refugees.\" The US has criticised domestic South African policy, accusing the government of seizing land from white farmers without any compensation. In JanuaryPresident Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed \"equitable and in the public interest\". But the government says no land has yet been seized under the act. There has been frustration in South Africa over the slow pace of land reform in the three decades since the end of the racist apartheid system. While black South Africans make up more than 90% of the population, they only hold 4% of all privately owned land, according to a 2017 report. One of Trump's closest advisers, South African-born Elon Musk, has previously said there was a \"genocide of white people\" in South Africa and accused the government of passing \"racist ownership laws\". The claims of a genocide of white peoplehave been widely discredited. In a statement to the BBC, Gregory Meeks, ranking Democratic member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Trump administration's refugee resettlement was \"not just a racist dog whistle, it's a politically motivated rewrite of history\". The Episcopal Church said it would no longer work with the federal government on refugee settlement because of the \"preferential treatment\" granted for the Afrikaners. Commenting on this news on X, Vice-President JD Vance posted, \"Crazy\". Melissa Keaney, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance project, told the BBC the White House's decision to fast-track the Afrikaners' arrival amounted to \"a lot of hypocrisy and unequal treatment\". Her organisation is suing the Trump administration after it indefinitely suspended the US Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) in January. She said that policy had left over 120,000 conditionally approved refugees in limbo. Afrikaner author Max du Preez told the BBC's Newsday radio programme that claims of persecution of white South Africans were a \"total absurdity\" and \"based on nothing\". Figures from the South African police show that in 2024, 44 murders were recorded on farms and smaller plots of agricultural land, with eight of those killed being farmers. South Africa does not report on crime statistics broken down by race but a majority of the country's farmers are white, while other people living on farms, such as workers, are mostly black. Bilateral relations between the US and South Africa have been strained since President Trump first tasked his administration with resettling Afrikaners, a group with mostly Dutch ancestry, in the US. In March,South Africa's ambassador to the US, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelledafter accusing President Trump of using \"white victimhood as a dog whistle\", leading to the US accusing Mr Rasool of \"race-baiting\". The US has also criticised South Africa for taking an \"aggressive\" position against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), where Pretoria has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government ofgenocide against Palestinians- a claim the Israelis strongly reject. President Trump's openness to accepting Afrikaner refugees comes as the US has engaged in a wider crackdown on migrants and asylum seekers from other countries.

    "title": "'Terrible grief' descends on Irish town after death of two teenagers",
    "article_text": "A community worker who comforted the mothers of two teenagers who died after getting into difficulty in water near Buncrana in County Donegal has said a \"terrible grief\" has descended on the town. Emmanuel Familola, 16, originally from Nigeria, and 18-year-old Matt Sibanda, from Zimbabwe died on Saturday. Ruth Garvey-Williams, from community centre The Exchange, had initially been with Matt's mother Bonnie as the tragedy unfolded before going to hospital with Emmanuel's mother Glory. \"Soon it became apparent there was not much hope of him surviving,\" she told BBC News NI. The tragedy unfolded on Saturday afternoon after the Irish Coast Guard received a report of a number of people in difficulty in the water. It is understood a group had been playing football on the beach at Ned's Point, just outside Buncrana, and some had gone into the water to retrieve a ball. Later that evening, the body ofMatt Sibanda was recovered from Lough Swilly. Emmanuel Familola was rescued and taken to Letterkenny University Hospital but he died in the early hours of Sunday morning. A third teenage boy managed to make it back to shore. Hundreds of peopleattended a special service held in their memory at St Mary's Oratory in Buncrana on Sundaywhile, on Monday night, up to 50 people were at a vigil in Londonderry, across the border in Northern Ireland, where flowers were thrown into the River Foyle as an act of remembrance. Mrs Garvey-Williams and her husband Andrew both volunteer at the Exchange community centre in Buncrana, which helps asylum seekers and provides English classes. They had both initially rushed to the shorefront when news of the tragedy broke, comforting Matt's mum. They left her in the company of friends to travel with Emmanuel's mother to hospital, where they waited by his bedside. \"The families were all praying for a miracle - sadly at 01:30 he passed away,\" she told BBC News NI. \"The doctors were incredible in ICU, they tried everything… it was a devastating, heartbreaking moment - to be with a mother, when her oldest son was dying there,\" she said. Both teenagers had been living with their families in separate international protection centres in Buncrana. \"These are amazing people who have fled terrible tragedies in their home countries, and have come to find safety here in Buncrana, and then to face this- it is every mothers worst nightmare,\" she said. Mrs Garvey-Williams said the wider Buncrana community had been rallying around the families, adding the wider response has been \"heartwarming.\" In Derry on Monday night, people came together in a vigil organised by United Against Racism - Davy McCauley, from the group, said the death of the teenagers had been \"absolutely heartbreaking\". Noting the historically strong links between Derry and nearby Buncrana, he added: \"We live together, we mourn together - this is the real spirit of this place.\" Becca Bor, who attended the vigil, said the deaths were \"every parents worst fear\". The boys, she said, had \"gone off to have a wonderful afternoon, a fun time with each other and they don't come home\". \"It is an absolute nightmare.\" Earlier on Monday, Joe Joyce, of the RNLI Lough Swilly lifeboat station, described the traumatic scenes as families watched helplessly amid efforts to locate the missing teenage boys. Speaking toBBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said dozens joined the search including Malin Head Coast Guard, the Irish Coast Guard helicopter and a former RNLI crew member, who was on the lough in his own personal boat. \"There was a local yacht race happening that day, and they stopped that and assisted with the search,\" he said. \"It was terribly traumatic to look at the families watching out over the lough and praying.\" The third teenage boy was helped out of the water \"with the assistance of a local man\" and was able to \"scramble\" onto the coastal pathway, Mr Joyce added. Mr Joyce said support services have been put in place following the incident. \"The schools have opened up to give counselling and we are looking after our own team, and everyone is just shocked. \"There was an eeriness that hung over the pier — it was a terrible scene.\" Mr Joyce said the area is a popular swimming spot and noted that waters can change dramatically and quickly. Fr Francis Bradley said he was present alongside the family of Matt Sibanda. He described the experience of standing beside the child's mother at the shoreline as \"unspeakably tough\". \"We simply said a prayer with Matt's mother, out over the water, simply begging God that his body would be found,\" he said. \"The power of a mother's love is amazing, as I stood there and listened to her call out Matt's name, trying her best to bring him back to life, as she once gave him life.\" Evelyn McLoughlin, principal of Scoil Mhuire in Buncrana where Emmanuel was a pupil, said there were \"no words\" that could \"fully capture the pain and sorrow that we are feeling\". Kevin Cooley, principal of Crana College, where Matt attended, said \"there is a dark cloud of sadness over Buncrana\". Councillor Fionán Bradley, who knew Emmanuel personally, said he was \"a beautiful person inside and out\". \"Since Saturday evening a real cloud of gloom and darkness, and a real sombre air has been over the whole town and whole community.\" Last week Emmanuel had taken part in the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs Global Ireland Young Leaders programme. After completing the programme Emmanuel wrote: \"I had the amazing opportunity to meet the Ambassador of Ireland and visit the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade — including the passport office! \"It was such a great experience learning about Ireland's work around the world. Grateful for the warm welcome and inspiring day.\" In a statement, the department said it was \"shocked and saddened\" to learn of his death. \"He was one of 30 Transition Year students from across the country learning about the work of the department and meeting officials engaged in different parts of its work,\" a spokesperson said. \"Emmanuel was clearly a bright, engaging, and popular young man, and his passing comes as a great shock to everyone who spent time with him.\" The 50-year-old was detained at Garda Station in County Louth. It comes following the death of Garda Kevin Flatley, 49, on Sunday whilst carrying out a speed checkpoint in County Dublin. The teenagers have been named as 18-year-old Matt Sibanda and 16-year-old Emmanuel Familola. Kevin Flatley, who was 49, had worked for An Garda Síochána for more than 26 years. Emmanuel Familola, 16, and Matt Sibanda, 18, died after getting into difficulty in the water near Buncrana in County Donegal.",

    "title": "Six Bulgarians jailed for spying for Russia",
    "article_text": "Six Bulgarianshave been sentenced to lengthy prison terms for spying for the Kremlin in the UK and across Europe. During a trial in London, the Old Bailey court heard the cell was paid handsomely for their services, which included spying on two journalists who had exposed nerve agent attacks on Russian dissidents Alexei Navalny and Sergei Skripal. The sentencing judge said the group's activities had posed a serious risk to the UK's national security. Ringleader Orlin Roussev, 47, was jailed for 10 years and eight months. His deputy, Biser Dzhambazov, 44,was sentenced to 10 years and two months. Dzhambazov's former partner,Katrin Ivanova, 33, was sentenced to nine years and eight months in prison. Three others- Tihomir Ivanchev, 39,Ivan Stoyanov, 33, and Vanya Gaberova, 30 - were jailed for between six and eight years. Roussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov all pleaded guilty to the spying charges, while the other three were convicted at a trial in March. Prosecutors had told the court they had conducted operations in the UK, Austria, Spain, Germany and Montenegro. They targeted investigative journalists Christo Grozev and Roman Dobrokhotov, as well as Russian dissidents, political figures and Ukrainian soldiers training at a military base in Germany. The case against them was describedas \"one of the largest\" foreign intelligence operations in the UKandfocused on six of their assignments. It presented, for the first timein a UK criminal court,  the inner workings of a Russian operational spy cell - exposing theirthousands of messages organising surveillance, photos and videos of their targets, and talk of plans to kidnap and kill. Evidence presented to the court this week also revealed new details about Jan Marsalek, an overseas fugitive who directed the unit for Russian intelligence services. Marsalek, an Austrian, is currently wanted in Germany for fraud allegations linked to the financial services company Wirecard. He is believed to be hiding in Moscow. The court heard the spy ring referred to themselves as the \"minions\", inspired by the yellow sidekicks of the villain Gru in the Despicable Me children's film franchise. The group also frequently referred to the Russian GRU agency - its military intelligence service - in Telegram messages. Police raided the Norfolk guesthouse housing the operation in 2023 where they found a \"treasure trove\" of gadgets, including a Minion cuddly toy containing a camera. In sentencing on Monday, Judge Nicholas Hilliard singled out Roussev as the boss but said all were \"motivated by money\". Sums of up to €1m (£840,000) were discussed by the gang, demonstrating the \"value\" of their covert activities to Russia. Mr Justice Hilliard said using the UK as a base to plan spy operations was a \"very serious offence\" which \"undermines this country's standing with allies\". \"Targeting journalists… undermines freedom of the press, one of our core democratic values,\" he added. Russia's embassy in London has not responded to the case. The Kremlin has previously always rejected allegations of spying. Conspiracy to spy carries a maximum sentence of 14 years, but Roussev, Dzhambazov and Stoyanov were afforded some credit for their guilty pleas. Roussev was ordered to pay a confiscation order of £180,768 in ill-gotten gains by August 2025. Meanwhile, Gaberova's sentenced was reduced to six years, eight months and three weeks following mitigation. Her barrister Anthony Metzer KC saidshehad been \"controlled, coerced into this conspiracy by Mr Dzhambazov,\" who was her lover while also being involved with Ivanova. The court was told Gaberova had been diagnosed with depression, panic disorder, claustrophobia and anxiety. The Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command said the case was \"a clear example\" of the increasing threat of state espionage. Commander Dominic Murphy said it \"highlights a relatively new phenomenon whereby espionage is being 'outsourced' by certain states\". Security Minister Dan Jarvis said: \"These substantial sentences should send a clear warning to anyone seeking to threaten our security, harm the UK, and compromise the safety of the public.\" All 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines flight died after it was shot down by a Russian-made missile. Polish minister Radek Sikorski tells the BBC that there is proof of Moscow's involvement, which the Kremlin denies. In an exclusive BBC interview, the Polish foreign minister accuses Russia of recruiting agents and paying them for acts of sabotage. Donald Tusk says the massive Warsaw blaze was \"for sure\" ordered by the Russian special services. Capt Ibrahim Traoré, 37, is portraying himself as a champion of pan-Africanism.",

    "title": "UK Pride groups suspend involvement of political parties",
    "article_text": "Four of the UK's largest Pride organisations have suspended political parties' involvement in their events in \"unequivocal solidarity\" with the transgender community. Birmingham, Brighton, London and Manchester Prides announced that political parties would not be welcome at their events in an official capacity until they demonstrated a \"tangible commitment to trans rights\". The announcement comes after the Supreme Court ruled that the term \"woman\" in the Equality Actwas defined by biological sex. The ruling was welcomed by some campaigners representing lesbian, gay and bisexual people who say it protects single-sex groups, while others shared concerns about the impact on the trans community. A statement from the group of Pride organisers said there was a \"disturbing global trend... where LGBTQ+ rights are being systematically rolled back\". It said: \"The UK must not follow this path of regression. Instead, it must rise as a global leader in human rights and equality.\" It said the Supreme Court ruling \"underscores the urgent need for immediate action\". \"In this moment, we choose to stand firmer, louder, and prouder in demanding change that protects and uplifts trans lives,\" it said. It said the move to suspend political party participation was a \"refusal to platform those who have not protected our rights\". The recent Supreme Court rulingclarified existing equality laws, and means that the term \"woman\" in the Equality Act refers solely to biological women. The legal dispute began in 2018, when the Scottish Parliament passed a bill designed to ensure gender balance on public sector boards. For Women Scotland complained that ministers had included transgender people as part of the quotas in that law. After the ruling they said women could \"now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women\". The ruling was also welcomed by some other gender critical groups including Scottish Lesbians, which describes itself as a grassroots campaigning organisation with around 70 members, made up of \"lesbians of all ages across Scotland.\" Directors of the group, which made submissions to the Supreme Court in the case, told the BBC: \"The Supreme Court decision, which was a clarification of existing law, protects the rights of lesbians as same-sex attracted women. \"As lesbians we're very relieved that our rights have been protected, and disappointed that Pride has once again abandoned lesbians.\" Some UK organisations - including insportandpolitics- have changed or updated their policies around single-sex teams and spaces such as toilets and changing rooms in response to the ruling. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers,issued interim guidancefor service providers which said access to such spaces must be based on biological sex. The EHRC said the impact of the ruling was that \"if somebody identifies as trans, they do not change sex for the purposes of the [Equality] Act, even if they have a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC)\". In this respect, the EHRC says, \"a trans woman is a biological man\" and \"a trans man is a biological woman\". As part of the judgement, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gave protection against discrimination to transgender people. The four Pride groups which took the decision to exclude political parties represent some of the most popular Pride groups in the UK, with a combined average attendance of over one million people. The groups have called for \"full and enforceable protections under the Equality Act\", \"timely and dignified access to NHS gender-affirming healthcare\", a reform of thegender recognition certificate processand \"sustainable funding for trans-led services and support organisations across the UK\". Birmingham Pride hadalready announced its own banon some political parties, as had Belfast and Southampton Pride events. Political parties are often involved in marches and demonstrations at Pride, often with notable politicians using the opportunity to share their parties' beliefs around LGBT+ issues. Sir Keir Starmer, Sir Ed Davey, Carla Denyer and Boris Johnson have all previously publicly attended Pride marches in a political capacity. A spokesperson for LGBT+ Lib Dems said the group was \"sickened to our core\" at the ban, and accused Pride organisers of creating a \"blanket suspension\" which was \"lumping them in\" with other political parties. They told the BBC: \"We look forward to a constructive dialogue with Pride organisers so we can come back bigger and better.\" Teachers are calling on the Scottish government to urgently publish new guidance following a landmark Supreme Court ruling. Paul Givan is expected to set out the policy for the education sector in the \"coming weeks\". The city at the crossroads of France, Germany and Switzerland gears up amid global tensions over diversity and inclusion. The move follows the UK Supreme Court's landmark ruling over the definition of a woman. Sherborne Pride returns to the town for its second year in July.",

    "title": "US-Israeli hostage reunites with family after being freed by Hamas",
    "article_text": "Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander has been reunited with his family in Israel after being held captive by Hamas in Gaza for 19 months. The 21-year-oldhad been serving in the Israeli army on the border of Gaza when he was captured by Hamas militants on 7 October 2023. On Monday, Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer. A senior Hamas official told the BBC the release was intended as a goodwill gesture and as part of efforts to reach a new ceasefire dealahead of US President Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East on Tuesday. Mr Alexander is thought to be the last US citizen held by Hamas who was still alive. PresidentTrump offered \"congratulations\" to his family on his release. Television pictures show Edan Alexander smiling as he embraces his parents and siblings at an Israeli military base. In a statement, his family thanked the US president but also urged the Israeli government and negotiators to continue working to free the 58 remaining hostages. Mr Alexander is the first hostage to be freed by Hamas since Israel restarted its military offensive on 18 March, after a two-month ceasefire came to an end. On Monday, he was seen with masked Hamas fighters as they handed him over to Red Cross workers in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. He was then transferred to Israeli authorities in Gaza before being reunited with his family in southern Israel. The Israeli military said it provided a \"safe corridor\" for Mr Alexander's release. A video shared on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's X account showed Yael Alexander speaking to her son over the phone. \"You are strong. You are protected. You are home,\" she said in the video. Netanyahu called Mr Alexander's return a \"very moving moment\" - and thanked Trump for his support. The release had been made possible because of military pressure on Hamas and \"the political pressure exerted by President Trump\", Netanyahu said. He added that Israel intended to continue with plans to intensify its military actions in Gaza and that there would be no ceasefire. Hamas had earlier said Mr Alexander's release was intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid into the enclave. Israel has blocked the entry of all food, medication and other humanitarian supplies into Gaza for 70 days, which aid agencies say amounts to a policy of starvation and could be a war crime, and renewed its aerial bombardment and other military operations there in mid-March. Hamas has previously said it will only agree to a deal that includes the end of the war. This has been repeatedly rejected by Netanyahu. Trump is due to arrive in the Middle East on Tuesday, and Israel has vowed to expand its military offensive against Hamas if no deal is reached by the end of his visit. Israeli officials have said the plans for their expanded offensive include seizing all of Gaza indefinitely, forcibly displacing Palestinians to the south, and taking over aid distribution with private companies despite opposition from the UN and its humanitarian partners, who say they will not co-operate because it appears to \"weaponise\" aid. Israel is due to send representatives to Qatar on Thursday to discuss a proposal on further hostage releases. Qatar and Egypt said that Mr Alexander's release was an encouraging sign of potential new truce talks. Born in Tel Aviv but raised in New Jersey, Mr Alexander had been serving in an elite infantry unit on the Gaza border when he was captured by Hamas militants during the 7 October 2003 attack. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages taken. Some 58 hostages remain, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive. Five of the captives held in Gaza are believed to have US citizenship. Mr Alexander is thought to be the last American still alive. Israel's military campaign has killed 52,829 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, including 2,720 Palestinians killed since March. Israeli settler Moshe Sharvit established a so-called 'outpost'  in occupied West Bank British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari, 28, who was held captive in Gaza, is visiting the UK for the first time since her release. Emily Damari, who is visiting the UK for the first time since her release, tells of how happy she is to be \"home finally\". One family said the hostages were at risk \"every day\" they continued to be held captive. UN agencies say they will not co-operate with the proposed system because it appears to \"weaponise\" aid.",

    "article_text": "Paralympic equestrian star Anne Dunham died on Sunday at the age of 76. Ms Dunham, from Wiltshire, was a world champion rider with a career spanning 23 years. Starting at the Atlanta Games in 1996, Ms Dunham won 10 Paralympic medals, six of them gold. Ms Dunham had grown up with a love of horses, working in a stables from an early age, and she was determined not to give up on the sport when she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 27. Ms Dunham's Paralympic golds included five team wins between Atlanta and Rio and an individual gold in Beijing in 2008. She won 32 major World Championship dressage medals, including 19 golds. Ms Dunham retired in 2017 at the age of 68. She said it had been a \"hard decision\", but she knew it was right and \"time to give others a chance\". She was awarded an OBE in the same year for services to Para-sport. Penny Briscoe, the Paralympics GB chef de mission, said in a statement: \"Anne was a wonderful, dedicated and devoted member of the Paralympics GB team whom I had the absolute pleasure of knowing since 2002. \"While her remarkable achievements over 20 years in Para dressage speak for themselves, what always stood out for me was her commitment to being her absolute best and encouraging the best from those around her. \"Anne really was a team player and represented the heart and soul of Paralympics GB with passion and professionalism. \"The world of Para sport will miss her greatly and my deepest sympathy goes out to her family and friends.\" Follow BBC Wiltshire onFacebook,XandInstagram.

    "title": "Can Ancelotti fix Brazil and end World Cup hoodoo?",
    "article_text": "Carlo Ancelotti has won two Champions League trophies since returning to Real Madrid in 2021 Carlo Ancelotti has agreed to take over as head coach of the Brazil national team. It isone of the most eye-catching appointmentsin international football history. For a team so deeply tied to the nation's 'beautiful game' identity, the decision to bring in a foreign coach - one of Europe's elite - signals a desperation to win and an ambition for the struggling Selecao to turn a corner. \"Ancelotti was the main choice because he has an unrivalled tradition of success, winning in five countries,\" said South American football expert Tim Vickery. So, with the 2026 World Cup around the corner, can Ancelotti fix Brazil? Brazil's footballing dominance has fallen away in the last two decades. Despite lifting two Copa America titles in that time, in 2007 and 2019, their record at the World Cup - the ultimate measure of success - has been disappointing They have not won the tournament since triumphing for the fifth time in 2002, and their recent exits have been painful signals of decline. The most dismal came in 2014, when Brazil, hosting the World Cup, werehumiliated 7-1 by Germanyin the semi-finals. Belgium got the better of Brazil in a 2018 quarter-final, while 2022 trophy hopes were dashed by defeat to Croatia on penalties in the last eight. \"Every campaign since 2002 has ended as soon as the side has come up against a European team in the knockout stages,\" said Vickery. \"It's become a hoodoo they want to overcome and another reason they've gone with a European coach this time round. They're saying 'if we want to beat them next time round, we need someone who knows them'.\" This video can not be played Ronaldo's eight goals as Brazil win 2002 World Cup Brazil's current World Cup qualifying campaign has been alarming. They should qualify comfortably enough, but a dire run, including a humiliating4-1 defeat to Argentina,has caused a scramble for answers. Managers have come and gone in recent years amid the clamour for a winning team. Tite, respected for bringing a sense of order and pride,stepped downas planned after Qatar 2022. The team's most recent coach, Dorival Junior, wassackedfollowing the Argentina collapse. This has led the Brazilian Football Confederation to deploy a bold plan, one that has been long in their thoughts: Project Ancelotti. It will officially begin on 26 May, as the 65-year-old Italian ends his stint in Madrid, whereXabi Alonso is expected to be his successor. Vickery said: \"We were hearing last year that the senior players weren't sold on Dorival Junior, but there will be none of that with Carlo Ancelotti. \"He has instant credibility in the dressing room.\" Flamengo manager Jorge Jesus celebrates winning the Copa Libertadores in 2019 In over a century of international football, Brazil's football federation has largely shied away from trusting foreign managers with its top job. Only three non-Brazilians have ever led the side, and they coached just seven games in all. Uruguayan Ramon Platero was the first in 1925 and managed four games, Joreca from Portugal managed two games in 1944, with Argentine Filpo Nunez the last foreign appointment, managing a single game in 1965. It has been a similar story in Brazil's domestic league, Serie A. The sense had always been that only a Brazilian could truly understand what it means to play football there. This culture changed soon after Portuguese coach Jorge Jesus,who was linked in recent reports,externalas another candidate for the Brazil job, took over in 2019 at Flamengo. His arrival initially came amid doubts that a pragmatic European system could bring success. Jesus went on to lead Flamengo to the league title as well as the Copa Libertadores, with the Rio de Janeiro club experiencing one of their most successful seasons ever. His team won 43 of their 57 games before Jesus left in July 2020. Since then there has been a domestic shift and acceptance of foreign coaching in the country - and this is now translating to the international stage. \"This is an important wall coming down,\" Vickery told BBC Sport. \"Especially as it now seems that Ancelotti wants to do the job from Europe which is going to be very controversial.\" Ancelotti will be the first true European titan at the helm, with a decorated trophy cabinet that includes five Champions League titles and domestic trophy success in Italy, England, France, Spain and Germany. This video can not be played 'You can't have all the success he's had without a genius of a brain' Carlo Ancelotti has won the Champions League a record five times as a head coach (AC Milan in 2003 and 2007; Real Madrid in 2014, 2022, 2024) One of Ancelotti's greatest strengths lies in his ability to steady teams without drama. His famously calm demeanour, often typified by little more than a raised eyebrow in the heat of a big moment, has helped some of the world's most powerful dressing rooms find stability. \"Ancelotti was the main choice because he has an unrivalled tradition of success,\" said Vickery. Although the 2024-25 season at Real Madrid has proved tricky, with his team losing to Barcelona in the Copa del Rey final and being knocked out in the Champions League quarter-finals by Arsenal, past achievements count for a lot with Ancelotti. He cultivated an elite culture and mindset throughout his time in the Spanish capital. For evidence of this we need look no further than Real's stunning run to the 2022 Champions League title under Ancelotti. Comeback victories from what seemed impossible positions against Chelsea and Manchester City were followed by a 1-0 victory against Liverpool in the final. That Real team benefited from the coach's tactical expertise but also performed with exceptional emotional composure. Such a collective temperament could lift a Brazil side who have often fallen short in the face of expectation and pressure. 'The prince who never became king' - Neymar returns to Santos I came from Brazil, pressure is normal for us - Joao Pedro Critics 'continue to try to cancel me' - Vinicius Jr Brazilian football has long wrestled between two systems: the flair of a samba style and the pragmatism needed to win at the highest level. Ancelotti's gift lies in having blended these identities throughout his career. His AC Milan teams of the early 2000s included such luminaries as Paolo Maldini, Andrea Pirlo and Kaka. They played a controlled, elegant brand of football that was defensively resilient yet could be breathtaking when going forward. He applied much the same approach during his second stint at Madrid, which began in June 2021. There was structure without suffocation, allowing Brazilian talents like Vinicius Jr and Rodrygo to express themselves while maintaining discipline. \"Vinicius Jr absolutely loves working with him. He will be delighted with this appointment,\" said Vickery. \"It's not just him though. You could also see a return for Manchester United midfielder Casemiro to shore up their midfield - which has been one of the main positions of concern.\" Carlo Ancelotti has worked with Brazilians including Eder Militao, Vinicius Jr, Rodrygo, Casemiro and Endrick during his time at Real Madrid Forwards Vinicius and Rodrygo have been crucial to Real and Ancelotti's most recent successes. Vinicius, in particular, has seen his club career take off. Despite dazzling on domestic duty in Spain, though, his performances for Brazil have often been underwhelming and his record shows a modest six goals from 39 caps. Critics argue,externalhe struggles with the different tactical set-ups, but Ancelotti knows how to get the best out of him â simplifying his role, boosting his confidence, and  providing freedom within a structured system. \"Ancelotti will act as a lightning rod for any criticism that side get - which will take the pressure off the players,\" said Vickery. \"There will be some in the coaching fraternity in Brazil who want him to fail, but the people who are least affected are the players.\" Make no mistake: appointing Ancelotti is a seismic move for Brazil, a statement that they are willing to change to regain their place at football's summit. If Ancelotti can bring his brand of stability to the group, while unleashing players like Vinicius Jr, and perhaps even coaxing one last magical tournament from Neymar, he may just be the man to lead Brazil back to glory. And in doing so, he may not just fix Brazil; he could redefine what Brazilian football means in the modern era.",

    "title": "'Box office Blackmore' - pioneer who transformed racing",
    "article_text": "Rachael Blackmore won the Cheltenham Gold Cup and Grand National in a glittering career \"I don't feel male or female right now. I don't even feel human.\" A memorable line from Rachael Blackmore after she became the first female jockey to win the Grand National when triumphing on Minella Times in 2021. As she retires from the saddle aged 35, Blackmore can rightly be called a game changer who was among the best of her generation. In a sport in which male and female riders compete on a level playing field, punters did not focus on whether she was a man or woman. She was just a top jockey. The self-effacing pioneer went about setting landmarks with a quiet humility as the first woman to: Win the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham, with Honeysuckle, in 2021 Become the Cheltenham Festival meeting's leading rider, in the same year Win the National a few weeks later Land the Cheltenham Gold Cup, with A Plus Tard in 2022 Trailblazing jockey Blackmore retires from racing 'Beyond belief' - Blackmore on National triumph The daughter of a dairy farmer and a school teacher, she rode ponies as a child near her home in Killenaule, County Tipperary, in the Republic of Ireland. Blackmore gained a degree in equine science with hopes of becoming a vet but combined her studies with riding out and competing as an amateur. Her first winner came aboard Stowaway Pearl for John 'Shark' Hanlon at Thurles in 2011, and she turned professional four years later. Much of her success came through an association with trainer Henry de Bromhead, while some of her early opportunities can be attributed to Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and his Gigginstown House Stud team. \"We identified Rachael early on as a very good jockey - not a female jockey - and we put her on all the Gigginstown Horses with Henry and Joseph [O'Brien],\" he said after her National victory. \"Her hard work and intelligence has done all the rest.\" Blackmore won on Allaho, Sir Gerhard, Telmesomethinggirl, Honeysuckle, Quilixios and Bob Olinger at the 2021 Cheltenham Festival Instinct, timing, tactical awareness and strength all played a part in her story. But also the ability to bounce back from falls and injury, plus sheer hard graft. When she rode six winners to be leading jockey at the 2021 Cheltenham Festival, she may not have returned to grand fanfare at a meeting held behind closed doors because of Covid-19 restrictions, but the impact was still felt. Her tally was more than the entire British training contingent. Before Blackmore, and fellow jockeys Lizzie Kelly and Bryony Frost, successes for female jockeys at Cheltenham were a rarity and largely came through amateur riders Katie Walsh and Nina Carberry. With Walsh, Carberry and Kelly now retired and Frost moving to France after finding opportunities limited since winning a bullying case against fellow jockey Robbie Dunne, it will be interesting to see if other women can rise to the fore in jump racing. Just two days ago,Hollie Doyle passed Hayley Turner's recordfor winners by a female jockey on the Flat, but Blackmore was one of only two professional women - the other being Isabel Williams - riding at this year's Cheltenham Festival. Rachael Blackmore won the Grand National in 2021 on Minella Times While Blackmore has not outlined the reasons for her retirement, Walsh and Carberry stopped at similar ages. They ended their careers with winners at Ireland's showpiece Punchestown Festival and maybe Blackmore intended to do the same, but she unusually ended the recent meeting without a victory. She suffered a bad neck injury in a fall earlier this season and only returned to action in December after three months out. Blackmore took success for women to another level, competing for a historic Irish champion jockey title before twice finishing runner-up to Paul Townend. Her achievements transcended racing. Victory in the National, watched by an estimated 500 million people worldwide, made headlines around the globe, and she was voted World Sport Star at the 2021 BBC Sports Personality awards. \"The support has been incredible. I got such a kick out of being on that list of nominees,\" she said. Those nominees included tennis star Novak Djokovic, boxing great Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez and American football quarterback Tom Brady. Blackmore, whose partner Brian Hayes is also a jockey, did not revel in the limelight - she preferred to get on with the business of riding winners - but spoke thoughtfully when interviewed. De Bromhead said she was a great support after his 13-year-old son Jack died in a riding accident in September 2022. The pair's victory with Honeysuckle in the horse's swansong in the Mares' Hurdle at Cheltenham in March 2023 sparked jubilant and emotional scenes. Spectators grabbed every vantage point to cheer the winner into the paddock. The roars were for the trainer and horse, but the rider too. Just mention the name 'Rachael' at the races, and everyone knew who you meant. With Honeysuckle in the winner's enclosure, a rainbow appeared on the horizon. \"We all wish a very special kid could be here today but he's watching down on us,\" said Blackmore. Her partnership with Honeysuckle was  a great match. Seventeen wins from 19 races, including four at the Cheltenham Festival. All with the same jockey on board. Blackmore will be remembered for a series of firsts, and potentially paving the way for others. \"Ah, look, it's brilliant, but I won't be the last. I'm delighted for myself anyway,\" she said after winning the National. \"I just hope it shows it doesn't matter, male or female. Plenty of people have gone before me and done that - Katie Walsh was third here on Seabass. All those things help girls coming along, but I don't think it's a major talking point any more.\" When Blackmore won the Gold Cup on A Plus Tard, she earned praise from the Cheltenham Festival's all-time leading rider Ruby Walsh. \"She's inspiring kids everywhere. It's incredible the interest she's driving in the sport. You need role models like that for the sport and the industry, she's box office,\" he said. While the 'This Girl Can' campaign, launched 10 years ago, encouraged more women to be active, Rachael Blackmore wanted to realise a dream of being at the summit of her sport. This girl did.

    "title": "Raducanu's Rome run ended by classy Gauff",
    "article_text": "Emma Raducanu has lost both of her matches against Coco Gauff, having also been beaten at the 2023 Australian Open Emma Raducanu's encouraging Italian Open run came to an end in the last 16 as world number three Coco Gauff proved too much of a step up in class. Raducanu, ranked 49th in the world, lost 6-1 6-2 on the Rome clay to American Gauff. For the first time in her career, the British number two had won three clay-court matches in a row to reach the fourth round in the Italian capital. But any hopes she could cause a shock against 21-year-old Gauff were soon extinguished. Like Raducanu in 2021, Gauff's sole major victory so far came on the hard courts of the US Open two years ago, but on Monday she emphasised why she is also a force on the red dirt. Gauff, who reached the French Open final three years ago, returned superbly from the start and also dug deep in service games when required. \"Emma is a tough opponent no matter what surface and always tough to play - so I'm happy with how I played,\" Gauff, a finalist on the Madrid clay last week, told Sky Sports. \"My level is getting better every match and Madrid was a step in the right direction. \"Today I think my forehand was a big weapon, set me up for a lot of short balls and a lot of good points.\" Raducanu, looking for plus points after her defeat, said: \"I just know that every day I'm trying to be the best version of myself, I'm trying to win the day, and I'm trying to get back to that. \"I didn't win on the match court today but I'm going to find a way to win the day still today. It was a tough one at the office, I just have to take a lot of positives.\" Raducanu beaten by classy Gauff in Rome - reaction Evans not ready for goodbye yet - Second Serve Clay is a surface which does not come naturally to Raducanu. Like most British players, the 22-year-old Briton had less exposure to the red dirt in her formative years and lacks experience on these courts as a professional. Raducanu's meeting against Gauff was only the 21st clay-court match of her career - compared to 81 on hard courts and 20 on the grass. Therefore, it is no surprise she is still - by her own reckoning - finding her feet on the surface. Beating Australian teenager Maya Joint, Swiss lucky loser Jil Teichmann and Russia's Veronika Kudermetova to reach the Rome last 16 represented solid progress. Facing Gauff was a different proposition - and proved to be a reminder of the gap which exists between Raducanu and the world's best. While Raducanu's movement has improved on the clay, Gauff's high-bouncing returns and weight of shot proved difficult to cope with. Raducanu did regularly manage to get herself into the points, but the American's outstanding athleticism meant it was difficult for the Briton to dictate them. Nevertheless, Raducanu will head to the French Open - which starts on 25 May - in a positive frame of mind. Since bringing Mark Petchey into her coaching team on an informal basis, Raducanu has cut a more relaxed, happier figure at tournaments and it has allowed her game to flourish. She has won eight of her 11 matches with Petchey in her corner, working alongside Raducanu's long-time ally Jane O'Donoghue. How long the partnership will last remains uncertain. Tennis commentator Petchey and O'Donoghue - who is taking a sabbatical from her job in finance - do not appear to be long-term solutions, even if Raducanu will be keen to maintain what is proving to be an encouraging dynamic. Following a tricky few seasons marred byphysical and mental difficulties,Raducanu's steady resurgence has moved her back into the world's top 50. If she had beaten Gauff, the former world number 10 would have reclaimed the British number one ranking from Katie Boulter after the Italian Open. Raducanu is currently 49th in the WTA standings, but another win would have pushed her into the top 40 - and above Boulter, who lost in the Rome first round. Boulter, who took over as the nation's leading women's player in July 2023,recently told BBC Sportthat she doesn't \"feel any pressure\". But it is not just Raducanu who is closing in. It is a three-way battle that also features Sonay Kartal, who has surged up the rankings over the past year and reached a career-high 59th, pushing Boulter and Raducanu. Also in Rome, Naomi Osaka's eight-match winning streak was ended by American Peyton Stearns. World number 42 Stearns won 6-4 3-6 7-6 (7-4) to reach the quarter-finals, overcoming a bout of on-court illness and an interruption from Italy's national air force display team roaring overhead. Italian sixth seed Jasmine Paolini beat Jelena Ostapenko 7-5 6-2, eighth seed Qinwen Zheng was a 7-5 6-1 winner against Bianca Andreescu, and world number one Aryna Sabalenka defeated Marta Kostyuk 6-1 7-6 (10-8). Russians Diana Shnaider and Mirra Andreeva also progressed to the last eight, while Ukraine's Elina Svitolina was a 6-4 6-2 victor against American Danielle Collins, who beat Iga Swiatek in the previous round.

    "title": "How bad have Amorim's United been in  the league?",
    "article_text": "Man Utd have dropped from 14th to 16th since Ruben Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in November 2024 \"Embarrassed.\" That was the word used by Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim to describe how he feels about his side's current position in the Premier League. Languishing in 16th and on their joint-worst winless run of seven games following a2-0 home defeat by West Ham, it begs the question just how much worse can things get for United? Under the Portuguese, it has been a league season to forget. After being appointed in November following the sacking of Erik ten Hag, Amorim's United will go into the history books for all the wrong sort of records. BBC Sport takes a look at the stats behind Amorim's tenure. Amorim admits he may have to leave if poor form continues Manchester United were already on a downward trajectory when Amorim took over from Ten Hag last year. The Red Devils sat 14th in the Premier League with three wins from their opening nine matches. Things were bad, but they got worse. While a new manager can often bring struggling teams a turn in fortunes or a so-called 'new manager bounce', no such thing has happened at United and instead their dour form has intensified under Amorim. They have accrued 24 points from 25 league games, dropped to 16th and their win record sits at an uncomfortably low 24%. Against the 16 non-relegated teams this season they have picked up just 23 points from a possible 87. If results against the three relegated teams were removed from the Premier League, United would sit rock bottom. Since 26 January, Amorim's side have only beaten relegated duo Ipswich and Leicester in the league. On the basis of three points for a win, they are heading for their worst tally since their 1930-31 relegation campaign, when they would have collected 29 points in a 42-game campaign. Premier League table since Amorim's first match in charge on 23 November At home their record has been particularly damaging. With nine home Premier League defeats they have suffered their joint-most losses in a single league campaign at Old Trafford, along with 1930-31, 1933-34 and 1962-63. Their 17 league defeats overall are their most in a league campaign since 1973-74 (20), when they were relegated to the second tier. They have fallen behind in 19 out of their 25 league games (W3 D3 L13) - only Southampton (21) and Leicester (23) have trailed in more matches - with United going 1-0 down 12 times at Old Trafford. Only Leicester have done so more (15). Amorim's first match in charge came on 23 November 2024 and since then their record has continued to disappoint: Amorim's win record of 24% is worse than any United manager since Sir Alex Ferguson's reign, with David Moyes' 50% the second-worst. United have won just six of their 25 league matches, drawing six and losing 13. In that time they have conceded 41 goals, with only the three relegated sides and Tottenham conceding more. United have conceded 1.6 goals per game under Amorim and kept just four clean sheets. They also have the sixth-worst record in the league in front of goal, failing to score in 10 of their 25 league games and finding the net 30 times. Of the 344 shots they have had, 107 have been on target but their 30-goal yield leaves them with a conversion rate of 8.7, worse only than Leicester City and Southampton. That makes them the second biggest underperformers relative to their xG, after Crystal Palace. Manchester United's European campaign has provided some respite from their dire league effort, with Amorim's unbeaten side facing Tottenham in the Europa League final on 21 May. If they win that they will be granted a place in next year's Champions League. But following defeat by West Ham, Amorim himself indicated concern over how they would fare in Europe's top competition, given their abject form and the increased calibre of opposition. \"I don't know what is best, if it's playing in the Champions League or not,\" he said. This video can not be played Murphy criticises Amorim 'negativity' More games feels counterproductive for Amorim at this stage and he and his players have argued their league form is suffering for an increased focus on the Europa League. In their past seven matches United have earned two points which, had the league started seven games ago, would leave them inside the drop zone with Southampton and Ipswich. And things are unlikely to get better any time soon. Even if United were to win their final two matches - against Chelsea and Aston Villa - they can finish no higher than 13th. That's five places worse off than their previous lowest finish in the Premier League - eighth in 2023-24. Their lowest-ever points tally for a Premier League campaign is 58 in 2021-22. United are now guaranteed to reduce that record by at least 13 points. A European trophy would certainly give the fans something to cheer about but ultimately Amorim has been unable to turn the tide on United's league campaign this season and whether he is the man for the job remains up for debate.

    "title": "'A winner, imposing, controversial' - who is Forest owner Marinakis?",
    "article_text": "Nottingham Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis has words for manager Nuno Espirito Santo after Saturday's 2-2 draw with Leicester As Evangelos Marinakis marched on to the City Ground pitch it was clear he is still very much the boss at Nottingham Forest. After Sunday's 2-2 draw with Leicester, and with Forest's Champions League hopes slipping away, the Greek shipping magnate held a brief, animated and extremely public discussion with head coach Nuno Espirito Santo. Marinakis' standing at the City Ground has not changed. However, he ceased to be a \"person with significant control\" of Forest byputting his stake in the club into a blind trust. Forest can still qualify for the Champions League and that has led to the dilution of Marinakis' control. Greek giants Olympiakos - another of Marinakis' clubs - have secured a spot in the competition's 2025-26 league phase, and Uefa rules state that clubs under the same ownership cannot compete in the same European competition. There will be no official ramifications or consequences for Sunday's on-field incident from the Premier League, as it is not viewed as a serious matter. Internally at Forest the matter is considered closed. Sources have told BBC that everyone is moving on and recognising the achievement of returning the club to Europe for the first time since 1996, as they are assured of at least a Conference League spot. Both Nuno and Marinakis played it down after the game as the confrontation briefly took the spotlight away from what has been a hugely successful season, following last year's brush with relegation. Sky Sports' Gary Neville branded the incident \"scandalous\", but Danny Murphy told Match of the Day 2 there was little point in dwelling on it. Yet where Marinakis goes, headlines usually follow. Marinakis at the City Ground in 2024, with Forest taking on Manchester United in the FA Cup Sami Mokbel, BBC Sport senior football correspondent When I interviewed Marinakis 12 months ago in his London offices, I met an imposing figure, yet at times softly spoken and candid. He loves the colour red, from his jewellery to the artwork on his walls. Marinakis and his family may be worth an estimated Â£3bn, according to Forbes. But he cares. And he always wants to win. At the time, he told me about the \"more than 100\" Forest matches - home and away - he had been to \"without incident\", the Â£250m-plus he had invested in the club, and hespoke passionately,externalabout a range of football topics - including refereeing standards and pundit criticism. He also confirmed his \"dream\" to move Forest to a new 50,000-seat stadium, with accompanying state-of-the-art training centre and academy - saying it would \"change the history in years to come of the region and the team for our supporters\". Some might say history is already changing, given Forest's first European qualification for 30 years. I've met him since that interview and I've seen the people he keeps around him almost physically stand to attention when he speaks. He's usually got his phone in one hand and his headphones in another hand - like he's always about to jump on a phone call to make orders. He's deeply passionate about the club, and he sets high standards. When those around him don't adhere to those standards, I think he's quick to let them know. But the more I've dealt with him, you see the more personable side. If you get under that 'death stare' persona I think he can also be a nice guy. When I last bumped into him after Forest lost the FA Cup semi-final to Manchester City, he was obviously very, very upset and he wears his heart on his sleeve. He was marching around the Wembley suite like it was the end of the world, face like thunder. Evangelos Marinakis confronted Nuno Espirito Santo following the 2-2 draw with Leicester on Sunday Marinakis is the founder and chairman of Capital Maritime & Trading Corp, an international shipping company, and was voted Greek Shipping Personality of the Year by British publication Lloyd's List in 2017. He has also invested in the media and his company, Alter Ego Media, bought two of Greece's best known daily newspapers - Ta Nea and To Vima. In 2019, he launched a new television channel, One Channel, in Greece. Earlier this year, his Alter Ego Media company, the largest media organisation in Greece, floated on the Athens stock market. As well as owning Forest, Marinakis bought Olympiakos in 2010. Under his ownership, the Greek side have won 11 domestic league titles and the Europa Conference League in 2024. Portuguese side Rio Ave also come under his portfolio. Marinakis also confirmed in December he had been in talks to purchase Brazilian side Vasco da Gama. \"We have a multi-club ownership and a lot see it as business. I don't necessarily see it this way,\" he said. \"It's very difficult to combine business with football, especially with big teams when you need to win trophies, you need to participate in Europe. \"It doesn't necessarily mean that you can make money - the opposite in a lot of cases. We don't have an unlimited budget, we are not a state company or a company that can afford each year to lose money. \"We need to find the balance between what we spend and what we can achieve.\" As he looks to extend his football empire, Marinakis has tempted Edu away from Arsenal. Edu is yet to be officially announced by Forest, but he is widely expected to become their new global director of football to oversee all Marinakis' clubs. The former Brazil internationalleft the Gunners after five yearsin November, having been sporting director since 2022 and technical director previously. He was at Wembley in April to watch Forest lose their FA Cup semi-final to Manchester City. Edu's anticipated appointment is a signal of Marinakis' intentions and desire to elevate Forest to another level, after buying them inMay 2017 from Fawaz Al Hasawi. Forest had just avoided relegation to League One on goal difference, and Marinakis stated his ambition was a return to the top flight by saying the club \"belongs to the elite of the Premier League\". They achieved Premier League status for the first time in 23 years by winning promotion under Steve Cooper in 2022. When Marinakis bought Forest eight years ago hefaced accusations of match-fixing in Greece,despite passing the EFL's owners' and directors' test. It was a charge he denied and he wascleared in 2018. The prosecution had accused him of fraud and blackmail and joining and running a criminal organisation, but these allegations were dropped. At the time, Forest chairman Nick Randall said in a letter to supporters that Marinakis had made sure structures were in place, regardless of his \"individual fortunes\". He also faced no action over allegedly beinginvolved in the bombing of a referee's bakery. The bombing happened a few days after a game between Xanthi and Olympiakos in 2012. Xanthi beat Olympiakos 1-0 and referee Petros Konstantineas claimed before the game he had received indirect threats to \"ensure\" Olympiakos won the game against Xanthi. Marinakis denied any involvement. Marinakis was also named during the investigation of one of Greece's most controversial drug trafficking cases. The 'Noor 1' case is widely regarded as one of the largest in Greek history, involving the smuggling of 2.1 tonnes of heroin into Greece in 2014. Marinakis was never charged or convicted of a crime. His alleged connections to individuals involved in the smuggling network placed him under formal judicial investigation for a time. He denied the allegations. Marinakis is being investigated in relation to civil misdemeanours. The investigation was prompted by the death of a riot police officer who was injured by a flare following an Olympiakos v Panathinaikos volleyball game in December 2023. Marinakis denies the allegations, which he says are \"totally baseless\", and has claimed it is a blackmail attempt. Evangelos Marinakis has courted controversy during his time at Nottingham Forest Sunday was also not the first time Marinakis has been under the spotlight for being on the pitch. In 2021, the Greek Super League banned him from entering the field of play for five months after he was found guilty of verbally abusing a referee. While at Forest, disciplinary issues have also followed him. In September he was found guilty of improper conduct for spitting on the floor as the match officials walked past following Forest's 1-0 Premier League defeat by Fulham at the City Ground on 28 September.He was given a five-game stadium ban. Marinakis denied the charge, but referee Josh Smith, assistant referee James Mainwaring and fourth official Tim Robinson submitted written statements saying they saw Marinakis spitting on the floor in their direction as they walked to the dressing room. Three months later, he was a central character in Forest's \"attack on the integrity of a match official on an unparalleled scale\" after a social media post made about VAR Stuart Attwell. Marinakis said he had\"no regrets\" calling out \"big mistakes\"made by the official, butForest were fined Â£750,000for the post on X last season. The club's official account called Attwell's integrity into question after Forest were not awarded penalties in their defeat at Everton last April, which left them a point above the relegation zone.",

    "title": "First group of white South Africans arrive in US after Trump grants refugee status",
    "article_text": "The first group of white South Africans granted refugee status by Donald Trump’s administration has arrived in the US, stirring controversy inSouth Africaas the US president declared the Afrikaners victims of a “genocide”. The Afrikaners, a minority descended from mainly Dutch colonists, were met at Dulles international airport outsideWashington DCby US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, and deputy secretary of homeland security, Troy Edgar, with many given US flags to wave. Reuters reported that the group numbered 59 adults and children, citing a state department official, while Associated Press said there were 49. At Dulles airport, Landau told the assembled white South Africans: “It is such an honour for us to receive you here today … it makes me so happy to see you with our flag in your hands. He invoked his family’s history, saying: “My own father was born in Europe and had to leave his country when Hitler came in … We respect what you have had to deal with these last few years.” He added: “We’re sending a clear message that the United States really rejects the egregious persecution of people on the basis of race in South Africa.” On the same day the group arrived in the US, Trump’s government also ended legal protections that had temporarily protected Afghans from deportation, citing an improved security situation in the country, which is ruled by the Taliban. One consideration for resettling Afrikaners not Afghans was that “they could be easily assimilated into our country,” Landau told reporters at the airport. Trumpsuspended the US refugee settlementprogramme in January, leavingmore than 100,000 peopleapproved for refugee resettlement stranded. Then, in February, hesigned an executive orderdirecting officials to grant refugee status to Afrikaners, whose leaders ruled during apartheid while violently repressing the Black majority. “It’s a genocide that’s taking place,” Trump told reporters at the White House, when asked why white South Africans were being prioritised for resettlement above victims of famine and war elsewhere on the continent, echoing a far-right conspiracy theory that has also been amplified by hisSouth African-born billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Trump added that the Afrikaners’ race “makes no difference to me”. He said South Africa’s leaders were travelling to meet him next week, but that he would not attend the G20 leaders’ meeting in Johannesburg in November unless the “situation is taken care of”. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said at a conference in Ivory Coast that he had told Trump by phone that he had received false information about white South Africans being discriminated against, from people who disagreed with government efforts to redress the racial inequalities that still persist three decades after white minority rule ended. “We think that the American government has got the wrong end of the stick here, but we’ll continue talking to them,” he said. White South Africans typically have 20 times the wealth of Black people, according to anarticlein the Review of Political Economy. The Black South Africanunemployment rate is 46.1%, compared with 9.2% for white people. Laura Thompson Osuri, executive director ofHomes Not Borders, a refugee care nonprofit in the Washington area, stood in the airport check-in area with a sign reading: “Refugee. Noun. A person who has been forced to leave his or her country due to persecution, war or violence. Afrikaners are not refugees.”Osuri said of Trump’s policy: “It’s for showing: ‘Look at us. We do welcome people as long as they look like us.’” Democrats also condemned the Afrikaners’ resettlement. Maryland senator Chris Van Hollentold a thinktank event: “To watch the Trump administration apply what I call their global apartheid policy … is just an outrageous insult to the whole idea of our country.” Meanwhile, the Episcopal church said it was ending its decades-long work with the US government supporting refugees, after it was asked to help resettle the white South Africans, citing its “commitment to racial justice and reconciliation”.",

    "article_text": "Koyo Kouoh, the groundbreaking Swiss-Cameroonian curator who was to become the first African woman to head up theVenice Biennale, died suddenly on Saturday, the Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa announced. “It is with profound sorrow that the trustees of Zeitz MOCAA announce the sudden passing of Koyo Kouoh, our beloved executive director and chief curator, on Saturday, 10 May 2025,” said the museum in a statement on Monday. Kouoh, 57, had beenput in chargeof the 61st edition of the Biennale Arte, which will take place in Venice from April to November 2026. Born in 1967 in Doula,Cameroon, but educated through her teens and 20s in Zurich, Kouoh had been executive director of MOCAA in Cape Town, South Africa, since 2019. It holds the continent’s largest collection of contemporary art. She was previously the founding artistic director of Raw Material Company, an art centre in Dakar, Senegal, which had a big impact on her. “It’s the place I came of age professionally, where I really became a curator and an exhibition-maker,” she recentlytold the Financial Times. “Dakar made me who I am today.” As curator of the Biennale she was due to present the exhibition’s title and theme in Venice in a week’s time, on 20 May. In a statement, the management of the Venice Biennale said they were “deeply saddened and dismayed to learn of the sudden and untimely passing of Koyo Kouoh”. They said Kouoh had “worked with passion, intellectual rigour and vision on the conception and development of the Biennale Arte 2026”. The statement added: “Her passing leaves an immense void in the world of contemporary art and in the international community of artists, curators and scholars who had the privilege of knowing and admiring her extraordinary human and intellectual commitment.” The Biennale confirmed it was “likely to hold the press conference on 20 May”, which would also be livestreamed from its headquarters.

She was regarded as a transformational leader at Zeitz MOCAA, where she built “an explicitly Pan-African, world-class programme”, according to the New York Times, which credited her with turning around an institution that had experienced several scandals. In one of her final interviews, Kouoh discussed her view on mortality. “I do believe in life after death because I come from an ancestral Black education where we believe in parallel lives and realities,” she said. “There is no ‘after death’, ‘before death’ or ‘during life’. It doesn’t matter that much. I believe in energies – living or dead – and in cosmic strength.",

    "title": "Brazil’s president seeks ‘indestructible’ links with China amid Trump trade war",
    "article_text": "The Brazilian president,Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, has heralded his desire to build “indestructible” relations withChina, as the leaders of three of Latin America’s biggest economies flew to Beijing against the backdrop ofDonald Trump’s trade war and the profound international uncertainty his presidency has generated. Lula touched down in China’s capital on Sunday for a four-day state visit, accompanied by 11 ministers, top politicians and a delegation of more than 150 business leaders. Hours later Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, arrived, making a beeline for the Great Wall of China and declaring his desire for the South American country to not “only look one way” towards the US. “We have decided to take a profound step forward between China and Latin America,” Petro said. Chile’s Gabriel Boric has also travelled to Beijing to attend Tuesday’s meeting between members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) and Chinese representatives. Addressing hundreds of Chinese and Brazilian business chiefs in the Chinese capital on Monday, Lula hit out atTrump’s tariffs, saying he could not accept the measures “that the president of the US tried to impose on planet Earth, from one day to the next”. The Brazilian leftist said he hoped to build an “indispensable” relationship with China – already Brazil’s top trading partner – and heaped praise on his Communist party hosts as his officials announced $4.6bn (£3.5bn) of Chinese investment in their country. On Tuesday, Lula is scheduled to meet China’s leader,Xi Jinping, who is expected to return the visit in July, when Xi travels to the Brics summit in Rio. “China has often been treated as though it were an enemy of global trade when actually China is behaving like an example of a country that is trying to do business with countries which, over the past 30 years, were forgotten by many other countries,” said Lula, who is expected to seek major Chinese investments in Brazilian infrastructure projects. The visit of the three South American leaders to China underlines the east Asian country’s rapidly growing footprint in a region where, over the past 25 years, it has become a voracious consumer of commodities such as soybeans, iron ore and copper. Chinese companies have also poured into the region. Electric cars made by the Chinese manufacturer BYD can be seen cruising the streets of Brazilian cities, from Brasília to Boa Vista, deep in the Amazon. The visits also come amid global jitters over Trump’s volatile presidency and Latin American anxiety and suspicion over the US president’s plans for a region where he hasthreatened to “take back” the Panama canal– by force if necessary. Matias Spektor, an international relations professor at the Getúlio Vargas Foundation, a Brazilian thinktank and university, said the presence of the three South American presidents in Beijing underscored how, in the Trump era, with the US in retreat, such leaders were increasingly reaching out to other parts of the world. “It tells us that countries around the world are willing to go out … to exploit all the opportunities that are there in the international system – and there are many. Because, as America turns away from free trade and as America adopts a policy that is … instead of transactional, predatory – countries have an incentive to engage with those who are transactional,” Spektor said, pointing to recent trips Lula made to Japan and Vietnam. “[Lula] is very proactively trying to open trade for Brazil at a time when America is undoing the previous rules of the game, and the new rules of the game are not yet born … These [Latin American] countries want to shape the norms that are likely to emerge now. And those rules are not going to emerge in Washington DC. They are going to be made globally,” Spektor added. Spektor said Latin American leaders such as Lula had long considered the world a multipolar place. “What happened on 20 January [with Trump’s return to power] is that the barrage of policy change coming from Washington DC has accelerated the belief that was already in place that the axis of global power has for a while been moving towards the east, and somewhat towards the south.”",

    "title": "Murders in Jamaica drop but activists alarmed at rise in fatal police shootings",
    "article_text": "Jamaicanofficials have hailed a sharp reduction in murders but rights campaigners warn that tackling crime should not come at the expense of accountability amid an “alarming” rise in fatal police shootings. Already burdened with the highesthomicide ratesin the region, Jamaica has recently struggled with asurge in gang-related violence. But the number of murders per capita has been falling this year, with a marked decline between January and April. “April 2025 has marked another historic milestone. For the second time this year, we have recorded the lowest number of murders in over two decades,” Dr Kevin Blake, the police commissioner, said in a statement. He added that this “progress is not accidental” but a result of “careful planning, tireless execution, and a commitment to excellence” by theJamaicaConstabulary Force, the Jamaica Defence Force and their strategic partners. According to Blake, compared with the same period last year, between January and April, there has been an 18% decline in overall major crimes, and murders are down by 37%. “These are not just statistics. Each number represents lives saved, communities stabilised, and a signal that the tide is turning,” he said. But the human rights groupJamaicans for Justice (JFJ)has raised concerns about a corresponding “significant and alarming increase” in fatal police shootings in the same period. According to Jamaica’s police complaints authority, theIndependent Commission of Investigations (Indecom), 111 people were fatally shot by security forces between January and April 2025, compared 44 in the same period last year – a 152% increase. Indecom is calling for strengthened accountability through mechanisms such as body-worn cameras amid an “elevated increase in use of force by the State”. Their concerns and recommendations are echoed by JFJ, which recently staged a protest against the “significant and alarming” increase in fatal shootings by police. Joining the calls for more body-worn cameras, JFJ’s executive director, Mickel Jackson, said: “Outside of the numbers, which in and of itself calls for greater scrutiny, we have received complaints, where citizens are giving a different account from the police’s official account.” She added that there were instances where amateur videos contradict police accounts of fatal shootings. These “conflicting accounts”, she said, were “enough to take pause and certainly to advocate for body-worn cameras”. Carla Gullotta, the executive director for the human rights groupStand Up For Jamaicastressed the importance of building relations between the police and people in “fragile and volatile areas”. Katrina Chin, whose cousin, Andrew Richards, 39, was killed by police in January, also called for greater transparency from police. Indecom isstill investigatingRichards’s shooting, but his family has maintained that he was innocent. Recalling the morning that she watched her cousin’s body being removed from his house covered by a sheet after an early morning defence forces raid, Chin said: “I understand that our country seriously has a problem with crime. We’re not denying that.” JFJ’s work, she added, is not anti-police. “We’re just advocating for it to be done the right way. We can’t just be so desperate to lower our crime rate that we’re willing to kill innocent people,” she said. She added that politicians should be careful that, in their defence of police actions, they are not “fueling” the view that the police are “untouchable”. Ahead of the JFJ protest against the increase in killings, for which they asked their supporters to wear black, a counter-protest was launched on social media, which invited people to wear blue in support of the police. Major businesses such as Jamaica’s popular pharmacy chain, Fontana, supported the “blue” campaign. Executive director Kevin O’Brien Chang said he and staff decided to wear blue because the plummeting crime rates were making people feel safer. “Every day, the police and soldiers put their lives on the line, and they pay the ultimate price,” he said. During the protest, the Jamaican prime minister, Andrew Holness, was pictured in a blue suit speaking to a police superintendent, withlocal media reportingthat he wore blue to support the counter-protest. Addressing concerns about the increasing number of killings by police, Holnessreportedly said: “Obviously, the JCF’s increased activities in interdicting criminals and in dealing with the gangs would have caused a significant increase in the loss of life of those who challenged them. But I think the country should also understand that the gang warfare is at a level where we must respond and respond decisively.” Blake, the police commissioner, defended his officers, saying: “We are a disciplined, modern law enforcement agency with a constitutional mandate to serve and protect all Jamaicans without fear, favour or ill will.” Jackson stressed that everyone, including the police, had the right to defend themselves. But, she added, “you can support the police and still be pro-accountability. You can support the police and the reduction in murder rates and their efforts, and still call for the body-worn cameras.” The police themselves would benefit from having the independent account from a camera, she said, adding she was disappointed to see the head of government appearing to choose sides, even if that was not his intention. “A call for accountability should never be seen as anti-police, and this was a moment, in my humble opinion, that I believe that the prime minister of the country should have come out and say that ‘I stand with law enforcement officers – but I support the call for increased accountability,’” she said.",

    "article_text": "The climate crisis is threatening the future of the world’s most popular fruit, as almost two-thirds of banana-growing areas in Latin America and theCaribbeanmay no longer be suitable for growing thefruitby 2080, new research has found. Rising temperatures, extreme weather and climate-related pests are pummeling banana-growing countries such asGuatemala,Costa RicaandColombia, reducing yields and devastating rural communities across the region,according to Christian Aid’s new report, Going Bananas: How Climate Change Threatens the World’s Favourite Fruit. Bananas are the world’s most consumed fruit – and the fourth most important food crop globally, after wheat, rice and maize. About 80% of bananas grown globally are for local consumption, and more than 400 million people rely on the fruit for 15% to 27% of their daily calories. An estimated 80% of banana exports which supply supermarkets around the world come from Latin America and theCaribbean– one of the most vulnerable regions to extreme weather and slow-onset climate disasters. And yet the crop is under threat from the human-made climate crisis, and threatens a vital food source and the livelihoods of communities that have contributed virtually nothing to the greenhouse gases driving global heating. “Climate change has been killing our crops. This means there is no income because we cannot sell anything. What is happening is that my plantation has been dying. So, what has been happening is death,” Aurelia Pop Xo, 53, a banana grower inGuatemala, told Christian Aid researchers. Bananas, especially the cavendish, are sensitive fruits. They require a temperature range between 15C and 35C (59F and 95F) to thrive, and just enough water – but not too much. They are sensitive to storms, which can cause a banana plant to shed leaves, making it much harder for the crop to photosynthesize. While there are hundreds of banana varieties, the cavendish accounts for the vast majority of exports since it was chosen by the fruit conglomerates for its decent flavor, hardiness and high yield. It’s this lack of genetic variation that makes bananas particularly vulnerable to the rapidly changing climate. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion The climate crisis directly harms growing conditions – and contributes to the spread of fungal diseases that are already decimating crops and livelihoods. Black leaf fungus can reduce the ability of banana plants to photosynthesize by 80% and it thrives in wet conditions, making bananas at risk from erratic rainfall and flooding. Rising temperatures and changing rain patterns are exacerbating another fungus, fusarium tropical race 4, a soil-borne microbe which is devastating entire cavendish plantations across the world. Christian Aid is calling on wealthy polluting nations most responsible for the climate crisis to urgently transition away from fossil fuels and fulfil their obligations to provide financing to help communities adapt to the changing climate. “Bananas are not just the world’s favourite fruit, they are also an essential food for millions of people. We need to wake up to the danger posed by climate change to this vital crop,” said Osai Ojigho, Christian Aid’s director of policy and campaigns. “The lives and livelihoods of people who have done nothing to cause the climate crisis are already under threat.”",

    "article_text": "Former Philippines presidentRodrigo Dutertehas been re-elected as mayor of the city of Davao, the family’s stronghold, despite being imprisoned thousands of miles away in The Hague for alleged crimes against humanity. With more than 60% of returns in, Duterte, 80, had an insurmountable lead of 405,000 votes – far ahead of his nearest competitor who trailed on 49,000, according to unofficial results from the election commission published by local media. Duterte wasarrested and flown to The Haguein March over his so-called “war on drugs”, in which thousands of people were killed, many of them young men in deprived urban areas who were shot dead in the streets. Despite international outrage over the killings, Duterte, known for his tough-talking, everyman persona, remained popular throughout his presidency. His arreststirred defiance and sympathyamong supporters in the run-up to Monday’s midterm elections, which have taken place amid a bitter power struggle between the Dutertes and their rivals, the family of president Ferdinand Marcos Jr. On Duterte’s 80th birthday in March, tens of thousands gathered in the city, lighting candles and singing. Campaigns by his supporters have been dominated by calls for him to be returned to thePhilippines. It is unclear how Duterte would take his oath to assume office as mayor. His daughter, impeached vice-president Sara Duterte, said this was being discussed by “his ICC [international criminal court] lawyers and his Filipino lawyers”. It is expected that, given the former president is imprisoned in the Netherlands, duties could instead be assumed by the vice-mayor – a race his son, Sebastian, was also on track to win. Duterte’s children and grandchildren have accused the state of having “kidnapped” him. In a video message posted after his arrest, he said he would take responsibility for his policies. The wider electoral picture for the family was mixed. Sara Duterte said late on Monday night that “the outcome was not what we had hoped for”, though her allies seeking seats in the senate appeared to have performed better than some pre-election surveys had predicted. She did not appear on the ballot papers on Monday, but the elections will prove crucial to her survival. Thevice-president was impeached in Februaryover claims that she misused funds, and in relation to a speech she gave in which she appeared to threaten the lives of the president, the first lady and speaker of the house. She is due to face trial in the 24-seat senate, where half of the members were being elected on Monday. If Sara Duterte were to be found guilty by the senate, she would be barred from office – preventing her from running for president in 2028. A two-thirds vote, of at least 16 senate members, is needed to convict an impeached official. As of midnight, five Duterte-aligned candidates were on course to secure seats in the senate, while allies of Marcos were projected to win six seats, fewer than had been predicted. A senator who has been associated with both the Marcos and Duterte campaigns has been included in each of their counts of successful candidates. Opposition candidates who are critical of both families performed better than expected. Sara Duterte said in a statement: “We will continue to hold the government accountable, advocate for the issues that matter, and work tirelessly to serve as a strong and constructive opposition.”",

    "article_text": "Donald Trumphailed a “total reset” in relations between China and the US after the countries agreed a 90-day pause to the deepening trade war that has threatened to upend the global economy, with tariffs to be lowered by 115 percentage points. “They’ve agreed to open upChina,” the US president claimed at a press conference at the White House on Monday morning, having spent months escalating tensions with Beijing by ratcheting up tariffs on the country’s exports. Aftertalks in Geneva, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said both sides had shown “great respect” in thenegotiations. “The consensus from both delegations this weekend was neither side wants a decoupling,” he said. Wall Street rose sharply after the announcement, with the benchmark S&P 500 jumping 3.2%, the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 2.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gaining 4%. The S&P 500, which endured a torrid sell-off as Trump ramped up his tariffs on China and much of the world, has now reversed all its losses since his “liberation day” announcement in April. Much of what he unveiled that day has since been shelved. “The talks in Geneva were very friendly,” said Trump. “We’re not looking to hurt China.” The US president, who has claimed for months that tariffs could raise trillions of dollars for the US federal government, appeared to change tack on Monday. “The biggest thing to me is the opening up,” he said of China. “I think it would be fantastic for our businesses if we could go in and compete.” At an event largely focused on his administration’s efforts to lower drug prices, Trump signaled he may now turn his focus to the European Union, which he claimed had been “nastier” than China. “We have all the cards,” the president claimed, using similar rhetoric to describe relations with the EU that he was using about China just weeks ago. “They treated us very unfairly.” The 90-day lowering of tariffs applies to the duties announced by Trump on 2 April, which ultimately escalated to 125% on most Chinese imports, with Beijing responding with equivalent measures. China also imposed non-tariff measures, such as restricting the export of critical minerals that are essential to US manufacturing of hi-tech goods. The US trade representative, Jamieson Greer, said China’s retaliation had been disproportionate and amounted to an effective embargo on trade between the world’s two biggest economies. With the 115 percentage point deduction, Chinese duties on US goods will be lowered to 10%, while the US tax on Chinese goods will be lowered to 30%. That is because the US tariffs include a 20% rate imposed by Trump before the latest trade war, which the president said was related to China’s role in the US’sfentanyl crisis. The fentanyl-related tariff will still apply, and Trump stressed that sector-specific US tariffs on cars, steel and aluminium will be unaffected. A spokesperson for China’s ministry of commerce said: “This move meets the expectations of producers and consumers in both countries, as well as the interests of both nations and the common interest of the world. “We hope that the US side will, based on this meeting, continue to move forward in the same direction with China, completely correct the erroneous practice of unilateral tariff hikes, and continually strengthen mutually beneficial cooperation.” China’s yuan jumped to a six-month high on the signal that the trade war would be paused. Up to 16m jobs wereat risk in China, according to some estimates, while the US faced rising inflation and empty shelves thanks to dizzying tariffs on the biggest supplier of US goods. Bessent said he was impressed by the level of Chinese engagement on the fentanyl problem during the talks in Switzerland. “For the first time the Chinese side understood the magnitude of what is happening in the US,” Bessent said. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Ajoint statementpublished by the US and China on Monday said both sides would “continue to advance related work in a spirit of mutual openness, continuous communication, cooperation and mutual respect”. William Xin, the chair of the hedge fund Spring Mountain Pu Jiang Investment Management, told Reuters: “The result far exceeds market expectations. Previously, the hope was just that the two sides can sit down to talk, and the market had been very fragile. Now, there’s more certainty. Both China stocks and the yuan will be in an upswing for a while.” Hu Xijin, the former editor of the nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, said on social media the agreement was a “great victory for China in upholding the principles of equality and mutual respect”. Hu noted on Weibo that the recently agreedUK-US trade dealmaintained the US’s 10% tariff on UK imports, “while the UK did not implement reciprocal measures”. Wang Wen, the head of the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said: “This is an unexpected achievement in Sino-US tariff negotiations.” However, Wang also urged caution, as he said the agreement “does not represent the resolution of the structural contradictions between China and the United States, nor does it mean that there will be no friction and serious differences between China and the United States in the future”. Stock markets across Europe rose in the aftermath of the US-China announcement. Germany’s Dax index jumped by nearly 1%, as Mercedes-Benz, Daimler Trucks and BMW were among the biggest risers. France’s Cac 40 index rose by 1.3%. Shares in the Danish shipping group Maersk rose 12%. Brent crude rose almost 3% at $65.75 a barrel, while the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, jumped by 1.2%. After the announcement of the US-China agreement, analysts at the Dutch bank ING lifted their forecast for China’s growth this year. ING predicted a jump in exports from China to the US, reverting to forecasting 4.7% growth in theChinese economythis year. Additional research by Lillian Yang",

    "title": "Potential role for Chinese firm in key UK windfarm attracts government scrutiny",
    "article_text": "Ministers are weighing up proposals for a Chinese company to supply wind turbines for a majoroffshore windfarmin the North Sea. The government is in discussions with Green Volt North Sea over whether Mingyang, China’s biggest offshore wind company, should supply the wind turbines. Mingyang has emerged as the preferred manufacturer, but the company has sought advice from ministers on whether to proceed. Green Volt, which is jointly owned by Flotation Energy, a Scottish company and Vårgrønn, a Norwegian one, is constructing the first commercial-scalefloating offshore windfarm in Europe. The project will deliver electricity to oil and gas platforms, replacing power currently generated by gas and diesel turbines, andprovide electricity to the UK grid. The decision over whether to source its wind turbines from Mingyang will be closely scrutinised after the governmentstepped in to take control of British Steelamid claims that its Chinese owner, Jingye Group, wanted to shut down its Scunthorpe plant to make the UK a dumping ground for Chinese steel. The incident triggered calls for Chinese companies to be locked out of involvement with critical national infrastructure. Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said at first that he would not bring another Chinese company into the British steel sector before softening his position. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary,travelled to China earlier this springto discuss closer cooperation on energy and climate. The decision over whether Mingyang can supply the turbines is not subject to any formal government process, but the company is unlikely to proceed if ministers say they have security concerns. The Sun reported three months ago that some officials in the Ministry of Defence and Department forEnergySecurity and Net Zero had raised concerns about the proposed deal. Green Volt has been waiting for a verdict from the government for weeks, according to people familiar with the discussions. An industry source said the UK did not currently have the heavy manufacturing capability to produce the turbines domestically. “They have tried to get European manufacturers to no avail,” the source said of Green Volt. “Miliband is on to something here. We all want to get to where he wants to get to, but if it’s not from Chinese companies, who is going to [supply wind turbines] to us?” The project would be an important contributor to the government’smission to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Progress towards that suffered a blow this week when the Danish company Ørstedcancelled its plansto build one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarms, the Hornsea 4 project. Ministers are hopeful that Ørsted will return to the table, however. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Mingyang has also come under scrutiny in Germany, where it is supplying wind turbines for the Waterkant offshore windfarm. The Guardian contacted Mingyang for comment. A Green Volt spokesperson said: “We are developing the largest commercial-scale, floating offshore windfarm in the world, working to hugely ambitious timelines to deliver the government’s goal of 43-50 GW of offshore wind by 2030. Having secured a contract for difference from the government last year, we are identifying supply chain partners to help us build the windfarm. As yet, no turbine supplier has been confirmed for Green Volt. We will comply with any government regulation and guidance around security of critical national infrastructure in the selection of all our suppliers.” A government spokesperson said: “We would never let anything get in the way of our national security, and while we would not comment on individual cases, investment in the energy sector is subject to the highest levels of national security scrutiny. “We are undergoing rigorous processes to look at the role of China in our supply chain and investment in critical infrastructure – taking into account the national security considerations, as well as our need for investment in the supply chain.”",

    "title": "Philippines elections 2025: polls open in midterms as Marcos and Duterte family dynasties vie for power",
    "article_text": "Millions of Filipinos began voting on Monday in a midterm election widely seen as a referendum on the explosive feud between President Ferdinand Marcos and impeached vice-president Sara Duterte. Workers in the capital, Manila, were busily setting up polling stations on Sunday for a race that will decide more than 18,000 posts, from seats in the House of Representatives to hotly contested municipal offices. It is the Senate race, however, that carries potentially major implications for 2028’s presidential election. The 12 senators elected on Monday will form half the jury in aDuterte impeachment trial– tentatively set for July – that could see her permanently barred from public office. In a speech at a rally last week, Duterte said her name, and her family’s name “have been dragged through the mud”. “Who will really benefit if the Duterte family is gone from this world? Not the Filipinos, not the victims of crime, the unemployed, the poor or even the hungry.” Duterte’s long-simmering feud with former ally Marcos exploded in February when she was impeached by the House for alleged “high crimes” including corruption and an assassination plot against the president. She has denied the allegations, adding that she had presented the assassination plot as a hypothetical scenario. Barely a month later, her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, wasarrested and flown to the international criminal court(ICC) the same day to face a charge of crimes against humanity over his deadly anti-drugs campaign. Sara Duterte will need nine votes in the 24-seat Senate to preserve any hope of a future presidential run. Heading into Monday, seven of the candidates polling in the top 12 were endorsed by Marcos while four were aligned with his vice-president. Two, including the president’s independent-minded sister Imee Marcos, were “adopted” as honorary members of the Duterte family’s PDP-Laban party on Saturday. The move to add Imee Marcos and television personality Camille Villar to the party’s slate was intended to add “more allies to protect the vice-president against impeachment”, according to the resolution. At her final rally in Manila on Thursday, Duterte invoked the spectre of “massive” electoral fraud and once again referred to her father’s transfer to the ICC as a “kidnapping”. Despite his detention at The Hague, theelder Duterte remains on the ballotin his family’s southern stronghold of Davao city, where he is seeking to retake his former job as mayor. At least one local poll is predicting he will win comfortably. National police in the archipelago nation have been on alert for more than a week, and about 163,000 officers have been deployed to secure polling stations, escort election officials and guard checkpoints. Thousands more personnel from the military, fire departments and other agencies have been mobilised to keep the peace in a country where battles over hotly contested provincial posts are known to erupt in violence. A city council hopeful, a polling officer and a village chief are among the at least 16 people police say have been killed in attacks in the run-up to Monday’s election. On Saturday, a candidate for municipal councillor was one of two men in an “armed group” killed in a shootout with police and the military in southern Mindanao island’s autonomous Muslim region, a notorious hotbed of election-related violence. Farther north, a group of men were arrested the same day at the Cebu airport while transporting 441m pesos (nearly $8m) in cash, a crime under election rules aimed at preventing the exchange of bribes for votes. Both cases were still under investigation.",

    "title": "Kim Kardashian ‘in serious terror’ when robbers entered suite, court told",
    "article_text": "A hotel receptionist who was held at gunpoint whileKim Kardashianwas robbed in Paris in 2016 has told a court that the US influencer was in a state of “serious terror” when armed men entered her suite. Abderrahmane Ouatiki, 48, who was handcuffed and forced at gunpoint to lead two armed robbers to Kardashian’s hotel room, said: “She was terrified, in a state of hysteria.” Ouatiki said that when the hooded, armed men burst into Kardashian’s bedroom, she began shouting in English that she was a mother. “She was in serious terror; it was unbearable to see a woman in that type of distress,” he told thePariscourt. A group of pensioners nicknamed the“grandpa robbers”by French media are on trial in Paris charged with stealing jewels worth millions of euros from the American reality TV star when she was in the French capital for fashion week in 2016. In perhaps the biggest robbery of an individual in France in 20 years, Kardashian wastied up and held hostageat gunpoint in her bedroom by men dressed as police officers in the early hours of 3 October 2016. They escaped with up to an estimated €10m (£8.4m) in jewellery, including a 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to Kardashian by her then husband, the rapper Kanye West, estimated to be worth $4m (£3.4m). Ouatiki, who is Algerian, said he was working as a night receptionist to fund himself as he completed a Sorbonne University PhD thesis on the semiotics of extremist discourse. He was alone that night at the reception desk of an exclusive apartment building in central Paris, known as a “no address” site, where celebrities visiting Paris often rented sumptuous suites. Ouatiki said that after 2am he saw three masked men “with police jackets on” approach the glass door to reception and gesture to him to open up. Thinking they were police officers, he opened the door. “They pushed me to my knees and said: ‘We’re here for the money’,” he told the court. He said they handcuffed him, showed him an automatic pistol and held another gun to his neck as they asked him: “Where is the rapper’s wife?” He knew that meant Kardashian. The robbers held a gun to Ouatiki and took him in the lift with them to Kardashian’s apartment, he told the court. As they approached her bedroom, Ouatiki said Kardashian called out “Hello? Hello?” thinking it might be her sister Kourtney Kardashian returning from a nightclub. He said the robbers burst into the room and roughly pushed Kardashian. Ouatiki said she was shouting and hysterical. Fearing the lead robber was “very nervous, unstable, aggressive”, Ouatiki said he felt he had to “calm things down and contain it” so he shouted at Kardashian to “shut up!”. He said she was shocked but it had an effect. He said the robbers spoke no English but were asking in French for money. Ouatiki, still with a gun to him, tried to translate. Kardashian said she had “a thousand” – either in dollars or euros. He said she gave the robbers the ring that was on a bedside table. She then nodded towards a Louis Vuitton jewellery box, the robbers allegedly opened it and poured its contents into two bags. Kardashian was roughly pushed on to the bed by the lead robber who tied her hands and feet and put black tape over her mouth, Ouatiki said. Asked by the judge if the robbers would have seen Kardashian’s nudity under her towelling hotel robe, Ouatiki said: “Yes, when they pushed her on to the bed.” He said the robber then dragged Kardashian to a bathroom and left her there, tied up. The lead judge asked Ouatiki if he thought Kardashian feared she would die. He said: “Yes.” He said he also feared he would die. Ten suspects, whose ages range from 35 to 78, are on trial until 23 May. Some are accused of aiding in the organisation of the robbery. Eight of the accused deny any involvement. Kardashian, 44, will testify on Tuesday.",

    "title": "Edi Rama on course to win fourth term as PM in Albania elections",
    "article_text": "Albania’s prime minister, Edi Rama, is poised for victory in general elections after preliminary results showed voters returning him to power for an unprecedented fourth term. With 30% of the ballots counted, Rama’s party was leading the leftwing Socialists to a resounding win over Sali Berisha’s centre-right Democratic party in a poll viewed as pivotal for the Balkan country’s attempt to join the EU. The incumbent party had garnered 53% of the vote compared with 34% for its main opposition rival. Preliminary turnout in Sunday’s election was almost 42.16%, or 4% lower than four years ago. “It’s a result exceeding all expectations even before the ballots have been fully counted,” said a well-placed source in Tirana. “A fourth consecutive win is phenomenal. Edi has cause to be very happy.” In office since 2013, Rama had campaigned on his ability to fast-track reforms deemed vital for the ex-communist state to accede to the EU. The 60-year-old has promised to deliver membership within five years after formally opening accession negotiations last October. The goal, seen by many as highly ambitious, has been aided by the desire of some European leaders to see Albania and other western Balkan states join the bloc following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The country’s first president after the fall of communism more than three decades ago, Berisha, 80, argued Albania was far from ready for EU admission. Once the personal physician of the late Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha, the cardiologist had run a US-style campaign overseen by consultants brought in from Washington DC, including Chris LaCivita, the Republican strategist credited with helping secure Donald Trump’s victory in November. Berisha had made his campaign motto “Make Albania Great Again”. The Democratic party had joined forces with 20 other political groups in the hope of removing Rama from office. But by early on Monday, as ballots were counted by hand, it was clear the Socialists were in the ascendancy. Analysts said the Socialist party appeared to have won backing from overseas voters after Albania’s large expatriate community was allowed to cast ballots by post for the first time. More than 192,000 votes were received from the nearly 246,000 Albanians who had registered to vote abroad before Sunday’s election in the 2.7 million-strong nation. An overwhelming 83% of Albanians support EU membership, the highest endorsement of any population in the western Balkans, according to a Eurobarometer survey released in November. Rama, who served as mayor of Tirana before going into mainstream politics – livening up the capital’s drab cityscape by having its communist-era buildings painted in an array of colours – has made the country’s EU accession a priority. Supporters attending his weekly rallies turned the quest into a hallmark by donning white T-shirts emblazoned with a large multicoloured “5” – indicating the years left until 2030. The promise of EU membership was a big draw for diaspora voters, said Albania’s ambassador to Greece, Luela Hajdaraga. “Albanians living abroad were very eager to participate in this historic process and have their voices heard,” she told the Guardian. “In Greece, especially, where the issue of gaining citizenship has been so difficult, the prospect of Albania joining the EU is seen very positively.” Rama has said that Albania, for decades the continent’s most isolated state, is “at the gates of Europe”. The country has opened 16 of the 35 negotiating chapters for membership of the bloc. But in a land blighted by corruption and organised crime, he also faces challenges, not least mass emigration as young Albanians seek better lives abroad.",

    "title": "Kurdish militants PKK to disarm after decades of attacks against Turkey",
    "article_text": "A Kurdish militant group whose attacks and insurgency againstTurkeyhave spanned more than four decades has declared it will disarm and disband, after a call from its jailed leader earlier this year. The Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) announced the decision to dissolve its guerrilla forces, heeding a watershedannouncement from Abdullah Öcalanthree months ago. Leaders of the militia group, which is regarded as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the UK and the US, said their armed insurgency had “brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics, and in this regard the PKK has completed its historical mission.” The announcement that the militia will end decades of fighting will affect forces based near Turkey’s borders with Iraq and Iran, as well as allied or splinter groups in north-east Syria. Despite the PKK announcement of a “new phase”, the decision to disarm and dissolve appeared to be unilateral, with few public indications about authorities in Ankara offering dialogue. The decision follows months of outreach to Kurdish political leaders in Turkey by the nationalist politician Devlet Bahçeli, a coalition partner of the president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP). Local reports suggest Bahçeli has sought pathways to extend Erdoğan’s rule beyond two presidential terms through bolstering support from the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Equality and Democracy (DEM) party. Erdoğan welcomed the PKK’s decision, saying: “With terror and violence being completely disengaged, the doors of a new era in every area, namely strengthening politics and democratic capacity, will be opened.” He added: “The winners will be our people and country, and actually all our siblings in our region.” The PKK leadership called their decision to halt armed struggle “a solid foundation for lasting peace and a democratic solution” and reiterated calls for Öcalan to be freed in order to oversee the group’s dissolution. The Kurdish leader has been held on an island prison off the coast of Istanbul since he was captured by Turkish forces in Kenya in 1999. Founded in 1978, the PKK led an armed insurgency primarily targeting Turkish military infrastructure, seeking greater recognition and independence for Kurdish communities in Turkey’s south-east. Amnesty Internationalaccusedthe group of harming rural Kurdish communities due to its activities in the 1990s. Tens of thousands of people are estimated to have been killed in the fighting with Turkish forces since the PKK officially began an armed insurgency in 1984,accordingto the International Crisis Group. The ICG found that in the year that followed the breakdown of the last ceasefire between the PKK and Turkey in 2015, more than 1,700 were killed including civilians, Kurdish fighters and members of the Turkish armed forces. The PKK’s decision to disband has further isolated allied Kurdish fighting forces in north-east Syria. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) remain under increasing pressure to integrate into Syria’s new military after the collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad last year and thewithdrawal of hundreds of supporting American troopsfrom areas in the north-east under their control. The SDF commander-in-chief, Mazloum Abdi,signed a dealwith the new authorities in Damascus in March to merge SDF-led institutions into those of the fledgling Syrian state. Abdi previously dismissed any suggestion that the PKK’s dissolution would affect his forces,saying: “To be clear, this only concerns the PKK and is nothing related to us here in Syria.”",

    "title": "Six Bulgarians jailed after spying for Russia in UK",
    "article_text": "Six Bulgarians convicted of spying for Russia in Britain have been jailed at the Old Bailey. Orlin Roussev, 47, who was the leader ofthe ringand had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to 10 years and eight months for his role in executing six “sophisticated” operations that risked national security and the safety of the public. His second-in-command, Biser Dzhambazov, 44, was jailed for 10 years and two months at the Old Bailey after also pleading guilty. Katrin Ivanova, 33, one of two women who were deployed as “honeytraps” against the group’s targets, was jailed for 9 years and eight months.Mr Justice Hilliard said he accepted she would not have become involved in the crimes without meetingDzhambazov, but he told her she had “thrown in” her lot with him “by free choice for better or worse.” The other woman,Vanya Gaberova, 30, was given a sentence of six years, eight months and three weeks. While the judge made an allowance for a claustrophobia diagnosis, he told her that she knew what she was doing was for Russia and had found it “exciting and glamorous.” Tihomir Ivanchev, 39, one of two lieutenants, was given a sentence of eight years by the judge, who noted reports of good behaviour and the fact his involvement in the ring stopped before their arrest in 2023. The other, Ivan Stoyanov, 33, was given five years and three weeks’ imprisonment after pleading guilty, albeit at what the judge noted was a late stage. Mr Justice Hilliard told each defendant that they would need to serve half their sentence before being eligible for parole and then would be liable for automatic deportation to Bulgaria. Earlier, he detailed six identified spy plots carried out by the defendants, some of whom he said were more culpable. Directed by Roussev’s second-in-command, Dzhambazov, he said the defendants were “motivated by money”, with “substantial” sums of up to €1m (£842,000) discussed. This, he said,demonstrated the “value” of their covert activities to Russia. “Some of the money would have covered their expenses, but not all. This enabled the defendants to live very comfortably. It must have been thought that what the defendants were doing was of value. The spy ring wasengaged in surveillance and intelligence operations between 2020 and 2023, targeting journalists and Russian dissidents. Working out of a guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, it was directed from abroad by Jan Marsalek, an Austrian businessman who had fled to Russia in 2020 after the payments company he helped to run, Wirecard, collapsed amid a €1.9bn (£1.6bn) fraud. Marsalek, who is believed to be in Moscow but is wanted in Germany over the Wirecard scandal, was working for the Russian FSB state security service and the GRU military intelligence agency. He directed surveillance in Bulgaria, Austria and Spain of Christo Grozev, an investigative journalist who had helped implicate Russian spies in the poisoning of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Sign up toHeadlines Europe A digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week day after newsletter promotion Marsalek also instructed gang members, including Ivanova, to steal mobile phone numbers of Ukrainian troops believed to be training at a US barracks in Stuttgart, Germany, using a military-grade spying device. In a televised sentencing, Mr Justice Hilliard commended officers for their “extremely thorough and determined investigative work.” Victims targeted by the spyring had been left “deeply concerned” and been forced to enhance their security, the judge said. He said the risk to them was obvious and Roussev would have been aware of the “extreme actions” Russia had taken against those it regarded as an “enemy” of the state. Commander Dominic Murphy, head of the Met’s Counter Terrorism Command,said after sentencing that the strength of the investigation into the group’s surveillance operations had left the ringleaders – Roussev and Dzhambazov - with no option but to plead guilty to the charges. “This case is a clear example of the increasing amount of state threat casework we are dealing with in the UK. It also highlights a relatively new phenomenon whereby espionage is being ‘outsourced’ by certain states. Frank Ferguson, Head of the CPS Special Crime and Counter Terrorism Division, said that,by targeting individuals in the UK fleeing persecution as well as journalists opposing the Russian regime,the the group had undermined the message that the UK is a safe country for those people. “This prolonged activity also undermined the security and safety of the UK; and there can be no doubt that each of the defendants knew exactly who they were spying for,” he added.",

In the clip, Yael Alexander is heard telling her son: You are strong. You are safe. You are home. We’ll see each other soon. I love you, Edan Alexander’s mom takes the phone from White House envoy@SteveWitkoffand speaks to her son after he was released. Watch here:pic.twitter.com/VhGKCRJZ9y It’s 11.15pm in Tel Aviv andGaza. Here’s a recap of the latest developments: Gaza is at “critical risk of famine”, food security experts have warned, 10 weeks afterIsraelimposed a blockadeon the devastated Palestinian territory, cutting off all supplies including food, medicine, shelter and fuel. Aid workers say prices for essentials had risen further in recent days, warehouses were empty and humanitarian teams treating malnourished children were being forced to divide rations. Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander has returned to Israel after being released by Hamas.Alexander, a dual national serving in the Israel Defense Forces, spent 584 days in captivity and was the last living US citizen held in Gaza. Hamas said they had freed Alexander “following contacts with the US administration, to achieve a ceasefire, open crossings, and bring aid and relief to our people in Gaza”. Edan Alexander’s release was welcomed in Israel and beyond.US presidentDonald Trumpdescribed it as a “good faith step” towards ending the war and bringing home all remaining hostages. Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, thanked Trump for his role in Edan’s release but also claimed credit was due to Israeli forces and his own government’s military strategy. Relatives of hostages called for the Israeli government to push for a breakthrough to bring back 58 others still in Gaza. Alexander’s release comes on the eve of Trump’s first trip to the region since his re-election,with Israel conspicuously missing from his itinerary, and after a series of blunt public snubs to the country’s leadership. Trump’s ambassador to Israel,Mike Huckabee,denied on Monday that the relationship with Israel’s most important ally was strained. The Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) has declared it will disarm and disbandafter a call from its jailed leader,Abdullah Öcalan,earlier this year. The announcement by the Kurdish militant group, whose attacks and insurgency against Turkey have spanned more than four decades, will end decades of fighting will affect forces based near Turkey’s borders with Iraq and Iran, as well as allied or splinter groups in north-east Syria. Al Jazeera can resume working in thePalestinian territories,the network’s Ramallah bureau chief said, after Palestinian presidentMahmoud Abbaslifted a ban imposed earlier this year. Al Jazeera remains banned from broadcasting from Israel. Israel has asked judges at the international criminal court (ICC) to withdraw arrest warrants against its prime minister and former defence ministerwhile the ICC reviews Israeli challenges to its jurisdiction over the conduct of the Gaza war. Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, told a meeting of woundedIsraelDefense Forces (IDF) soldiers that things “that you have never seen before” will “happen in Gaza” in the coming days. In the meeting, reported by the Times of Israel, Netanyahu said: Within days, things are going to happen in Gaza. Things will happen that you have never seen before until now. The Israeli leader is also reported to have told soldiers that while he is “giving a chance” for the return of the hostages, if these efforts do not succeed, the fighting will be intense and “to the end”.

A statement fromStéphane Dujarricreads: The Secretary-General renews his urgent call for an immediate permanent ceasefire, and the immediate and unconditional release of all remaining hostages.

He calls on all parties to immediately ensure the rapid, unhindered, and safe humanitarian relief, including the delivery of critical services, for all civilians in need. Aid is not negotiable. Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff didn’t mince his words. In a meeting late on Sunday with former hostages and relatives of those still held in Gaza, he told themIsraelis drawing out a war the US wants to end, local media reported. On the eve of the release ofEdan Alexander,the last living American being held by Hamas, Witkoff spelt out the gulf between his boss and the government ofBenjamin Netanyahu.According to Channel 12 Television, quoting sources who were present, Witkoff told the meeting: We want to bring the hostages home, but Israel is not willing to end the war. Israel is prolonging it – despite the fact that we don’t see where else we can go and that an agreement must be reached. It was the latest in a series of high-profile and high-stakes snubs from the White House which suggest that Israel’s most important ally is frustrated with its government – and possibly losing interest in its fortunes. “Trump’s not against Israel, but he doesn’t care about Israel,” said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat. As far as Trump is concerned, Netanyahu has become an irritant and an irritant that doesn’t contribute to the bank account.

A statement by the kibbutz reads: It is hard to ignore the difficult message that the citizens of the State of Israel are receiving today, and which is being conveyed to the entire world: Our lives are worth less. A hostage with an American passport is given priority, while the other 58 hostages are left behind — including 14 members of the Nir Oz community. “Every hostage who returns is a great light in the darkness we are in,” the statement continues. Al Jazeeracan resume working in thePalestinian territories, the network’s Ramallah bureau chief said, after Palestinian presidentMahmoud Abbaslifted a ban imposed earlier this year. Waleed Omari,the bureau chief of Al Jazeera in Jerusalem and Ramallah, said in a statement on Monday: Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has decided to lift the ban on the Al Jazeera network and allow its crews to resume work in the Palestinian territories starting tomorrow morning. The decision comes after Al Jazeera’s operations were halted in the Palestinian territories in January, after the Palestinian Authority (PA) accused the network of “inciting material”. At the time of the channel’s suspension, PA security forces had been engaged in weeks of deadly clashes with militant fighters in theJenincamp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Al Jazeera remains banned from broadcasting from Israel.

Watch here:pic.twitter.com/VhGKCRJZ9y The Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) has announced it will disarm and disband, after a call from its jailed leader Abdullah Öcalan earlier this year. Leaders of the militia group, which is regarded as a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the UK and the US, said their armed insurgency had “brought the Kurdish issue to the point of resolution through democratic politics, and in this regard the PKK has completed its historical mission.” The announcement that the militia will end decades of fighting will affect forces based nearTurkey’s borders withIraqandIran,as well as allied or splinter groups in north-eastSyria. Despite the PKK announcement of a “new phase”, the decision to disarm and dissolve appeared to be unilateral, with few public indications about authorities in Ankara offering dialogue. The decision follows months of outreach to Kurdish political leaders in Turkey by the nationalist politicianDevlet Bahçeli,a coalition partner of the presidentRecep Tayyip Erdoğan’s Justice and Development party (AKP). Erdoğan welcomed the PKK’s decision, saying: With terror and violence being completely disengaged, the doors of a new era in every area, namely strengthening politics and democratic capacity, will be opened. Israel’s president Isaac Herzog said he watched “with great emotion” the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander “from darkness to light”. “Welcome home, Edan. We waited for you so long,” Herzog wrote in a post on X. He said he watched Alexander’s release with Germany’s chancellor,Friedrich Merz.Herzog added: I send a huge hug to your heroic parents, incredible grandmother, and your entire family. Merz welcomed Herzog for a meeting in Berlin earlier today, and noted that the Israeli president is the first foreign leader he has hosted since taking office last week. Herzog is scheduled to be hosted by German presidentFrank-Walter Steinmeierfor a state dinner this evening, then return to Israel tomorrow morning. Gaza is at “critical risk of famine”, food security experts have warned, 10 weeks afterIsraelimposed a blockade on the devastated Palestinian territory, cutting off all supplies including food, medicine, shelter and fuel. In its most recent report, theIntegrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC)said on Monday there had been a “major deterioration” in the food security situation inGazasince its last assessment in October 2024 and that Palestinians living there faced “a critical risk of famine”. The IPC, a consortium of independent specialists tasked by the UN and international NGOs with assessing the risk of famine in crises worldwide, said: Goods indispensable for people’s survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks. The entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million people – one in five – facing starvation. Aid workers in Gaza told the Guardian that prices for essentials had risen further in recent days, warehouses were empty and humanitarian teams treating malnourished children were being forced to divide rations designed for one between two patients to give both a chance of survival. Jonathan Crickx, a spokesperson forUnicefspeaking from southern Gaza, said: The stocks we brought in during the [two-month-long] ceasefire are running very low. We have treated more than 11,000 children since the beginning of the year … In coming weeks, we fear we will see more children dying. TheHostages and Missing Families Forumsaid it welcomes the release ofEdan Alexanderafter 584 days of captivity. A statement from the group reads: We embrace you, Edan, and are so glad you are home. We hope your return is the beginning of a comprehensive agreement that is needed to bring all 58 hostages home. Benjamin Netanyahuhas credited the release of US-Israeli hostageEdan Alexanderto Israeli military pressure and “political pressure” from the US president,Donald Trump. Netanyahu, in a video statement published by his office, said: This is a very emotional moment – Edan Alexander has come home. We embrace him, and we embrace his family. This was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the political pressure exerted by President Trump. This is a winning combination. The Israeli prime minister added that he had spoken with Trump, who reaffirmed his commitment to Israel and promised to work “in close cooperation” to release the remaining hostages and defeat Hamas. Edan Alexander, the Israeli-American hostage who was released earlier today, has arrived at anIsraelDefense Forces (IDF) facility near the border community of Re’im in southern Israel. An IDF statement says Alexander will undergo an initial physical and mental checkup and be reunited with his family after he was escorted out ofGazaby Israeli troops. His father, Adi Alexander, was taken by an Israeli air force helicopter to Re’im shortly after arriving in the country from the US, the Times of Israel reports, citing an Israeli defence official. His mother arrived at the Re’im base earlier today. Gaza is at “critical risk of famine”, food security experts have warned, 10 weeks afterIsraelimposed a blockade on the devastated Palestinian territory, cutting off all supplies including food, medicine, shelter and fuel. In its most recent report, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) said on Monday there had been a “major deterioration” in the food security situation inGazasince its last assessment in October 2024 and that Palestinians living there faced “a critical risk of famine”. “Goods indispensable for people’s survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks. The entire population is facing high levels of acute food insecurity, with half a million people – one in five – facing starvation,” said the IPC, a consortium of independent specialists tasked by the UN and international NGOs with assessing the risk of famine in crises worldwide. Israel imposed its strict blockade in early March, after the end of the first phase of a supposed three-phase ceasefire. Just over two weeks later, a new wave of attacks by the Israeli military definitively ended the truce. US president Donald Trump has said he is considering lifting sanctions on Syria, following the UK’s lead, which removed some of its own sanctions in late April. Speaking at a press conference at the White House, Trump said he was mulling the move after Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, raised the issue. Trump said: “We may take them off of Syria, because we want to give them a fresh start.” He added: “President Erdogan’s asked me about that, many people have asked me about that because the way we have them sanctioned doesn’t really them much of a start. We want to see if we can help them out.” Syria’s interim president, Ahmed al-Sharaa, visited Paris last week, where he met with French President Emmanuel Macron, who similarly voiced his support for lifting EU-wide sanctions on the new government. After their meeting, Macron said that if al-Sharaa “continues on his path” and guarantees were provided that international funds would be used appropriately, France would push for the lifting of European sanctions and lobby Trump to do the same. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has confirmed that it “facilitated the safe transfer of a hostage from Gaza to Israeli authorities”. Reuters reported that the Israeli military also confirmed receiving the US-Israeli citizen hostage Edan Alexander. Donald Trump defended his decision to accept the gift of a plane from Qatar at a press conference on Monday. “They’re giving us a free jet,” said the US president, “I could say no, no, no, don’t give us, I wanna pay you $1bn or $400m or whatever it is, or I could say thank you very much.”",

    "title": "Hamas frees last living US citizen held in Gaza in what Trump calls a ‘good faith step’",
    "article_text": "Hamas has freed the last living US citizen it held in Gaza, soldier Edan Alexander, in a unilateral move Donald Trump described as a “good faith step” towards ending the war and bringing home all remaining hostages. The release of 20-year-old Alexander, a dual national serving in the Israel Defense Forces who spent 584 days in captivity after he was seized from his base on 7 October 2023, wasagreed with little Israeli involvement beyond practical coordination on the ground. There was no ceasefire in Gaza for his return, although Israel paused fighting from midday for the handover, which came as UN-backed experts warned thathalf a million Palestinians face starvation in Gaza due to Israel’s weeks-long siege. He was dressed in civilian clothes when masked fighters handed him to a Red Cross official. He was driven to the border withIsrael, where family who had flown over from the United States were waiting to meet him after initial check-ups. He told Israeli soldiers after his release that he had been held handcuffed with other hostages, in a cage inside a tunnel, Israel’s Kan television reported. Hamas said in a statement they had freed Alexander “following contacts with the US administration, to achieve a ceasefire, open crossings, and bring aid and relief to our people in Gaza”. “We urge President Trump’s administration to continue its efforts to end this brutal war,” the statement added. Trump celebrated the release with a post on Truth Social on Monday afternoon. “Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage, is being released. Congratulations to his wonderful parents, family, and friends!” In a previous post he described the release as “a step taken in good faith towards the United States and the efforts of the mediators – Qatar and Egypt – to put an end to this very brutal war and return ALL living hostages and remains to their loved ones”. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, thanked Trump for his role in Edan’s release but also claimed credit was due to Israeli forces and his own government’s military strategy. “This was achieved thanks to our military pressure and the diplomatic pressure applied by President Trump. This is a winning combination,” he said in a statement. The Israeli leader has insisted throughout the war that military pressure is the best way to ensure that the hostages return home, even as Trump stepped up calls for a deal to end the conflict. Alexander’s release comes on the eve ofTrump’s first trip to the region since his re-election, with Israel conspicuously missing from his itinerary,and after a series of blunt public snubs to the country’s leadership. Trump’s ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, denied on Monday that the relationship with Israel’s most important ally was strained. “Forget rumours. We’re all on the same page,” he said, after a meeting with Netanyahu and Steve Witkoff, Trump’s regional envoy which he described as “excellent”. Qatar and Egypt, who mediated Alexander’s release, described it as an encouraging step towards new truce talks. After the soldier returned to Israel, Netanyahu also said he had ordered negotiators to Doha to discuss a possible deal for Gaza, ahead of a planned new Israeli offensive there. For now, Israel’s leader appears trapped between Trump’s desire for a deal and pressure from his coalition partners to continue the war. His government relies on the backing of far-right parties who want Israel to keep fighting, including finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who earlier this month vowed that “Gaza will be entirely destroyed” and its Palestinian population will “leave in great numbers”. However Trump, who previously delighted Netanyahu’s far right allies by backing plans to force Palestinians to leave Gaza, has not publicly criticised Netanyahu. The Israeli leader may be hoping that strong support for Israel from the Republican base and other pressing demand’s on Trump’s attention, from the war in Ukraine to tariff talks with China, will divert the US leader’s attention away from Gaza even if fighting continues. Crowds gathered in Tel Aviv’s Hostages Square to watch footage of Alexander’s release and call for the return of other hostages. Trump said after Alexander’s release that only 20 of those were still alive, a number the Israeli government has not confirmed. Relatives and supporters called for the government to push for a breakthrough to bring back 58 others still in Gaza. Others were blunter. Einav Zangauker, the mother of hostage Matan Zangauker who for a time was held with Alexander, said the prime minister was an “angel of death” and called for mass protests to force him from office. “Instead of ending the war and bringing everyone back, Netanyahu is preparing to expand the war this week. To execute the kidnapped who remain in captivity and to make the dead disappear,” she said. “Instead of saving lives and bringing everyone back, he chose to turn our loved ones into corpses.”",

    "title": "British man being held in Saudi Arabia jailed for 10 years, say lawyers",
    "article_text": "A British national arrested inSaudi Arabiaon charges that appear to relate to a deleted tweet has been jailed for 10 years, according to British lawyers and campaign groups representing the family. Ahmed al-Doushwas arrested in Augustand, while it is understood that UK Foreign Office officials were allowed into the Saudi court for his hearing, the British government has been criticised for a lack of action since his arrest. Jeed Basyouni, who leads the human rights group Reprieve’s work to stop the use of the death penalty, said: “This is what can happen when the UK government fails to stand up for the rights of its citizens arbitrarily detained overseas. “A British man was abducted in front of his family and disappeared into a Saudi jail on charges unknown, and for eight months the Foreign Office failed to do what was needed and seek his release. “When a British national is convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison and neither his family nor his lawyer nor the Foreign Office know of what crime he has been accused something has gone very badly wrong.” She added: “It would be farcical if it was not a tragedy for this family who have been badly let down by the government.” A government special envoy for British nationals arbitrarily detained overseas has yet to be appointed. Doush’s wife, Amaher Nour, based in Manchester, has four children including one born while her husband was detained in Saudi Arabia. She was given brief news of his lengthy sentence by the lawyer appointed to him by the Saudi government. Foreign Office officials at the hearing were able to pass news of the sentence to Doush’s British lawyers, it is understood. Haydee Dijkstal, a barrister at 33 Bedford Row chambers and the international counsel for Doush, said: “Online expression, even if expressing concern or criticism of a government, should not be criminalised or lead to detention and imprisonment. Using anti-terrorism legislation to punish and repress online expression on social media with severe prison sentences is inconsistent with international law and human rights standards.” Speaking before the sentence, Nour said: “I rarely speak to my husband but in the few snatched conversations we have managed it is clear that Ahmed is struggling. “He has thyroid problems and is tormented by mental distress. He worries about his family particularly as he was the sole breadwinner. He missed the birth of our fourth child and our 10-year wedding anniversary. “Because Ahmed is a British citizen we expected the UK to provide clarity amid a storm of uncertainty. But the Foreign Office refused to share information with me for months – citing data protection – while at the same time accepting assurances from Saudi Arabia at face value.” The Foreign Office has also said the Middle East minister, Hamish Falconer, had raised the case multiple times with Saudi officials but Nour said she had been refused a meeting with the foreign secretary, David Lammy. Her husband had received only three consular visits since he was imprisoned in August. She said: “We think Ahmed is being charged for a tweet he posted seven years ago and subsequently deleted. “Ahmed has been sleeping in an overcrowded cell that is filthy. My husband is a dedicated family man who is devoted to his children, spending weekends taking them to restaurants and the park. They are distraught and are constantly asking when he will be back. I no longer know how to answer their questions. “For me the night-time is an empty void where I question over and over why this has happened to us. “What Ahmed has endured over the past eight months is tortuous prolonged solitary confinement, unclear charges, a forced confession and excessive surveillance by prison authorities all managed by a powerless state-appointed legal counsel.”",

    "title": "‘Just wildly illegal’: top Democrats push to censure Trump’s plan to accept Qatar jet",
    "article_text": "TopDemocratsin the US Senate are pushing for a vote on the floor of the chamber censuringDonald Trump’s reported plan to accept a $400m luxury jet from the royal family ofQatarfor use as Air Force One and later as a fixture in the Trump’s personal presidential library. Four Democratic members of the Senate foreign relations committee said on Monday that they would press for a vote later this week. They said that elected officials, including the president, were not allowed to accept large gifts from foreign governments unless authorized to do so by Congress. Cory Bookerfrom New Jersey, Brian Schatz from Hawaii, Chris Coons from Delaware and Chris Murphy from Connecticut cast the reported gift of the Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet as a clear conflict of interest and a serious threat to national security. “Air Force Once is more than just a plane – it’s a symbol of the presidency and of the United States itself,” the senators said in a joint statement. “No one should use public service for personal gain through foreign gifts.” News of a possible gift of the luxury jet prompted immediate scathing criticism from seniorDemocrats. Though the Qatari government has stressed that no final decision has yet been made, Trump appeared to confirm it on Sunday when he commented on social media that the transfer was being made “in a very public and transparent transaction”. The plan appears to be for the 13-year-old plane to be fitted out by the US military for use as Air Force One and then, when Trump leaves the White House, for it to be put on display in his presidential library – in effect being handed to Trump for his own personal use. The reported arrangement comes as Trump sets off for a tour of the Middle East, including Qatar. Another of the countries on the tour, theUnited Arab Emirates, has also become embroiled in controversy over potential conflicts of interest involving Trump. Last week it was revealed that an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi hadinjected $2bninto a stablecoin venture launched by Trump’s World Liberty Financial crypto company as an investment into the crypto exchange Binance. Senate Democrats are also gearing up to challenge Trump’s conflicts of interest under congressional rules governing the sale of military weapons to foreign countries. Murphy, the senator from Connecticut who has been at the forefront of sounding the alarm over conflicts of interest in the secondTrump administration, has said he will use his powers to challenge arms sales as a way of forcing a full debate and Senate vote on both the Qatar plane and UAE stablecoin issues. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion He said on social media that he would object to “any military deal with a nation that is paying off Trump personally – we can’t act like this is normal foreign policy”. He added: “UAE’s investment in Trump crypto and Qatar’s gifting of a plane is nuclear grade graft.” In anearlier poston Bluesky, Murphy described the idea of Qatar handing over the jet as being “just wildly illegal”. Trump has so far brushed aside the Democratic fury. He praised Qatar’s offer on Monday as a “great gesture” and said he would “never be one to turn down that kind of offer”.",

Last weekTrump announced a ceasefire deal with the Iranian-backed Houthisin Yemen which excluded Israel. He described the Houthi rebels as “brave” just days after one of their missiles hit Israel’s main airport, prompting many international airlines to suspend flights. Houthi attacks on Israel have continued. He previously dismissed Israeli calls for military action against Iran, instead opening talks with Tehran on ending its nuclear programme. Days after the Houthi ceasefire deal, news leaked that the Trump administration had dropped a Biden-era demand that linked progress on a Saudi Arabian civilian nuclear programme to normalising relations with Israel. Saudi Arabia has ruled out normalisation while Israel is at war inGaza. Trump’s move made clear he doesn’t want his hands to be tied as he heads to Riyadh later this week to seal billions of dollars in expected deals. His first trip to the region since returning to the White House will also include visits to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, but not Israel. That conspicuous absence from the presidential itinerary would have been unthinkable in recent decades. Ilan Baruch, a former Israeli ambassador who now chairs the Policy Working Group, which advocates for a two-state solution, said: “Trump, it seems, has embarked on a bluntly new trajectory. “Israel was expecting the Trump administration to stay the course within a paradigm of ‘shared convictions and mutual strategic interests’. Trump is the first president in a generation to put this equation in doubt.” Strong, long-term support for Israel among much of Trump’s Republican base means Netanyahu is in a better position to hold on to US support than a leader like the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said Nadav Eyal, a research scholar at Columbia University and a commentator with the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. “As to how serious the damage is, I would say right now it is not lasting … not a full blown crisis yet,” he said. “I suspect that both sides will try to mitigate, negotiate, and not make it a public confrontation.” Still, Netanyahu’s celebration of Israel-US ties at the start of the year, when he was the first foreign leader invited to Trump’s second-term White House, now look premature. Although Alexander’s release was agreed without Israeli input, Netanyahu responded initially not by thanking Trump but by in effect claiming credit for it. “The expected release of IDF soldier Edan Alexander without anything in return will be possible due to the vigorous policy that we have led with the backing of President Trump, and thanks to the military pressure of IDF soldiers in the Gaza Strip,” his office said in a statement before his planned release. He is already facing the fury of hostage families and their supporters,who say he is extending the war – and their suffering – for personal political gain.One, Einav Tsengauker, described the prime minister on Monday as an “angel of death”. But Netanyahu’s truculent response to the release of Alexander risks stirring up the anger of a far more potent enemy, whose endless appetite for praise and deference is now the basis of global foreign policy from Beijing to Brussels. Trump’s post celebrating Alexander’s release spelt out what he wants to see next. “Hopefully this is the first of those final steps necessary to end this brutal conflict. I look very much forward to that day of celebration!” There is broad support inside Israel for ending the war in return for the release of all hostages, with opinion polls showing more than two-thirds of the country back a deal. But those who want to carry on fighting include the leaders of two far-right parties at the heart of Netanyahu’s coalition. That leaves Netanyahu potentially facing a choice between shoring up his government, or shoring up Israel’s most important relationship. “If he wants Trump back on his side, then he needs to do things that would cost him the coalition,” said Pinkas, the former diplomat. “If you look at his biography and experience, he should be fully aware of all this. If you look at his behaviour, it’s as if he has no idea what’s going on.”",

    "title": "India has only ‘paused’ military action against Pakistan, Modi says",
    "article_text": "Narendra Modi has said India has only “paused” its military action against Pakistan and would “retaliate on its own terms” to any attacks, after a ceasefire brought escalating hostilities between the two countries to a standstill at the weekend. In his first address since attacks began between India andPakistan– culminating in both sides launching missiles at each other’s key military bases and airfields on Saturday – the Indian prime minister said he was “monitoring every step of Pakistan”. Donald Trump announced the ceasefire between the two countries on Saturday, halting fears that the two nuclear-armed nations were hurtling towards all-out war for the first time in decades. India launched its attack first on Pakistan on Wednesday in retaliation for a deadly militant attack in April in Indian-administeredKashmir, which it blamed on Pakistan-backed terror groups. It escalated into drone and missile strikes by both sides, and deadly shelling along the disputed border dividing Kashmir. Both Trump and Pakistani officials credited the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the vice-president, JD Vance, with brokering peace between the two countries, after hours of intense negotiations withIndiaand Pakistan. But Modi made no reference to the US’s role in the ceasefire. Instead he maintained India’s line that it was Pakistan that first reached out to India’s head of military operations on Saturday for a ceasefire, and it was Pakistan that had called on the global community for help. In comments at the White House on Monday, Trump claimed the US had “stopped a nuclear conflict” in its interventions with India and Pakistan. He said: “I think it could have been a bad nuclear war, millions of people could have been killed. So I’m very proud of that.” Modi’s speech also alluded to the nuclear threat that had hung over last week’s escalating tensions, adding that in any future conflict with Pakistan, India would not tolerate “nuclear blackmailing”. On Monday, Pakistan security officials said one of the terms of the ceasefire was an agreement that future talks would be held in a third country, with the United Arab Emirates floated as a possible venue. In his speech, Modi made reference to possible future negotiations but said that “if we talk to Pakistan, it will be about terrorism only … it will be about Pakistan-occupied Kashmir”. By Monday, it appeared as if the fragile ceasefire would continue to hold. Along the line of control, the disputed border dividing Kashmir between India and Pakistan, all the cross-border shelling and aggressions of last week showed no sign of resuming. India also reopened 32 airports across north India that had been shut down as cross-border hostilities escalated. The Indian army said in a statement on Sunday night: “The night remained largely peaceful across Jammu and Kashmir, and other areas along the international border.” In a phone call between military officials from India and Pakistan, both sides also agreed to reduce troop presence at the border. In Indian-administered Kashmir, expert teams were dispatched to the border areas to defuse unexploded bombs, as tens of thousands of people who had been evacuated from their villages in border areas returned home.",

    "title": "Warm weather and Easter weekend boosted UK spending in April, says Barclays",
    "article_text": "British households increased their spending in April as unusually warm weather and the long Easter weekend helped consumers shrug off anxiety around the global economy, new data has suggested. Consumer card spending grew by 4.5% in April compared with the same period last year, the biggest rise since June 2023, the high street bankBarclaysfound. Non-essential spending, such as on entertainment or takeaway food, rose by 5.1% last month, its highest rate in almost two years. Thewarmest April on record, combined with a long Easter weekend, also meant more shoppers were out on the high street. Spending in physical shops increased by 6.9% after it dropped by 1.9% in March on a year-on-year basis. Julien Lafargue, a strategist at Barclays, said economic sentiment was “surprisingly positive” even amid uncertainty around the impact of US tariffs on the economy. “The recent decision by the Bank of England to further lower interest rates should add to this momentum. Similarly, the trade agreement reached between the US and the UK should provide some much needed visibility to businesses.” he said. Last week the Bank agreed tocut interest rates by a quarter point to 4.25%and Keir Starmer announced he had reached a trade agreement with Donald Trump, the US president. The Barclays data chimed with separate research by the British Retail Consortium (BRC), an industry body. It found retail sales rose by 4.3% across the March and April period. Food sales in April grew 8.2% against last year, while non-food sales grew by 6.1%. Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said Easter falling in April this year had contributed to the sales boost and the sunny weather had led to a boost in consumer spending. She said: “Food sales performed well as people brought together their family and friends for Easter celebrations, while sales of DIY, homeware and gardening goods shone bright as people made the most of the weather.” Online furniture sales rose by 7% in April, with household appliances up 8%. Linda Ellett, of the consultancy KPMG, said that this was likely a result of a rise in new homeowners due to stamp duty changes last month.

    "title": "Labour to defend aid cuts, claiming UK’s days as ‘a global charity’ are over",
    "article_text": "The days of viewing the UK as “a global charity” are over, the new development minister, Jenny Chapman, will tell MPs, in remarks that are likely to prove a controversial defence of the large-scale aid cuts she is about to oversee. Lady Chapman replaced Anneliese Dodds in February after Doddsrefused to backKeir Starmer’s decision tocut the UK aid budgetfrom 0.5% of gross national income (GNI) to 0.3% in 2027. The move will take £6bn out of the 2023 aid budget of £15.2bn and will be the first time UK aid spending has fallen to 0.3% of GNI since 1999. On current trends, the UK will also fall behind Germany, France, Japan and Canada in terms of official development assistance as percentage of gross national income. Starmerjustified the cutby saying the money was necessary to fund defence. Chapman will tell the international development select committee on Tuesday that UK aid will be focused more on sharing British expertise than spending money. She will argue that supporting economies will be at the heart of how the UK spends its overseas aid budget, arguing helping countries to grow is the surest way to reduce poverty and deliver the UK’s plan for change by discouraging foreign populations from seeking to migrate. The unapologetic tone about the coming aid cuts may disturb someLabourMPs, as will her emphasis that her changes are likely to be welcomed by African countries. The Foreign Office said Chapman would say: “Partners across Africa, from Ethiopia to Zimbabwe, want to move on from receiving aid from the UK and that the government’s new approach will focus on the UK as an investor, not just a donor, and on partnering, not paternalism.” She will add that Britain will increasingly be sharing with countries the incredible expertise it has to offer, instead of direct funding. “The days of viewing government as a global aid charity are over,” she will say in remarks that are reminiscent of theclaim by Boris Johnsonthat the aid budget was seen as a “giant cashpoint in the sky”. Denying the government is opposed to international aid, Chapman will tell MPs: “We need to prioritise, be more efficient, and focus on impact above all else. We have to get the best value for money – for the UK taxpayer, but also for the people we are trying to help around the world. “We need to draw on all the expertise the UK has to offer, such as our world-class universities, the City of London, Met Office, Land Registry, HMRC, education, and health.

And ultimately, exit the need for aid. “With less to spend we have no choice. Biggest impact and biggest spend aren’t always the same thing.” The cuts are made more painful since they coincide with a massiveslashing back of aid by the US. As a result, global health aid is projected to decline by 40% in 2025 compared with the 2023 baseline.",

    "title": "Pension funds ‘to unlock up to £50bn’ of investment, with half for UK firms",
    "article_text": "The bosses of 17 of the UK’s biggest pension funds have struck a deal with the government that it claims will release up to £50bn worth of investments, with at least half earmarked for British assets including clean energy projects and homegrown startups. Fund managers including Aviva, Legal & General, M&G, Phoenix and the Universities Superannuation Scheme have agreed to sign a new “Mansion House accord” that will lead to at least 10% of their workplace pension schemes being invested in private market assets by 2030. Half of that money (5%) will be earmarked for UK investments, including stakes in private British businesses, property and major infrastructure projects, all areas of focus as the governmenttries to kickstart the economy. The new accord doubles the size of commitments made undera deal arranged by the Conservative government in 2023,known as the Mansion House compact. Led by the then chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, signatories agreed to allocate 5% of funds to private assets, with no stipulation about keeping any of that money in the UK. The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “We are choosing to back British businesses and British workers. I welcome this bold step by some of our biggest pension funds, which will unlock billions for major infrastructure, clean energy and exciting startups.” However, some pension fund providers are understood to be wary about any government efforts to force firms to put money into British assets, which could result in poorer returns for retirees compared with overseas investments, possibly breaching their fiduciary duties to clients. While the accord itself does not mandate UK investments, there are concerns that the pensions bill, due later this year, could leave the door open for the government to dictate how fund money is used. Zoe Alexander, the director of policy and advocacy at the Pension and Lifetime Savings Association, said the government, for its part, had “committed to take action to ensure there is a strong pipeline of investable assets for pension schemes. With everyone playing their part, there is great potential to boost returns for savers while providing vital funding to productive growth areas.” The voluntary pact covers signatories’ defined contribution pension schemes, which do not guarantee a set income at retirement, and are the default plan for most UK workers. The 17 signatories, which also include Aegon UK, Aon, M&G and Mercer, manage combined portfolios currently worth £252bn, suggesting UK investment commitments worth just £12.6bn. However, the government’s calculations predict those portfolios will grow by about 17% per year, and possibly further under government pressure to consolidate retirement schemes into national “megafunds” that are intended to replicate success stories in Canada and Australia. The Treasury believes that will leave the pension providers with portfolios worth £740bn by 2030, and roughly £50bn of new funds for private market investments, when discounting for existing commitments. Around half that – £25bn – would therefore be aimed at UK projects and startups. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion Many pension providers already allocate funds to private assets, including in the UK, meaning that it may not necessarily lead to a large injection of cash from individual pension providers. The Mansion House accord comes as the government tries to tackle concerns about a lack of domestic investment in the UK. But the Treasury has been juggling competing interests, with lobbyists also calling for reforms that could simultaneously boost ownership of stock-exchange listed companies. London lost out on a raft of blockbuster listings in recent years, including by UK chip designer Arm, which opted to list on Wall Street in August 2023.The buy now, pay later company Klarnafollowed suit, while other companies such as Paddy Power owner, Flutter, and the travel company Tui opted to switch their primary listings from London to rival hubs such as New York and Frankfurt. However, the metals investment company Cobalt Holdings bucked the trend on Monday,announcing plans to float in London in June in a rare boost to the UK stock exchange. Cobalt is planning to raise roughly $230m (£174m), with commodities trader Glencore due to take a 10% stake. The government is also expected to launch a consultation in coming weeks on a possible shake-up of the Isa market to incentivise more investment in British stocks via the tax-free accounts.",

    "article_text": "Three climbers from suburban Seattle were killed in a fall on Sunday when their equipment failed while rappelling down a steep gully in North Cascades national park inWashington state, sheriff’s officials said. A party of four climbers was descending the gully in the area of North Early Winters Spire when the fall happened. Sheriff’s officials presume the cause was an anchor failure but are still investigating. Three of the climbers – ages 36, 47 and 63 – were killed at the scene while the fourth person freed themselves and walked back to the trailhead then drove to a pay phone to call for help. Sheriff’s personnel and county search and rescue volunteers responded to the accident late Sunday morning about 16 miles (26km) west of Mazama in an area of rock formations that are popular with climbers, the Okanogan county sheriff’s office said in a social media post on Monday. The fourth climber sustained internal bleeding and a traumatic brain injury in the fall and was taken to a hospital in Seattle, Okanogan county undersheriff David Yarnell told the Seattle Times on Monday. “He didn’t realize he had as significant of internal injuries as he did,” Yarnell said. A helicopter rescue team from nearby Snohomish county helped recover the bodies from the technical, mountainous terrain. Investigators said they will inspect the climbers’ gear to help confirm the cause of the fall. Yarnell told the Seattle Times that all four climbers were locked in to the same anchor point which is “not preferred”. The anchor point will also be investigated to determine if it was pre-existing or their own gear. “All we know is that the anchor point that they were all tied off to failed,” Yarnell said.",

    "title": "Biden destroyed Harris bid by staying in race too long, top adviser says in book",
    "article_text": "Joe Biden “totally fucked us” by leaving it too late to drop out of the 2024 US presidential election, a former top campaign aide toKamala Harrishas told the authors of a new book. David Plouffe, who was manager of Barack Obama’s winning 2008 campaign and a senior adviser in his White House, was drafted in to help Harris’s bid for president after the declining Biden withdrew from the race last summer. Harris’s 107-day sprint against Donald Trump was “a fucking nightmare”, Plouffe is quoted as saying by authors Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson inOriginal Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again. A copy was obtained by the Guardian. “And it’s all Biden,” Plouffe adds, reflecting on the former US president’s decisions to run for re-election and then to cling on for more than three weeks after a catastrophic debate performance against Trump raised questions about his mental acuity and age. “He totally fucked us.” Plouffe, along with some other former Obama staffers, haspreviously been criticalof Biden and his role in the Democratic defeat. In the wake of Harris’s loss he posted a message on X – formerly known as Twitter – that the Harris campaign had begun in a “deep hole”. Helater deletedhis account. The book describes how Plouffe had received calls from donors worried about Biden’s diminishing energy, cognitive skills and ability to deliver a speech. He in turn pressed the White House and Democratic party if they felt sure that the then president could win another election and was repeatedly told he could. ButTapper, chief Washington correspondent for CNN, and Thompson, a national political correspondent for Axios, spoke to around 200 people for the book, including members of Congress and White House and campaign insiders. Some had been sounding the alarm about Biden’s mental acuity and about desperate efforts by his close staff and allies to hide the extent of his deterioration. One senior aide, who quit the White House because they did not think Biden should run, admits to the authors that “we attempted to shield him from his own staff so many people didn’t realize the extent of the decline beginning in 2023”. “I loveJoe Biden. When it comes to decency, there are few in politics like him. Still, it was a disservice to the country and to the party for his family and advisers to allow him to run again.” A prominent Democratic strategist says of Biden’s determination to seek re-election: “It was an abomination. He stole an election from the Democratic party; he stole it from the American people.” Original Sin is one of several eagerly awaited books about the 2024 election and an alleged White House conspiracy. Biden, 82, seemingly tried to preempt its revelations last week with media appearances on BBC Radio 4’s Today program and ABC’s talkshow The View. Biden has signed with Creative Artists Agency for representation andhired communications strategist Chris Meagherto help burnish his public reputation. But the 27 June 2024debate in Atlantawas no anomaly, the book argues. Since at least 2022 Biden has been increasingly prone to lose his train of thought and struggle to remember the names of top aides. His speeches can be incoherent and difficult to hear. When he proved incapable of delivering a two-minute video address without stumbling, aides filmed him with two cameras so the edit would be less obvious. Original Sin tells how prominent figures tried to intervene in various ways. Obama visited the White House in 2023 and warned Biden: “Just make sure you can win the race.” Ari Emanuel, a Hollywood powerbroker and significant Democratic donor, yelled at longtime Biden ally Ron Klain: “Joe Biden cannot run for re-election! He needs to drop out! He can’t win! What’s the plan B?” Klain admitted there was no plan B. AndChuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the Senate, confronted the president after the debate last July at his home in Rehoboth, Delaware, and appealed to his desire to preserve his legacy. He warned Biden that, he if stayed in the race and lost to Trump then 50 years of “amazing, beautiful work goes out the window. But it’s worse than that – you will go down in American history as one of the darkest figures.” On their way out, the book reports, Biden put his hands on Schumer’s shoulders and told him: “You have bigger balls than anyone I’ve ever met.” Biden stepped aside on 21 July and quickly endorsed Harris, but it was too late, the authors contend. He had already helpedusher in the fatethat he most wanted to avoid: the return of Trump to the White House.",

    "title": "Sean Penn says he’d work with Woody Allen again ‘in a heartbeat’",
    "article_text": "Sean Penn has reiterated his defence ofWoody Allen, saying he would “work with him in a heartbeat”. Penn was speaking onThe Louis Theroux Podcast, and told Theroux that while he felt he didn’t know Allen well enough to know for certain that “100% this didn’t happen”, he said: “The stories are mostly told by people that I wouldn’t trust with a dime. It just seems so heavily weighted in that way.” Allen is accused of sexual abuse by the director’s adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow; Allen has always denied the allegations and two official investigations by social services departments in Connecticut and New York state were closed after finding no evidence against him. Allen’s son, investigative journalist Ronan Farrow, has been outspoken in support of Dylan, while adopted son Moses Farrow has been equally outspoken in defence of Allen. Penn worked with Allen onthe 1999 film Sweet and Lowdown, for which he was nominated for an Oscar. Penn said: “I am not aware of any clinical psychologist or psychiatrist or anyone I’ve ever heard talk or spoken to around the subject of paedophilia that, in 80 years of life, there’s accusations of it happening only once. I’m not aware of that. And when people try to associate what were his, let’s say, much younger girlfriends, right or wrong … is to me a different conversation.” He added: “I see he’s not proven guilty, so I take him as innocent, and I would work with him in a heartbeat.” In the same interview Penn cast new light onhis meeting with former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad in 2018at the height of the Syrian civil war. Penn was working on a now-abandoned documentary about the Arab Spring uprisings. Penn told Theroux he wanted permission to speak to Isis prisoners and speak to Syrians “on the street … without a minder”. According to Penn, al-Assad’s response was, “Absolutely, we have nothing to hide”, and then invited him to lunch. Penn said: “I got into his car and … we drove about 20 minutes through Damascus. To this day, I have to believe it was The Truman Show. That every block all the way to his house was staged. People driving up next to him and saying, “hello, Mr President”. “Hey, how are you?” This kind of thing. Virtually no visible security.” “We went to the house. Again, no sign of security of any kind. He’s there with his wife and his children. His children are as western as any California kid, and they’re listening to Kanye and dancing around.” However, Penn said as negotiations progressed, access was denied and he decided to drop the film. Penn also had harsh comments on bothDonald Trumpand Elon Musk. Trump, he said, might be “extremely smart for his time and what it valued”, adding: “But what he values is so base. I won’t equate that with intelligence. It’s truly void of soul. And really, it actively engages in cruelty.” Penn said that Musk,who until recently was heading a so-called “department of government efficiency” for Trump’s administrationresulting in the shutdown of swathes of public services, appeared only to “value destruction of things and people”, adding. “I can’t associate that with any intelligence that’s going to do humankind any good.” Saying he had met Musk “on several occasions”, Penn suggested that Musk’s insecurities were down to being a “prematurely balding teenager, white in apartheid South Africa, who has no social skills” and that in his view Musk was a combination of “a lot of destructive energy and a lot of stuff that may end up being very productive for other generations”. Penn also reflected on his tempestuous relationship withMadonna, to whom he was married between 1985 and 1989, and in the course of which he had a number of run-ins with paparazzi. Responding to Theroux’s question about Madonna’s statement in her 1991 documentary In Bed with Madonna that Penn was “the love of her life”, Penn said: “She’s very sweet. Look, she’s been a good friend for a lot of years. It didn’t take us long to realise that we had mistaken a good first date for a wedding partner. It didn’t take us long to recover after we got divorced, maybe a year, in a friendship. I have a lot of fond memories of it – it’s not all jail. But there was a lot of alcohol and she’d be fairly accusing me of that.” Penn also said that he may have helped accelerate the rise of celebrity culture by his occasionally violent responses to harassment by the media. “[It] added to the idea you can go provoke people like this idiot. I’m probably partially responsible for this explosion that led to all this. Extreme creepy fascination with famous people and things like that. My life was much simpler before [meeting Madonna]. But she became a lightning rod of attention. I was there.”",

    "title": "Music mogul ‘Diddy’ faces allegations of abuse during first day of US trial",
    "article_text": "A number of witnesses have taken to the stand in the trial ofSean “Diddy” Combs, who is facing allegations of racketeering and sex trafficking during his time as head of an entertainment empire. Testimony in the trial began on Monday after the final phase of jury selection and opening statement from lawyers. Combs, donning a light-grey sweater, gave a thumbs-up to supporters in the courtroom in New York City in the United States. “For 20 years, the defendant, with the help of his trusted inner circle, committed crime after crime,” Assistant US Attorney Emily Johnson told the court. “That’s why we are here today. That’s what this case is about.” A number of witnesses testified that they had experienced physical violence, intimidation, and manipulation byCombs, while the rapper’s lawyers said that he has been charged with the wrong categories of crimes and “his kinky sex and his preferences for sex” were being portrayed as nefarious. Attorney Teny Geragos told jurors that they may end up thinking Combs was a “jerk” or “kind of mean”, but that he is not being charged “with being mean or a jerk”. “This case is about voluntary choices made by capable adults in consensual relationships,” Geragos said during her opening statement. Johnson, the US attorney, said that Combs “viciously attacked” women who refused to participate in the parties that were called “freak offs”. “They will tell you about some of the most painful experiences of their lives. The days they spent in hotel rooms, high on drugs, dressed in costumes to perform the defendant’s sexual fantasies,” Johnson told jurors of testimony from victims in the case. The courtroom became audibly silent as a video of Combs beating and kicking his former girlfriend Casandra Ventura in 2016 was shown. A stripper named Daniel Phillip testified that Combs had thrown a liquor bottle towards Ventura before grabbing her by the hair and dragging her screaming into another room, where Phillip says he heard Combs yelling and beating Ventura. “She literally jumped into my lap and she was shaking, like literally her whole entire body was shaking. She was terrified,” Phillip testified of Ventura. Geragos conceded that Combs is prone to jealousy and had committed an act of “horrible, dehumanising violence” in the video shown to jurors, but that it was evidence of domestic abuse, not alleged acts of sex trafficking or racketeering that are at the centre of the case. Prosecutors say that Combs, who faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years in prison if convicted of all five felony counts to which he had pleaded not guilty, pushed women to engage in drug-fuelled parties and then blackmailed them with videos of their encounters. Combs’s status as a high-profile entertainer has brought substantial attention to the trial, as well as larger debate about how powerful figures in sectors such as entertainment, business, sports, and politics often evade accountability for acts of abuse. As the case began, the jury and alternates – 12 men and six women – were seated in the courtroom. Opening arguments started after the judge finished explaining the law as it relates to this trial, along with incidentals such as that a light breakfast will be provided to the jury in addition to lunch. The jury for this case is essentially anonymous, meaning their identities are known to the court and the prosecution and defence, but will not be made public. “We will keep your names and identities in confidence,” Subramanian told jurors. It’s a common practice in federal cases to keep juries anonymous, particularly in sensitive, high-profile matters where juror safety can be a concern. Juror names also were kept from the public in US President Donald Trump’s criminal trial last year in state court in New York. Subramanian urged jurors to judge the case only based on the evidence presented in court. It’s a standard instruction, but it carried added significance in this high-profile case, which has been the subject of intense media coverage. “Anything you’ve seen or heard outside the courtroom is not evidence,” the judge said. “It must be disregarded.”",

    "article_text": "The United Nations has called for urgent de-escalation in Libya’s capital, Tripoli, as rival gunmen exchanged fire in the city’s southern districts after the killing of a powerful militia leader, with authorities imposing an emergency lockdown. The appeal early on Tuesday came as residents reported hearing heavy gunfire and explosions across multiple neighbourhoods from about 9pm local time (19:00 GMT) on Monday. Al Jazeera’s Malik Traina, reporting from Libya’s Misrata, said security sources had confirmed the killing of Abdel Ghani al-Kikli, widely known as “Gheniwa”, who is the head of the powerful Stability Support Authority (SSA) militia. Gunfire and clashes then consumed several parts of Tripoli. Al-Kikli was one of the capital’s most influential militia leaders and had recently been involved in disputes with rival armed groups, including factions linked to Misrata. His SSA is under the Presidential Council, which came to power in 2021 with the Government of National Unity (GNU) of Abdul Hamid Dbeibah through a UN-recognised process. Traina said that at least six people have been wounded, although it remains unclear whether they are security force members or civilians. In a statement shortly after the clashes began, the UN Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said it was “alarmed by the unfolding security situation in Tripoli, with intense fighting with heavy weaponry in densely populated civilian areas”. UNSMIL added that it “calls on all parties to immediately cease fighting and restore calm, and reminds all parties of their obligations to protect civilians at all times”. UNSMIL is alarmed by the unfolding security situation in Tripoli, with intense fighting with heavy weaponry in densely populated civilian areas.The Mission calls on all parties to immediately cease fighting and restore calm, and reminds all parties of their obligations to…pic.twitter.com/SZ8oKgZ1p8 — UNSMIL (@UNSMILibya)May 12, 2025 UNSMIL voiced support for local mediation efforts, particularly those led by elders and community leaders, emphasising the need to protect civilians amid mounting tensions. The GNU’s Ministry of Internal Affairs urged residents to stay home and avoid movement, warning of further instability, while the Ministry of Education suspended classes across Tripoli on Tuesday, citing the deteriorating security situation. The GNU’s media platform said early on Tuesday that the Ministry of Defence had fully taken control of the Abu Salim neighbourhood. “I heard heavy gunfire, and I saw red lights in the sky,” one resident told the Reuters news agency on condition of anonymity. Two others told Reuters that the gunfire was echoing all over their neighbourhoods of Abu Salim and Salah Eddin. Videos and images online showed plumes of black smoke amid the sound of gunfire, as well as armed men in the streets and convoys entering the city. Footage verified by Al Jazeera’s Sanad fact-checking agency captured the sound of medium-calibre gunfire in several neighbourhoods, including areas where the SSA militia is known to operate. Several districts have seen what local sources describe as “suspicious military manoeuvres”, with convoys arriving from Az-Zawiyah, Zintan and Misrata – seen by many as preparations for a possible showdown in the capital. Al Jazeera’s Traina said the renewed clashes have prompted anger and worry. “People are angry that every time these armed groups clash, civilians are caught in the crossfire,” he said, adding that residents are demanding “accountability”. “When these groups fight and people are killed, no one is held responsible. Locals want justice, and expect the authorities to hold those behind the violence accountable,” he said. Libya plunged into chaos following a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed Libyan leaderMuammar Gaddafiin 2011. The oil-rich nation has been governed for most of the past decade by rival governments in eastern and western Libya, each backed by an array of fighter groups and foreign governments.",

    "title": "Trump administration welcomes 59 white South Africans as refugees to the US",
    "article_text": "A group of 59 white Afrikaners from South Africa has arrived in the United States as part of a refugee programme set up by theadministration of US President Donald Trumpto offer sanctuary from what Trump has depicted as racial discrimination against white people. In a press conference on Monday, Trump mirrored the claims of a myth popular on the far right that white people in South Africa have been subjected to systematic violence since the end of white minority rule in that country. “It’s a genocide that’s taking place,” Trump told reporters at the White House, a claim that has drawn criticism from government officials, news media, and even someAfrikaners themselves. The move comes as the Trump administration blocks nearly all refugee admissions from non-white countries and leans into rhetoric about an “invasion” of immigrants from poor countries. While people fleeing widespread violence and persecution in countries such as Haiti and Afghanistan have found aclosed door, Al Jazeera correspondent Patty Culhane says that the Trump administration “has made a priority of getting these people [white South Africans] into the United States and paying for them to get here”. TheSouth African governmenthas called Trump’s claims that Afrikaners face persecution “completely false”, noting that they have remained among the richest and “most economically privileged” groups, even after the end of the apartheid system that upheld white minority control of the political, economic, and military resources of the country and denied basic rights to the Black South African majority. South African whites still own about three-quarters of all private land in the country, and have about 20 times the wealth of the Black majority, according to the international academic journal the Review of Political Economy. “We think that the American government has got the wrong end of the stick here, but we’ll continue talking to them,” South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, himself a veteran of the struggle to end apartheid, said on Monday. Tensions between the Trump administration and the government of South Africa have been high, with the USexpelling South Africa’s ambassadorover previous criticism of Trump and at odds with the African nation’s prominent position in a case before the International Court of Justice accusing US ally Israel of genocide in Gaza. The Trump administration offered in February to resettle Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch settlers in South Africa, stating that they face discrimination and violence against Afrikaner farmers. “I want you all to know that you are really welcome here and that we respect what you have had to deal with these last few years,” Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau told the group of Afrikaners who arrived in the US on Monday. “We respect the long tradition of your people and what you have accomplished over the years.” Bill Frelick, refugee policy director with Human Rights Watch, said the fast-track process of bringing Afrikaners into the US was unprecedented. “These are people who were not living in refugee camps; who hadn’t fled their country. They were the group that was most associated with the oppression of the Black majority through apartheid,” said Frelick. “It’s not like these are among the most vulnerable refugees of the world.”",

    "title": "Trump signs executive order to bring down prescription drug prices",
    "article_text": "United States PresidentDonald Trumphas signed an executive order that he says will bring down the price of prescription drugs in the US by as much as 90 percent. In an announcement on Monday, Trump said drug companies who have been “profiteering” will have to bring prices down but laid the blame for high prices primarily on foreign countries. “We’re going to equalise,” Trump said during a news conference. “We’re all going to pay the same. We’re going to pay what Europe pays.” People in the US have long been an outlier when it comes to the prices they pay for numerous types of life-saving medication, often payingseveral times morethan their peers in other rich countries for nearly identical drugs. That phenomenon is often attributed to the substantial economic and political influence that the pharmaceutical industry wields in the US. The high cost of medical drugs has been a source of popular discontent in the US for years, and Trump accused the pharmaceutical industry of “getting away with murder” in 2017. But in his remarks on Monday, the US leader also seemed to say that US pharmaceutical companies were not ultimately to blame for the difference in prices. Trump instead framed those high prices in the familiar terms of a trade imbalance with partners such as the European Union and said the US has been “subsidising” lower drug prices in other nations. That perspective seems to align with the framing of the pharmaceutical industry itself. The industry’s most powerful lobbying arm stated the cause of high prices for US consumers is “foreign countries not paying their fair share”. Senator Bernie Sanders, a left-wing politician who has railed against the high prices paid by US patients for years, said Trump’s order wrongly blames foreign countries rather than US companies for those prices. “I agree with President Trump: it is an outrage that the American people pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs,” Sanders said in a statement. “But let’s be clear: the problem is not that the price of prescription drugs is too low in Europe and Canada. The problem is that the extraordinarily greedy pharmaceutical industry made over $100bn in profits last year by ripping off the American people.” A fact sheet shared by the White House said the administration will “communicate price targets to pharmaceutical manufacturers to establish that America, the largest purchaser and funder of prescription drugs in the world, gets the best deal”. The stock prices of US drugmakers ticked upwards after the announcement. Experts have cast doubt on Trump’s optimistic assertion that drug prices would drop quickly and substantially. “It really does seem the plan is to ask manufacturers to voluntarily lower their prices to some point which is not known,” Rachel Sachs, a health law expert at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, told The Associated Press news agency. “If they do not lower their prices to the desired point, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] shall take other actions with a very long timeline, some of which could potentially, years in the future, lower drug prices.”",

    "article_text": "A glimmer of hope to end the more than three-year war in Ukraine that has killed thousands of civilians – and hundreds of thousands of soldiers. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has agreed to attend a meeting proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Istanbul on Thursday, as long as Putin is there in person. Putin wants the talks to first discuss the root causes of the conflict and deal with ceasefire negotiations later. His plan is also supported by US President Donald Trump, who says the meeting will help Ukraine’s allies, the US and European powers, decide whether a ceasefire is possible – and also the future of the war effort against Russia’s invasion. Is the Russian leader trying to deflect growing Western pressure to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire or face “massive sanctions”? And are the talks hosted by Turkiye likely to make any progress at all?

    "title": "Hamas frees soldier Edan Alexander as Gaza faces bombardment, famine risk",
    "article_text": "Hamas has releasedEdan Alexander, a dual United States-Israeli national and soldier, as it seeks to revive ceasefire negotiations and an end to Israel’s punishing blockade on the besieged and bombarded Gaza Strip. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed on Monday evening that it had facilitated the soldier’s transfer. An image was released showing Alexander with Hamas members and a Red Cross official. Hamas said it had released Alexander as a goodwill gesture towards US President Donald Trump, who is visiting Arab Gulf nations this week. Fighting briefly stopped to allow for the handover after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would permit safe passage for the release. “Edan Alexander, American hostage thought dead, to be released by Hamas. Great news!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “The government of Israel warmly welcomes soldier Sergeant Edan Alexander who has been returned from Hamas captivity,” a statement from Netanyahu’s office said. “The government of Israel is committed to the return of all hostages and missing persons – both the living and the fallen,” the statement added. Families of the captives have accused Netanyahu of putting his own political survival above that of the captives still held in Gaza. In a statement, ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric welcomed Alexander’s release while calling for a lasting ceasefire in Gaza. “We are relieved that one more family has been reunited today. This nightmare, however, continues for the remaining hostages, their families, and hundreds of thousands of civilians across Gaza,” Spoljaric said. Alexander’s mother reportedly arrived in Israel on Monday and was flown to the Re’im military base, where the two were expected to be reunited later in the evening, according to Al Jazeera’s Hamdah Salhut, reporting from Amman, Jordan, because Al Jazeera is banned from Israel. Despite the release, Israel has made no commitment to a broader ceasefire. “There’s nothing in exchange, no release of Palestinian prisoners, no pause in the fighting,” Salhut said. “If there are going to be any sort of negotiations, they’re going to happen under fire,” Salhut added, referring to the Israeli government’s prevailing line. Akiva Eldar, an Israeli political analyst, said Alexander’s release has spurred joy as well as frustration in Israel. “What we see is that what President Trump can do, Netanyahu is not able – or not willing – to do,” he told Al Jazeera from Tel Aviv. The Israeli prime minister has faced widespread calls to end the Gaza war to secure the captives’ release but has said he plans toexpand Israel’s offensive. “Today is a crucial point,” Eldar explained. “Because the Israeli public is aware of the fact that if you want a deal, if you want your sons back at home, you can do it. But for that, you have to be a leader like President Trump and not like Netanyahu.” Al Jazeera’s Hind Khoudary, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, said there seems to be no change forthcoming in Palestinians’ daily suffering: “Palestinians are devastated. They’re exhausted. Palestinian families are unable to feed their children. They’re saying their children are going to bed hungry.” “TheIPC [Integrated Food Security Phase Classification]reportissued today said 93 percent of Gaza’s population is living through acute food insecurity. This is because of the blockade that has been imposed on the Gaza Strip,” Khoudary said. “Palestinians are asking, ‘What’s next? What is this release going to bring? Are there any positive negotiations? Is there any glimpse of hope of a ceasefire?'” she added. And the bombardment continues, Gaza’s Ministry of Health said an Israeli strike on a school-turned-shelter killed at least 15 people on Monday. Humanitarian organisations have warned that Gaza is on the verge of mass starvation. The IPC reported that half a million Palestinians face imminent famine. According to the IPC, 70 days after Israel blocked entry of essential supplies, “goods indispensable for people’s survival are either depleted or expected to run out in the coming weeks.” The head of the UN’s World Food Programme, Cindy McCain, urged immediate international action. “Families in Gaza are starving while the food they need is sitting at the border,” she said. “If we wait until after a famine is confirmed, it will already be too late for many people.” Catherine Russell, Executive Director of UNICEF, also issued a stark warning. “The risk of famine does not arrive suddenly,” she said. “It unfolds in places where access to food is blocked, where health systems are decimated, and where children are left without the bare minimum to survive.” Hunger, she added, has become “a daily reality for children across the Gaza Strip”. Netanyahu and his hardline government remain committed to escalating the military campaign in Gaza. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a key coalition partner, reiterated his position that the war must continue and humanitarian aid should be blocked from entering the territory. “Israel has not committed to a ceasefire of any kind,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement, claiming military pressure had compelled Hamas to release Alexander. Critics have countered that the release came about purely because of direct US contacts with Hamas. Netanyahu met US figures, including Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee, on Monday. His office described the meeting as a “last-ditch effort” to push forward a captive-release deal before the fighting widens. Huckabee said Trump and his administration “hope this long-overdue release” of Alexander “marks the beginning of the end to this terrible war”. Israel plans to send a delegation to Doha on Tuesday for talks but made clear military operations would persist. “The prime minister made it clear that negotiations would only take place under fire,” his office said.",

    "title": "India’s Modi says fighting ‘only paused’ in wake of conflict with Pakistan",
    "article_text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said India “only paused” its military action against Pakistan, in his first speech to the nation since a ceasefire following a fiercemilitary confrontationlast week that threatened a fifth all-out war between the nuclear-armed neighbours. Speaking on Wednesday, the ultranationalist Hindu leader said in New Delhi that his government will not make a distinction between governments that support “terrorism” and “terrorist groups”. He said India would “retaliate on its own terms” if there is any future “terror” attack on the country. The Indian military launchedmultiple missile attackstargeting sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir on May 6, claiming it had hit “terrorist infrastructure”. Pakistan rejected that claim. Pakistan chose to “attack” India rather than combat terrorism, Modi stated, asserting that his country “will not tolerate nuclear blackmail”. “We will be monitoring every step of Pakistan,” Modi added, saying that “This is not an era of war, but this is not an era of terrorism, either.” Turning to the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, Modi said, “Terror and trade cannot go together, water and blood cannot flow together.” The treaty, brokered by the World Bank, has long survived multiple crises between the two rivals. However, India’s recent decision to stop the flow of water signals a sharp diplomatic shift, using water that Pakistan relies on for agricultural and civilian purposes as leverage. Pakistan’s Finance Minister said in an interview with the Reuters news agency on Monday that the Indus Waters Treaty, unilaterally suspended by India, “has to be rolled back to where it was”. On Monday, United States President Donald Trump claimed that by helping to broker the ceasefire, his administration had prevented “a nuclear conflict”. New Delhi has blamed Islamabad for a deadlyApril 22 attackon tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir inPahalgam, during which 26 people were killed – a charge Pakistan strongly denies. According to their partial counts, the fighting since last week killed around 60 civilians on both sides. India’s and Pakistan’s top military commanders were expected to revisit a recently brokered ceasefire agreement on Monday evening. The Indian Army earlier reported a “calm night”, as authorities said the night passed peacefully across disputed Kashmir and the international border, with no new incidents reported. A senior Indian defence official confirmed that talks, originally scheduled for noon local time, were pushed to later in the day. The discussions, analysts say, will likely focus on technical details to prevent future flare-ups rather than shape long-term policy. Abdul Basit, a South Asia specialist at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said the purpose of the exchange is to establish clear lines and avoid missteps. “The goal is to avoid any miscalculations, because right now one spark could quickly move towards a nuclear catastrophe,” Basit told the AFP news agency. The spike in hostilities had marked the most serious confrontation between the nuclear-armed neighbours since their last declared conflict in 1999. As tensions cooled, Indian authorities reopened 32 airports on Monday that had been shut down due to the fighting. Civilians in Kashmir havesufferedthe most in the crossfire. Military leaders in both countries spent Sunday delivering pointed briefings, each asserting they had won while pledging restraint. “We have delivered the promise we made to our people,” Pakistan’s military spokesman Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry declared, describing the recent operation as a “success on the battleground”. Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed added that Pakistan had “re-established deterrence and neutralised key threats”. India’s Lieutenant General Rajiv Ghai insisted that his country had shown “immense restraint,” but warned: “Any threat to the sovereignty, territorial integrity and safety of our citizens will be met with decisive force.” Both nations remain on high alert despite the temporary calm, as the world watches for signs of lasting de-escalation or a reignition of hostilities.",

    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV has called for the release of journalists imprisoned for doing their work while affirming free speech. Leo, who was elected pontiff on Thursday after the death of Pope Francis, gave his first news conference at the Vatican on Monday. Addressing some of the thousands of journalists who travelled to Rome to cover his election as the first American pontiff, he said journalists jailed “for seeking and reporting the truth” must be released. “The church recognises in these witnesses – I am thinking of those who report on war even at the cost of their lives – the courage of those who defend dignity, justice and the right of people to be informed because only informed individuals can make free choices,” he said. “The suffering of these imprisoned journalists challenges the conscience of nations and the international community, calling on all of us to safeguard the precious gift of free speech and of the press.” The new pope also reiterated his message of peace that he had communicated to large crowds on Sunday as well. “Peace begins with each one of us – in the way we look at others, listen to others and speak about others,” he told assembled journalists at the Vatican’s vast Paul VI Audience Hall. “In this sense, the way we communicate is of fundamental importance. We must say ‘no’ to the war of words and images. We must reject the paradigm of war.” Leo, who was active on social media before becoming pope, cautioned against  “communication of all prejudice and resentment, fanaticism and even hatred”. “Let us disarm words, and we will help to disarm the world,” he said, urging reporters to favour a path of communication for peace. During his first Sunday blessing as pontiff, Leo advocated for genuine peace in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere. He said he carries in his heart the “suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine” and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and release of all people held by the Palestinian group Hamas in the enclave.",

    "article_text": "Ivory Coast’s main opposition leader has said he is resigning as party leader but would still lead the fight to win the election, after having been barred from standing in an October presidential vote. “In the interest of the party, I’ve decided to place my mandate as president of the party in your hands, the activists,” Thiam said in a speech published on social media on Monday. “This decision does not change the commitment I made in December 2023 to personally lead our party to victory in October 2025.” President Alassane Ouattara, 83, who has been in power since 2011, has yet to say whether he plans to run again but has said he is eager to “continue serving my country”. Tidjane Thiam’s campaign for the presidency of the West African country has been mired in tussles over his nationality, as presidential candidates are not allowed to hold dual citizenship. Thiam was born in the Ivory Coast and renounced his French passport in March to enable his run for the top job. However, a court in Abidjan struck him off the electoral list last month, saying the 62-year-old politician had lost Ivorian nationality when he acquired French citizenship in 1987. Thiam also faces a legal case against his election as head of the Democratic Party of Ivory Coast–African Democratic Rally (PDCI) after a party member also contested his Ivorian nationality at the time he was chosen. PDCI deputy president Ernest N’Koumo Mobio assumed the party’s interim leadership following Thiam’s announcement. He appealed for “cohesion, serenity and discipline” and called a party meeting early Monday due to “the urgency linked to the political situation”. Three other opposition figures have also been excluded from the presidential race, including former President Laurent Gbagbo due to court convictions. Thiam alleged irregularities on Monday. “While we had the right to hope for inclusive, transparent and peaceful elections, it is clear that the unjustified removal of the PDCI candidate is part of the logic of eliminating the leaders of the main opposition parties to ensure tailor-made elections and a certain victory,” he said. The authorities regularly reject claims of any political intervention in the electoral process, saying decisions are taken by an independent judiciary.",

    "title": "Is Trump abandoning Israel? Not really",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trumpdescends on Tuesdayon the Middle East for a regional tour that will begin in Saudi Arabia and include stops in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. It is a business trip in every sense of the term, involving potentially trillions of dollars in investment and trade deals. The UAE, for example, has already pledged$1.4 trillion in investmentsto the US over 10 years in sectors ranging from artificial intelligence and energy to mining and aluminium production. Saudi Arabia, for its part, has committed to investing $600bn in the US over the next four years.According tothe Reuters news agency, Trump will also be offering the kingdom an arms package to the tune of $100bn. Meanwhile, in keeping with the president’s solid history of nepotism and self-enrichment, it just so happens that the Trump Organization is currently presiding over real estate projects and other business ventures in all three Gulf countries he is slated to visit. And yet one country is conspicuously absent from the regional itinerary despite being the US’s longstanding BFF in the Middle East: Israel, the nation that has for the past 19 months been perpetratinggenocidein the Gaza Strip with the help of gobs ofUS money and weaponry. The official Palestinian death toll stands at nearly 53,000 and counting. Although the genocide kicked off on the watch of his predecessor President Joe Biden, Trump was quick to embrace mass slaughter as well,announcingnot long after reassuming office that he was “sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job” in Gaza. It appears, however, that Israel is taking a bit too long for the US president’s liking – particularly now that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu hasprescribedan intensified offensive against an enclave that has already been largely reduced to rubble. The issue, of course, is not that Trump cares if Palestinian children and adults continue to be massacred andstarved to deathwhile Israel takes its sweet time “finishing the job”. Rather, the ongoing genocide is simply hampering his vision of the “Riviera of the Middle East” that will supposedly spring forth from the ruins of Gaza, the creation of which he hasoutlinedas follows: “The US will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it too. We’ll own it.” So while war may be good for business – just ask the arms industry – it seems that too much war can ultimately be a counterproductive investment, at least from a Trumpian real estate perspective. In the run-up to Trump’s Middle Eastern expedition, reports increasingly circulated of tensions between the US president and the Israeli prime minister – and not just on the Gaza front. On Sunday, NBC Newsnotedthat Netanyahu had been “blindsided – and infuriated – this past week by Trump’s announcement that the US was halting its military campaign against the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen”. Even more annoying to the Israeli premier, apparently, is Trump’s refusal to endorse military strikes on Iran. Plus, the US has reportedly discarded the demand that Saudi Arabia normalise relations with Israel as a condition for US support for the kingdom’s civilian nuclear programme. What, then, does the strained Trump-Netanyahu rapport mean for the ever-so-sacred “special relationship” between the US and Israel? According to anarticlepublished by the Israeli outlet Ynetnews: “Despite the tensions, Israeli officials insist behind-the-scenes coordination with the Trump administration remains close, with no real policy rift.” The dispatch goes on to assure readers that US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has “denied rumors that Trump might announce support for a Palestinian state during the visit” to the three Gulf nations. Of course, it’s not quite clear what sort of “Palestinian state” could ever be promoted by the man proposing US ownership of the Gaza Strip and expulsion of the native Palestinian population. Although Israel may be sidelined on this trip, that doesn’t mean it won’t continue to serve a key function in general US malevolence. Just last month, Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir – source of theideathat there is “no reason for a gram of food or aid to enter Gaza” – was hosted by Republican officials at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. After a dinner held in his honour, Ben-Gvirboastedthat Republicans had “expressed support for my very clear position on how to act in Gaza and that the food and aid depots should be bombed”. Flashy trillion-dollar Gulf deals aside, rest assured that the Trump administration remains as committed as ever to capitalising on Israeli atrocities.

    "title": "Renewed RSF shelling killed several in Sudan’s el-Fasher, army says",
    "article_text": "The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) killed seven people in artillery shelling on el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state in western Sudan. A statement from the military-aligned government said on Monday that the RSF shelling that began late on Sunday targeted residential neighbourhoods, killing seven people, including women and children, and wounding at least 15, who were taken to hospitals. On Sunday, the army also said theRSF shellingin the city killed nine people. El-Fasher has witnessed intense fighting between SAF and RSF since May 2024, despite international warnings about the risks of violence in a city that serves as a key humanitarian hub for the five Darfur states. For more than a year, the RSF has sought to wrest control of it, located more than 800km (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, from the Sudanese army, launching regular attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts. The RSF and the SAF have been locked in a brutal power struggle since April 2023, resulting in thousands of deaths and pushing Sudan into one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, according to the United Nations. More than 20,000 people have been killed and 15 million displaced in the brutal civil war now in its third year, according to UN and local figures. However, some United States-based researchers estimate the actual death toll to be as high as 130,000. Meanwhile, the African Union (AU) said on Monday it would not accept “any interference” in Sudan after the RSF was accused of receiving weapons from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Last week, the Sudanese government severed diplomatic relations with the UAE, accusing it of supplying weapons to the RSF. Amnesty International has also accused the UAE of supplying weapons to the RSF, in violation of a UN arms embargo. The UAE has rejected the claims as “baseless”. “The Commission’s position is that member states are sovereign states, and the AU Commission will not accept any interference in the internal affairs of Sudan,” said AU Chairperson Mahamoud Ali Youssouf. “We will not support any intervention, any interference in the crisis in Sudan,” he said. However, Youssouf declined to comment on the UAE’s possible role in the conflict. “It is not the role of the AU. Sudan has accused the Emirates; it is up to Sudan to provide this evidence,” he said. The foreign minister of Djibouti was elected head of the pan-African organisation in February, inheriting multiple conflicts and a record of ineffectual statements. Among the top of his priorities coming into the post was the Sudan civil war, which has effectively cleaved the country in two. Both sides have been accused of committing war crimes. In recent days, drone attacks attributed by the army to the RSF have increased, marking a turning point in the two-year conflict. Drone attacks have also notably targeted strategic sites in Port Sudan, the temporary seat of government and the logistical humanitarian epicentre. In February, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged a halt to the “flow of arms” into Sudan.",

    "title": "UK veterans allege war crimes by British forces in Afghanistan, Iraq",
    "article_text": "Former members of the United Kingdom’s special forces have described alleged war crimes committed by British soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq dating back over a decade. More than 30 witnesses who served with or alongside special forces soldiers broke their silence to the BBC’s Panorama programme and spoke about illegal killings and executions of detainees, including children, during the invasions of the two countries. David Cameron – who was prime minister from June 2010 to November 2013, the period now under scrutiny by a judge-led public inquiry into special forces – was repeatedly made aware of concerns about night raids and killings raised by then-Afghan President Hamid Karzai, according to the BBC. A spokesman for Cameron said “any suggestion that [he] colluded in covering up allegations of serious criminal wrongdoing is total nonsense”. The special air service and the navy’s special boat service, the UK’s top special forces units, were at the centre of the testimonies. “They handcuffed a young boy and shot him,” recalled one veteran who served with the elite soldiers in Afghanistan. ”He was clearly a child, not even close to fighting age.” Killing of detainees “became routine”, the veteran said, adding that the soldiers would remove plastic handcuffs from executed detainees and plant weapons by their bodies to make it look like they were fighters in photographs taken from the scene. Another veteran with the navy’s special forces regiment said some service members displayed “barbaric” and “psychopathic” behaviour as they felt untouchable by the law. One former soldier described the killings as something that could turn “addictive” as some soldiers became “intoxicated by that feeling” in Afghanistan. “On some operations, the troops would go into guesthouse-type buildings and kill everyone there,” he said. “They’d go in and shoot everyone sleeping there, on entry. It’s not justified, killing people in their sleep.” Even wounded people who did not pose a threat to anyone were executed in breach of international law, witnesses said, speaking on condition of anonymity. A former special forces operator said an execution of an unarmed person in Iraq was never properly investigated, adding that senior commanders were aware of the problem long before deploying to Afghanistan. The BBC also obtained new video evidence that showed squadrons kept kill counts to compete with others. One veteran said a former colleague was trying to get kills on every single operation, having become “notorious” for killing dozens of people. Another veteran said “everyone knew” about the killings in the UK special forces command with testimonies indicating officers would falsify postoperational reports to avoid scrutiny.",

    "article_text": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer promises to “finally take back control” of the United Kingdom’s borders as his Labour government unveils policies designed to reduce legal immigration and fend offrising support for the hard right. “Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control,” he told reporters at a Downing Street news conference on Monday. Starmer announced he was ending an “experiment in open borders” that saw net migration rise to nearly one million people under the previous Conservative government, which lost last year’s general election. Labour has been traditionally more sympathetic to immigration than the Conservative Party. Starmer, a former human rights lawyer who voted for the UK to remain part of the European Union, is under renewed pressure to tackle the issue after the anti-immigration Reform UK party’s gains in recent local elections. However, Starmer’s shift to the right on immigration risks alienating Labour’s large base of left-of-centre supporters and losing their votes to the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. The government’s Immigration White Paper policy document includes plans to cut overseas care workers and increase from five to 10 years the length of time people will have to live in the UK before qualifying for settlement and citizenship. English-language rules would also be strengthened with all adult dependants required to demonstrate a basic understanding while the length of time students may stay in the UK after completing their studies would be reduced. The white paper also proposes new powers to deport foreigners who commit offences in the country. Currently, the government is only informed of foreign nationals who receive prison sentences while under the new arrangements all foreign nationals convicted of offences would be flagged for the government. The document also proposes new visa controls requiring foreign skilled workers to have a university degree to secure a job in the UK. The prime minister acknowledged that migrants “make a massive contribution” to Britain but alleged the country risks becoming an “island of strangers” without more controls. He added that he wants net migration to fall “significantly” by the next election, likely in 2029, but refused to say by how much. Labour promised in its general election manifesto last year to significantly reduce net migration, which stood at 728,000 in the 12 months to June. It had peaked at 906,000 in 2023 after averaging 200,000 a year for most of the 2010s. Arch-eurosceptic Nigel Farage’s Reform party won more than 670 local council seats this month as well as its first two mayoral posts. It is also riding high in national polls while Labour is struggling after its 2024 landslide general election victory.",

    "title": "Trump visits Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE: What to know",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump will undertake a three-day tour of the Gulf for his first state visit since retaking office in January. The trip begins in Saudi Arabia, followed by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It marks Trump’s second foreign visit as president after he attendedPope Francis’s funeralin Rome in April. Here is what to know about the trip and what is on the agenda: Trump will fly out of the US on Monday and start his trip in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday. He is expected to attend a Gulf summit in the city on Wednesday, visit Qatar later that day and conclude his visit in the UAE on Thursday. Saudi Arabia was the first countryTrump visitedduring his first term as well, breaking the tradition of US presidents starting with the United Kingdom, Canada or Mexico. His objectives are securing majoreconomic dealsand making diplomatic progress on issues that impact the region, including a Gaza ceasefire and stalled Saudi-Israel normalisation talks. The focus on economic deals comes as the US recorded a drop in its economic output in the first quarter, its first in three years. On Wednesday, Trump said he will alsodecide during his trip howthe US refers to the “Persian Gulf”. US media reported that he may decide to refer to the body of water as the Arabian Gulf or the Gulf of Arabia. Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said the president wants to expand theAbraham Accords, under which the UAE and Bahrain recognised Israel during Trump’s first term, to include Saudi Arabia. Talks were reportedly under way on Saudi Arabia joining the accords, but after Israel began its war on Gaza in October 2023, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) paused those discussions. Saudi officials have said they won’t move forward unless there is real progress towards a two-state solution for Palestine, leading to speculation that Trump may propose a US-backed framework to end the war and revive normalisation efforts during this visit. In a shift from past US policy, the Trump administration has uncoupled discussions on a Saudi nuclear agreement and normalisation with Israel, which US President Joe Biden’s administration had held as a condition for nuclear cooperation. Riyadh wants US help building a civilian nuclear programme, which Israel has raised concerns about and had wanted it tied to normalisation. Trump’s main focus will be economic partnerships as he meets with MBS and attends a Saudi-US investment forum. He wants to secure a $1 trillion Saudi investment in US industries, expanding on a $600bn pledge made by the crown prince earlier this year. Saudi Arabia is also expected to announce more than $100bn in US arms purchases, including missiles, radar systems and transport aircraft. Other key issues include reviving a scaled-down US-Saudi defence pact. In the UAE, Trump is to meet with President Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss investment opportunities in sectors such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors, energy and manufacturing. In March, the UAE announced a $1.4 trillion investment plan for those sectors in the US over the next decade. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to liftBiden-era export restrictionson advanced technology as the UAE seeks US microchips and artificial intelligence technology to support its goal of becoming a global AI leader by 2031. In Qatar, where the largest US military base in the Middle East is located, Trump’s agenda includes meetings with the emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, to discuss military cooperation and regional security. Doha, which has close ties with Syria’s new president,Ahmed al-Sharaa, may also seek Trump’s support in easing sanctions on Syria. As a key partner in regional mediation, Qatar is also expected to discuss Gaza ceasefire efforts with Trump. Trump’s decision to skip Israel during this tour comes amid heightened tensions in Gaza, where Israel’s military has intensified its operations after breaking a ceasefire on March 18. “Nothing good can come out of a visit to Israel at the moment,” a US official told the Axios news website. Since it broke the ceasefire, Israel has continued extensive air strikes on Gaza while voicing concerns over what it sees as a decline in US support. Recent reports from US and Israeli media also suggest growing tensions between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the Trump administration signals it may act independently on Middle East policy without waiting for the Israeli leader. Israeli political commentator Ori Goldberg told Al Jazeera: “At the moment, Israel is at odds with [Trump’s] overall goal, promising continuous fire. “I think the mistrust between Trump and Netanyahu has been quite extensive for some time.” In the lead-up to Trump’s visit, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE pledged significant investments in the US, signalling an interest in deepening economic ties. However, Trump’s trip also follows resistance in the region over his proposal for the US to redevelop Gaza and relocate its residents to other Arab countries. In a meeting of Arab leaders in Riyadh in February, officials from countries including Egypt, Qatar, the UAE and Kuwait rejected Trump’s plan, emphasising the need for Palestinian self-determination and regional stability.",

    "title": "Alonso to join Real Madrid after Ancelotti takes Brazil job: Reports",
    "article_text": "Former Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso is set to become the club’s next manager on a three-year deal when he leaves Bayer Leverkusen after this season, Spanish media report. Alonso, 43, is expected to replace Real boss Carlo Ancelotti, who – despite having a year remaining on his Madrid contract – has just been confirmed as the new manager of Brazil in the run-up to the 2026 World Cup, the Brazilian FA (CBF) said on Monday. Alonso, who said earlier this month that he was leaving Leverkusen after guiding them to the double last term, will join Real before the inaugural Club World Cup in the United States from June 15 to July 13, multiple media reports said. Alonso, who also played for Liverpool and Bayern Munich, last season steered Leverkusen to their first Bundesliga title, ending the Bavarians’ 11-year domination, and they also won the German Cup and German Super Cup. Ancelotti’s departure from the club come as no surprise after Real’s 4-3 defeat at Barcelona in a thrilling El Clasico on Sunday left his side on the brink of a trophy-less season. The 65-year-old Italian, who returned for a second stint at Real in June 2021, led the Spanish giants to two Champions League and La Liga doubles, the latest of which came last season. He exits Real Madrid as the most successful manager in the club’s history with a total of 15 trophies and the first coach to claim titles in Europe’s top five leagues. However, this season Real were knocked out of the Champions League in the quarterfinals by Arsenal, and allowed Barca to fight back and win 3-2 in the Copa del Rey final. Second-placed Real are seven points adrift of Barcelona, who could secure the league title on Wednesday without kicking a ball if Real fail to win at home to Mallorca. Regardless of Real’s result, a Barca victory in the city derby away to Espanyol on Thursday would clinch the title. An official announcement regarding a managerial change is expected before Real’s last game of the season at home to Real Sociedad on May 25. Ancelotti is expected to receive a fitting farewell, recognising his four highly successful years with the club.",

    "title": "Qatar and US in talks over offer of luxury plane to use as Air Force One",
    "article_text": "The United States is discussing an offer from the royal family of Qatar to supply a luxury jumbo jet for use as a presidential plane. US President Donald Trump’s administration has signalled that it plans to accept the Boeing 747-8 airliner to serve as a temporary replacement for Air Force One. The news has provoked warnings from critics that accepting the plane would be unethical. Qatar denied in a statement that the plane would be a gift, saying the transfer of the aircraft for “temporary use” was under discussion. Spokesperson Ali Al-Ansari said the offer was still under consideration by Qatar’s Ministry of Defence and the US Department of Defense and “no decision has been made”. However, in a post on his social media site Truth Social late on Sunday, Trump appeared to confirm that he intends to accept the plane as a gift. At a cost of about $400m, it would be one of the most valuable gifts ever received by the US government. “So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane,” the Republican president wrote. Democrats and good government advocates said accepting the plane as a gift would be unethical and likely unconstitutional. “Nothing says ‘America First’ like Air Force One, brought to you by Qatar,” Chuck Schumer, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, wrote on X. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt rejected such claims. “Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. President Trump’s administration is committed to full transparency,” she said. Trump toured the Qatari-owned 747-8 in February when it was parked at Palm Beach International Airport in Florida near his Mar-a-Lago resort. At the time, the White House said the president did so to get a better understanding of how the updated Air Force One planes would be configured. Al-Ansari said the proposed arrangement involves Qatar donating the luxury jet to the US government for use as Air Force One during Trump’s presidency. The aircraft would then be transferred to the Donald J Trump Presidential Library upon his departure from office, according to reports in the US media. Trump is to visit Qatar during a trip to the Gulf this week. The airplane will not be presented or accepted while Trump is in Qatar.",

The second season of the hit Prime Video show will premiere in December, and the show has already been renewed for a third,Varietyreports. The second season will “pick up in the aftermath of Season One’s epic finale and take audiences along for a journey through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas,” according to a description included inVariety. Production wrapped on the seasonlast week. There’s no word on when the third season might premiere. Hopefully the early renewal means we’ll see it sooner rather than later. The first season was excellent, and as my colleague Ash Parrish wrote, it gotthe postapocalyptic vibes exactly right. Fingers crossed that the second season keeps up the quality of the first – I’ll be clearing some time during the holiday season to watch the new episodes.

    "article_text": "Whether you want to read in the bath or scribble notes in the margin, there’s an e-reader for just about everyone. Whether you want to read in the bath or scribble notes in the margin, there’s an e-reader for just about everyone. bySheena Vasani If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. Any ebook reader will let you cram aBeauty and the Beast-sized library’s worth of books in your pocket, but so will your phone. An ebook reader offers a more book-like reading experience, with fewer distractions and less eye strain, and many include extra features, like adjustable frontlighting. Some reallyarepocketable. Others are waterproof or offer physical page-turning buttons, while a few even let you take notes. I’ve been using ebook readers for nearly a decade, and I’ve gone hands-on with dozens, from the Kindle Paperwhite to lesser-known rivals like the Pocketbook Era. Whether you want something your kid can throw against the wall or a waterproof, warm-glow Kindle that won’t ruin your spa ambiance, these are the best ebook readers for everyone. Amazon’s latest Paperwhite features a seven-inch display, quick performance, and IPX8 waterproofing. It’s cheaper than its rivals, though, while offering many of the same features. The most pocketable Kindle offers many of the Paperwhite’s best features, only for less. It includes a 300ppi display and USB-C charging, but it lacks waterproofing and adjustable color temperature. The Kobo Libra Colour matches the Paperwhite when it comes to sharpness and waterproofing while adding a color screen, physical page-turn buttons, and stylus support. Kobo’s 10.3-inch Elipsa 2E is a great e-reader loaded with intuitive note-taking features. It sports an adjustable warm light, along with handwriting-to-text conversion and the ability to solve math problems. When testing a new ebook reader, I make sure to use it as my primary device for at least a full week. For those seven days, if not longer, that e-reader is my principal way of consuming ebooks, audiobooks, and most articles from the web (if applicable). If the device has note-taking capabilities, I’ll use it to annotate books and jot down various reminders, to-do lists, and notes. I’ll even use it for some light journaling, as well as doodling.On average, I tend to read for about an hour a day — longer on weekends — either for work or to unwind at the beach, in bed, or in the bathtub. I buy books directly from each e-reader’s respective bookstore, borrow library books via Overdrive, and try to sideload various file formats to see how easy it is to do. How easy is it to use and read on? A sharp display and relatively fast performance are essential to an enjoyable reading experience, as are size and weight. Some e-readers come with different features, like waterproofing, which means you really can read anywhere. Others offer buttons that make using the e-reader more intuitive to use. There must be easy, direct access to a wide selection of digital titles, which includes audiobooks as well as various file formats. Is the price justified, given what the e-reader offers? 8 Verge Score The best-looking screen on any e-readerSlightly larger screen without a noticeably larger deviceFaster page turns, loading, and a more responsive UIA splash of color (without a color screen) Upgrades aren’t as significant as the last PaperwhiteLacks stylus support and page turn buttonsSignature Edition wireless charging is frustrating without magnetsSignature Edition back panel feels less grippy Dimensions:7 x 5 x .3 inches /Weight:211 grams /Screen area and resolution:7-inch screen, 300ppi resolution /Storage:16GB /Other features:IPX8 waterproofing, Bluetooth audio support If you mostly buy ebooks from Amazon, you’ll want a Kindle, and the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite is the best choice for most people. Starting at $159.99, it’s cheaper than the Kobo Libra Colour — my top non-Amazon ebook reader, which I’ll dive into later — while offering many of the same features. Those include a spacious 7-inch 300pi display with rich contrast levels and an adjustable warm white frontlight, which make for a clear and enjoyable reading experience. The latter also conveniently improves sleep by cutting down on blue light that interrupts melatonin production. That warm white frontlighting is an advantage over the cool white of the $109.99 base-model Kindle, and unlike the base Kindle, the Paperwhite has IPX8 water resistance. The $ 199.99Signature Edition Paperwhitealso has an auto-adjusting frontlight and no lockscreen ads. It has wireless charging, which is a rare feature to find in an e-reader. Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world, and it dominates the US ebook market, so Kindle owners have access to advantages owners of other ebook readers don’t. Much of Amazon’s hardware strategy depends on offering cut-rate discounts to pull you into its content ecosystem. If you have Prime and buy a lot of Kindle ebooks, the Paperwhite is the best choice because Amazon makes it incredibly easy to buy and read its stuff. Its ebooks and audiobooks are often on sale, and Prime members get more free content through Prime Reading. Rivals like Kobo offer sales, too, but it’s hard for them to offer discounts as steep as Amazon. There are downsides, though. The Paperwhite has lockscreen ads unless you pay $20 extra to get rid of them. It’s also too big to hold comfortably with one hand. Perhaps the Kindle Paperwhite’s biggest flaw, though — which it shares with all Kindles aside from Fire tablets — is that it’s not easy to read books purchased outside of Amazon’s store. Kindle ebook formats are proprietary and only work on Kindle. Unlike Kobo and other ebook readers, Kindles don’t support EPUB files, an open file format used by pretty much everyoneexceptAmazon. So, for example, if you often shop from Kobo’s bookstore (or Barnes & Noble or Google Play Books or many other ebook stores), you can’t easily read those books on a Kindle without using a workaround. Thereare ways to convertandtransfer file formatsso you can read on the Kindle and vice versa, but it’ll take a couple of extra steps. However, if you don’t buy your books elsewhere or you don’t mind shopping from Amazon, you’ll be more than happy with the Kindle Paperwhite. Nice color screen with sharp, 300ppi black-and-white resolutionPhysical page-turning buttonsBuilt-in stylus supportCompatible with both Overdrive and Pocket Getting books from other stores onto the device can be toughMore expensive than the Kindle PaperwhiteLacks the vibrancy of other color e-readersNo wireless charging Dimensions:5.69 x 6.34 x 0.33 inches /Weight:199.5 grams /Screen area and resolution:7-inch screen, 300ppi (black-and-white), 150ppi (color) /Storage:32GB /Other features:Physical page-turning buttons, waterproofing, Kobo Stylus 2 support, Bluetooth audio support TheKobo Libra Colouris an excellent alternative to Amazon’s ebook readers, especially for readers outside the US or anyone who doesn’t want to tap into Amazon’s ecosystem. Kobo’s latest slate offers many of the standout features found on the 12th-gen Kindle Paperwhite — including waterproofing, USB-C support, and a 300ppi display — along with a few perks that make it more helpful and enjoyable to use. The color display is the most obvious. The Libra Colour uses E Ink’s latest Kaledio color screen technology, which provides soothing, pastel-like hues that still pop in direct sunlight. It’s not as sharp as reading in monochrome — the resolution drops to 150ppi when viewing content in color — but it’s a nice touch that makes viewing a wider range of content more pleasant. Book covers and comics, while still muted, have an added layer of depth, even if the colors are nowhere near as vivid as that of a traditional LED tablet or as vibrant as theKindle Colorsoft Signature Edition. However, unlike the Kindle Colorsoft Signature Edition, the Libra Colour works with a digital pen — the Kobo Stylus 2 (sold separately) — which lets you highlight text in various colors or take notes using Kobo’s integrated notebooks. You can also take advantage of some of the more advanced capabilities found in the Kobo Elipsa 2E, allowing you to solve math equations, convert handwriting into typed text, and insert diagrams. This lets the Libra Colour function as a mini notebook of sorts, though I wouldn’t use it as a primary note-taking device since the seven-inch display can feel cramped to write on. The color display is only part of the appeal, though. The Libra Colour doesn’t have the lockscreen ads on the base Paperwhite — and packs physical page-turning buttons, which feel more intuitive to use than tapping either side of the display as you have to do on Amazon’s modern e-readers. The speedy e-reader also supports more file formats, including EPUB files, and makes it much easier to borrow books from the Overdrive library system. Native support for Pocket, meanwhile, means you can read your articles offline if you’re someone who uses the long-standing bookmarking app. However, at $229.99, the Libra Colour costs $70 more than the entry-level Paperwhite — and that’s without Kobo’s $69.99 stylus, which is required for performing certain tasks. That gap widens further when the Paperwhite is on sale, which happens more often than the Libra Colour. The Kobo can’t easily tap into Amazon’s vast library of ebooks, which can be frustrating if you’ve amassed a collection of Kindle titles over the years. It can be done, but you have to convert file formats using third-party apps, which is tricky and can take time. But if those things don’t matter or apply to you, the Kobo Libra Colour will give you the best digital reading experience of all the e-readers on our list. It’s my personal favorite. Excellent, high-resolution displayEasy to hold with one handFaster than its predecessor with improved battery lifeFun color options No waterproofingLacks adjustable color temperatureSlightly more expensive than its predecessor Dimensions:6.2 x 4.3 x 0.32 inches /Weight:158 grams /Screen area and resolution: 6-inch screen, 300ppi resolution /Storage:16GB /Other features:USB-C support, Bluetooth audio support Thebase-model Kindle($109.99 with ads) is the best cheap ebook reader. Its 300ppi resolution makes text clearer and easier to read than the lower-resolution screens on other ebook readers in its price range. Plus, it even has USB-C for relatively fast charging. Reading on its six-inch screen feels a little more cramped than it does on the larger displays of the Kindle Paperwhite and Kobo Libra Colour. However, the flip side is that its small size makes it pocketable, light, and easy for small hands to hold. Combined with its relatively affordable price, the Kindle is also the best ebook reader for kids — especially theAmazon Kindle Kids Editionwhich costs $20 more. The kid-friendly version shares the same specs but is ad-free with parental controls, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a case. It also comes with six months ofAmazon Kids Plus, which grants kids access to thousands of children’s books and audiobooks for free. After that, though, you’ll have to pay $79 per year. The base Kindle doesn’t have extra conveniences like the waterproofing you’ll find inthe entry-level Kobo Clara BWand Paperwhite. You also don’t get the physical page-turning buttons found on Barnes & Noble’s entry-level e-reader, theNook GlowLight 4e(though the Kindle is a lot snappier than the Nook). And because it’s an Amazon ebook reader, you’re also locked into the Amazon ecosystem and have to pay extra to remove ads. But if you can do without that, the Kindle delivers the essentials for under $110. Intuitive note-taking featuresGreat e-readerAdjustable warm lightUseful note-taking capabilities, including handwriting-to-text conversion Lacks native support for Kindle books227ppi display isn’t as sharp as the competitionNo note-summarization features Dimensions:7.6 x 8.94 x 0.30 inches /Weight:390 grams /Screen area and resolution: 10.3-inches, 227ppi resolution /Storage:32GB /Other features:Handwriting to text conversion, magnetic stylus, Bluetooth audio support Of all the large ebook readers I tested, the Kobo Elipsa 2E stood out the most because it’s a good e-reader with solid note-taking abilities. You can write directly on pages just as on a physical book. The Kindle Scribe lets you annotate book pages as well, but it’s complicated involving resizable text boxes that mess up the page formatting and prevent you from doing basic things like circling words. In contrast, taking notes on the Elipsa 2E feels far more intuitive and natural. The Elipsa 2E offers other helpful note-taking tools and capabilities. Like the Kobo Libra Colour, it’s capable, for example, of solving math equations for you. You can also insert diagrams and drawings, and it’ll automatically snap them into something that looks cleaner and nicer. You can also sync your notes with Dropbox or view them online and convert handwriting to typed text. The Kindle Scribe offers the latter capability, too, but again, Kobo does it faster and better within the original notebook document as opposed to on a separate page. The only thing missing from the Elipsa 2E is the Scribe’s note-summarization feature, but that’s a trade-off I am okay with given how much easier it is to take notes. Finally, the Kobo Elipsa 2E comes with twice the storage (32GB) for the same price as the base Kindle Scribe. Youcanstep up to the 32GB Kindle Scribe for $20 more or upgrade to 64GB for $40 extra. Yet given the Scribe’s limitations, I still recommend saving the money and buying the Kobo Elipsa 2E instead. Note-taking capabilities aside, the Kobo Elipsa 2E is also a good e-reader with the same strengths and weaknesses as other Kobo devices. There’s support for a wide range of file formats, but you can’t easily read Kindle books without converting them first. Its 227ppi display is also slightly less sharp than the 300ppi screen found on the Kindle Scribe and the Kobo Libra Colour. However, the 10.3-inch screen balances things out a bit and makes text easier to read, so it’s not a noticeable drawback. Plus, the Elipsa 2E comes with an adjustable warm light for nighttime reading. That’s a feature rivals with more advanced note-taking capabilities — like the $379.99 OnyxBoox Go 10.3which lets you do everything the Scribe does and more, like insert links to notes — lacks. There are some other ebook readers my colleagues and I have tested that I didn’t feature above but are still worth highlighting. Here are the most notable: TheKindle Colorsoft Signature Editionis the first Kindle to feature E Ink’s color screen technology and it stands out from other color e-paper devices with customizations. It offers improved contrast, more vibrant colors, and faster screen refreshes. With a $279.99 price tag, it’s the most expensive Kindle model currently available that doesn’t support a stylus for note-taking, and it includes premium features like wireless charging that are convenient but not really necessary for a device with months of battery life. Amazon doesn’t offer a cheaper version of the Colorsoft like it does with the Paperwhite, which is available in standard and Signature Edition versions, but if you want a color screen and want to stick with Amazon, the Colorsoft is your best option.- Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter If you’re looking for a non-Amazon alternative that’s more affordable than the Kobo Libra Colour, theKobo Clara Colour— the successor to theKobo Clara 2E— is worth a look. At $159.99, the ad-free e-reader costs more than theKobo Clara 2E, but I think it’s worth the extra $10. It continues to offer the same six-inch display and IPX8 waterproof design, but the e-reader now offers color. Plus, it’s noticeably faster — something I was happy to see, considering the occasional lag on the Clara 2E sometimes got on my nerves. You don’t get the Clara Colour’s physical buttons or stylus support, but that’s a fair tradeoff at this price point. Despite all the advantages of E Ink display technology, your smartphone is probably still a more convenient device for reading given how pocket-friendly it is. TheBoox Palma 2is a smartphone-sized E Ink device that’s just as easy to slip into a pocket, but with more capabilities than an e-reader. Its 6.3-inch E Ink display is great for reading books, but the $279.99 Palma 2 also runs Android 13 so you can install productivity apps like email and messaging — assuming you’ve got access to Wi-Fi, of course, because the compact e-reader lacks cellular connectivity. If you already have the original Palma, the sequel isn’t worth the upgrade. But if you’re looking for a smaller alternative to Kindles and Kobos, the Palma 2 could be worth the splurge.- Andrew Liszewski, Senior Reporter The $379 Onyx Boox Go 10.3 is another ad-free ebook reader you can use to take notes. It’s excellent as a note-taking device, and it offers an impressively wide range of writing tools and more prebuilt notebook templates than Kobo’s Elipsa 2E. Jotting down notes using the built-in notebook felt more akin to writing on paper as well, and its slim design makes the device feel more like a traditional notebook. Like all Boox devices, it also provides quick access to the Google Play Store, so you can download multiple reading apps — including both Kindle and Kobo apps. The slate’s crisp 300ppi display is sharper than that of the Kobo Elipsa 2E, too, which is a plus. However, in comparison to the easy-to-use Elipsa 2E, the Go 10.3 lacks a front light and comes with a steeper learning curve. Notes you take on a Kindle or Kobo device won’t transfer over (and vice versa), and you can’t annotate books in either app using the Boox. I also felt like access to Google Play can be a double-edged sword as it grants easy access to distracting apps, including games, streaming services, and TikTok. It’s too slow to use the latter, but it’s fast and comfortable enough that I found myself playing around with the Word Search app far too often. For me personally, I need my e-reader to be devoid of such distractions — it’s one of the biggest things that distinguishes it from a tablet, after all. But if you’ve got more self-control than I do, the Go 10.3 could be worth a look. In 2023, Barnes and Noble released the newNook Glowlight 4 Plus. If you own a lot of digital books from Barnes and Noble, this could be a good Kindle alternative. Otherwise, I’d still recommend the Kobo Libra Colour to everybody else. The$199.99 Nook Glowlight 4 Plusis a good e-reader with a lot to offer, including a lovely 300ppi screen, waterproofing, physical page-turning buttons, and even a headphone jack. However, it’s just not as snappy, which makes setting it up, buying books from the device itself, and navigating the interface a slow ordeal. It didn’t help that the screen sometimes froze, too, which meant I had to restart the device while in the middle of a book.

    "article_text": "﻿The app is getting a big change to try and encourage you to keep learning. ﻿The app is getting a big change to try and encourage you to keep learning. byJay Peters Duolingo is making a big change: it’s moving on from hearts in favor of a new “energy” mechanic. The idea is to switch from a system that punishes mistakes to one that’s intended to feel more motivating — and a bit more gamified. Under the old system, you’d lose a heart if you made a mistake while doing a lesson. To earn hearts back, you could do things like watch an ad, pay for a full refill using Duolingo’s Gems currency, or just wait for the hearts to refresh. Under the new system, you’ll spend one unit of energy to complete an exercise, and a mistake will cost one energy. But you’ll also get extra energy back at a randomized rate for completing multiple lessons right in a row. As a result, users should be able to do more lessons, and that’s what’s showing up in the data, Moses Wayne, a senior staff engineer at Duolingo, tellsThe Verge. “We feel like this is a way that we can motivate you to focus on things you’re getting right rather than penalizing for the things that you’re making mistakes on,” Wayne says. He also says that “we wanted to find a way to gamify the experience a little more.” A full energy bar is 25 units of energy (versus five hearts). Energy regenerates over time, like hearts do, Wayne says. You can also buy more energy with Gems, and subscribers to Super Duolingo and Duolingo Max will have unlimited energy, similar to how subscribers of those tiers have unlimited hearts, according to Duolingo spokesperson Monica Earle. Wayne points out that, under the hearts system, you could fail out of your first lesson of the day. “In an energy world, that’s really not going to happen because we’re not penalizing you for mistakes anymore,” Wayne says. Duolingo’s aggregate metrics show that, in general, people are able to engage “a lot more” with Duolingo now than before. The change is rolling out first on iOS over the next weeks and months, and the aim is to bring it to Android later this year. If you happen to play Duolingo across iOS and Android right now, your Android app will stick with hearts, while the iOS app will stick with energy; they won’t sync, Wayne says. Duolingo’s CEO recently announced that the company isgoing to be “AI-first,”and it just doubled its language coursesthanks to AI.

    "title": "Trump administration announces &#8216;illegal&#8217; rollback of energy and water efficiency standards",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration is attempting to wipe decades of efficiency standards off the books. The Trump administration is attempting to wipe decades of efficiency standards off the books. byJustine Calma The US Energy Department says it’s rolling back long-standing efficiency standards for appliances, which advocates are calling a clear violation of the law. Continuing the Trump administration’s assault on federal water and energy efficiency programs, the department announced today what it’s calling its“largest deregulatory effort in history.” The agency is trying torollback 47 regulationsit says are “burdensome and costly,” including more than a dozen efficiency standards for appliances and battery chargers. The proposed rules target the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), which contains ananti-backsliding provision— and that the Trump administration is seemingly trying to bypass. “If this attack on consumers succeeds, President Trump would be raising costs dramatically for families as manufacturers dump energy- and water-wasting products into the market. Fortunately, it’s patently illegal, so hold your horses,” Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said in a pressstatementreleased today. ”Fortunately, it’s patently illegal, so hold your horses.” The Energy Department didn’t immediately respond to a press inquiry fromThe Vergeasking why it believes its proposals do not violate EPCA, which passed Congress in 1975 and had the anti-backsliding provision added in 1987. However, drafts of proposed ruleson the Federal Register’s websitesay that it wants to return standards to previous limits set by Congress. In some cases, doing so could eliminate decades of energy and water saving standards, deLaski tellsThe Verge. Aproposed rule for commercial clothes washers, for instance, would bring water conservation standards back to a “statutory baseline” set in 2007. Other rules target microwave ovens, conventional ovens, dish washers, faucets, portable air conditioners, and more. The law’s anti-backsliding provisionstipulatesthat the energy secretary can’t amend a standard in a way that“increases the maximum allowable energy use” or “decreases the minimum required energy efficiency”of a covered product. In other words, the agency can’t issue rules that are weaker than they were before. In many cases, the Energy Department has updated standards initially set by Congress as more efficient technologies became available — which it’s required to do by law if it is “economically justified.” The rules proposed today attempt to go back to limits set by Congress years ago, undoing tougher standards set more recently. The Energy Department is also attempting to get rid of standards altogether in cases where limits weren’t explicitly set in law by Congress. In the proposed rule for commercial clothes washers, the agency argues that the anti-backsliding provision applies to energy efficiency but notwaterstandards. “Water use has nothing to do with the energy consumed by a clothes washer. Therefore, the anti-backsliding provision does not apply,”it says. The agency still needs to open up its rules for public comment before attempting to finalize them, and is likely to face legal challenges. Courts have previously weighed in on the strength of the anti-backsliding provision. A 2004decisionfrom a federal appeals court says EPCA “unambiguously” constrains the Energy Department’s ability to weaken efficiency standards once they are published as final rules in the Federal Register. “We’re seeing the wholesale abandonment of a dozen-plus energy efficiency standards without any justification, and that absolutely violates the anti-backsliding provision,” says Kit Kennedy, who was one of the attorneys in the 2004 case and is currently a managing director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. The move follows a presidential memorandumTrump signed on Fridaythat takes aim at water use rules and related energy efficiency standards, as well as news that the Environmental Protection Agency plans towind down the Energy Star program. Experts warn that the proposed rules could lead to higher utility bills for consumers. While a program like Energy Star can help people choose more efficient appliances, standards the Trump administration is now targeting are supposed to ensure that more efficient technologies are accessible to anyone regardless of what they can afford to purchase. Appliance energy efficiency standards have been a great success. They save households on their electricity bills every month,” Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University says in an email toThe Verge. “Refrigerators are just as cold and just as large as they ever were but they are now much cheaper to run.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

The battery management tool will reportedly optimize your iPhone’s power consumption based on how you use your device. The new feature will use “battery data it has collected from users’ devices to understand trends and make predictions for when it should lower the power draw of certain applications or features,”Bloombergreports. Google launched itsmachine learning-powered Adaptive Battery on Android in 2018, and says it analyzes your phone usage patterns to determine which apps it should restrict from operating in the background, and which ones it should prioritize. The Android settings can control how apps are allowed to operate in the background, in order to check for updated data and notifications. iOS 19 will also reportedly include an indicator on the lock screen that shows how long it will take to fully charge your phone. As reported byBloomberg, Apple is mainly launching AI battery management forthe upcoming iPhone 17, which is rumored to be the company’s slimmest phone yet. Its thin design means it will have a smaller battery, making battery conservation more important. The AI battery tool will be available to all iPhones with iOS 19 – not just the iPhone 17,Bloombergreports. iOS 19 is also rumored to comewith a broader redesign.

    "article_text": "Philips Fixables wants to make it easier for consumers to keep their devices running.﻿ Philips Fixables wants to make it easier for consumers to keep their devices running.﻿ byAndrew Liszewski Philips has announced a new initiative that will let consumers 3D print their own replacements for small but essential parts included with many of its personal health products.Philips Fixablesis launching in the Czech Republic, where Prusa Research, the company’s partner for the initiative, is based. But the actual files that can be downloaded and 3D printed are being freelyshared through the Printables platform, which is accessible globally. You still can’t 3D print yourself a new beard trimmer if it breaks or the battery dies, but for accessories like a cutting guide, Philips Fixables will give some consumers an alternative to trying to find a replacement locally or have one shipped out. Being able to immediately fix your trimmer may also make it less appealing to throw away and replace a perfectly good device. Philips says it’s working with Prusa Research to ensure the 3D printed replacement parts it designs and releases meet the company’s standards for quality and safety. But it also points out that the durability and functionality of the replacements will depend on users sticking to the 3D printing material and guidelines the company recommends. There’s currently just one replacement part available from Philips on Printables: a small adjustable comb designed to attach to its OneBlade trimmer. The company recommends the use of standard PLA filament and advises users to print the part using the same orientation it has in the original file, which doesn’t require the use of any added supports. Modifying the file to reduce the amount of filament it needs or decrease print times could compromise its durability. It’s a welcome initiative, but one that’s only going to result in meaningful improvements to sustainability if the company follows through and releases more than just a single accessory. Philips is teasing additional 3D printable parts, including adjustable guides for beard trimmers and components for devices like electric toothbrushes and hair dryers, but doesn’t specify when they’ll be available. It also provides a form where consumers can specifically request a 3D printable alternative to a specific part, but it doesn’t guarantee one will be created, or specify how long it will take for one to be released after undergoing quality control testing.

Whether you want a battery that lasts for days or the best deal, we’ve got some recs for your next iPhone. byAllison Johnson If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission.See our ethics statement. The wait is over — kind of. Apple’s iPhone 16 series is out, including thekindaaffordable 16E, and its much-hyped Apple Intelligence has arrived courtesy of iOS 18.1. But if you’re expecting a new kind of iPhone experience, well, I have some bad news for you. TheAI features introduced in iOS 18.1andmorerecentupdates,including the writing tools and ChatGPT integration, are standard fare at this point. And although Siri has a new coat of paint, it’s basically the same old Siri. Apple has promised much more, but the Apple Intelligence rollout is going to be a slow burn that lasts well into 2025. This is all to say that if you don’t have any complaints about how your current phone is working, you definitely shouldn’t rush out and get a new one just for Apple Intelligence. There’s no shortcut to properly testing a phone; I put my personal SIM card (physical or otherwise) in each phone I review and live with it for a minimum of one full week. I set up each phone from scratch, load it up with my apps, and go about living my life — stress testing the battery, using GPS navigation on my bike while streaming radio, taking rapid-fire portrait mode photos of my kid — everything I can throw at it. Starting over with a new phone every week either sounds like a dream or your personal hell, depending on how Into Phones you are. For me, switching has become so routine that it’s mostly painless. The most expensive, souped-up iPhone isn’t automatically the best one for everyone. What I look for is a happy medium — features that will satisfy most people at the best price. Sometimes, that’s last year’s model. Battery performance can vary by a significant margin between current iPhone models, mostly down to the size of the phone. Everyone wants a phone that can last a full day, and these recommendations reflect that. One size does not fit all. Some people like a small phone, others want the biggest screen money can buy. This list includes iPhones for people in both camps. That’s actually the gist of our phone buying philosophy: hang on to the one you’ve got. If you’re not the type of person to get excited about a new camera button, updated photo processing options, or incremental performance upgrades, then there’s no reason to run out and buy an iPhone 16. But if you’re questioning whether it’s the year to replace your iPhone 11 or 12 (or you’re concerned about a price increase as a result of thecurrent tariff situation), then I think the answer is an easy yes. There are real gains this time around, especially in the basic iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, without even considering AI. And if Apple Intelligence turns out to be something special eventually, well, you’ll be ready for it. 8 Verge Score Reliable camera with versatile photographic stylesHandy new Action ButtonMore RAM and a current-gen chipset Standard refresh rate screenCamera Control is a mixed bag Screen:6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 OLED, 60Hz refresh rate /Processor:A18Cameras:48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:Not advertised /Charging:27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 Apple’s basic iPhone enjoyed a significant hardware boost this time around, playing an overdue game of catch-up to the Pro series. The iPhone 16 includes the Action Button from last year’s Pro models — handy if there’s an app in your life you want to access at the touch of a button — and the new Camera Control. So if buttons are anything to go by, this phone istwo betterthan the last-gen model. There’s more going on under the hood, too. The A18 chipset is in the same generation as the processor on the Pro models, which hasn’t been the case for the past couple of years. That bodes well for the 16 series staying on the same update schedule. And there’s extra RAM in this year’s base model, which can only be a good thing. The iPhone 16 became a much more interesting camera this time around, too. The Camera Control offers a quick way to launch the camera app and adjust settings like exposure compensation. But there’s also a new set of Photographic Style filters this time around, with options to adjust contrast, brightness, and undertones to dial in your preferred rendering of skin tones. You’ll get better low-light performance by stepping up to the 16 Pro models, and other cool tricks like 4K recording at 120 fps. But even without all that, it’s the most customizable camera Apple has offered yet. Outside of camera performance, there are two major drawbacks to picking the regular 16 over a Pro model: no zoom lens, and no ProMotion screen. Only the Pro has a dedicated 5x lens, which is handy for creative framing. And the standard 60Hz screen on the iPhone 16 will likely only bother you if you’re used to a smoother 120Hz display, though it’s annoying on principle that Apple keeps this feature to its Pro phones when virtually every other high-end phone has one. 8 Verge Score New tone control in camera lets you dial back HDR processingWho doesn’t love a physical shutter button?Your video director friends will spend hours gleefully taking 4K120 video portraits of people at street festivals Camera Control button is a little fiddlyDefault photo processing is more aggressive than everThe most incremental of incremental upgrades over the iPhone 15 Pro Screen:6.3-inch, 2622 x 1206 OLED, 120Hz refresh rate /Processor:A18 ProCameras:48-megapixel f/1.8 with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel 5x telephoto with OIS; 48-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:Not advertised /Charging:27W wired, 25W MagSafe wireless, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 The iPhone 16 Pro gets a small but meaningful upgrade this time around: a bump up to a 5x zoom, which on the 15 series was reserved for the Pro Max. And while the change from a 3x to 5x zoom doesn’t look that impressive on paper, it goes a long way to making the smaller 16 Pro feel like an equal to the 16 Pro Max. For once, you don’t need to get the biggest phone to get the best phone. The 16 Pro is roughly the same size as the 15 Pro, but it has a bigger screen: 6.3 inches, up from 6.1 inches. There’s also the new Camera Control, an upgraded 48-megapixel ultrawide on board, and naturally, a new chipset that — naturally — supports Apple Intelligence. There’s nothing here that makes the 16 Pro an absolute must-upgrade. Still, plenty of people will want the latest device with all the bells and whistles, and the 16 Pro represents an opportunity to get all of those features without having to buy the biggest phone. 8 Verge Score Reliable camera with versatile photographic stylesHandy new action buttonMore RAM and a current-gen chipsetBig screen for big screen fans Standard refresh rate screenCamera control is a mixed bag Screen:6.7-inch Super Retina OLED /Processor:A18Cameras:48-megapixel f/1.6 main with sensor-shift IS; 12-megapixel ultrawide; 12-megapixel selfie /Battery:Not advertised /Charging:27W wired, 25W wireless MagSafe, 15W Qi2, 7.5W Qi /Weather-resistance rating:IP68 The thing about a big phone is that it has a big battery. And while that’s easy enough to understand, it still feels surprising how much more performance you can eke out of the iPhone 16 Plus’ battery. It’ll stretch well into a second day of use, and even if you’re conditioned to charge your phone every night, you’ll be amazed at how much you have left in the tank at the end of each day. It’s a solid antidote to battery anxiety. Naturally, the 16 Plus’ big-ness comes with another bonus: a bigger screen. The benefits are obvious here, too. But something that stands out to me when I use the phone is just how light it feels for its size, especially if you’re comparing it to the 16 Pro Max. If you like a big display but don’t need all of the weight of the Max — metaphorically and physically speaking — then the Plus is the way to go. 7 Verge Score Reliable performanceGood, if limited, camera systemIt’s the cheapest new iPhone you can buy No MagSafe$599 feels like $100 too muchNo ultrawide Screen:6.1-inch Super Retina XDR /Processor:A18Cameras:48MP Fusionwith 1x and 2x optical zoom, 12-megapixel selfie/Battery:Not advertised /Charging:20-watt wired,7.5W Qi, no MagSafe/Weather-resistance rating:IP68 This recommendation comes with a heavy sigh. Yes, the 16E is the cheapest new iPhone Apple sells. Yes, it’s a good phone. It has a capable camera, reliable performance, full water resistance, wireless charging, and will be supported with software updates for years to come. But its $599 price tag starts to feel like too much when you consider what it’s missing. There’s no MagSafe, which you can kind of add by way of a MagSafe case, but it’s a bummer not to have it built in when it has basically become a standard iPhone feature. There’s no ultrawide camera, no Dynamic Island housing timely information, no camera control (not a huge loss, honestly), and no Ultra Wideband for precise object tracking. It does support Apple Intelligence, but that doesn’t feel like much of a consolation, given that it’s very much a work in progress. The 16E will most likely receive more years of software support than a previous-gen model like the iPhone 14 or 15. And sure, Apple Intelligence might turn into something useful someday. The 16E is a good choice if you want the path of least resistance to blue bubbles and FaceTime at your fingertips. But if you’d like MagSafe, a more advanced camera, and some of the other bells and whistles that got lost on the way to the 16E, then it’s not a bad idea to look at one of the older iPhones. Apple still sellsthe iPhone 15new, cutting the price down to $699 with the introduction of the 16 series. There’s a strong argument for buying a 15 rather than the 16E if you don’t care about Apple Intelligence; the 15 Pro runs Apple Intelligence while the regular 15 doesn’t. Compared to the 16E, the iPhone 15 includes MagSafe, the Dynamic Island, an ultra wideband chip for precise item tracking, and an ultrawide camera.

    "title": "Here's what to know about the GOP's proposed Medicaid work requirements",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 12, 2025 / 5:15 PM EDT/ CBS News A massive change could soon be in the works for the 71 million Americans on Medicaid, with House Republicans unveilingnew legislationon Sunday that would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage. The proposal is part of an effort by House Republicans to find $880 billion in savings over the next decade to help pay for President Trump's tax bill, which will extend his2017 tax cutswhile introducing some new reductions, like eliminating taxes on tips. Because President Trump has vowed not to touch Medicare — the health insurance program for people 65 and older — Republican lawmakers have turned their sights to Medicaid, which provides health coverage for low- and middle-income households. GOP lawmakers contend that Medicaid should be scrutinized because it's prone to financial waste, and that, by doing so, the program will be better able to serve the people who need it. \"Medicaid is hugely problematic because it has a lot of fraud, waste and abuse,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana,saidin February. Rooting out waste \"preserves the programs, so it is available for those who desperately need it.\" Some policy experts and Democrats in Congress warn that slashing Medicaid would hurt many vulnerable Americans, with millions likely to lose coverage if the bill passes, while also posing a financial risk to some hospitals that rely on the program. \"[Nowhere] in the bill are they cutting 'waste, fraud, and abuse' — they're cutting people's health care and using that money to give tax breaks to billionaires,\" said Rep. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees health care spending, in a May 12statementabout the new bill. The House Republican bill could change considerably as it moves through the legislative process. More than a dozen House Republicans have told Johnson and GOP leaders they will not support cuts to the health care safety net programs that their constituents depend on. Under the House bill, many Medicaid recipients would be subject to something the measure calls a \"community engagement requirement.\" That provision would mandate that people who are enrolled in the program either work, participate in volunteer work or be enrolled in an educational program for at least 80 hours a month. Medicaid recipients also would have to verify their community engagement eligibility twice a year. The bill also adds a more rigorous income verification process for those who enroll in the Affordable Care Act's health care coverage. If the bill is passed, the requirements would take effect Jan. 1, 2029. Republicans have previously sought to tie receiving government benefits to work requirements, with one GOP lawmaker in 2023 seeking totighten these rulesfor the food-stamp program because he said believed that \"work is the best pathway out of poverty.\" Some policy experts who study Medicaid, food stamps and other social safety net programs say that there's little evidence that work requirements increase employment, partly because most people who receive such aid and who are able to work are already doing so. About 92% of people under 65 years old who aren't receiving disability benefits were working full- or part-time in 2023, or else unable to work because of duties such as attending school or caregiving obligations, according to a recentanalysisfrom heath publication KFF. The remaining 8% were either retired, couldn't find work or weren't working for another reasons. Two states — Georgia and Arkansas — have added work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped the mandate after a courtstruck it downin 2019, a year after it was implemented. A 2020 analysis of Arkansas' work requirements found that 18,000 adultslost coverageafter the policy went into effect, with more than half of those reporting that they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 saying they delayed taking medications because of cost. The requirements didn't boost employment, the study, by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, also found. Georgia maintains a work requirement for a Medicaid expansion program called Pathways to Coverage, which provides insurance to some low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify for coverage. But that program hasfallen shortof enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative hurdles involved in verifying employment as well as technical glitches, according to a Pro Publica report. \"[W]ork requirements are the worst sort of red tape — blocking health coverage for working people, people with serious health conditions and people with disabilities,\" said Laura Harker, a senior policy analyst at the Center on Budget and Public Policies, a public policy think tank, in a Decemberpostabout Georgia's program. An April 2025estimatefrom the Urban Institute finds that as many as 5.2 million people ages 19- to 55-years-old could lose coverage if federal work requirements go into effect for Medicaid. Some Medicaid recipients who make more than 100% of the federal poverty level — about $32,000 a year for a family of four — would be required under the House GOP bill to pay out-of-pocket costs for some services. Those fees, which would not apply to emergency room visits, prenatal care, pediatric visits or primary care check-ups, would be limited to $35 per visit. And applicants could not qualify for Medicaid if they have a home that is valued at more than $1 million. The proposed bill also targets any immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally or without documentation. It reduces by 10% the share the federal government pays to states that allow those immigrants to sign up for Medicaid, such as California or New York. To qualify for Affordable Care Act coverage, enrollees would have to prove they are \"lawfully present.\" The Associated  Presscontributed to this report.

    "title": "8 U.S. cities where you must earn at least $100,000 to live comfortably",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 12, 2025 / 5:07 PM EDT/ CBS News With home prices near a recordhighand mortgage rates remaining elevated, renting a place to live around the U.S. is today considered abetter alternativeto buying. But here's the catch: Rents are surging, too. Zillowcalculatesthat renters need at least $80,000 in annual income to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental — up from $60,000 in 2020. And if you want to live in a larger urban area, apartment hunters now need to earn $100,000 or more to live in Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco and San Jose, while even modestly sized Riverside, California, requires six figures for people to keep their heads above water, according to the real estate firm. \"Today renters need to make six figures to afford the typical rental in eight major metropolitan areas —twice as many as before the pandemic,\" said Kara Ng, senior economist at Zillow. \"That means renters have less money in their budgets for essentials like groceries and transportation, or for saving for a down payment.\" The typical guidance is to spend no more than 30% of your income on rent. To put that in perspective, that's $2,500 a month for someone making $100,000. To stay below the 30% threshold, renters in the eight cities listed by Zillow need to make at least six figures. \"This Zillow data backs up what every renter has been feeling when they've been looking for an apartment or trying to renew their lease,\" said Rachel Fee, executive director of the New York Housing Conference, a nonprofit that advocates for affordable housing. \"Not just in New York City, but across the country, the cost of housing is skyrocketing and they just can't keep up.\" Here's a look at where around the country you need to earn six figures to afford the rent — plus cities where you might be able to get away with a lower salary. It's no surprise that New York City tops Zillow's list. The Big Apple has in many ways has come to represent the home affordability crisis. According to the Zillow analysis, New York City dwellers need annual income of roughly $135,000 to be able to comfortably afford rent. That's nearly double the average income for a New York City renter, Fee said. The average rent in New York City is $2,950, 59% higher than the national average, according to Zillowdata. The city is doingaway with broker feesstarting this summer, which could give renters a bit more wiggle room when it comes to their apartment search. The second-priciest city is Boston, where renters need to earn $127,000 a year to comfortably afford rent, according to Zillow. Renters in search of more affordable metro areas can look to cities like Buffalo, New York, and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In those cities, renters need to earn less than half of what they would to live in New York and Boston – or around $55,000. Zillow's data drives home how much rents have risen in recent years. Since April 2020, monthly rent for a typical U.S. apartment has increased almost 30% to $1,858. At the same time, wage growth over that period has lagged, with median annual income rising 22.5% to roughly $82,000, according to theCensus Bureau. At the center of the problem is the nation's inadequate housing supply. Even withhundreds of thousands of apartmentsbeing constructed each year, it's not enough to keep up with demand. \"We've seen so much pressure since the pandemic and competition for housing,\" Fee said. \"And the inventory just isn't there because, again, we're not building enough as a nation.\" Fee added that to increase the supply of affordable housing and overall inventory, Congress needs to take action by expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, whichsubsidizes affordable housing. \"Renters across the country are looking to Washington for relief, and Congress has yet to take any meaningful action to increase affordable housing supply,\" she told CBS MoneyWatch.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 12, 2025 / 3:50 PM EDT/ CBS/AP As a Biden administration ban on so-called \"junk fees\" took effect Monday, Ticketmaster said it will start displaying the full price of a ticket as soon as consumers begin shopping. Ticketmaster, long a subject of complaints about its hidden fees, was among those targeted by the new rule, which was announced in December by the Federal Trade Commission. The rule requires ticket sellers, hotels, vacation rental platforms and others to disclose processing fees, cleaning fees and other charges up front. Ticketmaster said Monday it commended the FTC's action. \"Ticketmaster has long advocated for all-in pricing to become the nationwide standard so fans can easily compare prices across all ticketing sites,\" Ticketmaster Chief Operating Officer Michael Wichser said in a statement. Ticketmaster said it will also tell shoppers where they are in line when they log in to buy tickets to an event. It will also give real-time updates to customers whose wait times exceed 30 minutes, letting them know ticket price ranges, availability and whether new event dates have been added. Ticketmaster, which is owned by Beverly Hills, California-based concert promoter Live Nation, is the world's largest ticket seller, processing 500 million tickets each year in more than 30 countries. Around 70% of tickets for major concert venues in the U.S. are sold through Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster said Monday's changes will bring North America in line with the rest of the world, where the full ticket price was already displayed as soon as customers started shopping. The company also says it plans to step up its fight againstticket bots, or automated software used by resellers to bulk-buy mass quantities of tickets. Complaints about these systems came to a head during the November 2022 presale toTaylor Swift's Eras tour, when its site crashed during a presale event for Taylor Swift's upcoming stadium tour. The company at the time said its site was overwhelmed by both fans and attacks from bots, which were posing as consumers in order to scoop up tickets and sell them on secondary sites. Thousands of people lost tickets after waiting for hours in an online queue. \"We now block an average of 200 million bot attempts every day, stopping them from stealing tickets meant for real fans,\" Ticketmaster said in a statement. \"In 2024 alone, we blocked over 53 billion bot attacks, a more than 5x increase from 2019.\" Last year, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Ticketmaster and Live Nation, accusing them of running an illegal monopoly that drives up U.S. ticket prices and asking a court to break them up.That case is ongoing. President Donald Trump is also eyeing the industry. In March, he signed an executive order that he said will help curb ticket scalping and bring \"commonsense\" changes to the way live events are priced. Under the order, the FTC must ensure \"price transparency at all stages of the ticket-purchase process\" and take enforcement to prevent unfair, deceptive, and anti-competitive conduct. \"Anyone who's bought a concert ticket in the last decade, maybe 20 years — no matter what your politics are — knows that it's a conundrum,\" said Kid Rock, who joined Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump signed the order. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News May 12, 2025 / 2:25 PM EDT/ CBS/AP Jupiter's dazzling auroras are hundreds of times brighter than those seen on Earth, new images from theJames Webb Space Telescopereveal. The solar system's largest planet displays striking dancing lights when high-energy particles from space collide with atoms of gas in the atmosphere near its magnetic poles, similar to how the northern lights are triggered on Earth. But Jupiter's version has much greater intensity, according to an international team of scientists who analyzed the photos from Webb taken on Christmas in 2023. Jonathan Nichols, from the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, led the team. In astatementshared with NASA, he said their findings blew him away. \"We wanted to see how quickly the auroras change, expecting them to fade in and out ponderously, perhaps over a quarter of an hour or so,\" said Nichols. \"Instead, we observed the whole auroral region fizzing and popping with light, sometimes varying by the second.\" Learning more about the variability Nichols' team observed will help scientists better understand how Jupiter's atmosphere works, according to NASA. Webb's images of Jupiter may have also opened doors to new questions about the universe. When compared to images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, which uses different wavelengths of light to capture them, scientists discovered that certain bright spots seen in Webb's images did not appear in Hubble's counterparts. \"This has left us scratching our heads,\" Nichols told NASA. \"In order to cause the combination of brightness seen by both Webb and Hubble, we need to have a combination of high quantities of very low-energy particles hitting the atmosphere, which was previously thought to be impossible. We still don't understand how this happens.\" Webb previously captured Neptune's glowing auroras in the best detail yet, many decades after they were first faintly detected during a flyby of the Voyager 2 spacecraft. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

There are 69 migrants currently being housed at Guantanamo Bay, according to a Defense official. Forty-three of the migrants are considered low risk and 26 migrants are considered high threat. The $21 million figure was firstreportedby NBC News. In January, PresidentTrump directedhis administration to use the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as a holding site for migrants, where he said the highest priority, \"worst\" offenders would be held as part of his aggressive crackdown on immigration. Since then, limited details about the flights have been available — including the costs. In February, the administrationtransferredVenezuelan migrants to the facility, before they were taken to Honduras. And the administration has intermittently brought migrants to the base before transferring them elsewhere in the proceeding months. The data, which came in response to questions from Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the Pentagon outlined that U.S. Transportation Command has flown a total of 46 flights on military aircraft \"in support of migrant deportation flights\" to Guantanamo Bay between Jan. 20 and April 8, with a total of 802 hours and an average cost of $26,277 per flight hour, adding up to more than $21 million. \"Every American should be outraged by Donald Trump wasting military resources to pay for his political stunts that do not make us safer,\" Warren said in a statement. \"U.S. servicemembers did not sign up for this abuse of power.\" CBS News previouslyreportedthat the Trump administration has transferred both detainees considered to be \"high-threat\" and \"low-risk\" to Guantanamo, and agovernment memoshows the Trump administration created broad rules outlining which migrants can be held at Guantanamo Bay, allowing officials to send non-criminal detainees there.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  May 12, 2025 / 12:39 PM EDT/ CBS News Those who take tirzepatide, the drug sold asZepbound and Mounjaro, could lose more weight than those who take semaglutide, known asOzempicandWegovy, according to new research. A study, published Sunday in theNew England Journal of Medicine, found tirzepatide users lost about 20% of their body weight, whereas those on semaglutide  lost about 14% over a 72-week period. \"That translates to about a difference of eight pounds on average between the two drugs,\" Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News,said on \"CBS Mornings\" Monday. Notably, the study wasfunded by Lilly, the maker of tirzepatide. \"So you always need to take that with a grain of salt,\" Gounder said, adding later on \"CBS Mornings Plus\" that the research \"does look legit, and we have seen hints of this in other studies.\" In an emailed statement to CBS News Monday, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk, the maker of Wegovy and Ozempic, said both Wegovy and Zepbound have demonstrated clinically significant weight reduction in clinical trial programs. The statement also said, in part, that \"robust data\" supporting Wegovy's \"meaningful and unique benefits continue to grow\" and that in addition to \"offering significant and sustained weight loss,\" Wegovy is \"the only obesity medicine approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with overweight or obesity and known heart disease backed by real-world evidence.\" Gounder also said the drugs aren't just about weight loss, and pointed to additional health benefits. \"We're seeing people's blood pressure come down, their diabetes numbers, their blood sugars improve, their cholesterol numbers improve,\" she said. \"So this is not just the weight loss, it's also health indicators.\" The price of these drugs, however, remains high. On average, they can cost over $1,000 out of pocket. If ordered through the drugmakers directly, you may be able to pay less than $500 out of pocket. Overall, only one in fourinsurance companiescover these medications, Gounder said. \"Big picture, there's still a lot that needs to be done on insurance coverage,\" she said. \"There was a proposal under Biden to expand coverage tothese drugs under Medicare, the Trump administration pulled back on that, and a lot of, as I said, private insurance companies still don't cover these medications for obesity.\" Sara Moniuszko is a health and lifestyle reporter at CBSNews.com.

The U.S. reduced its levies on Chinese imports to 30% from as high as 145%, while China cut its tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement followed a meeting in Switzerland this weekend involving U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Administrator Jamieson Greer and Chinese negotiators. S&P 500 futures were up 179 points, or 3.2%, as of 7:15 a.m. EST, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures soared more than 1,000 points, or 2.5%, and Nasdaq Composite futures jumped 822 points, or 4%. \"While the lower tariffs are technically only in place for 90 days, and 30% is still quite large on an absolute basis, the news is clearly an upside positive surprise,\" equities analyst Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, told investors in a research note. Bessent said the temporary reductions would effectively reduce the level of U.S. tariffs still in place on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China was reducing its levies on American imports to 10%. Global stock markets also rose on news of the U.S. and China de-escalating the trade conflict, if only temporarily.

    "title": "House Republicans unveil sweeping tax plan but have yet to resolve key fight over SALT",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — House Republicans on Monday unveiled the legislative text of their sweeping tax proposal for the massive bill for President Donald Trump's agenda, but a key divide within the conference remains: how much to lift the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., convened a video call Monday morning with members of both the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee and the SALT Caucus, a group of blue-state Republicans who have been fighting to raise the SALT cap much higher than the current level of $10,000. While several proposals were discussed, GOP lawmakers were unable to agree on a number. During an all-member GOP conference call in the afternoon, Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, told colleagues that the final SALT number was still a work in progress, according to two lawmakers on the call. The legislative text currently calls for the SALT deduction cap to be hiked to $30,000, and includes limits for those who make more than $400,000 a year. ButSALT Caucus members—  including Reps. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Young Kim, R-Calif. — have said that number is a nonstarter. One House Republican close to the process told NBC News there would be enough GOP votes to sink the bill if that SALT figure remains in the final product. Republicans can afford just three defections for the final package once it reaches the House floor. Lawler said there was \"zero chance\" he would support the current version of the bill. \"As I have said repeatedly, I will not support any bill that does not adequately lift the cap on SALT. This bill as written fails to deliver and will not have my support,\" Lawler said. \"I look forward to continuing to negotiate with leadership and the administration to provide real tax relief for my constituents.\" LaLotawrote on Xafter the text was posted: “Still a hell no.” \"We are not budging and this bill, as written, will not receive any of our votes,\" said a pro-SALT Republican lawmaker who is opposed to the current proposal. But Smith is pressing forward with a markup in his committee beginning Tuesday afternoon, leaving Johnson with the difficult task of striking a deal on SALT before a final floor vote, which he is aiming to hold next week. The prickly tax issue has created some tension between Johnson and Smith. During the morning video meeting, Smith told his colleagues it wasn’t his job to negotiate with the SALT Caucus Republicans, but the speaker’s job, according to two sources on the call. Smith explained that his bill reflects the will of his committee, not of the SALT Caucus, the sources said. The speaker, the sources said, didn’t directly commit to arbitrate the issue. Johnson's office did not respond to a request for comment. During the video call with Johnson, pro-SALT Republicans said they supported a figure floated last week by Kim: a $62,000 cap for individual tax filers and a $124,000 cap for joint filers, one source on the call said. But it’s unclear whether all pro-SALT Republicans, who have had mixed ideas on how to solve the issue, are equally committed to that figure. Another GOP source with first-hand knowledge of the situation noted that the pro-SALT group has been non-committal on a number throughout much of this process. But Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., the only SALT member who also serves on the Ways and Means Committee, announced her support for the SALT figure and overall tax proposal. \"Tripling the deduction to $30,000 will provide much-needed relief for the middle-class and cover 98% of families in my district,\" said Malliotakis, whose district includes Staten Island. Malliotakis' signal of support indicates that Smith may have the votes to get the bill out of the Ways and Means Committee and pass the issue onto Johnson, forcing him to amend the legislation to find the votes in the full House. The broader plan released by the Ways and Means Committee Monday would extend theexpiring tax cutsTrump signed into law into 2017 and incorporates some of Trump’s other campaign promises, including eliminating federal taxes on tips and overtime through 2028. It also creates a tax break for auto loan interest payments, which Trump had campaigned on in the swing state of Michigan in 2024. And the plan establishes so-called \"MAGA accounts,\" new savings accounts for newborns. The plan, though, does not include a tax hike on the wealthy, despite Trump personally urging the speaker to add it during a phone call last week. Trump had pushed to raise the tax rate for higher-income earners to 39.6%, up from the current 37% rate. But Trump’s proposal quicklyran into a buzzsaw of oppositionfrom anti-tax Republicans. Democrats from high-tax states, like New York, slammed the $30,000 SALT cap as paltry. \"This number is nothing short of insulting to hardworking Long Islanders,\" said first-term Rep. Laura Gillen, D-N.Y. \"For years, Republicans in New York and other high-tax states promised to oppose any bill that failed to restore the full deduction. It's time for them to honor that promise.\"",

    "article_text": "Stocks rocketed higher Monday after the U.S. and China announced anagreement to reduce,for now,their reciprocal tariffs, offering a sense of relief for investors who'd feared a significant economic downturn from President Donald Trump's trade policies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up more than 1,100 points, an increase of about 2.8%. With those gains, the Dow is now even for the year after having declined as much as 11%. Still, it remains 5.5% below the highs it reached in February. The S&P 500, the broadest stock index, added 3.3%. The tech-focused Nasdaq soared 4.4%, and is now in a bull market, having gained 20% from the low it just saw one month ago — though it remains 6.7% off from its February all-time high. Other indicators pointed to growing optimism that the economic damage of tariffs may end up being more limited than feared. Most notably, the odds that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates at current levels through its July meeting surged more than 17 percentage points on fears that current levels of inflation will not abate. There had been growing expectations that an economic slowdown related to tariffs would push the Fed to cut rates in order to boost the economy. Ina joint statementearly Monday, the U.S. announced it would slash the duties levied on Chinese imports from 145% to an all-in rate of 30% for 90 days, while China’s levies on U.S. imports would drop from 125% to 10%. For the U.S., the 30% rate represents a 10% baseline rate plus a 20% rate imposed to get China to curb fentanyl flows. That has alleviated some of the graver concerns about where the U.S. economy is headed and what it means for U.S. companies. “We believe the risk of a more severe economic downturn is now more limited, and we rate US equities as Attractive,” UBS analysts said in a note to clients late Sunday, before the joint statement had even been released. Even though the tariffs reduction is larger than some analysts had anticipated, tensions remain, and goods shipped in from China will still be more expensive for U.S. consumers relative to the pre-tariffs scenario. A 30% rate — which is effectively 40% when other product exclusions are factored in, according to Capital Economics consultancy — is still “substantially higher than most on other countries,” Capital Econ analysts said in a note. Meanwhile, the “underlying strains that put the U.S. and China on a collision course” in the first place, primarily the large trade imbalance the U.S. incurs with China, “have not gone away,” the analysts said. What’s worse, “differences are wider now” amid pushes by the U.S. to get countries like the U.K. to exclude China from its supply chains, the analysts wrote. In an appearance on CNBC, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it would be “implausible” for tariffs to fall below 10% even if further negotiation breakthroughs were reached. He also said the U.S. would continue to seek “decoupling” from China on strategic industries like steel and semiconductors. Still, he struck an upbeat tone about the prospect of future meetings. “We got a lot done over two days,” he said. “So I would imagine that in the next few weeks, we will be meeting again to get rolling on a more fulsome agreement.”",

    "title": "While pushing 'America First,' Trump set to accept Qatar's luxury jet as Air Force One",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — In Donald Trump’s vision, he’s set to usher in an American “golden age” in which the nation makes more of the world’s goods and sells more of its products. But when it comes to the president’s personal travel, he’s ready to ditch the old 747 known as Air Force One in favor of a luxe jet that theroyal family of Qatar, a tiny yet rich Arab country nearly 7,000 miles away, wants to gift to the U.S. Follow live politics coverage here The image of the 'America First' president floating above the clouds in Qatari splendor doesn’t sit well with some of the MAGA faithful, much less the good government groups who warn the deal may run afoul of the constitutional clause that bars gifts from foreign nations absent congressional approval. \"That's a pretty strange offer,\" Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis. said. Laura Loomer, a Trump ally,posted on social mediathat while she would “take a bullet” for the president, accepting a plane from Qatar would be “such a stain” on the Trump administration. “I’m so disappointed,” she wrote. In a post Sunday, Rep. Warren Davidson, an Ohio Republican, didn’t specifically mention Trump or the Qatari plane, but invoked former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her family foundation’sacceptance of foreign donations. “At a minimum, ‘bad idea,’”he wrote. Trump was unapologetic in a public appearance Monday. He said that the plane will someday be an exhibit in his presidential library after he leaves office and added he wouldn’t use it as a private citizen. He commended Qatar for what he described as a generous and welcome offer. A peninsula that juts into the Persian Gulf, Qatar is one stop on the president’s visit this week to the Middle East, thefirst major foreign trip ofhis secondterm. “They’re giving us a free jet,” Trump said. “I could say, ‘No, no, no, don’t give us. I want to pay you a billion or $400 million, or whatever it is,’ or I could say, ‘Thank you very much.’ You know?” A Qatar press official, Ali Al-Ansari, said in a statement Sunday said the deal still under review. \"The possible transfer of an aircraft for temporary use as Air Force One is currently under consideration between Qatar’s Ministry of Defense and the US Department of Defense, but the matter remains under review by the respective legal departments, and no decision has been made,\" he said. Trump reiterated his frustration over the time it’s taken for Boeing to complete jets that will replace the 747s that he is using now. The new planes may not be ready until 2027, the midpoint of Trump’s term. Converting the Qatari gift into Air Force One would require an overhaul that would take years to carry out and raise possible security concerns, according to three aviation and intelligence experts. It would likely would have to be effectively dismantled, part by part, to ensure there were no listening devices or other security vulnerabilities that could allow foreign powers to eavesdrop. The commercial jet would then have to be refitted with costly, sophisticated systems for mid-air refueling, missile defense, secure government communications and back-up power. The plane also would need to be hardened against potential electromagnetic pulse weapons. Air Force One is more than a means of presidential travel. With its distinctive blue and white, it is an emblem of American power and prestige. It functions as a kind of flying bunker for the commander in chief, capable of withstanding a nuclear blast. If the transfer happens, Air Force One would acquire what some describe as a foreign taint for this quintessential symbol of American pride. The Qatari plane and its whiff of excess would also seem at odds with Trump's message that Americans may have to make do with less as he remakes the global economic order.Fewer dollsand pencils for America's children, while the president flies in style. Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary in Republican President George W. Bush’s White House,posted on social mediathat “Nothing about getting Air Force One from a foreign government feels right.” “Air Force One should be American through and through,” Fleischer added. “It shouldn’t pass through foreign hands and it shouldn’t be a gift from a king. Don’t do it.” Trump first toured the Qatari plane in February at the airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago home. Known as the “flying palace,” the aircraft clearly made a favorable impression. “You look at some of the Arab countries and the planes they have parked alongside of the United States of America plane. It’s like from a different planet,” Trump told reporters Monday. During his first term, Trump complained that Air Force One wasn’t as luxurious inside as his private plane, a former White House official said. Asked for comment, the White House did not immediately respond. Congress’ GOP leaders gave muted responses when questioned about the swap Trump envisions. House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana declined comment. Senate Republican leader John Thune of South Dakota said, “I don’t know enough about it yet, and I don’t know there’s even been any offer.” Getting Congress to approve the present, in keeping with the constitution’s emoluments clause, would seem a heavy lift. A 60-vote supermajority would be required for Senate passage. But if Trump forges ahead and accepts the plane without Congress’ assent, there may not be much to stop him. He demonstrated in his first term that he has little to fear by way of impeachment. “Is Congress going to impeach him? Probably not,” said Richard Painter, who was chief ethics lawyer in George W. Bush’s White House. What’s more, the Supreme Court gave presidents broad immunity from prosecution in a landmark ruling last year. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has insisted any accepted gifts will be in accordance with the law. “Any gift givenby a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws,” Leavitt said. “President Trump’s administration is committed to full transparency.” Perhaps the only scenario Trump may need to worry about is that, after he leaves office, a future president may try to reclaim the aircraft for the U.S., seizing it from the Trump library. “You might have a future administration file suit and seek to repossess the plane as property of the U.S. government, because it should never have been accepted to begin with,” Painter said. Newt Gingrich, a former Republican House speaker and Trump ally, said that “in an ideal world,” Trump would get Congress to approve the gift. “The lawyers have to go through some hoops here, but if there is no quid pro quo and it’s all out in the open in public, it doesn’t strike me as an automatic problem,” Gingrich told NBC News. Ethics advisers in past administrations said they were wary of expensive gifts from foreign sources, no matter the reason. When President Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in his first term, he refused the more than $1 million that comes with it. Instead, the Nobel committee distributed the prize money among various charities, said Norm Eisen, who was a special counsel for ethics and government reform in the Obama administration. Painter recalled that during the Bush administration, Saudi Arabia’s government offered a Rolex watch to a senior White House official. “We saw to it that the gift was either returned or turned over to the U.S. government,” Painter said. “We weren’t going to have one of our top White House national security officials running around with a Rolex watch from the Saudis.\"",

    "article_text": "Three climbers died in Washington state when an anchor apparently failed as they were descending in a steep gulley Sunday, the Okanogan County Sheriff’s Office said. A fourth member of the climbing party in the North Early Winters Spire area survived and called authorities after the accident around 11:30 a.m., it said. The group was rappelling, which is when an anchored line is used to descend on a very steep or vertical face, with the line used to slow the descent, the sheriff’s office said. “The presumed cause of the accident is an anchor failure while rappelling, with more investigation still ongoing,” the sheriff’s office said. The names of the climbers were not released, but the sheriff’s office said they were 36, 47, and 63 years old and from Renton, a city just southeast of Seattle. The bodies of the three climbers have been recovered, the sheriff's office said. “Our thoughts are with the family members and friends of those involved,” the sheriff’s office said. The Early Winters Spires are two peaks — around 7,800 feet each —in the Northern Cascades. The north spire is the slightly shorter one, with a peak of around 7,760 feet.",

    "title": "Ms. Rachel doubles down support for  children in Gaza",
    "article_text": "Popular kids’ content creator Rachel Griffin Accurso, known as Ms. Rachel, addressed the ongoing backlash over her advocacy for Palestinian children, saying in a recent interview that “it should be controversial to not say anything.” Known for her YouTube series “Songs for Littles,” Accurso’s channel — which has 14.7million subscribers — focuses on teaching youngkids nursery rhymes, first words and basic educational concepts like colors and shapes. But elsewhere on her social media platforms, the educator has been outspoken about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza that has taken shape since Israel began its military response to Hamas’ deadly attack on Oct. 7, 2023. “It’s sad that people try to make it controversial when you speak out for children that are facing immeasurable suffering,” Accurso said in aninterviewwith journalist Mehdi Hasan, founder of the independent publication Zeteo. Accurso did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on Monday. The interview comes on the heels of intensified scrutiny of Accurso, who has been accused of antisemitism by some online critics who take issue with her posts about Palestinian children. Last month, the pro-Israel group StopAntisemitismrequestedthat Attorney General Pam Bondi investigate whether Accurso is “being funded by a foreign party to push anti-Israel propaganda to skew public opinion.” They accuse her of being “an amplifier of Hamas propaganda,” claiming some statistics and images she has shared about children in Gaza are false. Accurso did not address the probe request in her interview with Hasan. But she rejected claims that she is antisemitic because she advocates for the lives of children in Gaza. As an educator, she said, her empathy extends to all children around the world. “I’ve been blessed to get this platform. And kids feel that I care about them all deeply, and that’s why I have the platform. Because they feel it through the screen, because it’s genuine,” Accurso said. “And kids know when things aren’t genuine. And that care doesn’t end with the kids that are watching, or any kids.” Accurso, a mother to two young children, said her background in early childhood education made her aware that many of the youngest children in Gaza are being malnourished and traumatized in ways that harm their brain development during the crucial first three years of life. But mainly, she said, her concern is simply fueled by empathy. Since she began working with the humanitarian nonprofit Save the Children, Accurso said she learned more about situations faced by children around the world, from the U.S. to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to Gaza. She said she was “horrified” by Oct. 7, as well as the “distressing, horrific images” of suffering in Gaza. She has since used her platforms toraise awarenessandcall out human rights violationsagainst children. Last year, Accurso posted a tearful Instagram reel in which she shared that she wasbeing bullied onlineafter sheheld a fundraiserfor Save the Children’s emergency fund for kids in conflict zones like Gaza, Sudan, the Congo and Ukraine. She wrote in her caption that she cares for “Palestinian children, Israeli children, children in the US — Muslim, Jewish, Christian children — all children, in every country. Not one is excluded.” “The idea that caring for a group of children in an emergency situation means you don’t care about other children is false,” Accurso reiterated in Monday’s interview. “And I just don’t understand it.” Accurso has continued her advocacy this year,highlighting the storiesof Palestinian children likeHind Rajab. In recent months, she spotlighteda family whose home was destroyedand a3-year-old who lost both her legsin an airstrike, among others. “Our compassion doesn’t have boundaries or borders,” she told Zeteo. “We just love kids.”",

    "title": "Mavericks win No. 1 pick, chance to take Duke star Cooper Flagg",
    "article_text": "The Dallas Mavericks won the NBA Draft lottery Monday night, giving them the No. 1 pick in June’s draft and the chance to take Duke Blue Devils forward Cooper Flagg. The Mavericks entered the lottery with only a 1.8% chance of winning the first pick — the fourth-lowest odds for a lottery winner in NBA history. The San Antonio Spurs will pick second, while the rest of the top five (in order) will be the Philadelphia 76ers, Charlotte Hornets and Utah Jazz. The Jazz and Washington Wizards both entered with a 14% chance to win the top pick, but instead fell out of the top four. The Wizards will select sixth, while the New Orleans Pelicans — who had the second-best chance with 12.5% odds for the first pick — slid to seventh. Dallas missed the playoffs this season after controversially trading franchise cornerstone Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in February. The Mavericks will now have an opportunity to add Flagg to a core that includes two former No. 1 picks in Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving, though Irving will be recovering from a torn ACL he suffered in March. Flagg, 18, has widely been expected to be the No. 1 overall selection this summer since he re-classified in 2023 to a class of 2024 recruiting prospect. In 2022, Flagg was named to the All-Tournament Team for his performance helping lead Team USA to a championship in the FIBA Under-17 Basketball World Cup. In the summer of 2024, Flagg was chosen as part of the USA Select Team, practicing with the men’s national team ahead of the Paris Olympics. After committing to play for Duke in November 2023, Flagg spent one season with the Blue Devils, appearing in 37 games and averaging 19.2 points, 7.5 rebounds and 4.2 assists a night. He helped lead Duke to a Final Four appearance in April. The first round of the NBA draft will take place on June 25, with the second round the following day. There will be only 59 selections this year after the New York Knicks were forced to forfeit a second-round pick following a 2022 tampering investigation into the signing of Jalen Brunson that summer. The full results of the lottery are: 1. Dallas Mavericks 2. San Antonio Spurs 3. Philadelphia 76ers 4. Charlotte Hornets 5. Utah Jazz 6. Washington Wizards 7. New Orleans Pelicans 8. Brooklyn Nets 9. Toronto Raptors 10. Houston Rockets (via Phoenix Suns) 11. Portland Trail Blazers 12. Chicago Bulls 13. Atlanta Hawks (via Sacramento Kings) 14. San Antonio Spurs (via Atlanta Hawks)",

    "title": "DNC panel recommends redo of vote that elevated David Hogg to vice chair after procedural concerns",
    "article_text": "A Democratic National Committee subcommittee on Monday recommended that the organization invalidate one of its February vice-chair votes over claims that it unfairly disadvantaged female candidates. The move, which won't be official unless the entire DNC votes to approve it, could open up new races for the positions held by David Hogg, a Florida activist, and Malcolm Kenyatta, a Pennsylvania state legislator. The challenge by Oklahoma Democratic Committeewoman Kalyn Free, who unsuccessfully ran against Hogg and Kenyatta in the February race for vice chair, is not related to theongoing tension between Hogg and the national partyover his push to support primary challenges against incumbent Democrats. Instead, it was based off Free's claim that the handling of the vice-chair vote gave the two men an unfair advantage amid the national party's requirements that its executive committee achieve gender balance. Nevertheless, the Monday evening vote by the DNC Credentials Committee sets up a high-profile decision for the national party in the coming weeks as it will now be up to the full body to vote on whether to call for a new election for the vice-chair positions held by Hogg and Kenyatta. This is all happening as DNC Chairman Ken Martin has been separately pushing a reform that would “require all party officers — including myself — to remain neutral in primaries\" as Hogg has been signaling he's planning to take sides. DNC rules require that the national party's executive committee \"shall be as equally divided as practicable\" along gender lines. (If the committee includes members who identify as non-binary, they don't count for the purposes of gender division.) As DNC members met earlier this year for themulti-hour process of voting in a new slate of officers, the vote for the three vice chairs being the last position to be filled, it became clear that the party needed to elect at least one man to the final two vice chair spots to maintain the required gender equity on the seven-person executive committee. The party thendecided to hold a single vote to decide the final two slots instead of holding separate votes for each position. Free claimed that the combined ballot unfairly benefited Hogg and Kenyatta, the only two men left in the race, because members had to vote for at least one man on the combined ballot. She argued it's possible they could have voted differently if the ballots were separated. Follow live politics coverage here Representatives for Hogg and Kenyatta disagreed with the challenge, arguing that the party was well within its discretionary right to make a move to shorten the lengthy voting process in real time. Thechallenge to theDNC election dates fromlate February,wellbefore the disagreementbetweenHogg and the partywent public. But now, the 400-plus member DNC will have to vote on whether to call for a new election that could cost Hogg his position against this backdrop. In a statement Monday night, Hogg noted that the issue was over how the national party handled the election, not any accusation he nor Kenyatta did anything wrong. And he added that \"it is also impossible to ignore the broader context of my work to reform the party which loomed large over this vote.\" \"I ran to be DNC Vice Chair to help make the Democratic Party better, not to defend an indefensible status quo that has caused voters in almost every demographic group to move away from us,\" he said, adding that he views the vote as a way for the party to \"fast-track\" an attempt to remove him from his position. Kenyatta posted on social media that he while he respected the vote, he disagreed with the committee’s decision, calling it a “slap in my face.” He also weighed in on the characterization by some who see the vote as the latest in the saga between Hogg and the party. “I worked my a-- off to get this role and have done the job every day since I’ve held it,” he said in a longthread on X. “This story is complex and I’m frustrated—but it’s not about [David Hogg]. Even though he clearly wants it to be.” Martin, in a statement of his own issued after the vote, framed the debate as strictly about a failure of parliamentary procedure and one he's looking to party members to decide. \"During my campaign for Chair, I pledged to run the DNC with integrity, openness, and fairness. I am disappointed to learn that before I became Chair, there was a procedural error in the February Vice Chair elections,\" he said. \"The Credentials Committee has issued their recommendation, and I trust that the DNC Members will carefully review the Committee’s resolution and resolve this matter fairly,\" he added. The decision came after a three-hour virtual meeting, livestreamed on the party's YouTube page, that stretched even longer because the 18-member committee tied on its first ballot, which triggered another round of debate. The committee membership has been held over from the appointments by the previous national party chairman, Jaime Harrison, not new appointees by the new chairman. Eventually, the side that supported the recommendation for a new election won over key opponents, and approved a resolution with the support of 13 members declaring the election to the vice chair seats held by Hogg and Kenyatta \"incomplete.\" It recommends the DNC hold new elections for both seats \"as soon as practicable,\" with only the candidates eligible at the party's final ballot. Hogg and Kenyatta would be allowed to run again, but it's not a given they'd win the seats. Mark Mallory, a credentials committee member and former mayor of Cincinnati, said during the meeting that he supported the decision because while \"our former chairman did not do anything to intentionally disenfranchise any of the candidates running for vice-chair. However, the result has been just that.\" Mallory compared the process to when a patient with a broken leg has to go get the bone reset at the hospital. \"That process is painful too, but it is a part of the recovery of the initial incident,\" he said. \"We have, I believe, a responsibility to act.\"",

    "article_text": "BAMAKO, Mali — An attack by a jihadi group in northern Burkina Faso killed more than 100 people, mostly soldiers, an aid worker and local residents said Monday. The attack on several locations, including a military base and the long besieged strategic town of Djibo, occurred early Sunday, said an aid worker actively involved in dialogues in Burkina Faso’s hard-hit communities. A student from the area said her father was among those killed. Both individuals spoke to The Associated Press on Monday on the condition of anonymity due to fear of reprisals. A jihadi group aligned with Al-Qaida known as Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal-Muslimin, or JNIM, which is active in the Sahel region, claimed responsibility for Sunday’s attack. Run by a military junta, the landlocked nation of 23 million has been among the worst hit by the security crisis in Africa’s Sahel region, known as the global hot spot for violent extremism. About half of Burkina Faso is outside of government control as a result of the violence that contributed to two coups in 2022. Government security forces have also been accused of extrajudicial killings. The aid worker, as well as Charlie Werb, an independent analyst focusing on the Sahel, recounted how Sunday’s attack began simultaneously in different locations at 6 a.m. local time on Sunday. “JNIM fighters attacked eight localities simultaneously to disperse the Burkina Faso air force. The main attack occurred in Djibo, where JNIM fighters first took control of all the town’s entry checkpoints before attacking the military camps, particularly the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit’s camp,” said the aid worker. Werb, who studied videos posted online, said the attackers spent several hours in the areas without air support from Burkina Faso’s military, unlike similar attacks on Djibo in the past, when security forces have successfully repelled the extremists. The latest attack shows JNIM’s escalating power and widening reach in Burkina Faso, said Wassim Nasr, a Sahel specialist and senior research fellow at the Soufan Center security think tank. “The fact that Djibo was targeted confirms the extent of JNIM’s freedom of movement within Burkina Faso.” Analysts have warned that the junta’s strategy of military escalation, including the mass recruitment of civilians into poorly trained militias, has worsened inter-ethnic tensions.",

    "title": "Trump's drug pricing move shows his second-term reluctance to try bipartisanship: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, Sahil Kapur dives into how President Donald Trump has been reluctant to even attempt to reach across the aisle to Democratic lawmakers on policy proposals that could attract bipartisan support. Plus, we look at how markets soared after the U.S. and China agreed to ease their trade war — even as some uncertainty remains. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner President Donald Trump’sexecutive order on Mondayto cut prescription drug costs by imposing a “most favored nation” pricing model drew a pithy retort from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., Washington’s most outspoken proponent of taking on Big Pharma. “[A]s Trump well knows, his executive order will be thrown out by the courts,” said Sanders, the ranking member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. “If Trump is serious about making real change rather than just issuing a press release, he will support legislation I will soon be introducing to make sure we pay no more for prescription drugs than people in other major countries. If Republicans and Democrats come together on this legislation, we can get it passed in a few weeks.” Trump’s order is a directive to the Health and Human Services secretary to act on the goal — achieving parity with other developed countries on what Medicare and Medicaid pay for drugs — within 30 days. But the bigger problem is that a version of the idea was attempted by Trump in his first term, and blocked in court. The new order may run into the same brick wall before it can deliver any benefits. The back-and-forth points to a unique tendency for Trump in his second term: a reluctance to attempt bipartisanship, even when there is significant overlap with Democrats on a goal. Instead, Trump has repeatedly sought to go it alone — at risk of failure. The self-styled “dealmaker” is passing up opportunities for a deal, lest he have to share the victory with his political foes. It is a break from tradition. Presidents typically attempt to achieve congressional approval for their goals, knowing that legislation is the best way for a policy to overcome legal hurdles and — especially if it’s bipartisan — to stand the test of time. Trump is taking a different route, relying on executive action and party-line bills to advance his agenda. The move on drug pricing is just the latest example. In recent weeks, Trumphas hinted at supportfor raising taxes on upper earners, a goal that has virtually unanimous Democratic support and could turn into a bipartisan victory. Instead, he has repeatedly offered it up as a trial balloon for his party-line agenda bill, only for Republicans to shoot it down each time (and to question whether he’s even serious about it). Another example is Trump’s campaign promise of government-funded IVF treatments, a goal that Democrats are more supportive of than Republicans. Indeed, GOP lawmakers say they have no intention of advancing IVF funding in their bill. Yet there has been scant effort by Trump at a bipartisan deal that could deliver on the promise. The tendency helps explain why Trump signedfewer bills into lawthan any president since the 1950s during his first 100 days in office. Trump’s GOP trifecta includes a paper-thin House majority and a 60-vote hurdle in the Senate to pass most legislation, making his task of signing new laws even more complicated without any Democratic support. House Republicans still have a lot of work ahead of them to reach consensus on their massive bill for Trump's agenda, even as they start releasing key parts of legislative text for the package. Here's the latest from Capitol Hill: The United States and China announced a 90-day pause on most of their recent tariffs on each other, fueling hopes on Wall Street of a cooldown in the trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The combined U.S. tariffs rate on Chinese imports will be cut to 30% from 145%, while China’s levies on U.S. imports will be cut to 10% from 125%, the two countries said in a joint statement. The early morning announcement came after officials from the two countries met in Geneva over the weekend. It was the first face-to-face talks on the tariffs since President Donald Trump’s shock “Liberation Day” announcement last month imposing 84% duties on Chinese imports, which subsequently climbed to 125% — and then to 145% a day later. The math:The new 30% rate is the sum of the 20% duty imposed during the first weeks of his second term in response to alleged Chinese inaction on fentanyl flows, alongside the 10% across-the-board tariff Trump has imposed on all countries. How the markets responded:The Dow Jones Industrial Averageclosed up more than 1,100 points, an increase of about 2.8%. With those gains, the Dow is now even for the year after having declined as much as 11%. Still, it remains 5.5% below the highs it reached in February. The S&P 500, the broadest stock index, added 3.3%. Note of caution:Some analysts have urged caution, noting that tariffs remain far higher than before Trump returned to office. That suggests many consumer goods — from cars and groceries to fireworks — are set to see price hikes. Federal data is set to provide a fresh inflation snapshot on Tuesday morning. “The full set of U.S. tariffs would still be considerably higher and broader than expected by markets at the start of the year,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a note to clients Monday, noting that the 90-day countdown “should keep uncertainty high for both investors and businesses.” Read more → There may still be 540 days until the 2026 elections (who's counting?), but we've seen a flurry of candidates jump in — and others opt out — of key races around the country over the past 72 hours.

    "article_text": "Newark Mayor Ras Baraka’sarrest last weekat a federal immigration detention facility could shake up the New Jersey governor’s race, as Baraka looks to appeal to progressive Democratic voters to win the crowded primary. Baraka is one of six Democrats on the June 10 primary ballot, and he has been campaigning for months as an unapologetic progressive but has been vastly outspent spreading that message on the airwaves. His arrest Friday at the facility, known as Delaney Hall, could boost his profile just as Democratic voters look for a candidate willing to fight President Donald Trump. “We’re fighting to uphold the Constitution the United States,” Baraka told supporters on a call with a coalition of progressive groups Monday evening. “We’re fighting to uphold democracy that every single person deserves due process.” Follow live politics coverage here LaVar Young, who chairs the pro-Baraka super PAC One New Jersey United, said Baraka’s arrest shows “there’s only been one candidate that’s really been putting action behind his words.” “I think Friday was just really a demonstration of what he’s been doing over the last 30, 40 years of his career,\" Young later added, noting the super PAC expects to launch a digital ad highlighting Baraka’s arrest later this week. \"And I hope voters are able to see there’s a difference between rhetoric and action.\" New Jersey is one of two states, along with Virginia, that are holding governor’s races this year, which could provide indications about how voters are reacting to Trump’s second term. The New Jersey Democratic primary is also one of the party's first significant internal contests following its 2024 loss to Trump — and amid its fractious deliberations about the party's path forward. The crowded race features Baraka, Reps. Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller, and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney. All but Spiller faced off in a debate on Monday night. At the debate, Baraka said his actions at the ICE detention center were an effective way to push back against the Trump administration. “That’s what people need now. They need leadership. They don’t need people to acquiesce, to hide in the middle, to run under this veil of ‘I’m working with the president of the United States,’” Baraka said. “The reality is, we need to protect families, we need to protect immigrants, we need to protect democracy.” While some New Jersey political strategists view Sherrill as a leading candidate, the race is hotly contested. Themost recent survey, from Rutgers' Eagleton Institute of Politics, showed all six Democratic primary contenders clustered from 7% to 17% support — and the gap between first place and last place within the poll's margin of error.Baraka’s path to victory involves consolidating his party’s liberal base and leveraging his support in Newark, the state’s largest city, where he was first elected mayor in 2014. And his arrest could help him do just that. “If he can move a few thousand voters with a moment like this, it’s meaningful,” said one New Jersey Democratic operative granted anonymity to speak candidly about the race. The operative noted that the primary winner will not need a large percentage of the vote given how the crowded field will divide support. The person said Baraka’s arrest could be a “big blow” to Fulop as the two mayors have been battling for progressive voters. “This kind of a genuine, values-driven moment is huge for the type of voters that they’re going for,” the operative said. Each of Baraka’s primary opponents condemned the arrest on Friday, calling it outrageous and demanding that he be released. The top two GOP candidates for governor, former AssemblymanJack Ciattarelliand radio host Bill Spadea, slammed the arrest as a political stunt on the part of Baraka. “I wish it was, then I wouldn’t have to go to court on May 15,” Baraka toldZeteo’s Mehdi Hassanon Monday afternoon. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., who sought to enter the detention center along with Reps. LaMonica McIver and Rob Menendez on Friday, pushed back on the criticism that Baraka’s arrest was a stunt. “The mayor doesn’t do things just for performance. He does the things that he needs to do to protect the people,” said Watson Coleman, who has endorsed Baraka in the primary. Baraka’s campaign has been emphasizing his opposition to Delaney Hall, launching ads, includingone over the weekend, that featured footage of the mayor at a protest there earlier this year. “There’s only one progressive who Democrats trust: Ras Baraka,” a narrator says in the 15-second spot. “Ras is the Democrat we trust to fight for working families, to make the wealthy pay their fair share, to stand up to Musk and Trump.” The ad comes as other candidates have dominated the airwaves, also making the case that they will take on Trump. Gottheimer and his aligned super PACs have spent a combined $18.9 million on ads so far in the race this year, according to the ad-tracking firm AdImpact. Fulop and his aligned super PAC have spent a combined $14.3 million, while the pro-Spiller super PAC tied to the New Jersey teacher’s union has spent $7.8 million. Baraka, Sweeney and Sherrill, and their aligned outside groups, have each spent around $2 million. While the candidates have pledged to take on Trump, they have also been making the case that they are best positioned to win in November, with the race expected to be competitive. Trump lost New Jersey by 6 percentage points last year, but that was 10 points better than his 2020 margin by 10 points, making it the state with second-largest swing toward Trump in the country. The Democratic operative noted that some in the party are concerned that Baraka may be too liberal for New Jersey's more moderate voters, who have supported Republicans for governor in the past. “There is certainly a feeling among Democrats that if we do not nominate the right candidate we are in for a very, very difficult general election,” the operative said, noting that the concern is heightened given that Ciattarelli could once again be the GOP nominee. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli on Monday. Ciattarelli lost a surprisingly close race to current Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy by 3 points in 2021. Murphy was barred from running again in 2025 due to term limits. Ciattarelli weighed in Friday on Baraka’s arrest, calling it “cheap publicity stunt” ina post on X,and accused Baraka of “shilling for illegal immigrants” amid ongoing chaos at Newark airport and scores of flight delays. The comment offered a preview of Republicans’ potential case against Baraka, as well as how the party plans to focus on immigration in the governor's race. Immigration has been one of thefew dividing linesin the Democratic primary, and it’s a thorny issue for Democrats in a state where nearlyone in four residentsare immigrants. Republicans have leveraged the immigration issue, along with affordability, to make gains in the Garden State. “I think for other Dems it’s more complicated,” a second New Jersey Democratic operative, who has worked for one of Baraka’s primary opponents, wrote in a text message. “Being against ‘a facility to hold criminals' is not a winning message. But the admin arresting elected officials is a better message for us to push, and separate it from immigration issue.” Watson Coleman dismissed concerns that Baraka is too liberal to win a general election, noting he is fighting for “humane, foundational” issues like access to affordable health care, housing and food. She said she decided to back Baraka over the other candidates, including two of her House colleagues, because of his governing experience. Democratic voters, Watson Coleman said, “are looking for representation. They are looking for someone that they think will look after their interests and their needs. They’re looking for a person that will stand up for them.”",

    "title": "Honeytraps and high tech: Russian spy ring members jailed in the U.K.",
    "article_text": "LONDON — A Russian spy ring plotted to trade blood diamonds for weapons in Africa and supply drones to Russia’s military, according to messages shown to a London court that painted their fugitive leader as a wannabe James Bond. Jan Marsalek — who has been named as a key suspect in Germany’s biggest postwar fraud case — is alleged to have led the team of six Bulgarians who were sentenced Monday at London’s famous Old Bailey courthouse. When German payment company Wirecard collapsed in 2020, owing creditors almost $4 billion, Marsalek, the company’s chief operating officer, went on the run and an international manhunt was launched for the Austrian national, who remains at large. Messages revealed in court made it clear he was in Moscow as he referred to meetings with the GRU and the FSB state security service, at their headquarters building known as the Lubyanka, and at a “bonding exercise with the FSB guys at the shooting range.” He even posed for a selfie in Russian military fatigues. Court documents also showed that, while he was on the run, he directed a ragtag group of amateur operatives: Orlin Roussev, 47; his second-in-command, Biser Dzhambazov, 44; and Ivan Stoyanov, a 33-year-old mixed martial arts fighter known as “The Rock.” Katrin Ivanova, 33, and Vanya Gaberova, 30, described by prosecutors as “honeytrap” agents, and competitive swimmer Tihomir Ivanov Ivanchev, 39, made up the rest of the ring that carried out activities that, British police said, put lives and national security at risk. The spies conducted surveillance for the Russians targeting journalists, diplomats and dissidents in Britain, Austria, Spain and Montenegro, and they were paid handsomely for their services, prosecutors said. Using law enforcement grade devices called “IMSI grabbers,” prosecutors said they targeted the Patch Barracks, a U.S. base in Stuttgart, Germany, where they believed Ukrainian soldiers were being trained to operate Patriot missile air defense batteries. This would have helped Russians to target them when they returned to Ukraine to operate the missile batteries, the court heard. However, following an investigation by Britain’s MI5 spy service, they were arrested on Feb. 8, 2023, as they prepared to return to Germany with the devices hidden in a second-hand Chrysler. NBC News has contacted Russia’s Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, known as GU, for comment. Prosecutors said the unit did not work directly for Russian intelligence and their members were motivated by financial gain. Investigators traced $225,000 but believe at least the same amount was paid in cryptocurrency, they said. In his sentencing, Judge Justice Hilliard said the large amounts of money paid to the six Bulgarian spies demonstrated the “value” of their covert activities to Russia. “Some of the money would have covered their expenses, but not all,” he said. “This enabled the defendants to live very comfortably. It must have been thought that what the defendants were doing was of value.” However, prosecutors said that Roussev led the spy ring from a rundown guesthouse in Great Yarmouth, a seaside town on the east coast of England, where he stashed his huge collection of spy equipment, much of which he had adapted himself. Roussev pleaded guilty to spying for Russia in November and was sentenced to 10 years and eight months in prison. Dzhambazov was jailed for 10 years and two months and Stoyanov for seven years and seven months. Ivanova was found guilty in March along with Gaberova and Ivanchev. She was jailed for nine years and eight months. Gaberova and Ivanchev were sentenced to eight years each. As the sextet awaited sentencing, court documents revealed over 80,000 messages had been recovered from Roussev and Dzhambazov on the encrypted Telegram messaging app, following their arrest on Feb. 8, 2023. They shed light on the lifestyle of Marsalek in Moscow, revealing he partied with intelligence officers and naked girls, got cosmetic surgery to hide his identity and said he wanted to “outperform James Bond.” In a bid to show he was “not an anti-Western ideologue,” Roussev’s defense lawyers introduced messages with Marsalek which, they said, showed their client was “fixing for money” like “everything else Mr. Roussev does.” The messages, which were not introduced by prosecutors as part of their Russian espionage allegations, showed the pair discussed a request to help evacuate U.S. and Afghan nationals from Afghanistan during the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces from the country in August 2021. “Interesting request from our (sort of) friends at the CIA,” Marsalek said. “They urgently need aircraft to fly out contractors from Afghanistan,” he said. “Do you know anyone who’s a bit rogue and operates large-scale airplanes?” The objective was “to evacuate about 1,000 Afghan nationals” and “80 US citizens” to Albania, in a deal he said was agreed between the Albanian and U.S. governments. Roussev said he would ask his father’s pilot contacts in Africa and Marsalek replied: “America needs you, pax Americana rests on your broad and manly shoulders.” Roussev later said the flight left Kabul shortly before an ISIS-K terrorist detonated a bomb outside the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul killing 170 people and13 American service members. Defending Roussev in court, King’s Counsel Mark Summers said the request had come via a private company. The CIA declined to comment. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the pair were not acting on a humanitarian basis or at the direct request of the U.S. government. It remains unclear whether Roussev was successful in ensuring a flight. Roussev and Marsalek also discussed transporting diamonds in exchange for arms, the messages showed. In a June 2021 exchange, Marsalek asked whether African diamond sellers wanted guns in exchange or cash. “They usually buy guns, a lot of them,” noting that he wasn’t sure if rebel forces or the government would benefit from the deal. “Allegedly only government, but who knows, this is Africa,” he said. Three months earlier, Roussev messaged Marsalek to say he had been approached to supply 886,000 tons of wheat annually to the Cameroon government at a “very low price” from Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Describing it as a “good deal” considering the volume, he said that weapons and Sputnik COVID vaccines would likely be part of the transaction.” Guns and sputnik = no problem,” Marsalek replied. “Can pretty much organize anything they need except nukes,” he added, with a laughing emoji. “Even the nukes if they pay.” Other messages offered glimpses of Marsalek’s life in exile and his efforts to stay ahead of authorities, including facial reconstruction. In May 2021, he wrote: “I’m trying to improve my skills on a few fronts, languages is one of them. In my new role as an international fugitive, I must outperform James Bond.” Four months later, in September of that year, Marsalek apologized for being out of touch, saying he was “stuck between the mafia, half of Russia’s ambassadors, the GRU, a dozen naked girls and some deep-state guys whose names no one knows who forced me to drink a bottle of gin.” Months later, he told Roussev he had “another cosmetic surgery, trying to look differently.” “Sleep well, sleep is the best fix for this condition,” Roussev replied.",

    "title": "Trump tried to fire Corporation for Public Broadcasting board members. Then came DOGE",
    "article_text": "Stephen Fowler A control room at the Arizona PBS offices in Phoenix is seen Friday, May 2, 2025. Earlier this month, President Trump issued an executive order claiming to direct CPB's board to end federal funding to PBS and NPR.Katie Oyan/APhide caption Less than a day after President Trumpattempted to firethree Corporation for Public Broadcasting board members last month, DOGE staffers also tried to assign a team to review its operations. CPB leaders denied that request, citing federal law that establishes the independent nonprofit outside of the control of the federal government. The request comes as the president is launching a broad assault against the country's two largest public broadcasters. At the same time, the informalDepartment of Government Efficiencyhas sought to embed itself in numerous independent agencies Trump wants to shutter. Those revelations come incourt documentsfiled Friday in a lawsuit where CPB is challenging Trump's April 28 efforts to remove the board members, and after the president issuedan executive orderMay 1 that also purports to end any federal funding to the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. According to the filing, Nate Cavanaugh, a DOGE staffer with the General Services Administrationsent an emailaddressed to the two board members not targeted by Trump asking for a meeting just before the initial court hearing in the CPB case. \"I would like to learn more about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and discuss getting a DOGE team assigned to the organization,\" Cavanaugh wrote in an email dated April 29. AnApril 30 responsefrom CPB's executive vice president and general counsel Evan Slavitt reiterated the organization's stance that federal law states that CPB \"will not be an agency or establishment of the United States Government.\" \"Accordingly, neither DOGE, the GSA, nor any other component of the executive branch has any role supervising or having any activity relating to CPB,\" Slavitt wrote. Slavitt also said the DOGE email was sent to two email addresses that are only used by CPB's expense reimbursement system and are not the way to contact board members. The Trump administration contends the Constitution gives the president \"the power to remove personnel who exercise his executive authority,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogerspreviously told NPR. The lawappears to say otherwise. Federal law is explicit about CPB's structure and independence In a section of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 subtitled\"Federal interference or control,\"the statute does not allow \"any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over public telecommunications, or over the Corporation or any of its grantees or contractors.\" After Trump issued hisexecutive orderclaiming to direct CPB's board to end federal funding to PBS and NPR, leaders of the three organizations said the directive was illegal as well, citing a section of the act that established CPB in a manner \"to afford maximum protection from extraneous interference and control.\" Thelaw also saysthat funds allocated by Congress and distributed by CPB \"may be used at the discretion of the recipient,\" and spells out what percentage of the funds may be used for public television, public radio at the local and national levels. Congress allocated $535 million to CPB for the current fiscal year, a number that was left unchanged in the latest stopgap spending plan that all but two Republican lawmakers voted for in March. The president has indicated interest in asking Congress to claw back that funding using a process known as rescission, though that request has not been made and approval is not guaranteed. The executive order also directs federal agencies to end any \"direct or indirect\" funding of NPR and PBS. Last week, the Department of Education notified CPB it wasterminating its \"Ready to Learn\" grantfor educational television programing. In asking the court to block Trump's attempted removal of board members, CPB says it would not have a quorum to conduct any business if the firings were upheld, pointing to a previously-scheduled meeting for Tuesday, May 13 that would include discussing legislative communications plans with Congress, pending and potential litigation, and approving grant awards. \"Without a legally constituted Board, it cannot approve or give direction on any of these matters,\" the filing reads. And though CPB says it is not subject to the president's authority, it is worth noting that without a quorum, the board would also be unable to enact Trump's executive order allegedly seeking to defund PBS and NPR. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for May 14.

    "article_text": "By Joe Hernandez Documents unearthed from wooden crates in the basement of Argentina's top court included Nazi notebooks, photographs and postcards.ULAN/Pool/Latin America News Agency via Reutershide caption It was only by chance that a cache of secret Nazi documents seized during World War II was recently found in the basement of Argentina's top court. Judicial officials who were relocating court archives to a new museum encountered the boxes of German government records by accident, the Supreme Courtsaid on Monday. Inside were stacks of Nazi papers including material \"intended to consolidate and propagate Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina\" during the war, the court said. The contents of the Nazi crates are now being surveyed and inventoried by order of Supreme Court president Horacio Rosatti. According to the court, some 83 packages sent from the Germany embassy in Tokyo arrived in Argentina in 1941 aboard the Japanese steamer Nan-a-Maru. The German diplomatic mission at the time said the boxes contained the personal effects of its members, but Argentinian customs officials warned the foreign minister that allowing the packages into the country without inspection could threaten Argentina's neutrality in World War II. When some Argentinian officials opened five of the boxes at random, they found Nazi propaganda, postcards, photographs and thousands of notebooks from the National Socialist German Workers' Party Organization Abroad and the German Trade Union. Officials look on during the official opening of Nazi crates seized by Argentina during World War II that were recently discovered by judicial officials in the basement of the country's top court.ULAN/Pool/Latin America News Agency via Reutershide caption A federal judge ordered that the cargo be seized and referred the matter to Argentina's supreme court. In its announcement this week, the court didn't say why the boxes had gone unopened for so long. On Friday, Rosatti and other Argentinian officials, including representatives from the Buenos Aires Holocaust Museum, were present for the official opening of the boxes. The contents will now be placed under police guard while they are scanned, digitized and reviewed. Officials said they want to see what information the materials contain about the Holocaust and other aspects of the regime, such as the \"global Nazi money trail.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "article_text": "FromThe Texas Newsroom By Lucio Vasquez A Texas Lottery display promoting support for Texas education and veterans stands inside Lucky Rudy's in Rosenberg, Texas, on May 5, 2025.Lucio Vasquez.hide caption ROSENBERG, TEXAS – At Lucky Rudy's, a convenience store outside of Houston, 30-year-old Eli Sierra holds up a fresh scratch-off. Buying lottery and scratch-off tickets has been a simple tradition he shares with his wife — a little spark of excitement, not a serious investment. \"I'll go buy her some flowers and I'll buy her lottery tickets,\" Sierra said. \"I know she loves the rush to be like, 'Am I gonna win? Am I gonna win? Am I gonna win?'\" Americans spent more than $110 billion trying their luck on the lottery last year, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. Among the largest systems is the Texas Lottery, which brought in more than $8 billion in 2024 – the fourth highest in sales across the nation. Profits go tofund public educationin the state. But the future of the Texas Lottery looks clouded. After jackpot controversies, multiple resignations of lottery officials and a ban on online lotto ticket sales, the system is now under investigation by multiple state agencies. The scrutiny has also sparked action at the Texas Capitol, where state lawmakers are pushing new legislation intended to rein in the system. At the center of the debate are online courier services, which let users buy official lotto tickets online without stepping into a store. A scanned copy of the ticket is sent to the customer as proof of purchase. Couriers charge a fee for purchasing and managing tickets. Questions about the legality of such services emerged after two massive jackpot wins in Texas: an $83 million prize claimed in April 2023 through an online courier service and a seperate $95 million payout earlier this year secured by a group that bought nearly all 25.8 million possible number combinations. The latter was an effort orchestrated by a man from Malta and financed by a London-based betting company, according to theHouston ChronicleandThe Wall Street Journal. \"Texans must be able to trust in our state's lottery system and know that the lottery is conducted with integrity and lawfully,\" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in February. \"Texans deserve a lottery that is fair and transparent for everyone.\" In February, Abbottordered an investigationinto the state's lottery system; several state agencies followed suit. The Texas Lottery Commission responded bybanning couriersfrom operating within the state. And last month, the commission's executive directorresigned. Other lottery officials have alsostepped down. \"The Lottery Commission has enabled a private-public partnership, led by the state agency, to engage in a criminal conspiracy to defraud Texans,\" said state Sen. Bob Hall, who authoreda billbeing considered during this year's legislative session that would make online lottery sales a misdemeanor in the state. The state of Texas didn't previously regulate couriers. Only three states throughout the U.S. currently regulate them, according to a2024 reportfrom the Texas House Committee on Licensing and Administrative Procedures. Hall says this lack of oversight has tarnished the integrity of the system, \"creating a criminal organization actually operating within our state government.\" In a statement to NPR, the commission said its top priority was \"ensuring the integrity, security, honesty and fairness\" of the Texas Lottery. The agencyannounced its own investigationsinto couriers in February. But the couriers themselves say they've been legally operating for years and that they want to be regulated. One of these companies is Lotto.com, whichsued the state's lottery commissionover the ban on couriers in late April. \"Regulated lottery couriers support integrity and support the operations and continued growth of the Texas Lottery,\" said Rob Porter, chief legal officer for the company. Some lawmakers have proposedbills to regulatecourier services, while others have even suggestedabolishing the state lotterycompletely. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick says whatever happens, public trust must come first. \"Those who play the lottery must be assured that every game is honest and you have a fair chance to win. If we cannot guarantee that, then the lottery should not continue,\" Patrick said. As for Eli Sierra, he says he'll keep buying tickets for his wife – controversies or not. \"It's just something that makes her happy,\" he said. After we spoke, Sierra scratched off his ticket – and walked away $10 richer. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

The permanent post of Librarian of Congress must be confirmed by the Senate. Blanche has no experience working in libraries or archives,according to his public profile. Now he will be running the largest one in the world.As a lawyer, he has focused on investigations and criminal litigation, including work for the President.

    "title": "Gérard Depardieu faces verdict in sexual assault trial seen as #MeToo test",
    "article_text": "By Rebecca Rosman French actor Gérard Depardieu leaves for a break during his trial for the alleged sexual assaults of two women on a film set in 2021.Aurelien Morissard/APhide caption PARIS – French film legend Gérard Depardieu is set to receive a verdict on Tuesday in a closely watched sexual assault case. Two women say the 76-year-old actor groped them on the set of the 2022 filmLes Volets Verts. In France, the trial has been widely seen as more than a case against one man. Women's rights advocates say it's a test of how seriously the country takes sexual violence, and whether its long-delayed #MeToo reckoning is finally beginning. \"If there's a guilty verdict, it will be a victory not just for the women in court, but for all others who were silenced by time,\" Carine Durrieu-Diebolt, a lawyer representing one of the two plaintiffs, told NPR the day before the verdict. Durrieu-Diebolt says more than 20 women have come forward with accusations against Depardieu — including groping, harassment, and rape — but only two cases fell within France's statute of limitations to make it to court. The case was originally expected to be heard in late 2024, but it was postponed multiple times, first due to scheduling issues, and then for medical reasons cited by the defense. The trial finally opened in March 2025 and lasted four days. During the proceedings, Depardieu testified that if he ever touched the women, it wasn't with sexual intent. He admitted to using vulgar language on set, and said he now avoids female assistants in dressing rooms so as not to be misunderstood. \"I try not to be heard by the new world,\" he told the court. \"I think my time is done.\" In October 2023, Depardieu published anopen letterin Le Figaro denying all allegations. \"Never, ever have I abused a woman,\" he wrote, calling the accusations a \"lynching that has been reserved for me.\" Depardieu's lawyer, Jérémie Assous, was accused of using aggressive tactics in his questioning of the plaintiffs during the trial, prompting nearly 200 French lawyers tosign an open lettercondemning the defense strategy as sexist and intimidating. Prosecutors have asked for an 18-month suspended prison sentence and a fine of up to €200,000 euros (roughly $221,000). The actor has continued working throughout the legal proceedings and received public support from some high-profile figures, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Speaking onnational televisionin December 2023, Macron described himself as \"a great admirer of Gérard Depardieu,\" and warned against what he called a \"witch hunt\" when asked whether the actor should be stripped of hisLegion of Honor, France's highest award of merit. The comments drew backlash, and Macron laterclarifiedthat he would be \"uncompromising\" in the fight against rape and what he called \"a culture of brutality.\" For many women's rights advocates, the Depardieu case is part of a much larger pattern. In January, aFrench parliamentary reportfound that sexual violence and harassment remain \"endemic\" in the country's film and TV industry. It also noted a climate of \"collective denial\" and warned that France's legal system may be failing victims. Another high-profile rape investigation involving Depardieu, brought by actress Charlotte Arnould, remains open. \"It's a test of the moral independence of the justice system,\" said Elodie Tuaillon-Hibon, a lawyer and analyst focused on systemic responses to sexual violence. \"Depardieu has become a symbol of what we no longer want to see in France: this, 'bawdiness,' this so-called 'gallantry,' which, in reality, is harassment.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

The frontier between India and Pakistan had the \"first calm night in recent days,\" the Indian army said on May 12, after a weekend ceasefire.SAJJAD HUSSAIN/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption JAMMU, India — On Monday, children returned to school, airports reopened across border areas of India and Pakistan and families mourned their dead as a ceasefire announced Saturday by President Trump held for the second day. The ceasefire has halted what some analysts say was the most serious fighting between the two countries since they went to war in 1971, with India's strikes reaching the outskirts of the Pakistani capital Islamabad, and an airbase in Pakistan's second largest city, Lahore. The fighting began last Wednesday, when India struck multiple targets in Pakistan. Indian authorities said this was in retribution for a militant attack that killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in India-administered Kashmir on April 22. Eyewitnesses said some of the gunmen targeted Hindu men, drawing rage across Hindu-majority India. India blamed Pakistan, which denied any connection to the attack and demanded India show evidence of its claim. Asked repeatedly about that evidence,India's Ambassador to the United States Vinay Kwatra told NPRlast week that it would come out \"in fullness of time.\" The ceasefire has not affected other measures that India announced after the late-April attack — most importantly, its suspension of a water treaty that divides six South Asian rivers between it and Pakistan. Pakistan's United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmaddescribed the treaty's suspension as\"an existential threat\" to his country's people. On Monday evening, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed to rule out the possibility of discussions on the water treaty, saying any talks with Pakistan would focus only on Kashmir and terrorism. \"Water and blood cannot flow together,\" he said in a televised address to Indians. \"If there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on terrorism; and if there are talks with Pakistan, it will be only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir,\" he said. People look at the debris of an aircraft in Wuyan, a village in the Pulwama district in Indian-administered Kashmir, May 7.Bilal Kuchay for NPRhide caption Officials in India and Pakistan celebrated the ceasefire, each insisting it was the other side that called for a halt to fire. Talks between the Indian and Pakistani directors-general of military operations were held on Monday to ensure commitment to the ceasefire, the Indian defense ministry said in a statement. Civilians in both countries welcomed the stop in fighting. \"The ceasefire brings that sigh of relief,\" said 34-year-old Babar Rashid, who lives in Bahawalpur, a Pakistani city some 90 miles from the Indian border. India struck the city's outskirts last Wednesday, saying it was targeting terrorists there. Rashid said he was pleased that Pakistan managed, in his view, to bloody India's nose. Now, he warned, India '\"should not make any kind of misadventure.\" Indian authorities say India's military haskilled 100 \"terrorists\"in Pakistan. Dozens of civilians were killed between last Wednesday and Saturday in the tit-for-tat strikes between India and Pakistan, according to death tolls given by both countries. In the town of Poonch in India-administered Kashmir, the dead include 13-year-old twins Zain Ali and Urwa Fatima. Sarfaraz Ahmad Mir, a cousin of the twins, said the family had moved to Poonch three months ago, for the schools. He said his uncle, the children's father, was also seriously wounded. Mir's aunt, the twins' mother, did not have the heart to tell her husband that their children had been killed. \"He doesn't even know that there's a ceasefire,\" Mir said. When his aunt visits her husband in the hospital, \"she tells him that the children are at home. And when she leaves the room, she cries, she remembers those children.\" Most of the casualties on both sides were residents of Kashmir, the Himalayan territory divided between and disputed by Pakistan and India. Both countries claim the entire region. Thousands have either left there or fled as far as possible from the Line of Control, the de facto border that divides Kashmir. On the Indian side, a few dozen ended up sheltering in an ashram on the outskirts of Jammu, a city in Indian-administered Kashmir. Women hunkered in a bare basement; men hunkered in a bare prayer hall. Many of the displaced were farmers from a village called Pargwal, near the de-facto border. Jamail Kumar, 32, said when the firing started the previous week, some residents jumped into irrigation canals until local officials arranged buses for them to escape the village. \"Even then, there were bullets whizzing past us,\" he said. Despite the ceasefire, residents said they weren't sure it was safe yet to return.

Both India and Pakistan claimed they had hit sensitive military targets, and both sides confirmed the loss of some military personnel. India claimed to have struckseveralPakistani air bases, including one in a military garrison near the capital city Islamabad. Multiple eyewitnesses confirmed the last strike to NPR, as did the Pakistani defense minister Khawaja Asif, who said only a vehicle was hit. Pakistan claims it shot down five Indian aircraft, including at least one French-made fighter jet, the Rafale. India has not commented on those claims. When questioned on Sunday about them,Air Marshal A.K. Bhartiresponded at a press briefing by saying, \"Losses are a part of combat.\" With additional reporting by Betsy Joles in Lahore, Pakistan, and Diaa Hadid in Mumbai, India.

    "title": "With immigration limits, the U.K. vows to end a 'failed experiment in open borders'",
    "article_text": "By Lauren Frayer , Fatima Al-Kassab British Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaks during a news conference, ahead of the publication of the government's immigration policy paper, in London, Monday.Ian Vogler/Daily Mirror/APhide caption LONDON — Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced tighter British immigration rules, declaring an end to what he called a \"squalid chapter\" and a \"failed experiment in open borders.\" In aspeechMonday, Starmer vowed to \"take back control\" with new rules that make it harder to obtain work, family and student visas to the United Kingdom. Migrant rights advocates criticized his wording as being more typical of the far right thanof his center-left Labour Party. \"The damage [immigration] has done to our country is incalculable,\" the prime ministerwrotein a policy paper. Starmer said the changes, which still need Parliament's approval, are needed to maintain social cohesion, drive investment in the local workforce and prevent Britain from becoming \"an island of strangers.\" His proposals come less than two weeks after the far-right anti-immigration Reform U.K. Party, led byNigel Farage— a confidant of President Trump — madebig gainsin some local and municipal elections across England. Data shows net migration to the U.K. hasmore than tripledin the past decade. Indians are the largest recipients of U.K. visas. And in recent months, Americans have beenapplyingfor British citizenship in record numbers. Experts say the changes aim to reverse an unexpected spike in immigration after Britain left the European Union. \"After Brexit, a new immigration system came in under the previous [Conservative] government that was surprisingly liberal, and there was a big and unexpected increase in migration to the U.K.,\" says Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. \"When they saw how big the numbers were, they started to roll back some of those liberalizations and made some restrictions.\" \"The current government is keeping those existing restrictions and rolling back the liberalizations, taking us back to a system that's broadly similar to what we had for non-EU citizens before the U.K. left the EU,\" she says. Several of Starmer's predecessors focused on cracking down on illegal migration, including with acontroversial planto deport people in the country without legal status to Rwanda, no matter where they're originally from. (That plan was struck down by courts and ultimately scrapped when Starmer defeated then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak inlast summer's election. While some immigrants who enter illegally go undetected or uncounted,government figuresshow the vast majority of immigrants to the U.K. arrive legally. The changes announced Monday govern them, making it harder to obtain most types of U.K. work and residence visas. Immigrants and their dependents will have to pass higher-level English proficiency tests for some types of work visas. And most immigrants will have to spend at least 10 years in the country before applying for citizenship, rather than the current five years. Employers, in turn, won't be allowed to recruit as many overseas workers — particularly for low-skilled jobs. In recent years, the U.K. has also startedrequiring travelerswho don't need a tourist visa to buy a visa waiver online before being allowed to board a British-bound flight. Sumption estimates the changes will translate into a roughly 10% decline in visas issued. Immigrants will also spend more time, and money, on temporary visas, she predicts. \"Having temporary status is obviously not very good for migrants themselves. Because the U.K. immigration system is actually very expensive for people on temporary visas,\" she says. \"On the other hand, the benefit for the government is that they bring in a lot more revenue, and that money gets redistributed across the health service, across the skills system — though that's not the justification the government is using.\" Polls show most Britons want their government to do more to fight illegal types of migration, especially smugglers carrying people to England in small boats across the channel from France. But the rules Starmer announced Monday govern only legal types of migration. Onerecent pollfound most Britons do not want to see numbers of migrant worker visas reduced, especially for certain sectors, including workers in nursing homes. In a statement emailed to NPR, Steve Smith, CEO of Care4Calais, a charity that works with migrants and refugees, called Starmer's language \"dangerous.\" \"Shameful language like this will only inflame the fire of the far-right and risks further race riots that endanger survivors of horrors such as war, torture and modern slavery,\" Smith wrote. \"Starmer must apologize.\" One of Starmer's own Labour members of Parliament, Nadia Whittome,wrote on social mediathat the prime minister's language \"mimics the scaremongering of the far-right.\" Another left-wing lawmaker, Zarah Sultana,questionedwhether Starmer's speech had actually been written by far-right lawmaker Farage. And another former Starmer colleague, parliamentarian John McDonnell,comparedthe prime minister's \"island of strangers\" reference to the \"divisive language ofEnoch Powell.\" Powellwasa Conservative member of Parliament who made an infamous 1968 speech that's widely considered one of the most racist and incendiary in modern British history. (Both Sultana and McDonnell were suspended from the Labour Party last year after voting against one of Starmer's welfare policies, though they remain in Parliament.) Opposition lawmakers, meanwhile,questionedStarmer's commitment to cutting migration numbers and said his proposals don't go far enough. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "VPN firm says it didn’t know customers had lifetime subscriptions, cancels them",
    "article_text": "\"We acknowledge that notifying users after the deactivation was a poor experience ...\" The new owners of VPN provider VPNSecure have drawn ire after canceling lifetime subscriptions. The owners told customers that they didn’t know about the lifetime subscriptions when they bought VPNSecure, and they cannot honor the purchases. In March, complaints started appearing online about lifetime subscriptions to VPNSecure no longer working. The first public response Ars Technica found came on April 28, when lifetime subscription holders reported receiving an email from the VPN provider saying: To continue providing a secure and high-quality experience for all users, Lifetime Deal accounts have now been deactivated as of April 28th, 2025. A copy of the email from “The VPN Secure Team” andposted on Redditnotes that VPNSecure had previously deactivated accounts with lifetime subscriptions that it said hadn’t been used in “over 6 months.” The message noted that VPNSecure was acquired in 2023, “including the technology, domain, and customer database—but not the liabilities.” The email continues: Unfortunately, the previous owner did not disclose that thousands of Lifetime Deals (LTDs) had been sold through platforms like StackSocial. We discovered this only months later—when a large portion of our resources were strained by these LTD accounts and high support volume from users, who through part of the database, provided no sustaining income to help us improve and maintain the service. VPNSecure is offering affected users discounted new subscriptions for either $1.87 for a month (instead of $9.95), $19 for a year (instead of $79.92), or $55 for three years (instead of $107.64).The dealsare available until May 31, per the email. This week, users reported receiving a follow-up email from VPNSecure providing more details about why it made its bold and sudden move. Screenshots of the emailshared on Redditsay that the acquisition by InfiniteQuant Ltd (which is a different company thanInfiniteQuant Capital Ltd, an InfiniteQuant Capital rep told Ars via email) was “an asset only deal.” A VPNSecure representative claimed on the reviews siteTrustpilotthat the current owners “did not gain access to the customer database until months” after the acquisition. According to VPNSecure’s owners, their acquisition netted them “the tech, the brand, and the infrastructure/technology—but none of the company, contracts, payments, or obligations from the previous owners.” The current owners said they didn’t sue the seller because “a corporate lawsuit would’ve cost more than the entire purchase of the business.” VPNSecure also apologized to any customers who felt caught off guard by the changes, noted their backlash, and thanked those who purchased new subscriptions. The email’s authors claimed that they could have chosen to shut down VPNSecure after learning about the lifetime subscriptions but “chose the hard path.” They also emphasized they “never will” sell lifetime subscriptions. Customers have been incredulous about VPNSecure's owners not knowing about the purchased lifetime subscriptions before buying the company. The firm's email to customers this week said the current owners reviewed six to 12 months of VPNSecure’s prior “financials” before making the purchase, but the listing, profit and loss statements, and communications never mentioned lifetime deals. The email included a link to aVPNSecure sales listingdated April 2023 that shows an “estimated valuation” of $282,090–$344,770 and doesn’t mention lifetime subscriptions. Ars looked at the VPNSecure website’s history using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and didn’t find mention of lifetime subscriptions. Lifetime subscriptions to the service were apparently only offered through third parties, like these listings onStackSocialandWccftech, that no longer link to purchaseable subscriptions. VPNSecure’s email this week claimed that lifetime subscriptions were sold “between 2015 and 2017”; however, Ars found ads on ZDNET pushing $40 lifetime subscriptionsin 2021and $28 lifetime subscriptionsin 2022. Since March, there have been 20 pages worth of one-star reviews on Trustpilot complaining about lifetime subscribers losing access to their VPN. One Trustpilot user wrote on April 30: When the service stopped working, I logged a ticket. A couple days later, I got that infamous email informing me my subscription had (already) been cancelled. The comms should have been sent earlier (before the service was interrupted), and written with more clarity and empathy. VPNSecure is responding to the complaints on Trustpilot and has acknowledged that it could have communicated better with customers. \"We acknowledge that notifying users after the deactivation was a poor experience, and we take full responsibility for that,” a companyrep wroteon April 30. People have also been complaining on Reddit. One user, for example,wrote that the new owners\"said they did their due diligence, but a simple Google Search would have shown lifetime deal offers from the past.\" VPNSecure’s website lists its owner as InfiniteQuant Ltd in the Bahamas; however, itsterms of servicenames the company “HOLDXB Trading FZCO trading as VPN Secure, IFZA Business Park, Dubai - UAE.” According to the Wayback Machine, the terms of service page moved from naming an Australian firm, “Boost Network Pty Ltd trading as VPN Secure” to HOLDXB until 2024. VPNSecure’s email to customers this month noted that the team is “in the Bahamas” and “not [in] one [of the] five eyes countries anymore.” Ars has reached out to The VPN Secure support team for more information but didn’t hear back in time for publication. There isn’t much information or contact details for InfiniteQuant Ltd, HOLDXB Trading FZCO, or Boost Network Pty Ltd online. VPNSecure’s ordeal is a reminder that so-called lifetime subscriptions often last shorter than advertised. Per comments online, VPNSecure’s lifetime subscriptions lasted up to 20 years. Lifetime subscriptions, as well aslifetime warranties, can also get abruptly voided if a company goes out of business, and as we’ve seen with VPNSecure, new owners could also jeopardize “lifetime” offerings. Users can also see capabilities reduced or altered in the course of a \"lifetime.\" VPNSecure could’ve potentially mitigated backlash by giving users more advanced warning of the changes and a longer opportunity to select a new subscription before deactivating their accounts. We can’t confirm if InfiniteQuant Ltd. knew about the lifetime subscriptions before making its purchase. However, the firm claims to have known about the subscriptions a few months after taking ownership, so it had ample time to warn customers before abruptly deactivating “dormant” accounts and killing the subscriptions of thousands of customers.

    "title": "FCC commissioner writes op-ed titled, “It’s time for Trump to DOGE the FCC“",
    "article_text": "\"The FCC is a prime candidate for DOGE-style reform,\" Nathan Simington writes. A Republican member of the Federal Communications Commission is proposing a DOGE-style overhaul of the agency's operations, including large cuts to the Universal Service Fund that subsidizes broadband deployment and access. FCC Commissioner Nathan Simington said the fund should reduce spending on fiber networks and give money to Starlink—helping Elon Musk, the man in charge of President Trump's DOGE initiative. Simington also argued that the FCC is using too many staff hours on reviewing license applications and should instead use automated systems to approve most license requests. In aDaily Caller op-ed titled, \"It's Time For Trump To DOGE The FCC,\" Simington and his chief of staff, Gavin Wax, wrote that \"President Trump's vision for restoring constitutional government is finally taking shape, and nowhere is that more urgently needed than at the Federal Communications Commission.\" DOGE already has people at the agency, asthree individuals identified as DOGE staffersare listed in an FCC directory and have FCC.gov email addresses. The FCC historically has operated independently from the White House, but Trumpissued an executive orderdeclaring that it is no longer an independent agency. \"The FCC is a prime candidate for DOGE-style reform,\" Simington and Wax wrote. \"From redundant enforcement structures to legacy programs that drain resources with little oversight, the Commission is entangled by outdated practices that burden consumers, broadcasters, and taxpayers alike.\" Simington's op-ed said the government should \"slash the Universal Service Fund and related mandates,\" such as fees imposed on telephone bills. Universal Service Fund programs are paid for through fees imposed on phone companies, which generally pass the cost on to consumers. \"Few Americans realize that federally mandated fees, which are set at the sole discretion of the FCC, not Congress... raise the cost of monthly phone bills for voice service byover 36 percent,\" the Simington op-ed said. The FCC's$8 billion-a-yearUniversal Service system subsidizes the expansion of telecom networks with grants to Internet service providers and makes access more affordable with discounts for consumers. \"These fees fund a patchwork of programs under the Universal Service Fund (USF), including theInternet Protocol Captioned Telephone Service(IP CTS) and other telecommunications relay services,\" Simington and Wax wrote. \"While originally well-intentioned, many of these programs have become outdated, inefficient, and ripe for reform.\" Simington's proposed cost-cutting would also target Lifeline, a Universal Service program for people with low incomes; and E-Rate, a Universal Service program for schools and libraries. Simington wants to redirect money to Elon Musk's Starlink system and away from wired broadband networks, even though fiber networks offer superior service and are more future-proof. \"Programs like E-rate and Lifeline, while once valuable, have lost relevance in the age of widespread mobile Internet and emerging satellite services. Wired internet subsidies are increasingly unnecessary and cost-inefficient,\" Simington wrote. \"The rise of satellite broadband, such as Starlink, and fixed wireless alternatives offer a more scalable, less expensive solution. Rather than spending billions to trench fiber cable to remote areas, the FCC should adopt a technology-neutral approach that lets innovation drive infrastructure deployment. Reforming USF to reflect these realities is long overdue and would align with DOGE's mission of smarter, leaner government.\" In addition to cutting Universal Service, Simington proposed a broad streamlining of the FCC licensing process. Manual processing of license applications \"consumes vast staff hours and introduces unnecessary delay into markets that thrive on speed and innovation,\" he wrote. \"For non-contentious licenses, automated workflows should be the default,\" Simington argued. \"By implementing intelligent review systems and processing software, the FCC could drastically reduce the time and labor involved in issuing standard licenses.\" Simington also proposed taking employees out of the FCC Media Bureau and moving them \"to other offices within the FCC—such as the Space Bureau—that are grappling with staffing shortages in high-growth, high-need sectors.\" Much of the Media Bureau's \"work is concentrated on regulating traditional broadcast media—specifically, over-the-air television and radio—a sector that continues to contract in relevance,\" he wrote. Simington acknowledged that cutting the Media Bureau would seem to conflict with his ownproposalto regulate fees paid by local stations to broadcast networks. It might also conflict with FCC Chairman Brendan Carr'sattempts to regulate news contentthat he perceives as biased against Republicans. But Simington argued that the Media Bureau is \"significantly overstaffed relative to its current responsibilities.\" Simington became an FCC commissioner at the end of Trump's first term in 2020. Trump picked Simington as a replacement forRepublican Michael O'Rielly, who earned Trump's ire by opposing a crackdown on social media websites. The FCC is currently operating with two Republicans and two Democrats, preventing any major votes that require a Republican majority. But Democratic Commissioner Geoffrey Starkssaidhe is leaving sometime this spring, and Republican nominee Olivia Trusty is on track to beconfirmedby the Senate. The agency is likely to cut numerous regulations once there's a Republican majority. Carr started a \"Delete, Delete, Delete\" proceeding that aims to eliminate as many rules as possible. Congress is also pushing FCC cost cuts, as the Senatevoted to killa Biden-era attempt to use E-Rate to subsidize Wi-Fi hotspots for schoolchildren who lack reliable Internet access to complete their homework.

    "title": "Copyright Office head fired after reporting AI training isn’t always fair use",
    "article_text": "Cops scuffle with Trump picks at Copyright Office after AI report stuns tech industry. A day after the US Copyright Office dropped a bombshell pre-publicationreportchallenging artificial intelligence firms' argument that all AI training should be considered fair use, the Trump administration fired the head of the Copyright Office, Shira Perlmutter—sparking speculation that the controversial report hastened her removal. Tensions have apparently only escalated since. Now, as industry advocates decry the report as overstepping the office's authority, social mediapostson Monday described an apparent standoff at the Copyright Office between Capitol Police and men rumored to be with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). A source familiar with the mattertold Wiredthat the men were actually \"Brian Nieves, who claimed he was the new deputy librarian, and Paul Perkins, who said he was the new acting director of the Copyright Office, as well as acting Registrar,\" but it remains \"unclear whether the men accurately identified themselves.\" A spokesperson for the Capitol Police told Wired that no one was escorted off the premises or denied entry to the office. Perlmutter's firing followed Donald Trump's removal of Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, who, NPRnoted, was the first African American to hold the post. Responding to public backlash, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed that the firing was due to \"quite concerning things that she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children.\" The Library of Congress houses the Copyright Office, and critics suggested Trump's firings were unacceptable intrusions into cultural institutions that are supposed to operate independently of the executive branch. In astatement, Rep. Joe Morelle (D.-N.Y.) condemned Perlmutter's removal as \"a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis.\" Accusing Trump of trampling Congress' authority, he suggested that Musk and other tech leaders racing to dominate the AI industry stood to directly benefit from Trump's meddling at the Copyright Office. Likely most threatening to tech firms, the guidance from Perlmutter's Office not only suggested that AI training on copyrighted works may not be fair use when outputs threaten to disrupt creative markets—as publishers and authors have argued in several lawsuits aimed at the biggest AI firms—but also encouraged more licensing to compensate creators. \"It is surely no coincidence [Trump] acted less than a day after she refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk’s efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models,\" Morelle said, seemingly referencing Musk's xAI chatbot, Grok. Agreeing with Morelle, Courtney Radsch—the director of the Center for Journalism & Liberty at the left-leaning think tank the Open Markets Institute—said in a statement provided to Ars that Perlmutter's firing \"appears directly linked to her office's new AI report questioning unlimited harvesting of copyrighted materials.\" \"This unprecedented executive intrusion into the Library of Congress comes directly after Perlmutter released a copyright report challenging the tech elite's fundamental claim: unlimited access to creators' work without permission or compensation,\" Radsch said. And it comes \"after months of lobbying by the corporate billionaires\" who \"donated\" millions to Trump's inauguration and \"have lapped up the largess of government subsidies as they pursue AI dominance.\" The report that the Copyright Office released on Friday is not finalized but is not expected to change radically, unless Trump's new acting head potentially intervenes to overhaul the guidance. It comes after the Copyright Office parsed more than 10,000 comments debating whether creators should and could feasibly be compensated for the use of their works in AI training. \"The stakes are high,\" the office acknowledged, but ultimately, there must be an effective balance struck between the public interests in \"maintaining a thriving creative community\" and \"allowing technological innovation to flourish.\" Notably, the office concluded that the first and fourth factors of fair use—which assess the character of the use (and whether it is transformative) and how that use affects the market—are likely to hold the most weight in court. According to Radsch, the report \"raised crucial points that the tech elite don’t want acknowledged.\" First, the Copyright Office acknowledged that it's an open question how much data an AI developer needs to build an effective model. Then, they noted that there's a need for a consent framework beyond putting the onus on creators to opt their works out of AI training, and perhaps most alarmingly, they concluded that \"AI trained on copyrighted works could replace original creators in the marketplace.\" \"Commenters painted a dire picture of what unlicensed training would mean for artists’ livelihoods,\" the Copyright Office said, while industry advocates argued that giving artists the power to hamper or \"kill\" AI development could result in \"far less competition, far less innovation, and very likely the loss of the United States’ position as the leader in global AI development.\" To prevent both harms, the Copyright Office expects that some AI training will be deemed fair use, such as training viewed as transformative, because resulting models don't compete with creative works. Those uses threaten no market harm but rather solve a societal need, such as language models translating texts, moderating content, or correcting grammar. Or in the case of audio models, technology that helps producers clean up unwanted distortion might be fair use, where models that generate songs in the style of popular artists might not, the office opined. But while \"training a generative AI foundation model on a large and diverse dataset will often be transformative,\" the office said that \"not every transformative use is a fair one,\" especially if the AI model's function performs the same purpose as the copyrighted works they were trained on. Consider an example like chatbots regurgitating news articles, as is alleged inThe New York Times' dispute with OpenAIover ChatGPT. \"In such cases, unless the original work itself is being targeted for comment or parody, it is hard to see the use as transformative,\" the Copyright Office said. One possible solution for AI firms hoping to preserve utility of their chatbots could be effective filters that \"prevent the generation of infringing content,\" though. Only courts can effectively weigh the balance of fair use, the Copyright Office said. Perhaps importantly, however, the thinking of one of the first judges to weigh the question—in a case challengingMeta's torrenting of a pirated books datasetto train its AI models—seemed to align with the Copyright Office guidance at a recent hearing. Mulling whether Meta infringed on book authors' rights, US District Judge Vince Chhabria explained why he doesn't immediately \"understand how that can be fair use.\" \"You have companies using copyright-protected material to create a product that is capable of producing an infinite number of competing products,\" Chhabria said. \"You are dramatically changing, you might even say obliterating, the market for that person's work, and you're saying that you don't even have to pay a license to that person.\" Some AI critics think the courts have already indicated which way they are leaning. In a statement to Ars, a New York Times spokesperson suggested that \"both the Copyright Office and courts have recognized what should be obvious: when generative AI products give users outputs that compete with the original works on which they were trained, that unprecedented theft of millions of copyrighted works by developers for their own commercial benefit is not fair use.\" The NYT spokesperson further praised the Copyright Office for agreeing that using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI to surface copyrighted content \"is less likely to be transformative where the purpose is to generate outputs that summarize or provide abridged versions of retrieved copyrighted works, such as news articles, as opposed to hyperlinks.\" If courts agreed on the RAG finding, that could potentially disrupt AI search models from every major tech company. The backlash from industry stakeholders was immediate. The president and CEO of a trade association called the Computer & Communications Industry Association, Matt Schruers, said the report raised several concerns, particularly by endorsing \"an expansive theory of market harm for fair use purposes that would allow rightsholders to block any use that might have a general effect on the market for copyrighted works, even if it doesn’t impact the rightsholder themself.\" Similarly, the tech industry policy coalition Chamber of Progress warned that \"the report does not go far enough to support innovation and unnecessarily muddies the waters on what should be clear cases of transformative use with copyrighted works.\" Both groups celebrated the fact that the final decision on fair use would rest with courts. The Copyright Office agreed that \"it is not possible to prejudge the result in any particular case\" but said that precedent supports some \"general observations.\" Those included suggesting that licensing deals may be appropriate where uses are not considered fair without disrupting \"American leadership\" in AI, as some AI firms have claimed. \"These groundbreaking technologies should benefit both the innovators who design them and the creators whose content fuels them, as well as the general public,\" the report said, ending with the office promising to continue working with Congress to inform AI laws. Also among those \"general observations,\" the Copyright Office wrote that \"making commercial use of vast troves of copyrighted works to produce expressive content that competes with them in existing markets, especially where this is accomplished through illegal access, goes beyond established fair use boundaries.\" The report seemed to suggest that courts and the Copyright Office may also be aligned on AI firms' use of pirated or illegally accessed paywalled content for AI training. Judge Chhabria only considered Meta's torrenting in the book authors' case to be \"kind of messed up,\" prioritizing the fair use question, and the Copyright Office similarly only recommended that \"the knowing use of a dataset that consists of pirated or illegally accessed works should weigh against fair use without being determinative.\" However, torrenting should be a black mark, the Copyright Office suggested. \"Gaining unlawful access\" does bear \"on the character of the use,\" the office noted, arguing that \"training on pirated or illegally accessed material goes a step further\" than simply using copyrighted works \"despite the owners' denial of permission.\" Perhaps if authors can prove that AI models trained on pirated works led to lost sales, the office suggested that a fair use defense might not fly. \"The use of pirated collections of copyrighted works to build a training library, or the distribution of such a library to the public, would harm the market for access to those Works,\" the office wrote. \"And where training enables a model to output verbatim or substantially similar copies of the works trained on, and those copies are readily accessible by end users, they can substitute for sales of those works.\" Likely frustrating Meta—which iscurrently fighting to keep leeching evidence outof the book authors' case—the Copyright Office suggested that \"the copying of expressive works from pirate sources in order to generate unrestricted content that competes in the marketplace, when licensing is reasonably available, is unlikely to qualify as fair use.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "New pope chose his name based on AI’s threats to “human dignity”",
    "article_text": "Pope Leo XIV warns AI could threaten workers as industrial revolution did in the 1800s. Last Thursday, white smoke emerged from a chimney at the Sistine Chapel, signaling that cardinals hadelected a new pope. That's a rare event in itself, but one of the many unprecedented aspects of the election of Chicago-born Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV is one of the main reasons he chose his papal name: artificial intelligence. On Saturday, the new pope gave hisfirst addressto the College of Cardinals, explaining his name choice as a continuation of Pope Francis' concerns about technological transformation. \"Sensing myself called to continue in this same path, I chose to take the name Leo XIV,\" hesaidduring the address. \"There are different reasons for this, but mainly becausePope Leo XIIIin his historic EncyclicalRerum Novarumaddressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution.\" In his address, Leo XIV explicitly described \"artificial intelligence\" developments as \"another industrial revolution,\" positioning himself to address this technological shift as his namesake had done over a century ago. As the head of an ancient religious organization that spans millennia, the pope's talk about AI creates a somewhat head-spinning juxtaposition, but Leo XIV isn't the first pope to focus on defending human dignity in the age of AI. Pope Francis, who died in April, first established AI as a Vatican priority, aswe reportedin August 2023 when he warned during his 2023 World Day of Peace message that AI should not allow \"violence and discrimination to take root.\" In January of this year, Francisfurther elaboratedon his warnings about AI with reference to a \"shadow of evil\" that potentially looms over the field in a document called \"Antiqua et Nova\" (meaning \"the old and the new\"). \"Like any product of human creativity, AI can be directed toward positive or negative ends,\" Francis said in January. \"When used in ways that respect human dignity and promote the well-being of individuals and communities, it can contribute positively to the human vocation. Yet, as in all areas where humans are called to make decisions, the shadow of evil also looms here. Where human freedom allows for the possibility of choosing what is wrong, the moral evaluation of this technology will need to take into account how it is directed and used.\" While Pope Francis led the call for respecting human dignity in the face of AI, it's worth looking a little deeper into the historical inspiration for Leo XIV's name choice. In the 1891 encyclical Rerum Novarum, the earlier Leo XIII directly confronted the labor upheaval of theIndustrial Revolution, which generated unprecedented wealth and productive capacitybut came with severe human costs. At the time, factory conditions had created what the popecalled\"the misery and wretchedness pressing so unjustly on the majority of the working class.\" Workers faced 16-hour days, child labor, dangerous machinery, and wages that barely sustained life. The 1891 encyclical rejected both unchecked capitalism and socialism, instead proposing Catholic social doctrine that defended workers' rights to form unions, earn living wages, and rest on Sundays. Leo XIII argued that labor possessed inherent dignity and that employers held moral obligations to their workers. The document shaped modern Catholic social teaching and influenced labor movements worldwide, establishing the church as an advocate for workers caught between industrial capital and revolutionary socialism. Just as mechanization disrupted traditional labor in the 1890s, artificial intelligence nowpotentially threatens employment patternsandhuman dignityin ways that Pope Leo XIV believes demand similar moral leadership from the church. \"In our own day,\" Leo XIV concluded in his formal address on Saturday, \"the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defense of human dignity, justice, and labor.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Germ-theory skeptic RFK Jr. goes swimming in sewage-tainted water",
    "article_text": "The National Park Services bars all swimming and wading due to the health hazard. When you don’t believe in germ theory, the world is your oyster—or maybe your bathtub. Over the weekend, America's top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.,shared pictures on social mediaof himself fully submerged in the sewage-tinged waters of Rock Creek in Washington, DC. His grandchildren were also pictured playing in the water. The creek is known for having a sewage overflow problem and posing a health hazard to any who enter it. The National Park Service, which manages the Rock Creek Park, strictly bars all swimming and wading in Rock Creek and the park's other waterways due to the contamination, specifically \"high levels of bacteria.\" A notice on the NPS website advises \"Stay Dry, Stay Safe,\" warning, \"Rock Creek has high levels of bacteria and other infectious pathogens that make swimming, wading, and other contact with the water a hazard to human (and pet) health. Please protect yourself and your pooches by staying on trails and out of the creek. All District waterways are subject to a swim ban—this means wading, too!\" In images shared on social media, Kennedy can be seen getting fully underwater, including his head, and then splashing around with several of his grandchildren. Kennedy, who does not have any background in medicine or science, was a long-time anti-vaccine advocate before President Trump appointed him to be health secretary. In a 2021 book, Kennedy indicated that he does not believe in germ theory, the fundamental concept that microscopic pathogens, such as those abundant in sewage, are the cause of disease. The urban creek is contaminated mainly because of the numerous century-old municipal sewer lines that run under the park. These lines have cracked over time and leak sewage, according to Marchant Wentworth, an environmental consultant who submitted a report on the problem to the DC Council in 2021. Inan opinion piece in The Washington Post, Wentworth wrote about the report's findings and the dangers of the creek's water. While sewage pollution is most acute after rains, experts found that the creek's bacterial counts—particularlyE. colicounts—were dangerously high all the time. Wentworth wrote: For example, on July 14, 2015, the DC Department of Energy and the Environment found bacteria levels over 2,420 times the most probable number of colonies in 100 milliliters (MPN). This is far in excess of the Environmental Protection Agency standard of 410 MPN. On that same day, no rain was detected in any of three rain gauges around the city. Similarly, on Aug. 27, 2016, at the water sampling site maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey, the bacteria level was measured at an astoundingly dangerous 40,000 MPN. No rain was reported either that day or the day before. In March,the NPS announcedthat it had completed an environmental assessment and approved a proposal by DC Water to construct a tunnel to try to reduce sewage overflow from getting into the creek. The tunnel will be along Piney Branch stream, a tributary to Rock Creek. \"Currently, around 40 million gallons of stormwater combined with untreated sewage overflow into Piney Branch each year,\" the NPS wrote. It's unclear where Kennedy and his grandchildren went swimming in Rock Creek over the weekend. But he noted in his social media post that they had also been hiking in Dumbarton Oaks Park, an area that is downstream of Piney Branch.

    "article_text": "US drops China tariff from 145% to 30% while governments seek longer-term deal. The US and China agreed to lower tariffs by 115 percent for 90 days while they continue talks on a longer-term agreement, sending stocks soaring on hopes that President Trump's trade war won't be as damaging to the two economies as previously feared. \"As part of a deal hammered out in Geneva over the weekend, the US will lower additional tariffs on Chinese goods to 30 percent from 145 percent and China will reduce duties on US imports to 10 percent from 125 percent. China said it would also 'suspend or cancel' non-tariff measures taken against the US,\" the Financial Timeswrote. Trump recentlyappeared eager to make a deal, while China seemed content to wait for better terms. The White House todaycalledthe temporary deal \"a historic trade win for the United States\" that \"demonstrat[es] President Trump's unparalleled expertise in securing deals that benefit the American people.\" The White House said the agreement will \"reduce China's tariffs and eliminate retaliation, retain a US baseline tariff on China, and set a path for future discussions to open market access for American exports.\" Ajoint statement with Chinasaid the two governments recognize \"the importance of a sustainable, long-term, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship.\" The deal announced today \"did not address what would happen to low-value 'de minimis' ecommerce packages shipped from China to the US,\" Reuterswrote. The US imposed 120 percent tariffs on those packages.According to Axios, a White House official confirmed that small packages from China are still subject to 120 percent tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that both governments want to avoid a severing of their economies but that the US still plans to impose tariffs on specific items that the White House wants to be produced in the US. Bessentsaidthat \"neither side wants a generalized decoupling. The US is going to do a strategic decoupling in terms of the items that we discovered during COVID were of national security interests, whether it's semiconductors, medicine, steel, so we still have generalized tariffs on some of those, but both sides agree we do not want a generalized decoupling.\" The S&P 500 index was up about 2.6 percent today as of this writing, while the tech-focused NASDAQ Composite index had risen about 3.5 percent. Neither index has recovered to its record high after months of turmoil caused by Trump's tariffs. Reuters quotedZhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management in Hong Kong, as saying that the 90-day deal was better than he expected. \"I thought tariffs would be cut to somewhere around 50 percent,\" Zhang said. \"Obviously, this is very positive news for economies in both countries and for the global economy and makes investors much less concerned about the damage to global supply chains in the short term.\" In April, Trumpraised tariffs on Chinawhile pausing tariff hikes on other countries for 90 days.

    "title": "Nintendo warns that it can brick Switch consoles if it detects hacking, piracy",
    "article_text": "Updated EULA language includes new threat to \"render the... device permanently unusable.\" Switch and Switch 2 users who try to hack their consoles or play pirated copies of games may find their devices rendered completely inoperable by Nintendo. That new warning was buried in a recent update to the Nintendo User Account Agreement, asfirst noticed by Game File last week. Nintendo'sMay 2025 EULA updateadds new language concerning the specific ways users are allowed to use \"Nintendo Account Services\" on the console, a term defined here to encompass the use of \"video games and add-on content.\" Under the new EULA, any unlicensed use of the system not authorized by Nintendo could lead the company to \"render the Nintendo Account Servicesand/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part.\"(Emphasis added.) That language would apply to both the current Switch and the upcoming Switch 2. Later in the same EULA, Nintendo adds new language clarifying that it reserves the right to \"suspend your access to any or all Nintendo Account Services, in our sole discretion and without prior notice to you.\" That suspension can even come before a EULA violation occurs if Nintendo has \"a reasonable belief such a violation... will occur, or as we otherwise determine to be reasonably necessary for legal, technical or commercial reasons, such as to prevent harm to other users or the Nintendo Account Services.\" So what kind of Switch usage counts as a \"violation\" here? Unsurprisingly, playing pirated games is high on the list; the EULA now specifically calls out \"obtain[ing], install[ing] or us[ing] any unauthorized copies of Nintendo Account Services.\" That language would likely apply to users with hacked console hardware and those who use any number of third-party flash carts to play pirated games. But the EULA also restricts a wide array of largely synonymous verbs associated with hacking your own console for potential non-piracy uses. That includes restricting the right to \"modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble all or any portion of the Nintendo Account Services...\" as well as the ability to \"bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo Account Services, including through the use of any hardware or software.\" Nintendo haslong had robust systems in place for detecting when hacked systems are being played onlineand has not been shy aboutissuing device-level bansto stop those consoles from ever accessing any of Nintendo'sonlineservices. But the new EULA language suggests that Nintendo is now preparing the ability to completely disable Switch devices that run afoul of the usage agreement, even for offline use. It's currently unclear what technical means Nintendo would use to enforce this new ultimate punishment for Switch hackers or if users might be able to restore functionality to any remotely bricked consoles. Still, the new language suggests that Nintendo is prepared to play hardball inits ongoing waragainsthackersandpirates.

    "title": "A new era in cancer therapies is at hand",
    "article_text": "New therapeutic strategies build on the success of immunotherapy. In 2012, clinicians at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia treated Emily Whitehead, a 6-year-old with leukemia, with altered immune cells from her own body. At the time, the treatment was experimental, but it worked: The cells targeted the cancer and eradicated it. Thirteen years later, Whitehead is still cancer-free. The modified cells, calledCAR-T cells, are a form of immunotherapy, where doctors change parts of the immune system into cancer-attacking instruments. About five years after Whitehead’streatment, the first CAR-T drugs were approved by the FDA and were heralded, along withimmunotherapymore broadly, as one of the most promising modern cancer treatments. Today, there are seven FDA-approved CAR-T therapies, including the one used to treat Whitehead. Since then, however,studieshave linked CAR-T to fatal complications due to treatment toxicity, and the treatment has had a harder time addressing certain types of cancers, particularly solid tumors affecting the breast and pancreas, although some small clinical trials have beenstarting to showpositive results for solid cancers. “After a decade, a decade and a half, we arrive at the point that there are patients who answer, most of the patients still do not answer,” said George Calin, a researcher at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Now experts say that new therapies are beginning to surpass challenges that previous treatments couldn’t, providing safer, more targeted delivery directly to tumors. These include drugs that contain radioactive substances, called radiopharmaceuticals, which are used to diagnose or treat cancer; medications that can influence the genes that spur or suppress tumor growth; and therapeutic cancer vaccines. These approaches have shown promise in the lab, and researchers and companies are now conducting various stages of human clinical trials to explore their effectiveness. And some promising treatments have even gained approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The hope is that improving on these strategies will ultimately help treat even the most resistant types of cancer. Despite researchers’ excitement for innovative treatments, there is rampant online misinformation and there are occasions in which companies have been found to tout and sell fake cures, said Kathrin Dvir, an oncologist and researcher at Moffitt Cancer Center. But other scientists remain optimistic about the future of cancer research, Calin said: “All the time in science, you have to open the door with something new.” Historically, one of the biggest challenges in cancer treatments has been the lack of specific targets. The typical standards of care — chemotherapy and radiation — kill off not only cancer cells, but also healthy ones. (This is one reason why cancer patients on these treatments experience hair loss, nausea, and other symptoms.) In recent years, scientists have thus aimed to develop therapies that only attack cancer cells, leaving the rest of the body unharmed. One way to achieve this is through more precise targeting of the tumor. In one of these approaches, drugs act as a ferry, delivering radioactive molecules directly to the cancer. They do this by targeting proteins that are only present on the surface of specific tumors. Take, for example, prostate cancer. Here, the cancerous cells are sensitive to radiation, so some researchers are working on drugs containing unstable chemical elements that emit radiation — radioactive isotopes, or radiopharmaceuticals — to facilitate imaging of the tumors and provide enough radiation to treat them. Already, the field of radiopharmaceuticals has seen growth following successes like the brand name drugsPluvictofor prostate cancer andLutatherafor neuroendocrine tumors, which reportedly offer improved quality of life compared to traditional treatments. Additionally, using radioisotopes for imaging could also allow researchers to diagnose and classify patients much better to provide personalized care, said Jason Lewis, a radiochemist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. And while radiopharmaceutical therapy can have side effects, he added, it’s “designed to minimize radiation to healthy tissues.” Other therapies, calledantibody-drug conjugates, act similarly: They shuttle molecules that can kill the cancer cells via antibodies that can dock on tumors. About a dozen of such drugs have been approved by the FDA for various types of cancer. There are also new vaccines to help the immune system ward off cancer, using the key approach behind a type of COVID-19 vaccine — mRNA technology. For example, one of the companies that developed one of the COVID-19 shots, BioNTech, is working on a vaccine calledBNT116designed to elicit immune reactions to treat a type of lung cancer, which is currently recruiting about 150 participants across the world toundergo safety testing. mRNA therapeutic vaccines for cancer, which use messenger RNA as blueprint material so the body can create proteins that are unique to the tumor to help elicit an immune response, may offer several advantages. The shots can be personalized, for instance, to the patients’ own tumors, said Siow Ming Lee, an oncologist at University College London Hospitals and one of the lead researchers of the trial. Other vaccines arealso in the works. “We are in this sort of new era now,” he said. Another type of genetic molecule could also be a target to help treat cancer. Some RNAs, called microRNAs, can act on genes that are responsible for tumor growth. Researchers like Calin are developing small molecules that bind to cancer-related microRNAs, to turn them off and try to halt the disease’s spread. With FDA approvals, human clinical trials underway and, with promising preclinical data for many of these therapies, the researchers who spoke to Undark said that the future appears bright. “We're not just seeing these dramatic improvements in outcomes and survival for patients with some indications, but the quality of life,” Lewis said. As more of these latest cancer technologies do get approved for treatment, new approaches can bring new problems, experts say. For example, with radiotherapeutics, one big challenge is to source enough radioisotopes for the drugs, and have a specialized workforce to handle radioactivity, said Lewis. For microRNAS, it’s tricky to identify exactly which type to target for a particular cancer, Calin emphasized. And there are also companies that are trying to capitalize on new, unproven technologies and drugs prematurely. The company ExThera Medical, for instance, has been charging patients tens of thousands of dollars for unproven therapies, according to arecent reportby The New York Times. “All over the world, there are many so-called new therapeutics that are not well-tested and not well-developed,” said Calin. Dvir encounters misinformation at her clinic almost daily, she said. “Maybe some of those have some data in the preclinical, in animal studies — it doesn't mean that it works on the human because we need data before you expose people to those therapies.” Although the FDAfaces budget cuts, some of the researchers and clinicians that Undark spoke to insist that the agency will weed out bad science. If not, the clinicians that Undark spoke with said that they can also help guide patients toward evidence-based treatments. Ultimately, researchers want to continue to improve these treatments to see if they might work in tandem. “I think the name of the game in the next five to 10 years is combinations,” said Dvir. Already, there are trials looking at precisely how using different approaches together might boost their ability to treat cancer, she adds. “We know that these drugs work in synergy. It's just finding the right combination that is effective but not too toxic.” This article was originally published onUndark. Read theoriginal article.

    "title": "The tinkerers who opened up a fancy coffee maker to AI brewing",
    "article_text": "An Ars author slightly surrenders to chatbot-made profiles and automated brews. It’s taken a while, but I’ve finally found the thing I want generative AI to do for me: program a damn fine cup of coffee. Program, that is, but not make—that’s the job of theFellow Aiden, a coffee maker thatcrafts automated, precision pour-oversin a countertop-ready cube. Thanks to other folks who love their Aidens, as well as API tweaking and large language model training, I can hand this mechanical robot a GPT-generated recipe and get impressive coffee out of it. Strictly speaking, absolutely none of this is necessary. Humans can make great coffee with fresh beans, decent gear, time, patience, and experience. Experiments will reveal the differences in light and dark roasts, Ethiopian and Venezuelan, washed and honey-processed beans, or how often one agitates the grounds. But faced with something brand new, even an experienced brewer can be stumped and spend a good deal of time and none-too-cheap beans trying to get everything just right. I've been hesitant to use generative AI in my personal life. Having a bot to ask for a pour-over starting point has softened me, slightly, on large language models. I wanted to learn more about what I was using and how it worked. So I asked the people who made these brewing and sharing tools what was going on behind the scenes. Brandon Dixon, a Partner AI Strategist at Microsoft, is serious enough about coffee to have considered leaving a career in digital security and AI to start his own roastery (and build the software to manage it). “If I had to summarize all I learned down to one simple fact, it’s this: Not every idea or passionneedsto become a business,” Dixon wrote, just after turning back in 2021. So Dixon was in the right place when Fellow released its Aiden brewer in the fall of 2024. He was intrigued byFellow’s Drops program, which ships buyers boutique beans with a matching Aiden brew profile, curated andcuppedby experts. Dixon enjoyed some Drops but also grew wary of the pricing (such as $24 for an 8.8-ounce bag, plus $5 shipping). And he wanted to try out local and independent roasters’ wares without having to dial in every variation of temperature and timing (literally, as the only way to program an Aiden before an update to its companion app was byturning a dial). “I’ve worked for two years applying AI to security problems, and I thought the Aiden could be a great way to tap into the creativity of the models,” Dixon said in a message with Ars. But first, Dixon needed to figure out how to talk to his web-connected brewer. Asdetailed in his blog post, Dixon used theProxyman app, and, in 10 minutes, he had “a full enumeration of the Aiden API calls along with sample requests/responses.”Dixon built out his findings into a Python library, which eventually helped other people builda Home Assistant integrationand an entirely different AI tool, which we’ll get to in a bit. Then he got to work on the AI part. Dixon allowed ChatGPT’s o1 model to “lead the way on the application development,” giving it specifications and nudges and feeding its errors back in as adjustments. It wasn’t automatic; there was “attention drift” and “dimensional baggage,” among other issues. But after “about 30 turns” and cross-checking it againstDeepSeek R1’s output from a similar spec, he was pretty close. You can see one of the base ChatGPT prompts powering his appin its files: Assume the role of a master coffee brewer. You focus exclusively on the pour-over method and specialty coffee only. You often work with single origin coffees, but you also experiment with blends. Your recipes are executed by a robot, not a human, so maximum precision can be achieved. Temperatures are all maintained and stable in all steps. Always lead with the recipe, and only include explanations below that text, NOT inline. After this role-playing exercise, Dixon makes ChatGPT reformat its system and then \"assume the role of a data engineer\" before processing brewing knowledge into strict profile parameters. You can hostDixon’s appon your own ortry it out on a Streamlit site. It requires a ChatGPT API key to run and requires putting in your Fellow credentials. I asked Dixon about a nagging thought I had about this niche inside a niche. Coffee is grown and processed by humans, roasted by humans, and packaged and sold and brewed by humans. Is asking a language model to pull in the web’s knowledge, then act like a formula-focused barista, commoditizing and dehumanizing the process? Dixon was of two minds about it. “People aren’t great at interpreting a bunch of numbers and thinking, ‘Ah, this is going to be a good coffee brew,’” he said. An AI prompt like his, Dixon said, “democratizes knowledge, which is really powerful.” Especially if, for example, “all of a sudden, prices start going up, beans get expensive to buy, and it’s harder to enjoy the learning process.” At the same time, people should understand that recipes from any prompt are “a starting point” and that it’s the coffee maker's job to “learn from there what they like,” Dixon said. It was important to “celebrate the people along the chain that did a great job,” Dixon said, which too much emphasis on AI could diminish. It is just one tool, and he’s hoping people make good use of it. “If you’re naturally curious, AI is awesome for this kind of thing,” Dixon said. “You’re learning things far faster than you ever could have learned by trial and error.” Dixon’s greatest hope (noted on his blog post) is that Fellow opens up the Aiden brewer and app to greater community sharing and learning. The Drops program is great, but coffee enthusiasts could learn a lot more from each other, he said. That’s where two other tinkerers come in. (Ars contacted Fellow Products for comment on AI brewing and profile sharing and will update this post if we get a response.) Aiden profiles are shared and added to Aiden units through Fellow’sbrew.linkservice. But the profiles are not offered in an easy-to-sort database, nor are they easy to scan for details. So Aiden enthusiast and hobbyist coder Kevin Anderson createdbrewshare.coffee, which gathers both general and bean-based profiles, makes them easy to search and load, and adds optional but quite helpful suggested grind sizes. As a non-professional developer jumping into a public offering, he had to work hard on data validation, backend security, and mobile-friendly design. “I just had a bit of an idea and a hobby, so I thought I’d try and make it happen,” Anderson writes. With his tool, brew links can be stored and shared more widely, which helped both Dixon and another AI/coffee tinkerer. Gabriel Levine, director of engineering atretail analytics firm Leap Inc., lost hisOXO coffee maker(aka the “Barista Brain”) to malfunction just before the Aiden debuted. The Aiden appealed to Levine as a way to move beyond his coffee rut—a “nice chocolate-y medium roast, about as far as I went,” he told Ars. “This thing that can be hyper-customized to different coffees to bring out their characteristics; [it] really kind of appealed to that nerd side of me,” Levine said. Levine had also been doing AI stuff for about 10 years, or “since before everyone called it AI—predictive analytics, machine learning.” He described his career as “both kind of chief AI advocate and chief AI skeptic,” alternately driving real findings and talking down “everyone who… just wants to type, ‘how much money should my business make next year’ and call that work.” Like Dixon, Levine's work and fascination with Aiden ended up intersecting. The author's conversation with the Aiden Profile Creator, which pulled in both brewing knowledge and product info for a widely available coffee: Levine’sAiden Profile Creatoris a ChatGPT prompt set up with a custom prompt and told to weight certain knowledge more heavily. What kind of prompt and knowledge? Levine didn’t want to give away his exact work. But he cited resources like theSpecialty Coffee Association of AmericaandJames Hoffman’s coffee guidesas examples of what he fed it. What it does with that knowledge is something of a mystery to Levine himself. “There’s this kind of blind leap, where it’s grabbing the relevant pieces of information from the knowledge base, biasing toward all the expert advice and extraction science, doing something with it, and then I take that something and coerce it back into a structured output I can put on your Aiden,” Levine said. It’s a blind leap, but it has landed just right for me so far. I’ve made four profiles with Levine’s prompt based on beans I’ve bought:Stumptown’s Hundred Mile, a light-roasted batch from Jimma, Ethiopia, fromSmall Planes,Lost Sock’s Western Housefilter blend, and some dark-roast beans given as a gift. With the Western House, Levine’s profile creator said it aimed to “balance nutty sweetness, chocolate richness, and bright cherry acidity, using a slightly stepped temperature profile and moderate pulse structure.” Theresulting profilehas worked great, even if the chatbot named it “Cherry Timber.” Levine’s chatbot relies on two important things: Dixon’s work in revealing Fellow’s Aiden API and his own workhorse Aiden. Every Aiden profile link is created on a machine, so every profile created by Levine’s chat is launched, temporarily, from the Aiden in his kitchen, then deleted. “I’ve hit an undocumented limit on the number of profiles you can have on one machine, so I’ve had to do some triage there,” he said. As of April 22, nearly 3,600 profiles had passed through Levine’s Aiden. “My hope with this is that it lowers the bar to entry,” Levine said, “so more people get into these specialty roasts and it drives people to support local roasters, explore their world a little more. I feel like that certainly happened to me.” Credit:\n\n          \n          Fellow Products Having admitted to myself that I find something generated by ChatGPT prompts genuinely useful, I've softened my stance slightly on LLM technology, if not the hype. Used within very specific parameters, with everything second-guessed, I'm getting more comfortable asking chat prompts for formatted summaries on topics with lots of expertise available. I do my own writing, and I don't waste server energy on things I can, and should, research myself. I even generally resist calling language model prompts \"AI,\" given the term's baggage. But I've found one way to appreciate its possibilities. This revelation may not be new to someone already steeped in the models. But having tested—and tasted—my first big experiment while willfully engaging with a brewing bot, I'm a bit more awake.

    "title": "The Last of Us episode 5 recap: There’s something in the air",
    "article_text": "Omnipresent threats beset our heroes as they wade deeper into Seattle. New episodes of season 2 ofThe Last of Usare premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)will be talking about them here every Monday morning. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviouslyheavy spoilerscontained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh. Andrew: We're five episodes into this season ofThe Last of Us, and most of the infected we've seen have still been of the \"mindless, screeching horde\" variety. But in the first episode of the season, we saw Ellie encounter a single \"smart\" infected person, a creature that retained some sense of strategy and a self-preservation instinct. It implied that the show's monsters were not done evolving and that the seemingly stable fragments of civilization that had managed to take root were founded on a whole bunch of incorrect assumptions about what these monsters were and what they could do. Amidst all the human-created drama, the changing nature of the Mushroom Zombie Apocalypse is the backdrop of this week's entire episode, starting and ending with the revelation that a 2003-vintage cordyceps nest has become a hotbed of airborne spores, ready to infect humans with no biting required. This is news to me, as a Non-Game Player! But Kyle, I'm assuming this is another shoe that you knew the series was going to drop. Kyle: Actually, no. I suppose it's possible I'm forgetting something, but I think the \"some infected are actually pretty smart now\" storyline is completely new to the show. It's just one of myriad ways the show has diverged enough from the games at this point that I legitimately don't know where it's going to go or how it's going to get there at any given moment, which is equal parts fun and frustrating. I will say that the \"smart zombies\" made for my first real \"How are Ellie and Dina going to get out of this one?\" moment, as Dina's improvised cage was being actively torn apart by a smart and strong infected. But then, lo and behold, here came Deus Ex Jesse to save things with a timely re-entrance into the storyline proper. You had to know we hadn't seen the last of him, right? Andrew: As with last week's subway chase, I'm coming to expect that any time Ellie and Dina seem to be truly cornered, some other entity is going to swoop down and \"save\" them at the last minute. This week it was an actual ally instead of another enemy that just happened to take out the people chasing Ellie and Dina. But it's the same basic narrative fake-out. I assume their luck will run out at some point, but I also suspect that if it comes, that point will be a bit closer to the season finale. Kyle: Without spoiling anything from the games, I will say you can expect both Ellie and Dina to experience their fair share of lucky and unlucky moments in the episodes to come. Speaking of unlucky moments, while our favorite duo is hiding in the park we get to see how the local cultists treat captured WLF members, and it is extremely not pretty. I'm repeating myself a bit from last week, but the lingering on these moments of torture feels somehow more gratuitous in an HBO show, even when compared to similarly gory scenes in the games. Andrew: Well we had just heard these cultists compared to \"Amish people\" not long before, and we already know they don't have tanks or machine guns or any of the other Standard IssueThe Last of UsParamilitary Goon gear that most other people have, so I guess you've got to do something to make sure the audience can actually take the cultists seriously as a threat. But yeah, if you're squeamish about blood-and-guts stuff, this one's hard to watch. I do find myself becoming more of a fan of Dina and Ellie's relationship, or at least of Dina as a character. Sure, her tragic backstory's a bit trite (she defuses this criticism by pointing out in advance that it is trite), but she's smart, she can handle herself, she is a good counterweight to Ellie's rush-in-shooting impulses. They are still, as Dina points out, doing something stupid and reckless. But I am at least rooting for them to make it out alive! Kyle: Personality wise the Dina/Ellie pairing has just as many charms as the Joel/Ellie pairing from last season. But while I always felt like Joel and Ellie had a clear motivation and end goal driving them forward, the thirst for revenge pushing Dina and Ellie deeper into Seattle starts to feel less and less relevant the more time goes on. The show seems to realize this, too, stopping multiple times since Joel's death to kind of interrogate whether tracking down these killers is worth it when the alternative is just going back to Jackson and prepping for a coming baby. It's like the writers are trying to convince themselves even as they're trying (and somewhat failing, in my opinion) to convince the audience of their just and worthy cause. Kyle: \"We killed Joel\" team member Nora definitely would have preferred if Ellie and Dina were playing that more domestic kind of game. As it stands, Ellie ends up pursuing her toward a miserable-looking death in a cordyceps-infested basement. The chase scene leading up to this mirrors a very similar one in the game in a lot of ways. But while I found it easy to suspend my disbelief for the (very scripted) chase on the PlayStation, watching it in a TV show made me throw up my hands and say \"come on, these heavily armed soldiers can't stop a little girl that's making this much ruckus?\" Andrew: Yeah Jesse can pop half a dozen \"smart\" zombies in half a dozen shots, but when it's a girl with a giant backpack running down an open hallway everyone suddenly hasStar WarsStormtrooper aim. The visuals of the cordyceps den, with the fungified guys breathing out giant clouds of toxic spores, is effective in its unsettling-ness, at least! This episode'sotherrevelation is that what Joel did to the Fireflies in the hospital at the end of last season is apparentlynotnews to Ellie, when she hears it from Nora in the episode's final moments. It could be that Ellie, Noted Liar, is lying about knowing this. But Ellie is also totally incapable of controlling her emotions, and I've got to think that if she had been surprised by this, we would have been able to tell. Kyle: Yeah, saying too much about what Ellie knows and when would be risking some major spoilers. For now I'll just say the way the show decided to mix things up by putting this detailed information in Nora's desperate, spore-infested mouth kind of landed with a wet thud for me. I was equally perplexed by the sudden jump cut from \"Ellie torturing a prisoner\" to \"peaceful young Ellie flashback\" at the end of the episode. Is the audience supposed to assume that this is what is going on inside Ellie's head or something? Or is the narrative just shifting without a clutch?

    "article_text": "Falloutisgoing beyond New Vegas. Monday, Prime Video announced thatseason two of the hitvideo game adaptation is debuting in December 2025, and that it will befollowed by a third season too. “The holidays came a little early this yearâwe are thrilled to be ending the world all over again for a third season ofFallout,” executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy said in a press release. âOn behalf of our brilliant cast and crew, our showrunners Geneva [Robertson-Dworet] and Graham [Wagner], and our partners at Bethesda, weâre grateful to our incredible collaborators at Amazon MGM Studios and to the amazing fans as we continue our adventures in the wasteland together.â Season one of the show ended with Lucy (Ella Purnell) and the Ghoul (Walton Goggins) teaming up to attempt to find the leaders of Vault-Tec, the company responsible for everyone’s favorite Fallout chambers, which also just so happened to cause the apocalyptic event that led to their use. And all signs point to that happening in New Vegas, one of the most notable locations from the hit video game series. “We are absolutely thrilled that our global Prime Video customers will be able to delve deeper into the wonderfully surreal and captivating world ofFallout,â Vernon Sanders, global head of television for Amazon MGM, said. âJonah, Lisa, Geneva, and Graham have done an exceptional job bringing this beloved video game franchise to vivid life on Prime Video. Together with our amazing partners at Bethesda Games and Bethesda Softworks, we are delighted to announce a third season ofFallout, well ahead of the much-anticipated debut of season two.” It will have been about a year and a half between seasons when season two debuts, so a 2027 premiere seems likely for season three.

    "title": "Final Fantasy X‘s Laughing Scene Is Now a Magic: The Gathering Card",
    "article_text": "This past weekendWizards of the Coast really lifted the lid on its upcomingÂFinal FantasyÂcrossover setforMagic: The Gathering, but the oodles of cards revealed there were apparently not enough. Today theÂMagicteam revealed evenÂmorecards to players, and they’re filled with incredible nods toÂFinal Fantasyhistory… including an absolute gem fromÂFinal Fantasy X. Today Wizards revealedthe full card listsfor each of the fourÂFinal Fantasypreconstructed Commander Decks that will launch alongside the expansion next month. The four decks are built around four iconic entries from the mainlineÂFinal Fantasyseries: Revival Trance, based onÂFinal Fantasy VI; Limit Break, based onFinal Fantasy VII; Counter Blitz, based aroundÂFinal Fantasy X; and Scions and Spellcraft, based aroundFinal Fantasy XIV. Each deck of 100 cards is completely themed for theÂFinal Fantasyset, from wholly new cards to re-flavored takes on already-existentMagiccards with new thematically appropriate art. One such re-flavor in the Counter Blitz deck is Inspiring Call, a green mana instant that has been around in variousÂMagicsets since it first appeared in 2015’sDragons of Tarkir. It’s a simple enough card, granting any creatures you control that you’ve given +1/+1 counters to temporary protection while also drawing a few cards. But in Counter Blitz, it becomes, well, more of an inspiring laugh: Yes, right down to the flavor text, we’re getting Yuna and Tidus’ infamous laugh scene fromÂFinal Fantasy Xin card form. An early moment in the game, the scene sees Yuna try to cheer Tidus up as the duo and the rest of the party prepare to carry on their pilgrimage to defeat the monstrous entity known as Sin, who Tidus has just learned (spoilers for a 24-year-old PS2 game) is actually seemingly a transformed corruption of his long-missing father, Jecht. Yuna, knowing her quest will eventually claim her life, tries to get Tidus to learn how to hide his emotions and put on a happy face, first literally and then through comically forced laughter. The rest isFinal FantasyÂmeme history: Although the purpose of the scene is that Tidus and Yuna’s laughter is meant to be forced and awkward sounding (as you can see above, they break out into genuine laughter immediately after), the clip of their barked laughs has spent the past two and a half decades taking on a life of its own as a viral meme, from goofy music edits to dunks on cringy video game voice acting (Xwas the firstÂFinal Fantasyto feature extensive voice acting). And now, its legacy is reclaimed inÂMagic. It’s just one of many great little nods and references throughout what we’ve seen of theÂFinal Fantasyset so far. The Commander Decks have revealed a ton of new cards in a similar vein that have great mechanical nods to their respective gamesâsome of my favorites includeZack FairinÂFFVII‘s, which lets you essentially replicate Cloud swiping Zack’s identity after his death, orChampions from BeyondinÂFFXIV‘s, a very nifty nod to the MMORPG’s party finder mechanic (andone of the coolest momentsin its expansionÂShadowbringers). Most of the nods are reverentially serious, befitting the passion that’s on display for this meeting of fantastical titans. But it’s nice that in cards like Inspiring Call’s remixing, theÂFinal Fantasyset knows when to have a bit of forced laughter at itself too.

    "title": "Alex Jones Shares Fake Photo of Pro-Ukraine Leaders With ‘Cocaine’ on Train",
    "article_text": "Video footage of European political leaders taking a train to Ukraine went viral on Sunday after conspiracy theorists claimed that it showed cocaine on a table in front of French President Emannuel Macron. Alex Jones, arguably America’s most prominent conspiracy theorist if you don’t count the President of the United States, even shared an image that had been altered to make it look more like a bag of cocaine. The controversy all started because European leaders were photographed on May 9, 2025, traveling on a trainto Ukraineto meet with that country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to discuss the war against Russia. Macron can be seen with Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the video and still photos captured by reporters. In the video, you can see Macron grab something white on the table in front of them. Jones and his ilk insisted that something nefarious was going on. “DEVELOPING SCANDAL: Macron, Starmer, and Merz caught on video on their return from Kiev,” Joneswrote, misidentifying the video as the leaders coming back from Kiev rather than the train ride there. The video was taken on May 9. “A bag of white powder on the table,” Jones continued. “Macron quickly pockets it, Merz hides the spoon. No explanation given. Zelensky, known cocaine enthusiast, had just hosted them. All three of the ‘leaders’ look completely cracked out.” DEVELOPING SCANDAL: Macron, Starmer, and Merz caught on video on their return from Kiev. A bag of white powder on the table.

All three of the âleadersââ¦pic.twitter.com/M2h5Fhzo5h — Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones)May 11, 2025 Starmer looks overly excited in one of the photos, but to say they look “completely cracked out” is ridiculous. And none of what Jones insisted is real.Getty Imageshas high-resolution photos that allow us to zoom in on the supposed bag of cocaine to better inspect what’s going on. And it’s clearly just a napkin or tissue. One of the images Jonesshared on Xactually looked much more like a bag of cocaine. But it’s been altered in some way. You can clearly see itâs a bag of Blow,.https://t.co/C3SSJzhKrSpic.twitter.com/dcRDn7uIgU — Alex Jones (@RealAlexJones)May 12, 2025 It’s unclear what kind of alterations Jones may have made to get the tissue to look like that, but our best guess is that he ran it through an AI image upscaler. Those kinds of tools will take lower-resolution images and try to make them appear sharper by smoothing edges. And as you can see, the image posted by Jones has an almost glassy shine. The tweet from Jones also claims there’s a spoon that was hidden by Merz. Getty Images doesn’t have a good angle on that object, so it’s difficult to say definitively what it is, but it really doesn’t look like a spoon. It’s goldish in color, as you can see below, and looks like some kind of clip or zip-tie that maybe had some function with the binders in front of them. But it doesn’t look like a spoon. The viral conspiracy theory has gotten a lot of attention, with over 26 million views on Jones’s tweet alone. And that forced the French president’s office to issue a denial, pointing out that it’sjust a tissue. When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation goes so far as to make a simple tissue look like drugs. This fake news is being spread by Franceâs enemies, both abroad and at home. We must remain vigilant against manipulation.pic.twitter.com/xyXhGm9Dsr — ÃlysÃ©e (@Elysee)May 11, 2025 The images posted to X by Jones haven’t received any Community Notes, the crowdsourced fact-checking program. X has become one of the largest hubs of misinformation on the internet ever since billionaire Elon Musk bought the site in late 2022. Musk welcomed back neo-Nazis like Nick Fuentes, anti-Muslim bigots like Laura Loomer, and conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, all of whom were previously banned on the platform. Jones and his far-right buddies have long spread conspiracy theories about Ukraine in an effort to undermine the country, since they admire Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. Jones has even suggested that he would beopen to movingto Russia. So whenever you see this kind of garbage being spread, it’s good to ask yourself what other motivations Jones may have for claiming the leaders of liberal democracies are doing illicit drugs. They tried it repeatedly with Zelensky, so why not try it with all his allies as well? Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "With Apple, the Most Interesting Gadgets Are Always Two Years Away",
    "article_text": "Appleâs spaceship headquarters in Cupertino, California, always has several UFOs circling around it, though it’s rare to see them land. If you read the most-cited reports from the most-prominent Apple rumormonger, Mark Gurman, the companyâs most-interesting inventions and gadgets are often two years away from full release. These reports may be enough to keep the public excited about Appleâs next move, but the hype won’t last forever if the goalposts keep moving. Bloombergâs Mark Gurmanwrotein his latest Power On newsletter Sunday that Apple has a big 2027 in store to mark the 20th anniversary of the iPhone. The tech reporter suggested weâdfinally see a folding iPhone. Apple may also follow through on that long-sought ultra-thin smartphone-like device thatâs a curved sheet of glass without any cutouts. Whatâs more, Gurman suggested Apple will finally revealnew smart glassesthat year. There could be that promisedrobotic arm attached to an iPad-like display. The tech media tends to follow Gurmanâs pronouncements as closely as they do Appleâs official releases, but if you do, youâll start to notice thereâs a trend about what he writes. Bloomberg last suggested the smart home robot arm could be here as soon as 2026. Last year, Gurmanproposedthe folding iPhone would also arrive in 2026 as well. Thatâs not to suggest that Gurman has some say over Appleâs project timelines, but Gurmanâs crystal ball consultations shouldnât be taken without a grain of salt. On Monday, Gurmanposted on Xdefending his original timeline for the folding iPhone arriving by the end of 2026. Responding to a MacRumors post, Gurman wrote: âThis idea Iâve changed timelines is nonsense but otherwise it adds some nice tension and inspiration for comments. Itâs always been 2026.â He also commented in a separate post that he âshould have been clearerâ regarding the accurate timeline for the folding iPhone. This idea Iâve changed timelines is nonsense but understand it adds some nice tension and inspiration for comments. Itâs always been 2026. My column yesterday is talking about items that will either launch or be in market for 2027. Itâll launch end of 26 and sell mostly in 27. — Mark Gurman (@markgurman)May 12, 2025 Recent reporting fromThe Informationand anupdated timelinefrom regular Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo both suggest a 2026 release date for the first folding iPhone. A second-gen version could be on its way in 2027, according to the analyst. These dates may change, and Apple can always push or pull projects based on its own metrics. Gurman got his start at 9to5Mac, but heâs been a Bloomberg reporter since 2016. Bloomberg hires reporters who have inside information who can regularly get scoops, which in turn helps the company sell its $32,000-a-year subscription to Bloomberg Terminal. Bloombergâs reporting shouldnât be discounted, but itâs important to understand Gurmanâs audience. Consumersâat least those who donât have stock in Appleâdonât care a lick about the Cupertino companyâs year-end projections. Apple normally takes its time with new products, but lately its timelines have resulted in a staggered, often derivative lineup of products thatâdespite being relatively high qualityâare far too stale. Ignoring the relaunch of the slightly cheaper iPhone with the $600iPhone 16e, the last big new thing from Apple was theVision Pro, a $3,500 mixed reality headset that sports some of the best displays in this form factor with an interesting new take on an operating system, but is still too uncomfortable considering its enormous cost. VisionOS 3 could arrive this year with all-new capabilities, according to Gurmanâs latest reports. The next big thing is always on the horizon, which makes it hard to stay excited about the iPhone maker. This yearshould bring us a thin iPhoneto compete against Samsung’s ultra-thinS25 Galaxy Edge. Maybe the next MacBook may finally look a little different than the same, derivative design from 2021. Any interesting projects, like thePixar-like robotic lampswith a personality, will remain at least two years out. AppleiPhoneMac Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Among the fake trailers were major blockbuster IP such asThunderbolts*,The Fantastic Four: First Stepsand countless other movies on the wayâmany of which don’t even have official trailers out quite yet. Before this move, studios were at least able to nab ad revenue from the channels hawking AI heavy copies of their goods. The trend was frowned down upon by SAG-AFTRA as it enabled exploitation of their actors talents and worth; the union previously previously shared, âMonetizing unauthorized, unwanted, and subpar uses of human-centered IP is a race to the bottom.

    "title": "Trump Paused Some China Tariffs, but Stuff From Shein and Temu Will Remain Expensive",
    "article_text": "On Monday, the United States and China madea joint statementannouncing a new stage in the trade war that temporarily pauses the tariffs the two nations imposed on each other earlier this year. For the next 90 days, China will ease duties on US imports from 125% to 10%. Over the same timeframe, the US will decrease tariffs on Chinese imports from 145% to 30%. Excluded from this deal, however, are Chinese shipments worth less than $800, which will be taxed at a rate of 120%, or a flat rate of$100 per postal item. Starting on June 1st, that $100 fee will double to $200.Â The joint statement came after officials from both countries met in Geneva over the weekend. Markets, which have experienced heightened volatility since President Trumpâs âLiberation Day,âÂ  surged on Monday morning as the news broke.Â Last month, President Trump announced a wide range of new tariffs on global imports, including an 84% dutyon Chinese imports, which subsequently rose to 145%. He also closed the âde minimisâ loophole, which previously exempted shipments from China valued at less than $800. President Trump claimed that he was closing the loophole to help combat the USâs synthetic opioid crisis. In a fact sheet issued by the White House, the Trump admin claimed that âmanyâ Chinese-based shippers took advantage of the de minimis exemption to âhide illicit substances, including synthetic opioids, in low-value packages.âÂ Despite the Trump administrationâs emphasis on synthetic opioids, much of the public conversation around the ending of this exemption has been about cheap sneakers, memory foam pillows, and drones sold by Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. Both companies benefited greatly from the de minimis exemption and said that they planned to raise prices in light of the change. In separate but identical statements, Shein and Temu said that, âDue to recent changes in global trade rules and tariffs, our operating expenses have gone up. To keep offering the products you love without compromising on quality, we will be making price adjustments starting April 25, 2025.âÂ In early May, however, Temu seemed to change course.Fashion Divereported that Temu would address tariffs by transitioning to a local distribution model, hiring suppliers in the US.While that strategy helps the company circumvent Trumpâs tariffs, it puts Temu in direct competition with Amazon and Walmart in the US. Last year, Amazon seemed to take notice of Temu and Sheinâs growing popularity in the US by launching Amazon Haul, its own discount platform. Late last month, President Donald Trump called Amazonâs Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos over a report that Amazon Haul would display import charges on its site. While the idea was discussed internally, Amazon said in a statement to NBC News that âit was never approved and not going to happen.âÂ In March, American retailer Forever21, a fast fashion stalwart, filed for bankruptcy for a second time. In a court filing, Forever21 said it was âmaterially and negatively impactedâ by Shein and Temuâs use of the de minimis exception, and blamed them for âundercuttingâ Forever21âs business.Â While it remains to be seen who the winners and losers will be in Trumpâs remade trade landscape, itâs hard not to hold out hope that American consumers might consider reevaluating their endless appetite for more and cheaper stuff.Â de minimisDonald TrumpsheinTemu Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "New Twist on Famous Marshmallow Test: What Happens When You Add a Second Kid?",
    "article_text": "Our commitments to other people can have a big influence on how we actâeven for children who are trying to keep themselves from snacking on a tasty treatright now.Peer support helped children pass the famous Stanford marshmallow test, which tests whether a child can resist a tempting treat long enough to receive an even bigger, better reward, according to a new study. The study,publishedMay 7 inRoyal Society Open Science,found that children are more likely to wait for a larger reward if they have a buddy who has pledged to hold out than if theyâre alone. The findings show that promises can be a pretty powerful influence on peopleâs behavior, echoing previous studies that have found that explicit vows make childrenless likely to cheatandmore likely to tell the truth. The original marshmallow test, conducted at Stanford in the 1970s, was fairly simple and exceptionally cute. An experimenter placed a marshmallow or other treat in front of a child before leaving them alone in a room. The experimenter told the child that if the marshmallow was still there when the experimenter returned, the child would get double the tasty treats. Follow-up studies found that children who “passed” the marshmallow test by waiting until the experimenter returned had better outcomes later in life. But later studies challenged these findings, showing children who gobbled up the smaller reward were more likely to come from challenging homes and circumstances that may have made them less likely to trust adults. So, their relative levels of success later in life might have reflected the environment in which they were raised, not any intrinsic qualities. In the new study, a team of researchers, including psychologist Owen Waddington from the University of Manchester, sought to determine how interactions with others impacted a childâs ability to wait for a better reward. “Successful cooperation often relies, in part, on individuals maintaining delayed gratification,â the scientists wrote in the study. âThis sense of obligation can also lead to increased effort, and therefore increased cooperative success.” Researchers conducted the experiments online and paired each child with another child. The new experiments were conducted with children aged 5 to 6 years old and their parents. From their homes, a parent showed their child a familiar treat. The child was told that they would get an even better treat if and only if another child also waited for a larger treat under the same circumstances. The experimenters fibbed about a âmalfunctioningâ Zoom link, which allowed participants to see the other child but not interact or communicate with them. Participants were shown a video of the child they were paired with. The other child either promised that they wouldnât eat the treat or expressed uncertainty about whether they could wait. The study showed that when one child promised to hold out, the other child waited longer before eating the treat than if their partner had expressed uncertainty. It turns out that promises can mean a lot, even for children. Compared to previous studies involving the marshmallow test, this study âgoes further to show that when a partner promises to wait for their treat, childrenâs willingness to delay gratification is greater than when the partner expresses uncertainty,â the authors wrote. Younger children were more likely to last the whole time than older children, though the difference was not statistically significant. The authors wrote that this might be because with age, âchildren encounter more broken promises and learn that commitments are not always fulfilled.â The findings indicate that promises promote cooperation in children, echoing earlier experiments in addiction research that buddy systems can prevent relapses. But the authors caution that they may not apply to all children, as the studies were mainly conducted on healthy children in northern England. Whether these findings apply to children across other cultures isnât clear yet. It seems a simple promise goes a long way. kidsPsychology Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

    "title": "Do Prices on Ticketmaster Suddenly Seem Much Higher? You’re Not Alone.",
    "article_text": "For years now, the Ticketmaster experience has been defined by hitting the checkout button and seeing the price of your ticket purchase jump, sometimesnearly double, thanks to so-called “service fees.” Finally, that is going to change. No, Ticketmaster isn’t getting rid of the service charges. But it will now display the full cost of the purchase, fees included, from the very start of your transaction. In a blog post, Ticketmasterannouncedits so-called “all-in pricing,” which starts Monday, May 12. “With All In Prices, youâll be able to find tickets within your budget right away, with no surprises at checkout. Thatâs because youâll see the cost of your ticketâincluding fees, before taxesâfrom the moment you start shopping for any Ticketmaster event in the US,” the companysaid. Why is Ticketmaster introducing its new pricing that transparently reflects the actual cost of tickets? To hear Ticketmaster’s version of events, this is something it has wanted all along. “Weâre all in on putting fans first. Weâve long advocated for all-in pricing laws worldwide, and support a consistent ticket-buying experience for fans,” the company claimed in a blog post. There is something quite funny about Ticketmaster turning this into some sort of new feature and positioning itself as being pro-consumer, as if someone forced it to operate with hidden fees that only appear at checkout all this time. Ticketing fees have been an issue for a long time, with Ticketmaster being one of the biggest culprits. A 2018Government Accountability Office reportfound that service fees hit ticket buyers with costs that add, on average, 27% to 31% of the advertised ticket price to their final purchase. When the Biden administration started pursuing its crackdown on junk fees, Ticketmaster promised to go along with the changesâbut spent more of its efforts skirting and fighting them.Per the Washington Post, the ticketing giant started showing the full purchase price on tickets only for shows at Live Nation venues, a company Ticketmaster merged with back in 2010. The company alsoramped up its lobbying spendingas soon as the junk fee rules started to be discussed. That doesn’t exactly seem like the kind of thing a company that has always wanted price transparency would do. Instead, the explanation for Ticketmaster’s “All In Pricing,” the groundbreaking concept of showing what things cost, is much simpler. The Federal Trade Commission’s âRule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees,â which requires businesses to âclearly and conspicuouslyâ display the total price with fees included from the jump,went into effecton May 12. Weird how that needed to become the law of the land for Ticketmaster to actually do the thing it claims it has long supported.

    "title": "Doctor Who‘s Latest Story Was About the Power of Doctor Who Itself",
    "article_text": "AsÂDoctor Whohas, inch-by-inch, diversified the casting of its heroes, its willingness to tell stories directly influenced by those decisions has trailed a little behind. When Jodie Whittaker became the 13th Doctor, only a few of her stories ultimately engaged with what it meant that the Doctor now inhabited a female body. With the arrival of Ncuti Gatwa in the TARDIS last year, his debut season tackled his status as the first Black man and the first openly queer actor to play the Time Lord to… mixed success, especially on the former. But now, in the strongest episode of his sophomore season yet, we have a story that nails exploring the Doctor’s latest identity, because it allows itself the grace of being up front about engaging with that idea. Last season’s “Dot and Bubble”played with the notion of the Doctor’s racial identity by trapping him on a planet of white supremacists being eaten by giant slug monsters, but by saving that reveal for its closing scene as a gotcha for the Doctor and the audience alike, the episode failed to really engage with what it meant for the Doctor’s identity as a Black man to be called into question outside of a single moment. “The Story and the Engine,” then, by playwright Inua Ellams, stands as an interesting contrast. It is Gatwa’s firstDoctor Whoscript written entirely by a person of color (this season’s“The Well”was co-credited between Russell T Davies and Sharma Angel-Walfall). It is also a story that explicitly leverages Gatwa’s identity as a Black man to tell a story that can only be told in such a circumstance. But perhaps most crucially of all that in contrast, is that it is a story that uses that identity to tell a story of joy, of the universality and power of storytelling, something that connects the Doctor to the people they yearn to protect. And it can only do so by clearly establishing that connection between the story being told, and its setting, to the Doctor’s current identity from the get-go. Where that story takes place is Lagos, Nigeria, as the Doctor and Belinda continue to charge up their “try and find 2025 London” device by hopping around in time and space. Landing in Lagos, the Doctor gets what he needs almost immediately, but is reluctant to move on quickly: there’s a local barbershop, ran by a man named Omo (Sule Rimi), that he loves visiting. We’ve seen Gatwa’s Doctor play with myriad styles, especially with his hair, but as Belinda points out to him, he has a massive time ship that does all that for him. The reason Omo’s shop is special, the Doctor argues, is because it’s a place that makes his current incarnation feel seen, in a way he hasn’t before. Although it’s not the first time the Doctor has ever been Black (as we get a wonderful nod to with a brief surprise appearance byJo Martin’s Fugitive Doctorlater on), having the Doctor articulate to Belinda his desire to feel recognized and welcomed in spaces as a Black manâand having them both, as the first TARDIS team completely made up of people of color, connect over that in their developing friendshipâis an incredibly compelling idea, and it’s one that really resonates compared to the times this Doctor’s racial identity has been used in stories only to serve as a point of conflict, like “Dot and Bubble” orbriefly in “Lux”. After Belinda acquiesces and lets the Doctor check in for a trim though, things kick into high gear. It turns out Omo’s shop is under new management, a mysterious figure known only as the Barber (Ariyon Bakare), who has trapped Omo and several other men there, wrenching the shop out of time and space to keep them all in an endless cycle of haircuts and storytelling: their tales of history and myth powering a massive mechanical spider that is whisking the Barber and his ally Abena, the daughter of Anansi (Michelle Asante), on a quest for vengeance against the gods themselves. The Barber, it turns out, helped spread the myths of countless gods and folklores throughout human history by creating a Nexus, a literal web of storytelling and culture that spread their reach and influence but also laid the fundamental groundwork for human civilization itself, the act of sharing and developing thousands of years of stories, passed on through generations. No longer needing him with the Nexus’ creation, the gods cast the Barber out, and now he wants to destroy it, and take them with it. Much of this plays out within the confines of Omo’s barbershop, an infinitely tiny space for all these big ideas to burst out of, even if it’s also revealed that said barbershop is currently temporally displaced and being carried about an alternate dimension by a giant mechanical spider. At times, “The Story and the Engine” threatens to lose itself in the strains of bandying about all these big, heady ideas, but where episodes before it this season have hit those issues, here, it almost becomes part of the metatext ofDoctor Whoitself. After all, as this episode reminds us, what bigger story is there out there than the Doctor themselves, countless lives lived over and over? The Doctor’s status as this being who has seen so many histories and futures is the crux of the whole premise. It’s why Omo tells the Barber about them in the first place; it’s a story left untoldâthat the Fugitive Doctor once promised to free Abena from the clutches of her father, but failed to do so, telling her and us in a brief moment that she was wrapped up in a story for another timeâthat creates the conflict between the Doctor and Abena in the first place. It’s how, ultimately, the Doctor manages to save the day, tempting the Barber with himself as the simplest story ever told: they live, they die, they are reborn. What saves the day in “The Story and the Engine” is not necessarily the Doctor’s brains or any kind of technobabble, it’s the very fact that they are the star of the story that isÂDoctor Who, an ongoing, living, breathing narrative that stretches across life after life, is shared between generations of people. The Doctor isn’t just a story of potentiality, but one so powerful it manages to overwhelm the Barber’s engine, freeing everyone trapped in the shop and guiding the Barber and Abena away from their misguided quest for revenge. That might be a story that could’ve been told with any incarnation of the Doctorâand that is arguably part of the point, given it’s the Doctor’s narrative potentiality that proves key to foiling the Barber’s plans. But “The Story and the Engine” also directly engages with beats that re-iterate that this is a story that could have only been told by pushing the Doctor’s story to a place where people of color can be part of it, as well. It’s not just in the yearning for community the Doctor seeks by going to Omo’s shop in the first place, it becomes even more important when Abena decides to help the Doctor by braiding his hair with a map to the heart of the Spider so he can stop it, drawing on real-world historical traditions of braided hair being used to hide messages and maps in the era of colonialism and the slave trade. “The Story and the Engine” is laser-focused on the power ofDoctor Whoas a story, metatextually or otherwise, but there’s also a lot of power in how it chooses to tell this story intertwined with how it leverages Gatwa’s identity as the first Black, queer man to be a major player in that story. This era ofÂDoctor Whoin particular has been very interested inthe metanarratives of stories, and with playing of awareness of them for both the audience and our heroes alike. Sometimes it’s worth celebrating for a moment, as we get to here, that that story can now help connect even more people from different backgrounds and welcome them to be a part of it. And that’s just vital a story to tell with the first mainline Doctor played by a man of color as any story of prejudice is. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "GOP Senator Introduces Bill to Make All Porn a Federal Crime, Following Project 2025 Playbook",
    "article_text": "Last year, the rightwing think-tank the Heritage Foundation launchedProject 2025, which laid out much of thepolicy blueprintfor the current Trump administration. One of the project’s espoused goals was to permanentlycriminalize all pornography. Now, a Republican senatorwith kind words for Trumphas introduced a bill that would do just that. Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) recently introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which would effectively criminalize all pornography nationwide by legally redefining what it means to be obscene. For years, “obscenity” has been all but a defunct legal category that narrowly defines speech thatremains unprotectedby the First Amendment. Lee would explode this legal category, expanding it to encompass virtually all visual representations of sex. According tothe bill text, “a picture, image, graphic image file, film, videotape, or other visual depiction” of any media that “appeals to the prurient interest in nudity, sex, or excretion” would be considered criminal. In other words, if you have an old VHS tape of some Cinemax-style smut stashed away in your garage, you could, under this law, be considered to be harboring deeply illicit materials. Some critics have suggested that Lee’s definition of obscenity is so ridiculously broad that it could effectivelycriminalizeGame of Thrones. That said, the punishments for merely possessing porn under the proposed law seem unclear at this point, as the legislation seems more focused on punishing the creators and distributors of racy material. The law would “pave the way for the prosecution of obscene content disseminated across state lines or from foreign countries and open the door to federal restrictions or bans regarding online porn,” The Daily Callerwrites. âObscenity isnât protected by the First Amendment, but hazy and unenforceable legal definitions have allowed extreme pornography to saturate American society and reach countless children,â said Lee, ina press releaseabout the bill. âOur bill updates the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age so this content can be taken down and its peddlers prosecuted.â Lee’s view of pornography hews closely to that of the Heritage Foundation, which has similarly sought to crush the smut industry. In itsMandate for Leadership,Project 2025defines pornography as the “omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children” and argues that the “people who produce and distribute it should be imprisoned” and that “telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its spread should be shuttered.” It should be noted that porn has always been a hot-button issue and that critics have long tried to criminalize it. The history of the anti-pornography movement in the U.S. is a long and complicated one, littered with differing ideological justifications andstrange bedfellows. In recent years, however, the anti-porn crusade has largely been led by the MAGA right. Much of the modern anti-porn movement has sought to focus on the harmful psychological impact that pornography may have on young web users and children. It has targeted online access to porn by institutingage-verification requirementsfor porn websites that bar underage users. Over the past decade,over a dozen stateshave passed legislation designed to curb youth access to porn, much of which is still being challenged in court. mike leePornhubpornographyproject 2025 Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger Riding a Dinosaur Is Somehow Normal in Wild Leaked Footage From Kung Fury 2",
    "article_text": "Imagine a movie that featuresArnold Schwarzeneggeron a dinosaur,giant mech battles, time travel,David Hasselhoffas a talking Lamborghini,Michael Fassbenderwith a mullet, and an all-out war against Adolf Hitler. Now imagine that movie never coming out. Both are difficult concepts to fathom, but each applies toKung Fury: The Movie. Written, directed, and starring David Sandberg,Kung Fury: The Movie(also referred to asKung Fury 2) is a feature-length follow-up to a 2015 short film thatyou can watch on YouTube(or below). It’s a wild, tongue-in-cheek send-up of 1980s sci-fi action films that co-stars Jorma Taccone and David Hasselhoff. Based on that film’s success, a feature-length version was made that brought back Taccone and Hasselhoff, and added Arnold Schwarzenegger, Michael Fassbender, and Alexandra Shipp. However, a legal battle over the film’s visual effects has delayed it five years and counting. Late last week, though, a 10-minute promo for the film leaked online andVarietyconfirmed with Sandberg that it was in fact genuine. “This was an internal promo video that was never supposed to be seen by the public,” Sandberg said in a statement. “I feel bad because it contains a bunch of plot points and temp VFX. I hope at least people can see the passion that we poured into the movie, the world deserves to see it as it was meant to be seen. This movie has been held hostage for the past five years but I promise to keep fighting for it and make sure this film gets the chance it truly deserves.â The clip not only features all manner of batshit insanity, such as Schwarzenegger on the dinosaur, Fassbender shooting bullets to press keys on a typewriter, and so much more, but some presumably huge narrative spoilers such as character deaths and plot twists. So you understand why Sandberg would seemingly feel mixed about the leak. But maybethis isDeadpoolall over again. You literally can’t watch the 10-minute clip and not instantly want to see the movie. It’s simply not possible. So, maybe, by bringing further awareness to the project, something can be worked out to getKung Fury: The Movieinto the world. For now, here’s the original short film.

    "title": "How Fast Is Too Fast to See? Study Reveals Your Visual Speed Limit",
    "article_text": "When a camera whips around from one point to another, most people expect the fast movement to result in a blurry smear. What they don’t realize, however, is that our own eyes engage in a similar kind of rapid movementâcalled saccadesâover 100,000 times a day. Unlike video cameras, our brain avoids the nauseating blurâbut when things move in a particular way, they become invisible. As detailed in astudypublished May 8 in Nature Communications, researchers have revealed that the speed of an individual’s saccades corresponds to the limit at which a moving object becomes too fast for them to see. That means people with faster eye movements can perceive faster-moving objects, with potential implications for activities requiring fast eye movements such as sports, video games, and even photography. The researchers claim to be the first to provide evidence for the theory that a person’s movement impacts their perception. “What parts of the physical world we can sense depends fundamentally on how good our sensors are,” Martin Rolfs, lead author of the study and an active vision scientist at Humboldt University of Berlin’s Department of Psychology, said in astatementby the research group Science of Intelligence. âIn this paper, however, we show that the limits of seeing are not just defined by these biophysical constraints but also by the actions and movements that impose changes on the sensory system.â Rolfs and his colleagues demonstrated that when a study participant saw visual stimuli moving with the same speed and pattern as their own saccade shifts, the stimuli became invisible. This suggests the brain filters out motion that mimics our own eye movements, which might be why our saccades don’t cause visual blurs in the way that cameras do. More broadly, this suggests that physical movementâsuch as eye movementâlimits our sensory system’s perception of the world. In other words, our ability to see things in motion is not just dictated by our sensory abilities, such as the strength, or sensitivity, of the photoreceptors in our eyes. “In simple terms, the properties of a sensory system such as the human visual system are best understood in the context of the kinematics of actions that drive its input (in this case, rapid eye movements),” said Rolfs.Kinematicsis the study of object motion without considering the cause of said motion. “Our visual system and motor system are finely tuned to each other, but this has long been ignored,” he continued. “One of the issues is that the people who study motor control are not the same ones who study perception. They attend different conferences, they publish in different journalsâbut they should be talking!” It’s only a matter of time until helicopter parents start timing their kidsâ saccades to decide whether they belong in little league or theater.

    "title": "The Early Returns on NYC’s Congestion Pricing Are Pretty Impressive",
    "article_text": "It’s been a little over four months since New York City’s congestion pricing rules, which charge vehicles a toll to enter certain parts of the city, took effect. Thegoal of the pricing system, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was to produce “cleaner air, safer streets, and better transit.” So, how exactly is that going? Well,according to data collected by the New York Times, it’s going pretty damn well! The $9 fee charged to enter Manhattan between the hours of 5 AM and 9 PM has changed the traffic patterns and behaviors of Tri-State area goers, and it seems like it is working out to the benefit of just about everyone. The upshot: overall traffic is down, the traffic remaining is moving faster, and public transit usage is upâbut attitudes haven’t quite caught up yet. That all starts with traffic declining, which it has quite a bit,per the New York Times, even below the city’s expectations. The publication reported a 12% drop in total vehicles per day in the congestion zone, an equivalent of 2.3 million fewer cars for the month of April alone. With fewer cars on the road, those that remain are moving faster.Available data indicatethat traffic speeds increased by 15% during the first two months of the pricing scheme, and up to 20% during peak commuting hours, representing the first time gridlock has dropped and movement has increased in the post-pandemic era. It’s not just cars moving faster, either. MTA buses are reportedly seeing upticks in speed, too, which has also meant fewer delays and the buses running on time more frequently. And that is with increased passengership, too, as the buses have seen a 13% uptick in daily ridership since the congestion prices went into effect. Similarly, the city’s subway has seen an 8% increase in riders. The Long Island Rail Road, the Staten Island Railway, and the Metro-North commuter lines are all carrying more people, too. Even taxi rides are up,per the Times, despiteconcerns from cab companiesthat the prices could hurt their already flagging ridership. Citi Bike, the city’s ride-sharing bike program, is also seeing more people saddle up and peddle, with rides up as much as 9% on the year. The side effects of these shifts in behavior, which have seen more people leaving their cars at home while opting for public transit or other alternatives, are largely positive. Vehicle-involved accidents have declined by 14% through the first half of the year, traffic violations are down nearly 4%, and noise complaints have dropped by a whopping 45% within the congestion zone. Emergency response time is up, as is the number of tourists visiting the zone and the number of restaurant reservations. So, is anythingnotworking? The health benefits aren’t clear yetâair pollution is down, but theTimes writes that it’s too early to sayanything definitive there. But the biggest issue seems to be public opinion. In December, just 32% of New York City voters supported the program. That has gone up since the pricing went into place, but supporters can’t crack the majority quite yetâ42% of city folk want the program to stay, per anApril Marist poll. congestion pricingmtaNew York Citypublic transit Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Trump Says Only a ‘Stupid Person’ Wouldn’t Take a Free Plane From Qatar",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump defended his plan to accept a $400 million plane from Qatar to use as Air Force One during a press conference at the White House Monday morning. The “great gesture,” as Trump called it, would be one of the most galling acts of corruption in modern history, all in plain sight. But Trump seems to think that it’s not actually corrupt as long as public officials don’t hide it behind closed doors. News about the plane first broke whenABC Newsreported Sunday that Trump was in discussions to accept a super luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from the royal family of Qatar. The report said Trump’s presidential library foundation would take control of the plane after his presidency, an idea clearly inspired by the fact that a plane which had served as Air Force One during the late 20th century was placed at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library and Museum after it was decommissioned in the 2000s. Trump defended the news on Truth Social in a bizarre screed Sunday night, insisting that it would be great to get a “gift” from Qatar like this. “So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction, so bothers the Crooked Democrats that they insist we pay, TOP DOLLAR, for the plane. Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!! MAGA,” Trumpwrote. The Trump Organization struck a deal in April to build a luxury golf resort in Qatar, according to theAssociated Press, believed to be the first publicly disclosed overseas deal from his company since President Trump was inaugurated in January. Trump’s business is also reportedly negotiating deals in other countries like Vietnam, a country that’s also important for trade discussions with the U.S. government. Trump was asked by a reporter at the White House onMondayif Qatar had asked for anything in exchange for the $400 million plane. But the president insisted the country just wanted to give him a plane for free and didn’t want anything in return. Boeing is currently working on delivering a new Air Force One but isbehind schedule, something that clearly frustrates Trump, who called it “a mess I inherited from Biden.” “I think Qatar, who has… really we’ve helped them a lot over the years in terms of security and safety, I felt that… I think that… and very, very nicely,” Trump rambled. “I have a lot of respect for the leadership and for the leader, Qatar. And I think they very… they knew about it because they buy Boeings.” Trump went on to claim the donation of the plane would be to the Defense Department, which somehow didn’t make it corrupt. “If we can get a 747 as a contribution to our Defense Department to use during a couple of years while they’re building the other ones, I think that was a very nice gesture,” Trump said. “Now I could be a stupid person to say ‘oh no we don’t want a free plane.’ We give free things out, we’ll take one too. And it helps us out because, again, we’re talking about… we have 40-year-old aircraft.” Trump went on to claim it was a “gesture of good faith” because the U.S. protects countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar militarily. Trump said those countries “wouldn’t exist” if it weren’t for American protection. He went on to bring up the plane at President Reagan’s presidential library, appearing to confirm suspicions that his administration got the idea for using his own library as an excuse from that institution. It’s unclear how on Earth the U.S. government would be able to secure a plane gifted from a foreign government, given the likelihood that it poses an enormous security risk. But security hasn’t really been top of mind for the Trump regime. Needless to say, even if Trump doesn’t use the plane in a personal capacity after he leaves office, the transaction is still illegal under the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Applying the most rudimentary logic, nobody gets a $400 million plane for nothing. The press conference on Monday was ostensibly about lowering drug prices, but several other topics came up. And journalists in the room were very interested in the story of the jet from Qatar. Trump was asked by an ABC News reporter what he’d say to people who view the Qatari jet as a “personal gift to you.” That touched a nerve as Trump said, “You should be embarrassed asking that question,” referring to the reporter asfake news. The president then went on to tell the story of a golfer named Sam Snead, who died in 2002. “You know, there was an old golfer named Sam Snead. Did you ever hear of him? He won 82 tournaments,” Trump said. “He was a great golfer. And he had a motto, ‘When they give you a putt, you say, thank you very much.’ You pick up your ball and you walk to the next hole.” Trump was referring to the common courtesy that sometimes happens between people who are playing golf together. Someone will just allow someone to pick up their ball when it’s close to the hole, assuming they would have made it because it was so easy. He went on to explain that anyone who didn’t take something for “free,” like a gimme putt on the golf course, was essentially a chump. “A lot of people are stupid,” said Trump. “They say, ‘No, no, I insist on putting it.’ Then they putt it and they miss it. And their partner gets angry at them. You know what? Remember that. Sam Snead. When they give you a putt, you pick it up and you walk to the next hole and you say, ‘Thank you very much.'” Trump appears to believe a gimme putt and a $400 million jet are the same thing. It’s all so shockingly corrupt at every level, but don’t expect America’s traditional news outlets to call it that. Eric Lipton, a writer for the New York Times, argued Monday on Bluesky that Trump accepting the plane wouldn’t technically be corruption because there’s no “explict [sic] quid pro quo.” “Corruption requires explict quid pro quo. It is not corrupt to take an action that aligns with the interest of a person who gives you a gift, unless the official action was in direct response to that giftâa bribe. Terms matter. Accuracy and fairness matters. Regardless of what social media wants,” Liptonwrote. Corruption requires explict quid pro quo. It is not corrupt to take an action that aligns with the interest of a person who gives you a gift, unless the official action was in direct response to that gift–a bribe. Terms matter. Accuracy and fairness matters. Regardless of what social media wants. â Eric Lipton NYT (@ericlipton.nytimes.com)May 12, 2025 at 6:02 AM For a person trying to be pedantic, this is laughably untrue. The most straightforward dictionary definitions of corruption do not require a quid pro quo. Rick Hasen, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, wrote in response to Lipton’s post, “Please do not confuse the legal requirements for the crime of bribery with the concept of corruption.” Trump’s fascist government has absolutely steamrolled American society with blatantly corrupt schemes, including the president’s so-called memecoin cryptocurrency, which has reportedly contributed billions toTrump’s net worth. The president plans to have dinner with the top buyers of $TRUMP on May 22, one of countless ways Trump is engaging in shady dealings out in public. Again, it seems like Trump doesn’t believe he’ll actually pay any consequence if he does it out in the open, and so far, he’s been right. The biggest scandal of Trump’s second term, as far as media coverage is concerned, is probably Signalgate, when Mike Waltz and Pete Hegseth shared military plans on a commercially available messaging app that included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg. The scandal, it seems, was that the impropriety happened in a way that wasn’t supposed to be known publicly. If Hegseth and Waltz had just announced ahead of time that they were using Signal to discuss highly sensitive classified information, it almost certainly would not have been a huge story. President Trump will continue to act like there are no guardrails to his administration because it’s clear the U.S. is in a constitutional crisis. And America’s “opposition party,” the Democrats, refuse to recognize the emergency we’re in. Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar appeared on Meet the Press on Sunday and was asked whether the country was in a constitutional crisis. Klobuchar said we weren’t because courts have frequently beenruling against Trump. The problem with that argument? Trump has often ignored the courts. In fact, the Supreme Court ordered Trump to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador. Trump has plainly said he’ll make no effort to bring the man back. We’re in a constitutional crisis, and Trump is corrupt as hell, selling crypto and trying to take a gift worth $400 million from a foreign government.

    "title": "The SteamOS era is imminent: Valve adds a new compatibility rating for games that’ll run on ‘any device that’s not a Steam Deck’",
    "article_text": "Sounds like more SteamOS devices could be on their way soon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheSteam Deckwon’t be the onlyhandheld gaming PCto run Valve’s open source Linux-based operating system later this month, and it looks like we can expect more devices to come in the near future. In preparation for the launch ofLenovo’s Legion Go S with SteamOS,Valve will start rating games on their compatibility with third-party devices. Valve expects to give the stamp of approval to over 18,000 Steam games to start with, and will include this rating on all the games it checks for Steam Deck compatibility going forward. The compatibility ratings are “based on a subset of the Steam Deck compatibility testing results and are meant to show at a glance whether a game and all of its middleware is supported on Steam OS,” it said in anews post.“This includes features like game functionality, launcher functionality, and anti-cheat support.” You won’t see the new ratings on Steam unless you’re on a device like the Legion Go S, Valve said. It’ll appear next to the Steam Deck verification status and tell you whether you can run it on SteamOS as well as other important details, like if it requires an internet connection. Valve says a Deck Verified game will only ever have a SteamOS compatibility rating that is the same or better, so there won’t be any cases where something will run on the Steam Deck but not other devices. Now that Valve is finally letting SteamOS leave the nest, this seems like a necessity for the rollout to other devices to succeed. The rating system will serve the same purpose as the compatibility details on iOS and Android app store pages. And Valve says this is “just the first step” in helping people understand which games will run on specific devices.Speaking to French outlet Frandroidin January, Valve developer Pierre-Loup Griffais said it wants the open source software to eventually run on everything from desktop PCs to laptops, but that handhelds are the focus right now. As is common for people who work at a company as lax as Valve, Griffais said there’s “not really” a roadmap for SteamOS’ future on other devices. “It’s when we have the time and we get there,” he said.

    "title": "Dune: Awakening's stabby stunlock PvP exploit is being fixed, says Funcom: 'We've got this covered'",
    "article_text": "Being endlessly staggered by a human opponent isn't a heck of a lot of fun. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. TheDune: Awakeningbeta weekend has come to an end, and along with sandworms, speeders, and spice, there's another topic on everyone's mind: stunlock. We learned over the weekend that Paul Atreides didn't need to spend all that time training to master the slow blade: he could have just repeatedly slashed his knife around in front of him and conquered Arrakis in a matter of minutes. That's because there's a bit of an exploit in Dune: Awakening's PvP. Instead of holding the mouse button to perform a slow blade attack, you can just spam a quick knife attack at your PvP opponent, and if they're at zero stamina they'll be staggered. Use the brief stagger window to keep slashing, and they'll be completely unable to defend themselves or escape. Button-mashing FTW, even if they've got their protective shield up which, lore-wise, is supposed to defend you against anything moving quickly. It's… not great. There are a few clips of this exploit making the rounds, and one of them was even shown to several of Funcom's developers at the end of a 4-hour livestream this weekend. The clip shows streamer Tyler1 fighting Shroud, both using knives with Holtzmann shields activated. Shroud, out of stamina, is perpetually staggered and Tyler1 keeps spamming knife attacks. It takes a good long while, but the helpless Shroud is eventually killed. Dune: Awakening's world director Jeff Gagné and lead producer Ole Andreas Haley were quick to address the exploit and comment on if the exploit will be fixed in the June 10 release. \"It will. We already have a version, internally, that has some of this [problem] already covered,\" they said. \"The [beta] is a few versions old compared to what we have.\" You can seethe clip here at 4:04:16 in the livestream. You can also see it from Shroud's perspective in the clip below: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"We got this covered,\" Gagné added. \"It's not like 'Oh my god, we haven't thought about it.' It's already going away.\" Weirdly, I've seen some players defending the exploit, saying it's Shroud's fault for not managing his stamina, but I'm still glad it's getting a fix. I don't care how careless you are in a fight, being slowly spammed to death with a knife while you're helplessly stunlocked isn't good PvP, no matter if someone was playing recklessly. Combat just shouldn't work that way, doubly so since the lore says fast-moving blades won't get through your shield anyway.

    "title": "Oblivion Remastered has an unleveled, legendary sword you can grab right after leaving the starting sewers⁠—just bring a lot of arrows or magicka potions",
    "article_text": "Umbra is one of my very favorite Elder Scrolls weapons. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Even if you're taking advantage of one of the great mods toun-levelorauto-upgradeOblivion Remastered's quest rewards, you might still want to snag yourself something with a little extra oomph right out of the gate. That's whereUmbracomes in. This pitch-black, super evil longsword is a centerpiece of Elder Scrolls lore, and ties into the level-20 Daedric quest forClavicus Vile. But the sword, and itswielder of the same name, still spawn out in the world even if you haven't activated the quest. You can find her at the Ayleid ruin,Vindasel, close to the Imperial City. Unlike nearly every other character and item in Oblivion, Umbra and her sword are always full-power, no level adjustment to speak of. It's a piece of loot without an expiration date, and that just feels good to find. The fact that Umbra the person is also unleveleddoescomplicate killing her to steal her stuff, but she can be easily dispatched with some creative gamer strategies. The crumbling pillar in the center of her chamber offers a perfect vantage point to rain down magic or arrows on her, and she'll just keep running at you, clipping into the pillar, with no ranged abilities of her own to retaliate with. I actually stumbled into Vindasel accidentally on my playthrough, having forgotten which Ayleid ruins correspond to which key quests⁠—I keep stopping into caves and forts on my way between cities before realizing they're part of quests I haven't started. Even at around level 12, I was able to chip her down with Destruction magic while munching on mana-restoring Welkynd stones⁠. I think I ate more than 20 to go the distance with Umbra on Oblivion Remastered's Expert difficulty⁠—and that's before downloading IxiosVII'sexcellent difficulty adjustment mod. As an added bonus, the sword is treated as a \"quest item\" by Oblivion, and thus has zero carry weight. You'll eventually want to finish the quest so you can accessHermaeus Mora's daedric quest, which requires completion of all the other daedra princes' tasks, but you can still keep the sword and snub annoying old Clavicus⁠—it'll just be a lot heavier to lug around. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Umbra itself rocks. It looks rad as hell, and has the highest base damage of nearly any weapon in the game, with the only possible exceptions being one or two leveled weapons in Shivering Isles, while also being a fast-attacking one handed sword. Whether you're a gallant fighter or sneaky edgy nightblade, Umbra's a good fit. Umbra also has a long-lasting soul trap enchantment, which lets you fill Soul Gems to recharge magical items⁠—my master key combo is Umbra paired with the endgame fire katana,Goldbrand. Goldbrand dishes out monster fire damage while having only slightly less base damage than Umbra. It's fun to swap between the two, topping off Goldbrand with soul gems filled by Umbra. But Goldbrand requires you to be at least level 20 to accessBoethia's daedric quest, while Umbra is just right there for the taking the second you leave the Imperial City sewers.

    "title": "US senator announces a bill requiring geotracking in high-end GPUs to prevent the Chinese government from wielding the ruinous power of your Nvidia RTX 4090",
    "article_text": "The US can't afford to lose its advantage in making games look a little funny with DLSS. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week, we reported on Democrat congressman Bill Foster's plans tointroduce a billthat requires manufacturers of AI processors, like those in Nvidia GPUs, to implement tech that allows the US government to track where they end up. Well, it looks like the Senate didn't want to be outdone, because less than 24 hours later Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas announced the Chip Security Act, his own bill requiring AI hardware manufacturers to allow for geotracking of those all-so-important chips (viaTom'sHardware). Thepress release announcing Cotton's bill, which says the legislation will keep American hardware from \"falling into the hands of adversaries like Communist China,\" uses the word \"chips\" nine times. That's how you know it's serious. \"We must do better at maintaining and expanding our position in the global market, while safeguarding America's technological edge,\" Cotton said in the press release. \"With these enhanced security measures, we can continue to expand access to US technology without compromising our national security.\" The Chip Security Act would direct the Secretary of Commerce to \"require a location verification mechanism on export-controlled advanced chips or products with export-controlled advanced chips,\" with exporters needing to inform the Bureau of Industry and Security if their hardware is tampered with or diverted somewhere it shouldn't be. Specifically, thetext of the billwould require those geotracking mechanisms on products classified under Export Control Classification Number 3A090, 3A001.z, 4A090, 4A003.z, or any \"successor or substantially similar numbers.\" High-end Nvidia GPUs like the RTX 4090 have been classified as ECCN 3A090 and 4A090 productssince 2023, while US export control orders have beenhalting Nvidia GPU sales to Chinasince 2022. The bill also includes provisions for coordinating with the Department of Defense to study potential and newly-developed security mechanisms \"and determine if any new mechanisms should be required.\" Nvidia has said publicly that itisn't capable of tracking its hardwareafter it's been sold, and hasdenied concerns of widespread chip smuggling. It's worth noting, however, that TSMC—the main producer of Nvidia hardware—was facing a potential $1 billion fine just last month after one of its chips wasdiscovered in a Huawei processor. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I understand the justification about protecting America's dominance in AI tech, but I'll admit that the idea of my GPU being tracked as a potential national security threat feels a little silly. If their experience ends up anything like mine, anyone with a smuggled 4090 will probably just spend most of their time trying to decide whether or not DLSS is making everything look like it's coated in a sheen of cyber-vaseline.

    "article_text": "Nobody believed them until they posted proof. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If Dark Souls is any indication, people take a lot of pride in mastering hard games. There's nothing wrong with that until the moment theymake it about ego: getting smart and findingcreative solutions through hard gamescan be so much more interesting than getting good. General sentiment seemed to be that it was impossible to finish the entirety ofClair Obscur: Expedition 33without engaging with its demanding dodging and parrying mechanics—that is until Reddit user HunterIV4 spent the last week proving the naysayers wrong. \"I've seen a lot of posts from people about how hard this game is and how you need to get perfect at dodge/parry in order to survive,\" HunterIV4 wrote at the start of theirpost last week.\"But there are plenty of people out there who may be turned off from the game thinking 'Well, Isuckat Souls games and action games in general, I like to take my time with turn-based combat, should I skip this game?'\" HunterIV4 says no, you do not in fact have to skip Clair Obscur if you aren't a dodge and parry god, and they have proof. They played it on Story mode and beefed up their characters with as much health as possible, and found that enemies aren't as scary as people claimed. \"I got most of the way through act 1 without ever touching a button during the enemy's turn,\" they said. “So if you are interested in this game but worried you don't have the ‘gamer reflexes’ to get those insane multi-hit parries and no-hit boss kills, relax!” It took a while—longer than they cared for—to finish act 1, but it was more than possible with some patience and a crew of characters built for pure defense. Not every person in the comments was convinced you could actually complete the whole game, however, pointing out that some optional bosses would be insurmountable. HunterIV4 took that as a challenge. And while the doubters were right about some of the optional bosses, they came back a few days later toexplain howthey hit credits without using a single dodge or parry, and even took down some of the optional (and brutal) Chromatic boss fights. They played with the auto QTE feature and avoided the 'one-shot' builds thatthe recent patch just nerfed.Most of their strategy revolved around usinga weaponthat can block hits and buff party members automatically. The key is playing in Story mode, which replaces tricky boss mechanics, like one that removes a character from the fight, with regular attacks. As long as everyone can survive for long enough, all the story-critical fights are beatable.Doing it on higher difficulties probably isn't feasible without abusing broken builds, HunterIV4 admits. \"But the point was to see if someone who didn't go for the absolute best builds or have good reflexes could still beat the game,\" they said, \"and while I'm sure there are limits to how bad your build can be and still succeed, I think I demonstrated thatmostpeople can beat the game with minimal or even no dodging at all.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "At least it's a pretty tragedy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If you ask me, No Man's Sky is at its best when it's at its most desolate—when it's just you, your spaceship, and the awe of an indifferent cosmos. By most metrics, No Man's Sky has only improved since its launch in 2016, but all those massive updates and feature additions have made that delightful isolation a bit harder to find. Unless you're No Man's Sky permadeath player Spirited_Ad3028, that is. Eight days ago, Spirited_Ad posted on theNo Man's Sky subredditto say farewell to their permadeath save. He'd made a critical error in the worst possible circumstances, creating what might be the most poignant end that a No Man's Sky character has ever met. \"I landed on the wrong planet in my permadeath save,\" Spirited_Ad said. \"I'm on a tiny pillar of rock, surrounded by deep ocean in every direction. I'm out of launch fuel, and I have no ferrite. I can only survive a few seconds outside the ship before the toxic air kills me—and toxic storms roll in every few minutes, bringing massive waves.\" In the accompanying video, Spirited_Ad's character watches the world outside from within the safe refuge of his stranded vessel. It's a somber scene: Surging seas rage through the haze around his spaceship's wretched perch, whipped into frenzy by toxic gale. In the distance, lightning splits the murk of his planetary tomb. There is no sound but wind and rain. \"All I can do is sit in my ship, watch the lightning storms, and wait for my oxygen to run out,\" Spirited_Ad said. The tragic scene resonated with other No Man's Sky players. Many tried to help, brainstorming solutions like digging downwards through the pillar for necessary ferrite or offering to personally fly to Spirited_Ad's aid.

Others questioned whether mounting a rescue woulddetract from the moment, and I'm more in their camp.

Studio founder Sean Murray posted a reaction to the clipon X, where he honored the doomed traveler with a salute emoji. Would that we could all be so remembered. It's almost enough to convince me to fire up my own permadeath save. Can't imagine my ignominious end would achieve quite the same level of cinema, though.

    "article_text": "Difficulty Slider Fixed is a must-install mod for me now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Oblivion Remastered has taken some well-judged steps tofix the original's wonky skill and attribute system, but it's still a very strange, unbalanced experience. Nublivion's middle, \"Adept\" difficulty just feels too easy, while a single step up to \"Expert\" makes fighting even a basic bandit a life or death slog. Now I know why: The behind-the-scenes math is bonkers. Modder IxionXVII's \"Difficulty Slider Fixed\" mod is a blessed solution with a ton of options to customize Oblivion Remastered's difficulty to your liking, but the author also helpfully lays out what the different difficulties actually change in the game, and it's immediately apparent why vanilla Nublivion's Expert setting felt so awful to me. The settings apply a flat multiplier to the damage you deal and receive. Adept is just 1x/1x for each, which makes sense. One notch up to Expert, though, causes a huge jump to how much damage you take, while it turns even legendary Daedric weapons into foam cosplay toys. Here's a chart of the default numbers from IxionXVII: As you can see, there's a huge gulf between each difficulty setting, and I'd imagine part of the problem was contorting the original game's very granular slider (adjustable in 1% increments no less!) into five distinct tiers to more or less match the ones in Skyrim. Now, I love a challenge in games, and ill-advisedly do take a bit of pride in playing on higher difficulty settings, but that default Expert setting is just torture, while Adept feels a little frictionless. IxionVII's \"2.0\" version of the mod at the \"Master\" difficulty setting, with x2.0 damage taken and x0.5 dealt, hits a real sweet spot for me. I've never felt The Elder Scrolls has hadfantasticcombat in any of its entries, but these games are greater than the sum of their parts, offering an immersive fantasy second life like nothing else. I just need that combat and stealth to be goodenoughto bolster dozens of hours worth of Ayleid ruin clearing and Dark Brotherhood questing. This newly adjusted difficulty provides enough friction to keep things interesting, without making me miserable.

    "article_text": "There's still room in my heart for the assassin sim AC1 was set up as, someone just needs to make it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Let's play 'guess the game'. You're a meticulous killer in a historical setting. Your targets are high-ranking aristocrats, priests, merchants—men and women of status who go everywhere flanked by a platoon of guards, who sleep behind barred doors, and whose entire lives are lived publicly. These people cannot enter a room without an eruption of folderol: they're here! They're here! 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Getting a 15-second conversation with them would require weeks of prep. Assassinating them? Next to impossible. Surviving the attempt? Actually impossible. For everyone but you, anyway. You pound the pavement until eventually you know your target's itinerary better than they do. When the big day comes, you emerge as if from smoke—from the rafters, the floorboards, the crowd—in a display of specific and spectacular public violence, leaving your untouchable target gasping while you make your escape, using your superior agility and parkour skills to disappear while arrows and shouted curses whizz by your ears. Your uncanny ability to climb and swing from things was what separated you from your clanky armoured foes, If the game you guessed was 'Nothing' then congratulations! You are correct. This is no game that ever got published. Once upon a time it wasgoingto be Assassin's Creed 1—it was, at least, the game that was suggested by howUbisofttalked about the project in the run-up to its release: a historical assassination sim focused on careful planning and dazzling execution, where your uncanny ability to climb and swing from things was what separated you from your clanky armoured foes, letting you evade them even after you'd stabbed their boss in the neck in the town square. It's a game you caught glimpses of in old trailers:Altair was here, an alarmingly young Patrice Desilets talking about the game's\"flower box\" approach to player freedom, or Jade Raymond walking you through a mission to silentlyinfiltrate a crusader fortress. What we got was, well, Assassin's Creed 1, a game I have a lot of fondness for but whose fantasy of the careful assassin resolved into repeating some mission templates a few times—obtaining key information you probably never looked at and certainly never truly needed—to unlock the final assassination mission, where you never had to do anything but charge at your target, kill them, and then either jog away leisurely or murder entire legions of guards with a seriously overpowered counter move. The fantasy wasn't quite there, and AC spiralled into an identity crisis it's still yet to escape from. Rather than knuckle down and tighten up the elements of AC1 that were truly interesting, that had you embody the role of a diligent master assassin, the series splayed outwards, bolting on more and new systems with every iteration—now you're building a town, buying Rome, running a guild, or being a pirate. Don't get me wrong, some of those systems were great. I loved being a pirate, and I've been having fun shinobi'ing about Japan in Shadows, but as Ubi has frantically bolted more and morepartsonto AC as a whole in an attempt to get you to love it and, on some level, to reach some internal understanding about what the hell this series actually is, I've been more and more mournful for that idea that seem to live and die exclusively with AC1: historical Hitman—a clockwork world where you were a fragile but cunning planner without equal, whose wit and speed, and not the ability to massacre upwards of fifty men in single combat, was what struck fear into the hearts of the medieval haut monde. The closest we ever got to that idea in the mainline series was AC: Unity—where getting into combat was a genuine risk and you could concoct relatively elaborate schemes to lure targets into scripted executions—but unfortunately that game launched with people's eyeballs popping out of their heads and, fair's fair, it was riddled with online nonsense that I never had any interest in. So Ubi retreated and we got the series' current iteration: 'what if we made The Witcher 3?' Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I don't think Ubi will ever condense down the great, sprawling identity crisis that is the modern iteration of Assassin's Creed back to that 2007 vision, butsomeoneshould. A true historical assassin sim—where you get to strike fear into noble hearts with your limitless cunning—is too good an idea to leave at the start of the century.

    "title": "All Elden Ring Nightreign classes and abilities",
    "article_text": "Discover all eight Nightfarers and their particular playstyles. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Forget fighting Night Lords; picking which of theElden Ring Nightreignclassesto try on launch is going to be the real ordeal. Do you go basic and play Wylder with his grappling hook and stake driver? Do you jump right in the deep end with Recluse and her endlessly combinable magics? Or do you just pick Guardian because he has a literal bird head? Though Nightreign doesn't afford players the same level of customization as the originalElden Ring, each of the Nightfarers—what the game calls its cast of heroes—have unique abilities and focused playstyles. While trying to survive three days in Limveld and take on the Night Lord at the end, these abilities, and more importantly how you combine them as a team, decide whether you get to survive to the end. With the exception of the Executor and the Revenant, all8 Nightreign charactershave now been showcased, and we even have some details about those two that are yet to be fully revealed. Below, you'll find all of their abilities and some details about playstyle. As the poster boy of Nightreign, Wylder is a pretty versatile knight character who can use his grappling hook to pull enemies towards him—or him towards enemies—and perform a powerful stake driver-esque attack for big damage. Wylder is pretty balanced in terms of his kit, so might be a good first option for those unsure which class to pick, before moving onto one of the more specialised Nightfarers. This bird-headed bastion—or \"Big Hawk Logan\" as I like to call him—is a defense-focused character with a big ol' shield capable of tanking attacks with his Steel Guard passive. Guardian also has some other storm hawk-themed abilities like being able to whip up a whirlwind, or fly into the air and drop down on allies in need of rescue and revive, creating a protective AoE. Similar to the Recluse, I think Ironeye is likely to be one of the strongest Nightfarers, in no small part due to their ranged-based playstyle and ability to mark enemies so your squad can deal extra damage. Though Ironeye lacks any defensive or healing-based support abilities, being able to pepper enemies with arrows at a safe distance will be a massive advantage. For those looking to roleplay a Bloodborne hunter, the Duchess is all about evasion and illusion, gaining an enhanced dodge, the ability to essentially repeat allies' attacks on an enemy with Restage, and a fantastic rescue ability in Finale, which makes allies invisible. Due to Duchess' well-balanced suite of abilities, impeccable style, and Bloodborne vibes, I wouldn't be surprised if she ended up as the most popular character. If you primarily play a strength main, then Raider will likely be for you, but it's hard to tell how good he'll actually be. His Totem Stela, summoning a giant rock that ranged characters can safely stand on and pepper enemies, seems totally cracked, but the rest of his abilities rely on taking damage, which isn't something you normally, y'know, want to do. Sure, he can reduce incoming damage with Retaliate, but would that be enough to mitigate hits from big bosses? It's unclear, but Raider will likely be a good combo with the Recluse and her healing through damage. Nightreign's resident spellcaster, the Recluse, honestly seems like the game's strongest class, though with a high skill ceiling. You might be looking at her abilities above wondering what the hell any of that means. Let me explain: this witch can collect three elemental attributes attached to allies and enemies, combining them to perform different spells. The sheer number of combinations and making them happen is why the Recluse will likely be the trickiest class to learn, but well worth it. She can also brand enemies and bosses with a blood sigil that returns health and magic to allies as they attack—extremely strong. Since the Executor hasn't been officially revealed yet, beyond the recent overview trailer, we don't know their exact abilities. That said, it's pretty clear that they're going to be focused around parrying and deflection and following up with big attacks; potentially a kind of Sekiro-esque class. From the footage timestamped above, we can see that they wield a katana that looks like it's alive, with little tendrils waving around (maybe they have some attack-based HP recovery like Blasphemous Blade), and a brass-looking set of armour. The Revenant is another character who hasn't been officially revealed, but we do know that they are a summon-based class, conjuring spirit ash creatures, as with the spirit-calling bell in Elden Ring. In this case, it looks like she uses a harp or lyre to create their summons. Otherwise, the Revenant is doll-like, resembling Ranni to some extent, clad in a dress, a variety of trinkets, and with a crown of flowers adorning her head.

    "title": "Elden Ring Nightreign's story is told in part through playable memories, so FromSoftware really is delivering lore through whacking things",
    "article_text": "Relive that time your character hit a monster really hard! When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If one thing is clear aboutElden RingNightreign, it's that this is gonna upset a lot of folks' expectations for what aFromSoftwareSouls game is. The co-op roguelike is built around short sessions, with each complete run lasting roughly 40 minutes, and that comes with a relentless pace: if you just enjoy bashing horrible monsters with big weapons, you're sorted, but those who love the subtleties of these worlds and the freeform exploration are mostly out of luck. But that doesn't mean the baby's been thrown out with the bathwater.In a new interview with IGNdirector Junya Ishizaki reveals how the game plans to tell its story: and in a game where hitting things is the main mechanic, they're making memories about it. \"Nightreign shares essentially the base setting and the world of Elden Ring, but it's played out on a different stage so to speak,\" says Ishizaki. \"So there's this concept called the Night Lord, which is a sort of abstract phenomenon or calamity that has befallen The Lands Between in this alternate timeline, and much like a real-life calamity, it's something that it's not done by design or intention: it's just something that has occurred naturally and it's befallen The Lands Between and it needed some sort of opposition. \"It needs something to oppose it, and that opposition comes in the form of the Nightfarers, who are these warriors who are entrusted with the fate of opposing and defeating the Nightlord and putting a stop to this terrible calamity.\" Elden Ring: Nightreign gives players eight classes to choose from, but in each case these Nightfarers had a past before everything went wrong. Each character's history is explored through Remembrances, which are accessed via the Roundtable Hold (which acts as Nightreign's hub between individual runs). There's a journal in the Roundtable Hold's library where you can view your current character's Remembrances: some of these are just story text, but some are playable memories from that character's past. These launch into a singleplayer Remembrance with hazy woo-woo borders around the action, and bespoke settings. These memories also include NPCs, who'll give the character a personal objective, and the style of Remembrance will differ for each character. Some will ask you to fetch a particular item from a particular place during a 'normal' run, then return to the Remembrance and give it to the NPC and progress the characters' stories. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. One example given of how the Remembrances differ between the characters is the Raider, whose memories build-out his past as some sort of arena fighter: so they're all one-on-one battles against various bosses. Elden Ring Nightreign is out on Steam on May 30. PCG's Morgan Park recently played three hours of the game, and had a lot of fun, even if it's not quite clear whether the game cankeep things interesting over a longer period: \"I hope I'm not dealing fatal psychic damage when I say that, structurally, Elden Ring Nightreign has more in common with Fortnite than Elden Ring.\" Rich is a games journalist with 15 years' experience, beginning his career on Edge magazine before working for a wide range of outlets, including Ars Technica, Eurogamer, GamesRadar+, Gamespot, the Guardian, IGN, the New Statesman, Polygon, and Vice.

    "title": "ThunderX3 Flex Pro Ergonomic Office Chair review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The ThunderX3 Flex Pro is a little confused about what it wants to be, but that actually boosts its performance as a gaming chair while only limiting its office chair capabilities by a negligible amount. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The ThunderX3 Flex Pro is a strange chair, mostly because I'm not entirely sure it knows what it wants to be. A professional-looking chair with few frills, it's at its best not when you're sitting bolt upright concentrating on a meeting or working diligently at your keyboard, but when you're almost dangerously reclined, gamepad in hand as you relax at your desk. The flexibility to allow you to switch between those two approaches is one of the Thunder X3 Flex Pro's biggest selling points. Boasting 19 different \"dimensions of adjustment,\" you can feel it working to accommodate you no matter what orientation you're sitting in. Across its seat, lumbar, back, and head rests, a combination of mesh material and a dizzying number of moving parts means that you've got plenty of support. Perhaps most outlandish are the two separate lumbar support panels. Moving independently of one another, they're the stars of the show whether you're sitting up or leaning back. If that sounds a little more 'massage chair' than 'office chair' to you, the good news is that all of this chair's various moving parts can be locked in place, often with nothing more than the simple twist of a lever. The extent of all that adjustability does mean that you might have to struggle through some confused pushing and pulling at the start, but that should be a short-term problem. With all those moving parts, I was worried that the ThunderX3 Flex Pro would be a building nightmare, but thankfully I was wrong. The entire build took me 30 minutes on my own, and while the hardest part was getting its enormous, heavy box up the stairs to my office, actually pulling the whole thing together was pretty easy. I thought I'd be in for a nightmare of complex moving pieces, but 12 screws and just six major components brought the entire chair together. Fabric:MeshMaximum load:150 kgWeight:25.5 kgArmrest rotation:360°Price:$500/£419 Unfortunately, not all of those components are great. The mesh seat is quite hard, which feels a little out of place with the gentle give that the rest of the chair clearly prides itself on. It's also pretty small, and while you don't really notice that while leaning back, while sitting up I'm not dealing with a lot of extra room, despite fitting firmly within the size and weight descriptions. And for how solid some of the rest of the build feels, I was a little disappointed by the simple plastic rollers I got for wheels. Thankfully, my initial uncertainty about the armrests' 360-degree adjustability seems to have been mostly unfounded, but even for all the movement I do have access to, I've struggled to get them exactly where I wanted them. It's a slightly similar story with the headrest. It's massive, and you can move it around a fair bit, but I wanted to move it forward to give me some help while I'm sitting up as well as leaning back. Whether that's by design or my issue interpreting the slightly hieroglyphic instruction manual I'm not sure, but it's another slight miss. I was initially sceptical about the value of all that adjustability, especially when it didn't always seem to work as intended. The first time I sat down, it was easy to feel where the chair was moving with me, but only after I stopped sitting up straight. Almost immediately, it felt as though the ThunderX3 Flex Pro would be great for lazily leaning back with a gamepad, but would offer much less value in meetings or for keyboard + mouse games. Given how much more time I spend dealing with the latter than the former, that was a concern. Happily, I appear to have been wrong on that front. The combination of the hard seat and a bit of clever post-sitting adjustment around the lumbar support meant that I could feel nicely held up, even when sitting up straight. Obviously, it falls away if I lean forward, but an adjustable seat does offer a partial means of addressing that particular issue. ✅ You want endlessly adjustable comfort:The ThunderX3 Flex Pro moves in almost every dimension you can think of, mostly without you even having to think about it ❌ You want an office chair that supports excellent posture:The lumbar support is great, but I struggled to get the Flex Pro to adjust around a really straight spine. Nevertheless, it does leave me slightly torn on the ThunderX3 Flex Pro. For the price point, I think it's excellent—you're definitely getting more support and flexibility than most of its gaming chair competitors at the same price (and often at higher prices too). The problem is, some of this chair's biggest selling points feel a little like they're aiming in the wrong place. Much of its best supportive and flexible features fall away when you use it as an actual office chair. Sat forward at a desk, you're simply not feeling several of those 19 points of adjustment. Thankfully though, I do have to admit that when it comes to arguably its most important spot—the lumbar support—it does great work no matter how you sit. As a gaming chair, I think this is much better. Lean back, and you can feel the ThunderX3 Flex Pro moving with you, and the mesh material means it's breathable and has some decent give. The lumbar supports feel amazing here too, almost as though they're holding you up on their own. For longer sessions where you've using a gamepad and leaning back to drink in an hours-long open-world session, this chair does a really good job. It might require a little getting used to, and a little fine-tuning to make sure it's working at peak performance, but if you can get past that initial admin stage, this is a solid hybrid chair at a price that leaves its biggest gaming rivals pretty far behind, without compromising on anything more than a few small details. The ThunderX3 Flex Pro is a little confused about what it wants to be, but that actually boosts its performance as a gaming chair while only limiting its office chair capabilities by a negligible amount.

    "title": "Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 10 gaming laptop review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The new Legion chassis looks good, and the performance is absolutely top-notch. But it's the level of customisation that sings to me, allowing you to create a gaming profile that at once delivers the frame rates and the noise level you desire. Just a shame the battery life is still so weak. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. The new Legion is a real solid slab of gaming laptop goodness. It's robust, feels dense, and is the most powerful and performant of all the new notebooks we've been testing in this generation. It may feel like a classic big gaming laptop, but it's still got some tricks up its sleeve which make it a great modern gaming laptop. It would be all too easy to tar the Legion Pro 7i with the same anachronistic brush as theGigabyte Aorus Master 16andMSI Vector 16 HX AI—it is, after all, very much one of those big old school gaming laptops you expect to have plumbed into a power source for its entire life. But, though it doesn't have the same thinned-down chassis as the latestRazer Blade 16design, Lenovo has given its Legion line a complete redesign, which makes it look far slicker and with more than a hint of theAlienwareflair about it, too. The angular RGB rings around the exhaust ports on the rear of theLegion Pro 7i Gen 10are what give that feel, and that's not a bad thing. There's a real style about this new chassis design that I'm into. It feels knowingly solid, designed to be a strong base for your mobile components, and give them enough cooling power to keep them running at peak performance. It's also made it more of a unit by culling the side exhaust vents and leaving just that whole expanse at the back of the machine for blowing out all the hot air from the system. That makes it feel more grown-up, with the chassis being more enclosed rather than all exhausts and vents. To me, it feels more modern and that RGB flair—like the tail-lights of a BMW concept car or a Tron light-cycle—has a definite style which doesn't feel crass in the way external lightbars often can. CPU:Intel Core Ultra 9 275HXRAM:32 GB DDR5-6400GPU:Nvidia RTX 5080 (175 W)Screen:16-inch OLEDRefresh:240 HzNative resolution:2560 x 1600Storage:2x 1 TB SSDBattery:99.9 WhrDimensions:21.9 ~ 26.6 x 364 x 275.9 mm | 0.86 - 1.04 x 14.33 x 10.86-inchWeight:2.72 kg | 6 lbsPrice:$3,560|£3,200 Lenovo has also taken the same approach as Razer in terms of creating a large underslung \"thermal hood\" over the triple intake fans, giving it a lot of space to pull in cooling air. And, again like the Razer design, the Legion is super-easy to open up, though here with just a Phillips screwdriver and a little shiv to pry it open. There's a secondary thermal covering to the twin SSDs and SODIMM slots, but that's labelled up to make it simple to remove, too. Okay, that's just me taking a lot of words to say, 'hey, it might not be a skinny boi, but I really like the look and experience of the new Legion.' And Ireallylike the performance of the new machine. This is outright the most performantRTX 5080-toting gaming laptop I've tested so far, and whoever's going to compete with Lenovo is going to have to really pull some levers (and push the cooling array) to get their machines even on par with the Legion Pro 7i. So yes, there's an RTX 5080 mobile GPU as the gaming heart of this laptop, and as with most of the rest of the pack we're looking at a 175 W version of the Nvidia GPU. That's the top RTX 5080 spec around, but even so in our Metro Exodus Enhanced testing we never saw the power draw go much above the 150 W mark, with an average of 127 W. It's a similar story with all the other nominally 175 W GPUs I've checked out this year, and arguably the Legion is one which pushes its hardware as hard and as far as any others. But it's not just about the GPU inside this laptop, because Lenovo has also seen fit to drop an Arrow Lake-HX chip into its Gen 10 laptops, and here that means an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX. That's a 24-core hybrid chip, with eight full-fledged performance cores giving it the gaming grunt. And, while I am very much into theAMD RyzenAI chips for their efficient power-sipping performance, you cannot argue with the CPU grunt the latest Intel mobile chips display. You just have to look at the relative Cinebench or Baldur's Gate 3 performance numbers to see the delta between AMD and Intel on this one. Still, we haven't seen AMD's trump card yet, the Ryzen 9 9955HX3D. That ought to be a gaming CPU powerhouse, though likely in far fewer notebooks than Intel can deliver. There is also 32 GB DDR5-6400 in there, in two ranks of standard SODIMMs. Which is important because Lenovo was certainly guilty of somegross offences against gaming laptop memoryin the previous generation. It's something Alienware does, too, but still, only slapping a single stick of 16 GB DDR5 memory into a gaming laptop is just plain wrong. Thankfully, Lenovo is going full dual-channel here—with a single stick, even if it's fast memory, you're getting half the bandwidth of using two sticks, even adding up to the same overall capacity. It's also doubling up on storage, too, with a pair of 1 TB SK Hynix SSDs giving you options as to where to store your games. It's not configured in any kind of RAID array—the PCIe 4 SSDs are plenty fast enough for gaming needs—and so you're just getting one speedy SSD for your OS and another identical one for extra data. Simple, and effective. And all of that lovely mobile silicon leads to the Legion Pro 7i delivering generally the highest gaming performance out of any machine touting the same core parts. Lenovo has tuned its system to the point where it genuinely delivers on frame rates. That's even true when we put it up against theRTX 5090in the Razer Blade 16. Though that isn't really indicative of the sort of frame rates youcouldget out of the top RTX Blackwell GPU if you jammed it in a broad 18-inch chassis. The Legion Pro 7i has the frame rate edge in pretty much every game at 1080p, though things are a touch closer when it comes to the 1600p tests. That said, once you go into 'real-world' testing, using DLSS and Frame Generation, the Lenovo lappy pulls out in front again. But, as you will no doubt expect from a gaming laptop review, here comes the expected, 'but it ain't half loud' comment. And yes, running the LegionSpace app and sticking the machine in Performance mode will make those fans rather noticeable. What I will say is that it's nowhere near as ear-splitting as the racket that the Legion 9iI tested with an RTX 4090 gets at full speed. Unlike the MSI Vector 16 HX AI or even the Gigabyte Aorus Master 16, knocking things back to the Balanced mode isn't particularly satisfying from a gaming perspective, however. Where those machines tempered the fan noise but only lost a touch of gaming performance, Lenovo's setup seems to be rather more aggressive when it comes to limiting the GPU, while still letting the Intel processor go wild with its 5 GHz+ frequencies. Sure, you get lower fan noise, but the fps tradeoff is much more prominent. That would be a huge shame for the Legion Pro 7i if that were the end of the story. Yay! Highest performance! Boo! A big hit on the gaming mode that you would actually want to use! Thankfully, that LegionSpace app has a little trick up its digital sleeve I've been wanting to see in laptops since I first got my mitts on a modern handheld gaming PC: Actual granular power control. The Custom setting is the most configurable I've seen in any laptop, gaming or otherwise. It's something I've been crying out for with the Framework machines, and it's great to see the level of control Lenovo is letting its users have. You can only use it when the system is plugged into the wall, but when you do it reveals a sea of sliders allowing you to adjust the power limits, both short and long term, as well as both the CPU -> GPU and GPU -> CPU Dynamic Boost options. You can also mess with the full 150 Watt configurable TGP of the graphics chip and set temperature limits on both the processor and the GPU. It's super granular, and allowed me to create a custom profile that knocked back the CPU demands while bumping up the graphics card limits. That makes it a relatively quiet, but still very powerful, gaming mode. That's my new balanced mode, and that's the version I'm sticking to. I've not had this level of freedom with the settings of a gaming laptop in some time—maybe not ever—and I give huge props to Lenovo for actually not trying to dumb this stuff down and trust its users. Well, trust them to an extent. While there is a fun curve editor, that initial level is the lowest on offer, not allowing you to go lower and limit the cooling to such an extent that it might fry some silicon. A nice visual touch is the Legion logo around the power button lights up different colours to indicate which profile you are using and glows hot pink—my personal PC RGB preference—when in my new custom gaming mode. I do like that logo lighting quite a lot. More than I really should, to be honest. But strangely, it's the little things with expensive bits of kit that can really sell them. I love the way it slowly flashes when you lift the lid and it wakes out of sleep, flashing faster as it glows up into life before going solid the instant the screen comes on. Speaking of little things, here's one I don'treallylike: the trackpad. Now, it is responsive and slippy in all the good ways, but it feels almost restrictively small. It is absolutely functional, and its central placement beneath the spacebar means hitting a right-click isn't as tricksy to get your muscle memory around as with the frankly enormous Blade 16 pad, but it's the only area where the package doesn't feel completely premium. Though everything else does. I regularly refer to Lenovo as the best in the business when it comes to laptop keyboards and the one on this Legion Pro 7i is typically good. Razer has upped its game, giving you more travel on the keys, but Lenovo has been refining its design for years, and it's ace. There's great travel, there's plenty of space between the keys while still offering a full, and importantly accessible numpad. And the OLED screen is glorious. Even set at 66%, the screen feels pleasingly bright in a well-lit springtime office, and the colours and contrast are impeccable. It's not too warm, there's a glossy coating which only accentuates that pin-sharp contrast, and the 16-inch panel means that even at 1600p, there's some real fine pixel density right here. Where there is one major let-down—and it's only in the face of improvements from other manufacturers—it's the battery life. Lenovo Legion machines have almost always had appalling gaming battery life, and while the Legion Pro 7i isn't the worst we've seen, sitting only just over the hour mark is disappointing for a GPU generation that has been touting on-battery gaming. ✅You only care about raw gaming performance:The Legion Pro 7i has this in spades, thanks to its large chassis and quality cooling, making it the laptop which consistently delivers the top gaming performance almost across the board.✅You want to tweak the power and fansjust so:The custom profiling in the Legion Pro gives the end user an unprecedented level of control over the power the individual gaming components draw, allowing you to perfectly tailor your laptop experience. ❌You want to experience the promised battery gaming of the RTX Blackwell generation of laptops:The Legion Pro is a classic Lenovo gaming laptop, in that it really does not perform for long away from a power source. Certainly that's eminently possible with the RTX 5090 and Blade 16, but with the Legion Pro 7i, however, gaming on this thing's battery really isn't. I partly blame the Intel CPU—as you can see from the benchmarks, all the other Intel-based RTX 5080 machines come way behind the AMD-powered Razer—but it's also down to the tuning and efficiency of the Lenovo build as a whole. This thing's rocking a 99.9 Whr battery and shouldn't be delivering such a poor level of uptime while gaming. It's nowhere near as bad when you'renotgaming, but that's not really the point. I'm not really going to hold that against the Legion too much, though. This is a classical 16-inch gaming laptop, not one developed for gaming on the go, more about gaming when you finally reach your destination and can plug in. And in that, it excels. The starting price is steep, however. Especially in the face of a Razer Blade 16 that costs a shade less. What I will say is the Legion will confidently outperform the Razer machine with the same RTX 5080, so if that's all you care about—and portability and on the go performance be damned—then the Legion Pro 7i has the edge. It's also probably worth stating that last generation's best value gaming laptop was arguably the Legion Pro 7i with an RTX 4080, which quickly dropped in price. And I wouldn't be surprised to see this drop down below the $3,000 mark by the end of the year. I like the clean, nicely RGB-lit looks of the new Legion chassis, I'm into the all-round performance of the device, and I absolutely love the level of customisation the Lenovo Legion software now affords its users. I'm still always going to be pining after the new Blade 16 as my go-to gaming laptop of choice, but this is a pretty close second if all you want is straight line gaming performance. The new Legion chassis looks good, and the performance is absolutely top-notch. But it's the level of customisation that sings to me, allowing you to create a gaming profile that at once delivers the frame rates and the noise level you desire. Just a shame the battery life is still so weak. Dave has been gaming since the days of Zaxxon and Lady Bug on the Colecovision, and code books for the Commodore Vic 20 (Death Race 2000!).

    "title": "AceZone A-Blaze wireless gaming headset review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The A-Blaze feature set seems to contradict itself. Great battery life and wireless connectivity should make it a killer wireless headset for travelling, but the sub-par on-ear controls and a non-removable boom mic hold it back from greatness. Where it excels is in marathon gaming sessions. From its lightweight and comfortable frame, to its clear, speedy, and accurate soundstage, it's one for serious gamers who don't expect to go outside with it. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. Built for gaming, the AceZone A-Blaze design skirts a fine line between affordability, portability, and practicality. Against previous AceZone wireless gaming headsets, we're looking at a fairly cut-down model meant to bring pro-gaming audio to the masses. There's a lot of competition in this price range though, and while the A-Blaze sticks to its roots as a ferocious gaming headset, it may have been pruned a little too hard in order to hit that fiscal sweet-spot. The AceZone A-Blaze goes hard on comfort. Wearing it all day, every day, for the past week I've only felt minor discomfort on my crown, despite the thin headband. I'm a stickler for a floating headband like that of theArctis Nova Pro, but the A-Blaze is cushioned enough that it's not a real issue. The rotating cans and ear cup padding further serve this feather-light gaming headset, all but eliminating the pressure I'd usually get from wearing glasses. Even my chunky hoop earrings aren't an issue, which is kinda wild. That's thanks in part to the flexibility of the headband, as well as the glorious ear-cup padding. Thankfully, AceZone has also added swappable earpads over some previous models, which is always a welcome feature since pleather tends to shed after a while. There's an evident focus on build quality here, but that's not to say the A-Blaze neglects aesthetics. It's nowhere near as jarring to look at as some sharp and garish gaming headsets I've seen, and it doesn't show off with flashy RGB either. Its subtle, almost retro styling nearly makes it worthy of whipping out on the bus, though the un-detachable mic and pop shield makes you look like youworkfor the bus company. Style:Over-ear, closed-backDriver:40 mmFrequency response:20 Hz - 20 kHzMicrophone:Flip-to-mute boomBattery life:45 hoursConnection:2.4 GHz wireless (Type-C dongle), Bluetooth 5.4, USB Type-A to USB Type-C cableWeight:270 g | 9.5 ozPrice:$199|£169 I have been impressed with the A-Blaze microphone, though. Handling plosives and sibilants well, it's great for in-game chat and Discord calls and doesn't sound too harsh, though it can come across a little compressed compared to thebest gaming microphones. There's some fair active noise cancelling on the A-Blaze. Hybrid ANC, AceZone calls it. And although there's only on, off, and transparency settings, it does a great job of reducing more distant droning sounds like passing cars and air-con. Still, it's nowhere near the kind of ANC you'd get in the $200+ price range. As for sound, the A-Blaze comes with a middling frequency response that, while it's more than satisfactory for everyday use it isn't the most well-rounded. It's well-editable in the accompanying equalizer app, though you'll need to connect via both Bluetooth and Wireless to get the benefit in game since there's no Windows app. When gaming, footsteps and vocals are clear. I've definitely been hearing sounds I don't usually notice, which says something about the A-Blaze's ability to pick up more distant in-game audio. While it doesn't match the sound quality of its big sister, the A-Rise (usually around£700/$750), it's certainly speedy and accurate. Plus it's supremely light by comparison and doesn't cost the earth. Where other headsets have struggled as I move around the house and garden, the AceZone keeps a super consistent connection over wireless. It even stays connected to the wireless dongle some three doors down from my house, though the Bluetooth has some trouble with lots of other signals present. My main issue while I'm listening to music away from my PC, is that there's a point at which the pause button refuses to work while the sound is still ringing clear. What's more, when I return to my PC, pause, then try to unpause music, it starts playing a random YouTube tab I have open. Basically, it picks up the input of whatever is the active window. Thankfully it does no such thing in-game. Still, the on-ear controls are a little lacking. Aside from the utter lack of back and forward music controls that other wireless headsets pride themselves on, the volume also jumps up a lot on a quick button press—I once had it go from 76% to 100%, which was a bit of a shock. Just something to be aware of if you've got sensitive ears. ✅ You've got a really big house:The flawless connection through the 2.4 GHz dongle means you can move pretty far while on call without it cutting out. ✅ You're looking to go pro:With incredibly accurate and fast audio, alongside comfort and great battery life, the A-Blaze will see you right in marathon gaming sessions. ❌ You have a lot of Bluetooth accessories:There are some Bluetooth connectivity issues when a lot of wireless signals are pinging around.❌You want to walk around outside with your headset:No detachable mic means it looks silly walking about in public. If you're willing to forgo wireless and ANC altogether, you can nab theCorsair HS55 Stereofor better than half the price of this one, but then you're stuck tethered to your workstation. Still, if a wizard 300 hour battery life and stellar wireless is what you seek, theHyperX Cloud Alphais our top wireless headset at£190/$100, and often found on sale. It's a little heavier but just as comfortable, and even comes with a detachable mic. And while the A-Blaze improves upon the£279/$369wirelessA-Spiredesign, with improved aesthetics, better wireless performance, more impressive battery life, and a nice pop-shield for the mic, AceZone notes that its ANC is a little weaker by comparison, as is the noise cancelling microphone. There are plenty of similar-specced headsets going for slightly cheaper. Take the Turtle Beach Stealth 600 for example, which sits at around£100/$100. While it delivers arguably better sound quality with its 50 mm Nanoclear drivers and more resounding ear cups, it doesn't quite match the comfort or battery-life of the A-Blaze. The question is, are you willing to sacrifice a little extra cash and a little control, for fae-like connection over Wi-Fi and a gratuitous 45-hour battery life? While your average gamer won't need or even benefit from the lightning fast response times this wireless gaming headset provides, it's got it where it counts for those looking to go pro. Plus, there's a lot to love about a sleek, comfy gaming headset that'll keep going, all night long. I just really wish I had the option to remove the mic, so I could take it out on daily dog walks without getting funny looks. The A-Blaze feature set seems to contradict itself. Great battery life and wireless connectivity should make it a killer wireless headset for travelling, but the sub-par on-ear controls and a non-removable boom mic hold it back from greatness. Where it excels is in marathon gaming sessions.

    "title": "Fallout show actor says they know its 'endpoint' and it's sometime in season 5 or 6, which means we've still got loads of time to scream at each other about New Vegas",
    "article_text": "Phew. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fallout's second seasonjust wrapped filming, which means we're tantalisingly close to once again screaming at each other about Fallout: New Vegas. Personally, I can't wait. I'm already gearing up to cancel you over your terrible Raul Tejada take and write an overly long dissertation on how that guy who hangs out on the Hotel Golf balcony is actually an allegory for American imperialism. Wait, no.I already did that. It's a dance we'll repeat every time this show gets a new season, I'd wager. How many times will that be? Well, per Aaron Moten—the actor who plays Maximus in the show—around three or four more times. Moten says the show's arc as it's currently conceived would see the whole thing last five or six seasons (viaTheGamer). \"When I signed on to do the series, we would have a starting point, and they gave me the endpoint,\" said Moten on-stage at the recent Comic Con Liverpool event. With season 2 wrapped, that endpoint \"hasn't changed,\" and places the end of the show somewhere around \"season five, six, type of endpoint.\" Which means there's a heck of a lot of the Fallout TV show left to go, assuming Amazon sticks to the plan as it is right now. \"We've always known that we're going to take our time with the development of the characters,\" said Moten, leaving unspoken what was surely at the forefront of the creative team's minds: giving Fallout 1, 2 and New Vegas fans as much time as possible to boil their brains into stew. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of those people. Fallout 1 and New Vegas are two of my favourite games ever made, and while I enjoyed my time with FO3 and FO4, it's the West Coast tales that live in my heart. I'm incredibly curious to see what season 2 does with New Vegas as a setting now that Lucy, Maximus and co are heading there. The endings of the original game are so radically different that I struggle to imagine the show settling on a narrative that satisfies everyone, but I'd like to see it try. Who knows? Maybe they'll revealthat the \"brainrot theory\"that Maximus' Brotherhood is a syncretic mash-up of Caesar's Legion and OG Brotherhood remnants is totally true.

    "article_text": "\"We couldn't beat him.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 feels like a love letter to JRPGs—and that's because it pretty much is. Director Guillaume Broche has a long-lasting history with the genre, including an ill-fated attempt to play Final Fantasy 8 before he and his brother could actually read. That's per arecent interview with The Washington Post, wherein Guillaume recounts some of his earliest gaming memories: \"[FF8] came out at a time where my brother and I could barely read.\" Guillaume is, fittingly, 33 years old—which would've made him around 7 at the time. That does indeed put him within developmental striking distance of being able to barely read the reams of text in your average RPG. \"We have fond memories of struggling against the first boss. We couldn't beat him because we couldn't read, as the only thing we knew how to do was just auto-attack. Which is really bad.\" It's a charming little reveal from Guillaume, who appears to've hit the ground running with Sandfall. Having sunk a good 60 hours into a much-enjoyable playthrough myself, I can see the influences of his JRPG experiences scattered throughout it. There's the obvious stuff, like the heftily Persona-inspired menus, but then there's also other bits: Like that one volleyball minigame that raised my blood pressure, or those charmingly-janky jumping puzzles. Infuriating, optional nonsense is basically a mainstay of classic Final Fantasies. It's also unmistakably French, but Guillaume says that's all part of the cultural exchange: \"It goes both ways, because when we go to Japan as French developers with our game, we show them this distorted version of Paris, and we immediately catch their attention because they are also influenced by French culture. There is a reciprocal fascination for one culture to another.\" It's nice—and a little reassuring, given howcynical the industry has become—to see a game so clearly forged out of passion and appreciation for its contemporaries. Guillaume sums it up well at the tail-end of the interview: \"There is a lot of joy and sincerity in how we made the game, and I think it’s something players can connect with … We are emptied out. There is all of us in the game, nothing left.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "If you can call $899 affordable, I guess. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. WhileOLED gaming monitorsmight be a stretch goal for many of us, miniature versions are already being crammed into VR headsets. Much like their bigger, desktop-dwelling cousins, however, the price can be pretty prohibitive. Pimax may be bucking that trend, as it's announced theDream Air SE, a lighter weight, slightly lower-specced version of itsDream Air Micro-OLED VR headsetwith a much cheaper pre-order price than the standard model. It's still $899 for the Lighthouse version, which comes without controllers. Boo. Still, that's a full $1,000 cheaper than the non-SE controllerless version, and what you're getting in the headset itself is still pretty impressive. Two 2,560 x 2,560 resolution Micro-OLED panels sat behind tailored pancake lenses, for a start. That's not quite as impressive as the 3,840 x 3,552 resolution Sony versions you'll find in the standard Dream Air, but the SE should be much less hardware-demanding as a result. And it's still a fair few more pixels than the 2,064 x 2,208 you'll find in each LCD panel of our current best VR headset pick, theMeta Quest 3. Plus you get integrated audio and eye tracking, and the whole headset weighs less than 150 grams, which makes it significantly lighter than many traditional headsets I've strapped to my skull over the years. It's a downright gorgeous-looking design, too, if you're into the \"I-just-fell-through-an-Apple-factory-in-Cyberpunk-2077\" aesthetic. Should you wish for the luxury of included controllers (and Pimax's camera-based Simultaneous Localization and Mapping technology, negating the need for a base station tracking solution), you'll be looking at a total cost of $1,199. Thebest VR headsetswe've tested to date are significantly cheaper than that, but none of them come with Micro-OLED screens, and they don't come cheap. That price isn't exactly chump change, granted—but compared to the $2,099 you'd pay for the controller-including regular Dream Air (or the ludicrous $3,499 you'd pay for anApple Vision Pro), I'd say it's a relatively reasonable sum. If that's still too pricey a proposition to pay in one go, you could take a look at thePimax Primemembership program, which lets you pay off the base price of a headset before paying instalments on the rest, with a discount available for the one-off payment in relation to the standard retail price. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's all a bit overcomplicated if you ask me, but if Micro-OLED VR is where your dreams lie but the price is holding you back, it's probably worth considering. I haven't had a chance to get hands-on with the Dream Air myself, but I did visit the Pimax booth at CES 2025 for a play around with itsCrystal Light VR headset, and the results were impressive. Best VR headset: which kit should you choose?Best graphics card: you need serious GPU power for VRBest gaming laptop: don't get tied to your desktop in VR I've never been particularly sold on VR in general, but as a newly-discovered flight sim fan I have to say it really adds something to the experience of bombing around in a fighter jet inDCS World. Plus, our main critique of thePimax Crystal Lightis its overall bulkiness. The Dream Air and Dream Air SE look downright svelte by comparison, which matters when you plan on wearing something attached to the front of your face for a sweaty, adrenaline-filled gaming session.

    "article_text": "Say goodbye to your career (mode). When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The news that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 wouldn't include the popular career mode from the original 4th game wasn't received well when it was announced in March. Instead, the timed challenges from the first three games would replace the mode that so many skaters loved. Inan interview with Game Informer, Iron Galaxy's design director Mike Rossi says: \"We looked at 3, and that was obviously another very highly regarded title in the franchise. So then it was 'Let's look at 4. It's quite different, but what at its essence is it?' Our goal here is to make the ultimate package of 3 and 4. So ultimately, we felt that taking it into feeling more towards the 3 format as opposed to what 4 did originally, was a better representation for a cohesive package.\" Rossi claims the decision wasn't made lightly either, especially since so many hardcore Pro Skater 4 players were bound to be upset with the mode missing from the remaster. The interview goes on to share the anxieties Iron Galaxy felt about changing such a significant part of a well-loved game. But Rossi then stated that it \"benefits the titles as they exist.\" Which, as much as I will miss the career mode, is the most important thing. But with that said, even though career's gone, you aren't just limited to the fixed 2-minute timer like the original games. You will have the opportunity to extend the timer up to 60 minutes to give yourself more time to pull off sick tricks and complete challenges. Whenspeaking with Press Start, Rossi explained that this compromise was made because of feedback online stating that players \"didn't always love the two-minute timer. They'd want just a little bit more time.\" The more objective-based approach to the remaster of Pro Skater 4 will definitely be a change of pace compared to the original, but at least some compromises are being made to keep players happy. Challenges from the original game have been implemented with this new time format too, so in a way, it might be a chance to test how far your virtual skating skills have come.

Elon Musk'sColossus supercomputerthat powers Grok, xAI's alternative to ChatGPT, tackles this by using over 30 methane gas turbine stations, but the construction has incurred fierce criticism over its impact on local air quality. WhenColossus fired up for the first time last year, it was already making headlines. Partly because it took a mere three months to build, but also because its appetite for water and electricity was raising eyebrows. In the case of the latter, the system uses anywhere between 50 and 150 MW of power, and in order to meet that demand, xAI installed a number of methane-burning gas turbines. A report by theSouthern Environmental Law Center(viaFudzilla) claims that these turbines were installed without permits and raises serious concerns over the potential impact these machines will have on the local air quality, due to their emissions. To make matters worse, it appears that xAI is now retrospectively applying for permits to use the turbines constantly. Memphis news channelWREGwrites that the mayor of Memphis, Paul Young, had argued that things weren't as bad as they seem, quoting him as saying, \"There are 35 [turbines], but there are only 15 that are on. The other ones are stored on the site.\" However, thermal camera footage taken by the Southern Environmental Law Center (SLEC) shows, for that moment in time at least, 33 of the turbines generating large amounts of heat—in other words, they were in heavy use. SLEC goes on to criticise xAI's approach to the Colossus project: \"From the beginning, the company operated with a stunning lack of transparency that left impacted communities in the dark. Even many Memphis city officials were unaware of the facility’s plans and how it would be powered.\" One might think that using fossil fuels is a poor choice—not just because of the environmental impact but also because of therapid rise of renewable systems—but with President Trump rolling out a raft ofexecutive orders favouring the return to fossil fuels, it's perhaps not hard to see why xAI chose gas turbines over anything else. However, it's unlikely to be a long-term solution. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There is no way to avoid the huge energy demands of any data center, and it's a problem that will only get worse, as more systems come online to meet theAI growth targetsthat Google, Meta, OpenAI, xAI, and Microsoft all have. Musk hopes to haveColossus expanded from 200,000 up to one million GPUs, and no amount of gas turbines can realistically hope to cover that. So, xAI will have to rely on the local electricity network and battery storage systems to meet that level of demand. But that passes the problem of generating the electricity onto somebody else, and they may well resort to using fossil fuels, even if xAI doesn't. What is artificial general intelligence?:We dive into the lingo of AI and what the terms actually mean. If you don't use or have no interest in Grok, you might think that this has no real impact on PC gaming. However, it's worth noting that AMD, Intel, and Nvidia are all heavily invested in building and using data centers to train and run AI inference for their graphics technologies. In the case of the latter, Team Green ran such a systemflat-out for six years, just to improve DLSS. While Nvidia's center is unlikely to have anything near the same energy demands as Colossus, it's a reminder that the cost of sustaining the growth of AI is more than mere dollars. Energy and the environment have a sizeable share of the bill, too.

    "article_text": "\"Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget for Borderlands 3. More than twice.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Gearbox Software co-founder and CEO Randy Pitchford is going full PT Barnum for the release of Borderlands 4, bullishly telling everyone that this is going to be the best Borderlands since sliced bread, and wading into online fights to tell the doubters to \"play the game first.\" Heck he even pulled a Todd Howard: \"you see something anywhere on the screen, a mile away, up in the sky, you will be able to get there.\" Speaking at PAX East (thanks, GR+), Pitchford now says the development team is \"on offense\" and, apparently, this is the game he needs in his life right now. \"Look, sometimes we're white-knuckling to the landing,\" Pitchford said, referring to past Gearbox titles. \"And we've got a lot of work to do, we're working our asses off, but the momentum is insane. The velocity is insane. \"I don't think we've ever been in a better spot this far from launch as we are right now with Borderlands 4. And I'm really stoked because I kind of need a game like this right now, you know? I kind of need this. So I'm stoked to play it.\" Unlike a certain other Take-Two title, Borderlands 4's release date was recently moved forwards: it's now out on September 12 (it was due September 23). That's because, in Pitchford's words, the team is \"cooking\" and the game is \"awesome.\" This guy really would do a good job as a carnival barker. Pitchford also touched on price, specifically in relation to Nintendo setting the new Mario Kart World at an eye-watering $80. \"It's an interesting time,\" says Pitchford. \"On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where the people that make those choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people that are price-sensitive. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"There are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There's other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing, and there's tariffs for the retail packaging. It's getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands 4 has more than twice the development budget for Borderlands 3. More than twice. So the truth is, I don't know what the price is going to be.\" That sounds… potentially expensive. Pitchford spiels a little more about how more revenue means bigger and better games in future, but at the same time \"we want everyone who buys and plays a Gearbox game to feel certain that they got the better end of the bargain.\" Pitchford says the game's price will be set \"soon,\" and it \"might be the new price that Nintendo and Microsoft have led with\" or \"it might be that we stay back.\" Finally, it's always good to end with a gag: this one taking aim at the people lamenting the absence of a minimap in the game's HUD. \"If it is cheaper, maybe we'll sell you that minimap that you guys want that we'll develop later,\" smiled Pitchford. \"How bad do you want that? $10? I don't know.

    "title": "Arctic Freezer 36 review",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Freezer 36 could be nearly double the price and still get a look in for our guide to the best air coolers. It's affordable, effective, and quiet—look no further. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. You can't beat an air cooler on a budget and there's no better example of that than the superb Arctic Freezer 36. It's quiet, performs exceptionally well, and is very affordable—what more could you ask for? Arctic has nailed the formula with the Freezer 36. I've used other popular designs from the company prior to this, such as the Freezer 34, but without a doubt the Freezer 36 is the one to buy today. A big part of that is price. You can buy a Freezer 36 for$46/£23today, which puts it very much on the budget end of price scale—a true budget hero in the UK, if pretty close in the US, too. That's the price for model with aluminium and copper on show, and the one I have for review. It doesn't look half bad. However, you can also spend a few dollars more on the all-black version ($48), or a little more again (in the US) on the RGB version ($59/£35). If I had the option at the time, I'd have gone for the all-black, but this is a popular cooler, and for good reason. The Freezer 36 is ready for any modern PC, with AM4/AM5 mounting options and support for Intel LGA1700 and LGA1851 using an included contact frame. Type:single-towerFans:2x P12 PWM PSTCPU support:Intel LGA1700/1851, AM4/AM5Extras:Arctic MX-6 thermal pastePrice:$46/£23(standard version) That's right, a contact frame is included in the box with this budget cooler. I'm as surprised as you are. If you're not familiar, this is a replacement for the ILM (levered mounting bracket) that comes pre-installed on a motherboard. It surrounds the CPU on all sides, and offers a studier point to mount a cooler onto. It's a good thing to have with a 13/14th Gen Intel processor as these are prone to bending ever-so-slightly under continued use, which can lead to higher temperatures over time. A contact frame prevents that. So, this budget cooler comes with a contact frame, saving around $10, maybe more, on buying one separately. It's good to see a manufacturer taking processor bend seriously, too, alongside brands like Noctua that have released models of their coolers for already bent chips (once a chip is bent, it's staying that way). I've carried out all my testing using our usual Core i7 14700K test bench. That means loading the contact frame into place for installation. It's a bit trickier to install than a traditional Intel cooler bracket, which often tend to be screwed into place using a rear bracket. There is more scope for damaging your motherboard's socket without the ILM in place, which you have to remove using an included Torx key. Once off, it's much easier if you have your motherboard laid flat to keep the CPU in the socket, then it's fairly easy to fit the contact frame around it, making sure to orient it the correct way using the matching symbols and keeping the rear plate in the correct position. Like I said, the Freezer 36 is trickier to install on an Intel chip than your average cooler, but a contact frame is worthwhile to have, especially on a brand new chip. I also installed the Freezer 36 on an AMD-powered PC. This was a simpler process, and only required removing the motherboard cooler mounting points and replacing with the included brackets and spacers. Oh, and there's a small 0.8 gram tube of Arctic MX-6 thermal paste in the box that's good for an install or two. I didn't use it, as I test with MX-4 across everything, but it's great to see everything you need included in the box. With the cooler installed, it's onto testing. The Freezer 36 manages to deal with the power-hungryCore i7 14700Kextremely well while gaming. On average, in extended runs of Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition and Baldur's Gate 3, it outperformed the Cooler Master Hyper 612 Apex andBe Quiet! Dark Rock 5, both of which are more expensive, and it even matched theNoctua NH-D15 G2in Baldur's Gate 3. It did allow for marginally higher maximum temperatures at times, and this is where the NH-D15 G2 comes into its own, though well within the expected variance with cooler testing. It is a different story when it comes to Cinebench R23 and X264 benchmarks, both of which are hugely CPU intensive. Not a single air cooler I've tested to date is able to handle the 14700K in these benchmarks and the Freezer 36 doesn't buck that trend. However, I do run a separate test in which I tune the 14700K down to 120 W. This puts the power-hungry Intel chip, usually able to run up to 253 W, on a more level-pegging with modern Intel and AMD processors, the latter often running at a 120 W TDP. It's not a massive drop for the 14700K, as it more often than not runs closer to 120 W than 253 W, but it does mean the Freezer 36 and most other air coolers stand a chance of keeping it cool. PC Gamer test rigCPU:Intel Core i7 14700K |Motherboard:AsusROG Maximus Z790 Dark Hero |GPU:Nvidia RTX 4070 Founders Edition |RAM:G.Skill Trident Z5 @ 5600 MT/s |SSD:Sabrent 2 TB |PSU:Gigabyte Aorus P1200W |Case:Thermaltake Core P5 (open) ✅ You want a simple, affordable cooling solution:You needn't go overboard on your CPU cooler. The Freezer 36 is all you really need for most modern chips, and it won't break the bank. ❌ You want the simplest installation on Intel:The inclusion of a contact frame is awesome, though it does make for a slightly more involved install process compared to some. AMD installs are easy enough, anyways. Since I also fitted this cooler inside a gaming PC powered by aRyzen 5 9600X, I can confirm it manages to cool just about anything that chip can muster. Even throwing Cinebench R24, Blender, 7Zip and 3DMark Time Spy Extreme only saw a max temp of 72 °C, and throughout various gaming benchmarks it kept the CPU at 62 °C or lower. All of which is to say, it performs easily as well as more premium air coolers, but what's more is how quietly it goes about it. This single-tower cooler is sandwiched between two P12 PWM PST fans. These aren't anything special, except that they connect to the tower using what Arctic calls a 'click system', which is essentially made up of small metal fittings that click into place without any additional clips. It's a small difference, but it makes for a cleaner finish overall. Whatisspecial is these two fans make very little noise during operation. We test all coolers with the fans ramped up to 100%, to get a gauge of the maximum performance on offer, and these two were quieter than some coolers with just one. Seriously impressive, Arctic, and you wouldn't expect it from looking at it. Quiet, performant, and affordable—the Freezer 36 gets a whole lot right. You could spend more on something like the Be Quiet! Dark Rock 5 for better looks, or get something flashier in the Cooler Master Hyper 612 Apex or 212 Pro, but you wouldn't get anything as complete as you would with the Freezer 36. I won't belabour the point for long as I think this is one of the easiest recommendations I've made in years: if you need a cooler for your next CPU upgrade, and you don't want to spend a lot, the Arctic Freezer 36 is easily one of the best you can buy today. The Freezer 36 could be nearly double the price and still get a look in for our guide to the best air coolers. It's affordable, effective, and quiet—look no further.

    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Cooler Master 612 Apex looks like it should cost a million bucks. It doesn't, of course. It's surprisingly affordable and plenty capable, if a little louder than some. PC Gamer's got your backOur experienced team dedicates many hours to every review, to really get to the heart of what matters most to you.Find out more about how we evaluate games and hardware. I find the Hyper 612 to be oddly satisfying to look at. It stands out for having little about it that actually stands out. It has a wholly understated design yet its silver-sided fans make it something of a showpiece in the right build to match. It looks more expensive than it is, and that's a very good quality to have, though you could spend less on something equally effective. No expense has been spared with the packaging of this air cooler. Its slight air of pretention carries over to the cloth bag it's tucked inside. A nice touch, if a little unnecessary. Remove it from its sheath and there are only a few flourishes in its design: a small Cooler Master logo on the top plate and the aforementioned silver facade to the fan housing. It's a hefty unit, measuring 159 mm in height and weighing 1.134 kg. Make sure you measure the space between your CPU and the side panel on your chassis, as this is the biggest compatibility concern for this cooler. You'll probably be fine, as many cases will be sufficient, but as it stands a little taller from the motherboard than some modern graphics cards there could be the occasional issue. You really don't want this butting up against your tempered glass side panel. On either side of the lone heatsink tower sits a Mobius 120P PWM fan. These come with nicely braided cables and are installed with a rail system that cuts out any fiddling with wire mounts or screws. It's a neat system for installation, especially as the top plate is magnetic and peels away easily, and it makes for easy access to the screws below, but there are downsides. Namely, you have to unscrew the mounts attached to the heatsink if you want to reverse the orientation of the fans, but also you are a little stuck with the fans it comes with. Type:Single-towerFans:2x Mobius 120P PWMCPU support:Intel LGA1700/1851/1200/1151/1150/1155/1156 + AM4/AM5Price:$65/£55 Now, potentially, yes, you could switch out the included fans for others, but they'd have to be pretty similar in size and shape to match the fittings used on the Mobius models and removing the silver facade on either side feels like an experiment in how far you can bend plastic until it breaks. It's all possible, but much more work than most. You needn't be too concerned with switching out the fans, at least. They're not the quietest on offer, and a good deal louder thanArctic's Freezer 36in my testing, but it's still on the quieter side when compared with most liquid coolers. You won't find a lick of lighting anywhere on the 612 Apex, fans included, but that's to be expected from its clean-cut finish. Installation is fairly straightforward on the 612 Apex. On Intel systems, a bracket and backplate are supplied to punch through the provided holes on the motherboard and secure down with thumbscrews. Easy peasy. On AMD systems, replace the pre-installed mounting bracket on your motherboard with the one provided, ensuring the correct orientation, and secure down with thumbscrews. Orientation is key here. The 612 Apex has a slight offset to the six copper heatpipes protruding from the coldplate, and ensures it sits away from the RAM and out of the way of the motherboard. There's no overhang over the memory by the right-most fan in this configuration, which is a good thing as there's only around 35 mm of height between fan and coldplate, which could be quite restrictive for memory module selection otherwise. You don't have to worry about that, providing you absolutely want the cooler mounted in this way. Any other way and it wouldn't fit my motherboard, theAsusROG Maximus Z790 Dark Hero, which has massive VRM heatsinks. In my testing, the 612 Apex performs admirably compared to the Freezer 36 andBe Quiet! Dark Rock 5. It keeps anIntel Core i7 14700Kat a steady 60 °C during five runs of the Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition benchmark, and while it did struggle more than those other two in Baldur's Gate 3, which is more CPU intensive, the average 78 °C isn't half-bad. In truly CPU-heavy benchmarks, Cinebench R23 and X264, it hit 100 °C and stayed near to that throughout, as is the case with all the air coolers I've tested, bar theNoctua NH-D15 G2, though it gets close. I've found a more reasonable test is to drop this chip down to 120 W in the BIOS—a match for AMD's top gaming chip, theRyzen 7 9800X3D—and run Cinebench R23 over again. In this test, the 612 Apex easily keeps the chip at bay with a superb 54 °C on average. PC Gamer test rigCPU:Intel Core i7 14700K |Motherboard:Asus ROG Maximus Z790 Dark Hero |GPU:Nvidia RTX 4070 Founders Edition |RAM:G.Skill Trident Z5 @ 5600 MT/s |SSD:Sabrent 2 TB |PSU:Gigabyte Aorus P1200W |Case:Thermaltake Core P5 (open) ✅ You have a tempered glass side panel:For pure performance, you can buy a Freezer 36, though if you want to make your build look a little more impressive, the 612 Apex is where it's at.✅ You have an AMD Ryzen or Intel Arrow Lake system:Like most, this air cooler deals with power-savvy chips better than a hot 14th Gen Intel chip. ❌ You want a quiet air cooler:This is pretty quiet on account of being an air cooler without the pump found on an all-in-one, but it's louder than others in its price range. Overall, a totally acceptable picture of performance for an air cooler on one of Intel's most power-hungry chips. Thankfully, most modern chips aren't anywhere near as demanding, and this cooler will come into its own. As for how it stands up versus the competition, such as the aforementioned Freezer 36 or Dark Rock 5, it all comes down to price. At its $80 MSRP, the 612 Apex is on the pricey side, and it's tough to justify even for its devilishly good looks. However, it is on sale over at Amazon for$65, and as far as I can tell that's been the case for some time. That's a lot more competitive and it's easier to argue the case for the 612 Apex when it's just $19 more than the Freezer 36. I wouldn't pay much more than that, however. At $65, it's priced similarly to the Dark Rock 5, which fluctuates in price around that sort of region. That's a tougher decision, as the Dark Rock does perform well for only a single fan, but I'd take the Cooler Master over it in a pinch. It looks sharper, and you need to be in it for looks to pick anything pricier than the Freezer 36. The same can't be said for the 612 Apex in the UK. It is still discounted at Amazon at£55, which looks to be a fairly steady price, but the Freezer 36 is an unbeatable£23. For pure performance-per-dollar, and price-per-decibel, the Freezer 36 has the Hyper 612 Apex beat. However, I really do like the styling a lot, and I think that counts for something. For more flair on a your next build, this is a good way to go about it without spending extra on a liquid cooler. The Cooler Master 612 Apex looks like it should cost a million bucks. It doesn't, of course. It's surprisingly affordable and plenty capable, if a little louder than some. Jacob earned his first byline writing for his own tech blog.

    "title": "WoW's Leeroy Jenkins, one of the internet's oldest memes, turns 20 years old—and after looking back on what we wrote in 2005, I feel like we've failed Leeroys everywhere",
    "article_text": "I'm comin' up with 32.33 (repeating of course) percentage of feeling your age. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I don't like to make our readers feel the weight of the passing years—but I'm afraid I have to inform you that Leeroy Jenkins, one of the internet's oldest memes, turned 20 years old yesterday. I know, I know. I'm not sure how to feel about it either. The meme (which is one year away from being able to drink in the US, and has already been slamming pints for two years in the UK) was releasedon May 11, 2005to Warcraftmovies—you know, back when you could still have websites dedicated to the machinima of a single game. Also, back when 'Machinima' was still a word people used. The video, recorded by the charmingly-named guild Pals for Life, features the titular Leeroy Jenkins just absolutely screwing up an entire raid pull in the Rookery of Blackrock Spire. It's a perfect comedy routine: A set of exasperated, tired gamers talking about their chances of successfully pulling off a good fight. One player saying, with full knowledge that the number's a complete asspull, how the group has a \"32.33 (repeating of course) percentage\" of victory. Then Leeroy, belting his own name like a battlecry to the gods, springs out of his AFK state, fuelled by some animating spirit of the skalds of legend, and barrels inside, quickly killing everybody in a swarm of dial-up internet lag and bad decisions. As the dust settles, he's called \"stupid as hell\", to which he replies \"at least I have chicken\". Two decades later, we're still making Leeroy jokes. In 2023, US House representative Jared Huffmannbelted his name with the same intonationafter three days of arduous voting. Sweep back through the past, and you'll be pelted with Leeroy Jenkins.How I Met Your Mothereven referenced it, doubtless leaving plenty of sitcom watchers confused. Turns out, we even wrote about it back then—and with a little bit of hunting in our archives by our own Dave Jones, we were able to dredge up some excerpts from \"The Ballad of Leeroy Jenkins\" by former PCG writer Craig Pearson. It gives a nice window into the 2005-era internet. An era I fear we've now well and truly lost. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"A legend has been born,\" Pearson wrote. \"Leeroy's guild forum is littered with fans clamouring to bask in the man's presence.\" He goes on to cite a post from the Pals for Life site, which stated: \"All day today my local radio station was pranking people with the Leeroy Jenkins yell, and my local tobacco and liquor shop was giving away free drinks and radio station T-shirts to people who came in and yelled 'Hell yea it's Friday, LEEROY JENKINS!!!!'. All damn day they were doing this.\" According to that article, Leeroy's player endured no small amount of internet stardom, for good or for ill, with routine messages and \"increased attention from enemy players, horde gangs queuing up to snuff him out the minute he shows up in enemy territory.\" Rewatching the video itself, I can't help but feel nostalgic. Even ifKotaku would later break my heart and reveal it was staged—although re-reading Pearson's article from 2005, it turns out most people knew all along: \"Of course, it's a setup. Made to parody nerdy guilds,\" he wrote, before also adding that Pals for Life themselves told PCG directly that: \"With MMOs, a lot of people treat the game as a job, and with our guild that is exactly what we're trying to avoid\". Pearson also elaborates that \"Stunts like naked raids on enemy settlements are an integral part of their manifesto\". Hardly the type to have a mathemagician spin percentiles out of thin air. It's a symbol of a simpler time, where videogame memes could crop up pure, unfiltered, and spread because they were gut-bustingly funny. It also reflects a goofier era in MMOs in general—perhaps I was simply too much of a greenhorn noob in my youth, but in the modern era of instantly-solved raid mechanics and mandatory UI mods, I'm not sure something like Leeroy Jenkins could exist. Honestly, looking at Pearson's conclusion to the phenomenon nowadays gives me a sense dramatic irony: \"For too long we've suffered under the folk who take games too seriously, who call us 'noobs' for dying, or killing them when they weren't expecting it, or not following their perfectly laid plans. \"Leeroy shows us the way. A simple act of (staged) idiocy has freed us all and reminded us what gaming's about: Fun.\" Anyone who's done Mythic+ dungeon runs in WoW can tell you this liberation did not last. I'm sorry, Leeroy. We've lost our way. We no longer know how to cry \"times up, let's do this!\". We may not even have chicken. Sweaty, high-DPS min-maxers are now the expected norm, rather than the butt of a joke. Leeroy's brand of hooliganry now has to manifest interms of service-violating nonsense—and while I'll still have a good-old chuckle, it's all far less wholesome. They just don't make memes like they used to, and none of us can just run in without fearing the wrath of strangers. The folks who take games too seriously won.

    "article_text": "It's just sweet and innocent cleaning. Nothing else. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After the popularity ofSchedule 1, it was only a matter of time before another questionable simulator came to occupy everyone's free time, and Cash Cleaner Simulator is here to do just that. Rather than crafting your own supply and handing it out around the town, as the name suggests you are responsible for checking, cleaning, and sorting out stacks of notes before shipping it back out. The only catch is you can't leave, and you probably shouldn't ask any questions. Not only are you responsible for cleaning the money, you'll also have to retrieve it from a variety of places. Unfortunately, you won't just be able to clean wads of cash shipped neatly in a box. No. Starting out you'll get everything from cash-filled bags to notes stuffed inside mattresses, but eventually (if you're a good little lawbreaker) you can expand your cleaning services to things like ancient statues and gold bars. Be warned though, not everything is legit and it's part of your service to identify anything counterfeit. If you ignore all the red flags and warnings that you are working as a criminal, you could probably just see it as a sort of shop simulator. I find that the soundtrack also helps to make the experience feel significantly less stressful than it seems, even with the looming pressure of doing a good job for your clients. But even the threat of the system and the customers isn't enough to keep players away. Cash Cleaner Simulator hit 10,029 concurrent players on Steam over the weekend. Which is a pretty incredible number of people keen to trial a new life as a low-level criminal. The game also earned a \"very positive\" label for reviews too. To celebrate, it was announced on Steam that a new patch is coming next week based entirely on the feedback from players. In addition, the soundtrack for the game has also been released on Steam so you can get your lo-fi fix when you're doing something slightly more legal. Hopefully.

    "article_text": "Throw it in the bin. Trash. Garbage. Whichever you prefer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Unless you're a networking engineer, it's unlikely you've thought about your router in some time. After all, working tech is working tech, and if it's still delivering the speeds your internet provider promised, why change it? Cyber criminals, that's why. Especially if yours happens to be a Cisco Linksys model. That's according to the FBI, which has released adocument[PDF warning] advising that not only are EOL (End of Life) routers particularly open to attack from nefarious internet forces in general, but specifically mentions multiple Cisco Linksys models as \"vulnerable to compromise\" (viaHot Hardware). The routers mentioned are as follows: \"Threat actors exploit known vulnerabilities to compromise EOL routers, install malware, and use the routers in a botnet they control to launch coordinated attacks or sell access to the devices as proxy services,\" the document warns. \"The FBI recommends users replace compromised devices with newer models or prevent infection by disabling remote administration and rebooting the router.\" Given just how many people cling on to ageing routers until the day their ISP finally replaces them, I'd say it's worth having a look at routers used by your nearest and dearest, too.

    "title": "Even in early access, Blacksmith Master is a well forged ingot of cozy management and metalwork",
    "article_text": "Who knew working hammer and tongs could feel so relaxing? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. \"Cozy\" isn't the word I'd usually reach for when discussing the hot and sweaty labour that comes with running a medieval forge. But even in its early access form, Blacksmith Master's unlikely combination of hard metalwork and decorative drapes brings a pleasantly relaxing vibe to all that smelting and hammering. My little workshop's comfortably nestled inside an established town, and bustles with activity from early dawn until the warm street lights come on at dusk. People stroll around the nearby streets, and hopefully walk into my finely-decorated shop for a moment to peruse my wares as they pass by. One blacksmith saws wood while another assembles a sickle at a workbench. An assistant might be hauling freshly-mined ore into my workshop while another lugs a sack of goods over to a merchant rocking on their heels as they wait by their cart, and a few workers might even be seen resting on benches in the rare moments when there's nothing for them to do. Being able to keep track of a dozen different moving parts just by looking over the workshop floor is more than helpful, it makes it easy to believe my business is one part of a wider community. I'm not clearing Task #4 with Worker #16 or making a bunch of gauges fill up for no other reason than because I'm supposed to, I'm trading with local merchants and supplying the townsfolk with well-crafted goods. Building my business upwards, outwards, and even downwards into the basement is a breeze. Clean snap-to-grid behaviour combined with a clear UI showing exactly which corner of a shelf or staircase accidentally overlaps something else makes placing everything from essential anvils to pretty pot plants simple, even when working across multiple floors in the middle of a busy day. And if (OK,when) I mess up, rearranging and rotating the existing furniture is as simple as dragging it about while the shop menu's open, allowing me to quickly correct my routinely appalling layout choices before they become a problem—or just dress up the shop I opened to sell my goods with another tasteful wall basket for fun. Before long I've got a functional, if not efficient, workshop filled with its own stories and amusing quirks. I made the effort to give my designers a quiet area in a corner of the upper floor, and paid for a torch just because I thought my lumberjack's camp looked a bit sparse and unfriendly without it. Watching another harried assistant rush about all over the place because of my frankly terrible item chest placement makes me smile. Until I choose to navigate my layouts myself. The game allows me to take over any of my small army's worth of highly customisable blacksmiths at any time and experience the entire crafting process first-hand; a chain of actions that might involve picking up a log and taking it to a table before sawing it into shape and finally dropping it off in the order cart. The minigames that pop up along the way—a small selection of extremely simple QTE-like things—aren't in any danger of challenging any PC gamer capable of the strenuous task of pushing a single button when they're told to, but the relaxed nature of it all only felt in keeping with the rest of the game's easygoing attitude. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Most of the time I'm assigning individual workers, each possessing their own combination of stats and unique traits, sensible tasks from an easily accessed short list of jobs and letting them get on with it. Maybe one of them's a talented carpenter, so I'll make sure they always prioritise wood-related jobs. I'll ask others to create the most expensive items first, craft exclusively for my own shop's shelves, or focus on fulfilling merchant orders. I have to make meaningful decisions and keep an eye on things, but I'm never drowned under a thousand different stats spread across a dozen windows, and my burgeoning blacksmith business won't fall apart if I'm not constantly breathing down my worker's necks. New skills, abilities, and even areas—that fresh wood and raw ore has to come from somewhere—are introduced at a gentle pace; an interesting new problem to work into my existing and ever-expanding routine, rather than another damned chore piled on top of an increasingly precarious house of cards. I never seem to be more than a quick click away from another friendly tooltip explaining whatever I'm currently looking at, and little eye-catching prompts ensure I can see when an order's ready to be turned in, a blacksmith can level up, or a new design's made itself available. It's practical help that makes it easier to quickly keep tabs on an ever-increasing number of moving parts, while still feeling warm and welcoming. The game wants to help. We're a team, and we're going to make this blacksmith's work—together. It doesn't feel like busywork, not even when dozens of workers are running all over the place, trying to fulfil triple-digit orders just to keep the place going. I can see clearly how all of these systems interconnect and rely on each other. I know there's a point to every last little thing that's going on. And because I can get in so close and watch these lovely lo-poly people dip hot iron into cold water to take a rest in the mines, it always feels like a very personal sort of success. My team is working hard, together, and coming out on top. There's still some work to be done here before it's all buffed to a bright finish—I'd like to see some need for specialism, such as a reason to organise my shop space so the pots and pans customers don't rub elbows with the bow and blade customers—but even in its early access release, this is pretty hot stuff.

    "title": "One day the silicon in this $7000 Asus RTX 5090 will be worthless, but you'll still have a whole 6 grams of solid gold to make up for it",
    "article_text": "It's real, it's bling, its price tag is stratospheric: The gold-plated RTX 5090 from Asus finally goes on sale. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Graphics cards are very expensive these days. Hardly news, of course, and the most powerful of these have been ludicrously pricey for quite a few years now. Nvidia'sGeForce RTX 5090 Founders Editionhas a painful MSRP of $1,999 and other models are considerably more expensive. Enter stage left, theAsus ROG Astral GeForce RTX 5090 Dhahab OC Edition, replete with a massive cooler, a hefty base overclock, over six grams of gold-plating… oh, and a $7,000 price tag. We first learned ofAsus' golden gooseearlier this year, but there was no word on what the price was going to be. While all of us in the PC Gamer hardware office expected it to be extremely steep, I don't think any of us were expecting it to be this high. Actually, it can bemoreexpensive than that, because it depends on what country you buy it in. Asus isn't selling its monstrous 5090 across the globe, just a select few locations in the Middle East, according toVideocardz, and the cheapest price seems to be around $6,500 or so. Up until now, the priciestRTX 5090offered by Asus was its overclocked ROG Astral edition, coming in at$3,360 at Newegg. The Dhahab model is basicallytwicethat figure, which is…. err… something, that's for sure. So, what exactly are you getting for all that additional money? Well, you're getting anRTX 5090with a hefty base overclock, for starters. Where Nvidia's FE version offers a boost clock of 2,407 MHz, this massive gold brick of a card defaults to 2,580 MHz and goes up to 2,680 MHz in OC mode. The latter is a clock speed increase of 11% so that's clearly worth at least $1,000 (I'm not being serious). Then there's the four-fan cooler, with its huge heatsink and phase-change thermal pad for the GPU die. I don't know about you, but to me, that's got to be another $1,000 there easily (I'm still not being serious). Finally, there's the pièce de résistance: the cooler's shroud and backplate are gold-plated. Not gold paint but actual, real, solid gold. A whole 6.5 grams of it. Now that'snotworth $1,000, as the current spot price for the malleable metal puts it around $670. But doesyourGPU have solid gold on it? Yeah, I thought not, so that easily makes it worth every cent of a thousand dollars. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. So, there you have it—it's obvious why the ROG Astral Dhahab is over $3,000 more expensive than the common-or-garden ROG Astral. Okay, let me actually be serious for a moment. Asus could have charged five times what it's asking for and it would still have no problems selling the Dhahab edition in its intended markets. The fact that it's 'just' an overclocked RTX 5090 doesn't matter, it's the fact that it's highly exclusive and ridiculously bling. Many buyers probably won't evenuseit—just the status of having one will be all that matters.If you just so happen to have $7,000 and you do want to splash out on some PC gaming goodies, can I humbly suggest that you give Asus' Dhahab card a miss and instead get yourself anentire RTX 5090 gaming PCand amassive OLED gaming monitorfor the same amount of money? You'll have change spare to buy a can of gold spray paint, too, if you feel the urge to make your own Dhahab Lite edition.

    "article_text": "Several ups to be un-mucked, is the short and tall of it. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun: a second texture error has been located in Oblivion Remastered's whizzbang skins, rendering the game unplayable and life unlivable. Right after players noticed that the new texture on the door to Cheydinhal's Dark Brotherhood sanctuary recklessly bungles a bit ofthe sect's background lore, someone else has noticed a gag on one of the game's shop signs hasn't survived the transition to 4K. Spotted by detail-oriented Redditors (viaTheGamer), the sign for Lelles' Quality Merchandise—a general store on the Anvil Waterfront—wasn't quite uprezzed properly when Virtuos brought it over to Oblivion Remastered. In the original, 2006 game, the sign reads 'Lelles' Quality Mercandise' with a letter H clumsily interposed between the C and the A. It was a charming, funny nod to the owner's general haplessness (which becomes even more apparent when you help him fend off a gang of thieves during the Fighers' Guild questline). In the remaster, the sign maintains the spelling error but not the clumsy fix. It now reads 'Lelles' Quality Mercandise' with nary an H to be seen. Instead of a deliberate joke, it just looks like someone at Bethesda couldn't spell merchandise—though NPCs will still note the error in dialogue. It is, let's be honest, an incredibly minor thing, but it does highlight one of the dangers of contracting work like this out. Just like the Dark Brotherhood's front door, it's likely some poor, beleaguered texture artist at Virtuos just didn't quite get the significance of the thing they were working on. Then again, I guess there's no guarantee Bethesda's own people wouldn't have overlooked something like this if the studio had done the remaster in-house. With any luck, it's one of more than a few issues that will be ironed out whenever Oblivion Remastered gets a patch. Which I'm hoping is any day now. Someone needs to teach useless old Savlian Matius that he can enter Castle Kvatch, after all, as well fix my Arch-Mage Robes so that my character's derriere isn't constantly clipping through the back.

The Trump administration has fired Shira Perlmutter, the prior register of copyrights and director of the US Copyright Office, by email—according to reports fromThe Washington PostandTech Crunch. A statement from US democrat representative Joe Morelle alleges that the termination is a\"brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis\"and, in the representative's view, \"It is surely no coincidence he acted less than a day after she refused to rubber-stamp Elon Musk’s efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.\" \"Register Perlmutter is a patriot, and her tenure has propelled the Copyright Office into the 21st century by comprehensively modernizing its operations and setting global standards on the intersection of AI and intellectual property\" says Morelle. Morelle linked a pre-publication version of aUS Copyright Office report[PDF warning] on copyright and artificial intelligence in his statement, in which the office states that there are limitations on how much AI companies can count on fair use as a defence when training models on copyrighted content. OpenAI, co-founded by Musk, and Meta are currently facing a number of lawsuits accusing them of copyright infringement, including one involvingcomedian Sarah Silverman and two other authorsalleging that pirated versions of their works were used to train AI language models without their permission.

After a lot of speculation, Bam Margera's appearance as a Secret Skater in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 has been officially confirmed by avideo posted to the game's social media. In March, the skater list was published and players were quick to notice that Bam Margera was missing from the lineup. But, not long after the lineup was announced, it was shared on skating podcastThe Nine ClubthatTony Hawk was essentially demanding Margera's appearancein the game, even after development had finished. According to the podcast, Hawk put his foot down and madeActivisionfly Margera out to get his body scanned to put him back into the remaster. Until now, it's been unclear whether or not he would make an appearance in 3 + 4 despite being the only original skater missing from the list. Thanks to a video stating \"BAM. IS.

Pre-order today, available July 11: https://t.co/jEDJYfxtSR pic.twitter.com/DrVHkvqJMaMay 9, 2025 The video shows Margera's body being scanned, alongside a brief interview with Margera where he states \"the second Tony Hawk game, I was so obsessed with playing [the game] that I was missing flights over it.\" He went on to explain how he eventually missed six flights and had to put the game to one side, before continuing \"I'm going to have to let myself play video games again, because this one will be well worth it.\" Margera made his debut as a playable character in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, and featured in every game following with the final being Tony Hawk's Proving Ground. This led to a lot of people noticing his disappearance from the skater list for the remakes. Fortunately, the announcement of his inclusion as a secret skater has been met with a lot of excitement. How you'll unlock Bam Margera in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is something we'll have to discover when the game launches on July 11.

    "title": "US and China talk it out at Geneva, agreeing to suspend ultra-high tariffs for 90 days, but PC parts don't seem to be part of the deal",
    "article_text": "Sector-specific tariffs aren't part of the deal. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After weeks of reciprocal tariffs by the US and China on each other's exports, ahigh-level meeting held in Genevaappears to have resulted in the reset button being firmly pressed. For an initial period of 90 days, Chinese imports to the US will incur a 30% tariff, down from 145%, whereas goods going the other direction will receive a 10% tariff (previously 125%). However, these broad reductions aren't being applied to every item being imported. Along with ajoint statement from the US and China, news of the deal was reported byReuters, which includes further comments on the meeting by Scott Bessent, the US Treasury Secretary. \"The consensus from both delegations this weekend is neither side wants a decoupling,\" Bessent said. \"And what had occurred with these very high tariffs...was the equivalent of an embargo, and neither side wants that. We do want trade.\" It's worth noting, though, that while these big reductions in tariffs will help settle the global market's nerves, not every import will benefit. Apparently, the deal doesn't include 'sector-specific tariffs' and items such as semiconductors, steel, and medicines will still be treated separately to \"continue strategic rebalancing in areas…where [the US] had identified supply chain vulnerabilities,\" to quote Reuters. BBC News reports that thetariff reduction will commence this Wednesday, 14 May, and various stock markets have responded positively to the news. One might think that 90 days isn't very long, but it's the same period as the three-month blitz of tariffs and reciprocal tariffs churned out by the US and China, so it's a remarkably long period of grace. Of course, there is the question of what happens if either country suddenly changes its mind or whether (ab)normal service will resume once the 90 days are over. It's also not clear whether CPU, GPUs, and everything else related to computing will enjoy tariff relief. Bessent's comments about the semiconductor industry suggest that thecurrent levy of 20%will still apply, as such goods were handled separately to the massive 145% fees, but perhaps that will become clearer over the next few days. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There's no denying that the Geneva meeting was much-needed, and its outcome is good news for the general consumer. However, vendors and retailers are unlikely to suddenly lower prices or improve stocks, as there's still too much uncertainty—nervous markets tend not to go down the cheap route to entice buyers. If you were hoping to see graphics cards, for example, arrive in droves and with sensible price tags, you'll need to wait a fair while longer for things to settle down.

    "title": "Ouch—Warner Bros throws Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League under the bus in the most corporate way possible, side-eyes it for closed studios and cancelled games",
    "article_text": "\"Prior year quarter impairment\" is some potent corpo-speak. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. WB Games has had a bit of a rough time recently. That's as per afinance reportthat unveiled a cliff-sharp drop in gaming revenue in the first quarter of 2025. While the report doesn't have its own segment purely for gaming, it does go into the numbers pulled in by videogames in its highlights summary. The report states that \"Games revenue decreased 48% [excluding foreign currencies] due to the prior year release of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League compared to no releases in the current year quarter, as well as higher carryover from Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 in the prior year.\" Which all checks out. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice Leagueactually lost Warner Bros $200 million, and that was back in June 2024. It's hard to get an exact timeline, but given the gamewrapped up its final proper update in January of this year, it's safe to assume it's lost a touch more cash. Now, in fairness to Rocksteady—and the report itself—any successful game will see a drop in revenue the quarter after, for the simple fact that games take a long time to make and hits are rare. Hogwarts Legacy sold gangbusters, withover 22 million copies flooding cash directly into Warner Bros' pocket. You could make some very decent games after that and still see a drop in revenue. The real corporate mic-drop happens as WB explains its lower expenses—what it's spending—on gaming content, which dropped 66% \"primarily driven by the prior year quarter impairment related to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and lower games revenue in the current quarter\". Oof. Having your game name directly called out as being related to a quarter-yearimpairmentfeels like the most savage takedown you'd get in a business earnings report. Especially since that drop in expenses islikely related to a sweep of closuresthat saw Monolith, Player First Games, and WB San Diego shuttered—alongside a Wonder Woman game. This is all conjecture, sure—but when you say you're spending 66% less money on games after you closed a bunch of studios, then say that's because of an impairment \"related\" to a poorly-performing game? It's conjecture with meat on the bone, at least. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's completely scrubbed-clean, anesthetised, unoffensive language that nonetheless suggests a miserable attitude towards Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's market flop. I feel like I'm a noble in a highly political fantasy drama dropping my glass of wine in shock, because some lord suggested the fair lady's etiquette was passing strange. The scandal! It's been asimilarly miserable time to work in the games industry, and I personally pin this failure on the leadership who decided to make this game rather than the developers forced to make it, but it's no wonder itsfinale resulted in layoffsand thehead of WB games stepping down. 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Harvey's history with games started when he first begged his parents for a World of Warcraft subscription aged 12, though he's since been cursed with Final Fantasy 14-brain and a huge crush on G'raha Tia.

    "title": "Doom: The Dark Ages is unplayable on handheld gaming PCs at the moment but it's not because the hardware isn't good enough",
    "article_text": "The frequency of GPU driver updates for portable PCs really needs improving. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're only a few days away from the public launch ofDoom: The Dark Ages, id Software's newest entry in the 32-year-old franchise. Take a leaf from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which used the id Tech 7 engine, the new Doom uses ray tracing all the time for global lighting, reflections, and shadows. As I discovered inmy performance analysis, it's not quite as demanding on your rig as you might expect, and even a handheld gaming PC can run the id Tech 8-powered shooter. Well, for a few seconds.The above video has been captured on anAsusROG Ally, set to its 30 W performance mode, with Doom: The Dark Ages configured to use the Low graphics preset, along with FSR Performance upscaling. As you can see, it manages to pull a consistent 30 fps...for nearly 40 seconds, before the drivers bailed out.Admittedly, the game launched with a big warning about how the ROG Ally's GPU drivers were old and not recommended for use with Doom: The Dark Ages, so it's not like the above crash is unexpected.However, the frustrating part of all of this isn't the crash or the blurry, heavily upscaled graphics. It's the fact that updating the GPU drivers for the ROG Ally is far harder than it needs to be. Unlike with AMD's desktop and laptop graphics processors, where I can download the latest Adrenalin software, I'm stuck waiting for Asus to release better drivers for the ROG Ally. This seems to be a perennial problem with any handheld gaming PC that uses anAMD RyzenZ1 processor for CPU and GPU duties. Any other APU from AMD's lineup can be updated via Adrenalin, but not the Z1s—they have to be done by the handheld PC's vendor. Sure, the likes of the Ally, Steam Deck, and other portable PCs are really up for handling a fully ray-traced game, and I could only get 30 fps by use of FSR Performance, which makes everything so blurry that all the ray-traced goodies are somewhat lost. That said, on a little 7-inch screen, it doesn't look too bad, and I'd be happy to stomp around with my shield and shotgun for a quick blast. But until Asus decides to update the GPU drivers for the Ally, there's no chance of that happening, and as more games become RT-only over the years, handheld vendors will need to do a better job at staying up-to-date with drivers.

    "article_text": "\"More than 15,000 players\" provided feedback on the original Gothic 1 Remake demo, informing a new version. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The gamers yearn for the mines. Specifically, the gamers yearn for the sandbox mining colony of Gothic, the janky and completely beloved 2001 RPG that's getting remade as I write this. They yearn for it so much that its demo version has gotten a full-on update you can play right now. \"There's a new demo in town! Developer Alkimia Interactive has been closely monitoring and analyzing player feedback since the release of the Gothic 1 Remake demo—the so-called Nyras Prologue—in February. More than 15,000 players completed the survey, with even more feedback coming in via social media, Steam forums, and the official Discord server,\"saidAlkimia in an update posted alongside a mini making-of documentary about its work on the demo. Gothic was a seminal, vital first RPG for many players—especially in Europe and the UK—because of its ambitious sandbox world environment and different ways that characters could make their way through the story. This demo, released to a lot of attention during this year's Steam Next Fest, is a prologue about secondary character from the original game. The precise changelog for the demo was detailedon THQ Nordic's website, with the most salient change from player feedback being faster movement, pick up, and loot animations that overall make the character feel more agile. In the video about the update, Alkimia developers also acknowledge a pervasive bug where hits won't register even though your sword goes right through some goblin's face. (This is my least favorite bug.) When we learned more about it last year, PC Gamer's Robin Valentinenoted that the Gothic 1 Remake looks\"even more wonderfully over-ambitious and janky than the original game.\" You can findGothic 1 Remake Demo: Nyras Prologue on Steam, where it's free.

    "article_text": "It's out now on Steam. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. You, a bumbling cloaked wizardy figure, tumble out of a wormhole into a new world. You jog a short distance to the spot you can install your extractor—which is a tower that sucks juice out of the land. Your initial juice budget lets you buy a few defensive towers well, which you place along the path you just followed, which also happens to be the path shadowy blob monsters will follow when they pour out of space to come for your extractor. This is Rift Riff, a tower defense game that joins Thronefall, Cataclismo, Emberward, Defender's Quest 2, and most recentlyNordholdandGnomesin the resurgent hold-the-line genre.Turtling is back, and I'm so happy I would come out from behind my maze of walls, only I will never come out from behind my maze of walls, that is how they get you. One of the things that makes Rift Riff special is that, as the Steam page puts it, this is a \"remarkably forgiving\" game. You can refund a tower for its full value, at the start of each wave you get back any towers that fell, and if you die then you respawn at the start of that wave rather than having to redo the whole level, and you respawn with all the towers you'd built in place so you can refund and edit your layout rather than having to reconstruct it from scratch. Also you can collect flowers for bonus juice. It's just real pleasant to experience. The music's delightful, and so is the way your stumblebum hero goofs into and out of portals. Rift Riff's co-creator was Adriaan de Jongh, who previously worked on the equally delightful Hidden Folks—a hidden object game that couldn't be more different genre-wise, yet when the protagonist of Rift Riff bumbles around making mouth sounds I do get a little of that Hidden Folks vibe. Rift Riff's closest cousin in the tower defense genre is probably Thronefall, and conveniently you can get the two games in aSteam bundleto satisfy your desire for lo-fi tower defense. Or you can just find Rift Riff on its ownSteam pagewhere it's on sale for like $US6.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We've got a fresh clue for today'sWordleall written up and ready to use. Take a look at it before you begin to supercharge your first line. Save it for later, a little something extra in case you need help turning yellow letters green. It's entirely up to you. And don't forget: the May 12 (1423) answer is here too, ready to save any game in an instant. Today's answer never felt far away thanks to the rich seam of green letters that popped up in my opening row, and I managed to solve Monday's Wordle pretty quickly. I could have done without having a slightly careless stumble on the row after, but as I still ended up with a comfortable win in three I can't really complain. Flex your arm a little—what muscle did you just show off? No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Let's get going. The answer to the May 12 (1423) Wordle isBICEP. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

    "title": "Five new Steam games you probably missed (May 12, 2025)",
    "article_text": "Sorting through every new game on Steam so you don't have to. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest MMOs: Massive worldsBest RPGs: Grand adventures On an average day about a dozen new games are released on Steam. And while we think that's a good thing, it can be understandably hard to keep up with. Potentially exciting gems are sure to be lost in the deluge of new things to play unless you sort through every single game that is released on Steam. So that’s exactly what we’ve done. If nothing catches your fancy this week, we've gathered thebest PC gamesyou can play right now and a running list of the2025 gamesthat are launching this year. Steam ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 9Developer:‌ Scared Stupid Inc Midnight Special is an '80s-themed horror point-and-clicker about exploring a sinister old manor. Unlike protagonists in most horror games, babysitter Sarah doesn't deliberately and rather stupidly volunteer to visit the scary old mansion: she mysteriously wakes up in it. What follows is the usual mix of puzzling and exploration, rendered in lavish 16-bit pixel art and coated in dreamy scanlines. This is an early access affair: the first of four planned seasons is included in the current build, with the full game scheduled to release within 18 months. Steam‌ ‌page‌Release:‌ May 9Developer:‌ Mind Control Games No, it's not a money laundering simulator: it's a game about literally cleaning money. Granted, you're cleaning the money for criminals, but you're doing so with washing machines and driers, all the better to send back dirty or blood-soaked money—or counterfeit money—in a usable state. Once you've made a lot of money, you can shoot money around your lair with your money gun, or maybe you'd prefer to burn it to keep warm. Cash Cleaner Simulator is doing pretty well considering it looks like a joke game: it has accrued over 700 reviews and a \"very positive\" rating since releasing last week. Wonders never cease. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 8Developers:‌ Soft SourceSteeped in Arabian mythology, Bahamut and the Waqwaq Tree is a 2D underwater exploration game with a lil' whiff of Ecco the Dolphin about it. The underwater realm of Ma'een is harried by destructive \"dark entities\", and naturally it's your job to bring that to an end via the spreading of light. Expect a mysterious subaquatic vibe, some light puzzling, and lots of panicked fleeing from inscrutable marine life. Underwater games tend to become monotonous, but the art style of Bahamut looks gorgeous and varied. Steam pageRelease:‌ May 9Developer:‌ Yakov Butuzoff Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Anoxia Station is a miserable turn-based strategy and management sim set in an alternative '80s where the earth has been destroyed and abandoned, but continues to be plundered for oil. A giant deposit of crude oil has been discovered, and it's up to you to keep a mining expedition alive in the most trying of circumstances. That means keeping people alive in a world where \"extreme pressure, heat, radiation and other incomprehensible dangers\" can spell the end of everyone involved. Not chill at all then! This one looks good for people who found Frostpunk too optimistic. Steam‌ ‌page‌‌Release:‌ May 8Developer:‌ RedSaw Games Studio Here's another post-apocalyptic outing, except it's a cheerful 'n' cosy farming sim with survival elements. Unlike most of these pixel art life games, Doloc Town is a sidescroller, which means exploration involves some light platforming through cutesy ruins. Apart from that and its dour setting, Doloc Town is exactly what you'd expect from a mashing together of Terraria and Stardew Valley. It's an early access game: a full release is expected within a year, during which time the main storyline will be finished, as well as automated farming and some other systems.

    "title": "Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge launch live: all the Unpacked news as it breaks",
    "article_text": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. After several months of waiting,Samsungfinally announced theGalaxy S25 Edgeand confirmed several specs for the flagship device, including a 200MP camera. The tech giant first teased the device at the January Unpacked, and showed it all off at a virtual Galaxy Unpacked that kicked off at 8pm ET / 5pm PT today / 1am BST (Tuesday). Ahead, you can rewatch the live stream of what might be the shortest Galaxy Unpacked ever and read TechRadar's live reporting about Samsung's thinnest smartphone ever. The Galaxy S25 Edge is just 5.8 millimeters thick, with a zippy Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor inside and a 6.7-inch LTPO AMOLED display with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 for extra durability. Samsung really focused on the design, and the S25 Edge represents a new chapter in the story of Galaxy smartphone design. It's up for preorder now at $1,099.99 / £1,099 / AU$1,849 (starting) and will officially launch on May 30. You can see our fullhands-on with the Galaxy S25 Edge here, acloser look at the cameras here, and lastly, thefive things you need to know about the ultra-thin smartphone. You can watch the virtual Galaxy Unpacked event using the video below. As the Managing Editor of Mobile Computing, Roland has covered a lot of phone launches in recent years, and a whole lot of other stuff as well. So he's well trained to be your guide as we build up to today's Samsung Galaxy Unpacked. If video is more your speed, TechRadar's Axel Metz explains everything you need to know about the Galaxy S25 Edge here. Again, it'll be up for preorder on May 13, 2025 – so right now in the UK and Australia and just a few hours away in the US at $1,099.99 / £1,099 / AU$1,849. And just like – in a tight 15 minutes – Samsung's virtual Galaxy Unpacked, all about the Galaxy S25 Edge, is done. You can of course play it back, but here's something better – TechRadar's already gone hands-on with Samsung's ultra-thin phone andyou can read it here. Our own Philip Berne has written his early impressions on the phone, summing it up as a goldlock's device – \"The Galaxy S25 Edge is the phone forSamsungfans who like to complain. Does yourGalaxy S25 Plusfeel too thick for your tight jeans and small hands? Is theGalaxy S25 Ultratoo heavy for your bag? The Galaxy S25 Edge is precisely the phone you want, nothing more and nothing less.\" Considering we've been waiting for more info since January, it makes sense that Samsung is now wasting no time shipping the Galaxy S25 Edge. It's launching on May 23, 2025, with a starting price of $1,099.99 / £1,099 / AU$1,849, with preorders starting tomorrow, May 13. It also comes in three nice shades: Titanium Jetblack, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Icy Blue. Unfortunately, there are no ultra-fun, vibrant shades here. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge:up to $620 off with a trade, free storage upgrade, and $50 credit at SamsungTechRadar readers can get $50 in added store credit at the official Samsung Store this week thanks to anexclusivepromotion. This handy bonus stacks on top of the excellent trade-in rebate of up to $620 off and a free storage upgrade for a massive total savings of $800. Note that if you've already reserved a device, you may not be able to claim our exclusive bonus in addition to that $50 credit. The Galaxy AI features ultimately really impressed us on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and the S25 Edge will be no different. Google's ecosystem is deeply integrated, including Gemini and Gemini Live. This means that you'll be able to use the latter to let Google Gemini see through your cameras and help you make outfit decisions, translate in real time, and so much more. The Galaxy S25 Edge's camera features a 200-megapixel main camera – just like the Galaxy S25 Ultra – and a 12-megapixel ultra-wide lens. You'll also get all the Galaxy AI features we've been using on the S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra, including the ability to remove items from the background of photos, and for videos, you can clean up audio to let you hear what you meant to capture. It really is super thin. Here's a shot of just how thin it is. Under the good, Samsung is sticking with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 for the Galaxy for excellent performance. It's the same chip as the S25, S25+, and S25 Ultra. We're now getting a pre-recorded video that breaks down how the Galaxy S25 Edge came to be – from a thinner, more compact camera module to a new method for handling heat under the rear. On the front, it's the first phone to have Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 with a titanium frame so as not to compromise on durability for the ultra-thin design. Samsung says it's balancing form and function. Now, Hubert Lee, Samsung's VP of Design for Galaxy, is kicking things off and speaking to design. Right before this, we saw the inside of the Galaxy S25 Edge being assembled with some jolly music backing it. It's being billed as the slimmest smartphone ever from Samsung, and the team had to rethink every aspect of the phone. It still looks like an S25 with a mostly titanium frame, albeit much thinner, a Samsung logo on the back, and two main cameras. And away we go! Samsung's kicking off it's virtual Galaxy Unpacked now with a bit of a disclaimer, and the title gives it away. \"Galaxy S25 Edge: Beyond slim\". We're two minutes out now. Samsung's still keeping the mood lively with some jazz, and no countdown has appeared yet. YouTube does show over 4,000 people watching, all potentially eagerly awaiting the formal unveiling of the S25 Edge. We're just under 30 minutes out from Samsung's virtual Unpacked, which kicks off at 8pm ET / 5pm PT today / 1am BST (Tuesday, May 13, 2025). The stream is already live with some jazzy tunes playing. It's still showing the invite, which teases the forthcoming S25 Edge pushing through the background and the tagline 'Beyond Slim.' As my colleagues have taken us through today, the focus here will be on the Galaxy S25 Edge, which Samsung first teased back in January at Unpacked after unveiling the rest of the S25 family. This device should complete that lineup for now, offering a premium, ultra-thin smartphone. You can watch the livestream right above this post. Hello there, Jacob Krol, Managing Editor for News, stepping in from lovely California, US. We're less than an hour away from Samsung's virtual Galaxy Unpacked, which is expected to finally shed all the information we could possibly want about a pretty thin phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge. Right, as I'm based in the UK and the hour is late, I'll be handing over this live blog to fellow managing editor Jacob Krol. He'll take you through the rest of the run up to this Galaxy Unpacked event and will report live on the showcase. Any questions about the launch, feel free to contact me and the TechRadar phones team. Otherwise, goodbye and enjoy today's Unpacked. With Samsung seemingly leading the charge on the slim flagship phone, the question of how Apple could and would respond is on my lips. We've already heard plenty of murmurings about a so-callediPhone 17 Air, which looks set to be a slimmed-down version of the next iPhone. Equally, Apple tends to tread its own path, which is probably why we've not seen a foldable iPhone yet. So maybe the crew at Cupertino won't be influenced by what Samsung does this year. Something that's left me a tad cold isa claimed leak of the Galaxy S25 Edge's colors. There appear to be three of them: a light blue/silver, white/silver, and black/grey. Those shades don't exactly set my pulse racing. But I guess they are in keeping with the sleek aesthetic the Galaxy S25 Edge is going for. Maybe there'll be more colors after the phone launches via Samsung's online store. A little question that popped into my head is how well will the Galaxy S25 Edge handle gaming? The Galaxy S25 Ultra and its stablemates are fine gaming phones thanks to their powerful chips and cooling systems. The S25 Edge is tipped to have the same chipsets but being slimmer might have a bigger challenge of handling heat dissipation; my guess is Samsung might have applied some smart approaches to cooling. Time for a different perspective than mine: freelancer Max Slater-Robins isexcited for the Galaxy S25 Edge but does have concerns over the trade-offs needed to make phones slim. \"The potential reinvigoration of overly thin smartphones is interesting because, if we’ve learned anything from past design trends, it’s that thinner doesn’t always mean better – and it rarely comes without trade-offs,\" he wrote. \"There’s only so much internal space you can sacrifice before doing so starts to impact the experience in meaningful, everyday ways.\" When it comes to Galaxy AI, I recently wrote that I thinkmore AI could transform the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 from what could be a ‘meh’ into a ‘hell yeah’of a folding phone. My logic here is that AI baked into a phone's operating system could see it do a lot more in a slicker and more intuitive fashion. It would be a bit too much to hope that for the Galaxy S25 Edge, which is very likely to have all the AI features of the main Galaxy S25 family, only with whatever updated those smart tools have had since launch. I wonder if Samsung will use the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge as a way to showcase some more Galaxy AI features. I suspect not, as the company will likely do that when the rumoredSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 7andGalaxy Z Flip 7get launches, likely in July. Another tip points towardsthe Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge making use of a titanium frame. NowI'm a big advocate of titanium on phones, especially as it really does make them tough. So using the metal on a slim phone makes a lot of sense. It could also go some way to explaining the rumored price tag of the Galaxy S25 Edge, as titanium is more costly than stainless steel. On the topic of the battery, I'd be curious if the Galaxy S25 Edge has any changes to its charging; maybe to save space it ditches the coils needed for wireless charging, Or perhaps a new way of approaching battery packaging means faster charging for the S25 Edge. Quandt has also claimed the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge has a 3,900mAh battery, wireless charging, and an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. Neither are bad specs, but that battery size could be a tad small given the chip the Edge is likely to have. Of course, Samsung could have worked hard at battery efficiency to ensure the phone can get through a day of use. Reputable leaker, and likely thorn in the side of big tech firms, Roland Quandt, has theGalaxy S25 Edge tipped to come with a 200MP f/1.7 main camerawith optical image stabilization (OIS) and a 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide with a 120-degree field of view and no OIS. It also reportedly has a 12MP f/2.2 front-facing camera. Not a bad combo of cameras, though I prefer a telephoto camera over an ultra-wide one but I'm likely in the minority there. Right let's move on from the design and discuss some other rumors. Going back to my ponderings over the Galaxy S25 Edge potentially being a bit of a fashion-forward phone, I wonder if Samsung will use actor Sydney Sweeney in this Unpacked. I could see a super-slim phone going quite well with a small purse to accompany a Met Gala dress. A quick look at Sweeney's Instagram show no hint of her traveling to a Samsung event; she's previously posted images of her Unpacked journeys.... maybe she's not euphoric about launch. A previously claimed price leakhas the 256GB Galaxy S25 Edge set to cost $1,678.99 Canadian dollars, while a 512GB model will set you back $1,858.99. So that also tracks with other nuggets of pricing information, which isn't the best news for prospective owners of the Galaxy S25 Edge. While I'm on the topic of the Galaxy S25 Edge's design, I'd be curious to see how tough the phone will be. I have vivid memories of people bending and breaking iPhones back when the (kinda) current design language was established and some folks felt the phones weren't tough enough. Looking at some of the leaked images of the Galaxy S25 Edge and how it's tipped to have new cases, the phone could be designed more for people who care about the aesthetics of a mobile device over its capabilities. Could this see a return of the 'fashion phone'? Maybe... Then again, the Galaxy S25 Edge could have a lot of cutting-edge (pun intended) tech inside it to make a slim flagship phone. So perhaps there'll be people who'll pay for the privilege of using sophisticated tech... I may be one such person! Over a grand for a phone that perhaps takes away more than it gives might be a hard pill for consumers to swallow. Smartphone prices have creeped up as they've got more sophisticated, but one you go past the $1,000 / £1,000 your device better offer some strong value. Right let's dig into some rumors and tips. First off. yesterday we saw aSamsung Galaxy S25 Edge leak showed off the phone's design and a potential price. From a screen grab of a retailer who seemingly put its listing of the Galaxy S25 Edge online prematurely, we got a look at the phone, which looks largely unchanged from its debut earlier in the year, and spied a price tag of £1,099 (about $1,465 / AU$2,275). S25 Edge pic.twitter.com/pbMCL68dNsMay 10, 2025 Now that's a punchy price tag for phone that doesn't sport as many cameras as its standard stablemate. I'd suggest taking this 'leak' with a dose of skepticism. You might be asking why we need a slim take on the Galaxy S25? Well I’m partially with you, as it’s not like the current phones are bulky; even theGalaxy S25 Ultrafeels like it has modest girth for a phone of its size. But as someone who’s heading to a wedding in the next couple of days, I do like the idea of a very slim, and hopefully light, phone that can slip into a suit jacket pocket and not bulk it out. So while I’m talking performance, I guess that includes battery life. I’ll be intrigued to see if Samsung has made a slim phone that doesn’t compromise on battery capacity. Perhaps the South Korean tech giant may have used some form of split-cell design to keep the phone’s overall body slim but still ensure there’s plenty of electrical juice for it to sip for at least a day’s worth of use. Powerwise, the Galaxy S25 Edge is tipped to use the sameQualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elitechipset as its stablemates. What’ll be interesting here is if the slim chassis affects performance, as less thickness means less space for heat to dissipate when a chip is being pushed. But I suspect Samsung may have done some clever stuff with cooling and vapour chambers to ensure the Snapdragon chip doesn’t melt in a silicon sweat. So what’s the lowdown with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge then? Well in simple terms the phone will be a slimmed down version of theGalaxy S25. Its size looks set to sit between the base Galaxy S25 and the Plus model. While its main concession to slimness appears to be the removal of a rear camera, meaning the Edge will have two rear snappers. The good news here is that the main camera is tipped to sport a 200-megapixel sensor. Unusual for Samsung, this Unpacked is taking place a lot later in the day than usual. Perhaps this is down to the showcase expected to be small and short. Ultimately, we’re only expecting to see theGalaxy S25 Edgeat this Unpacked and nothing more. So that might explain why Samsung isn’t making this event one that’s at a reasonable time for most of its key markets. Hello!

    "title": "Exclusive: Sonos launches its first AI-powered sound mode to enhance speech, developed with a major hearing-loss charity – and it sounds great",
    "article_text": "A free upgrade for the Sonos Arc Ultra, available today When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sonoshas launched a new version of its Speech Enhancement tools for theSonos Arc Ultra, which we rate as one of thebest soundbarsavailable. You'll still find these tools on the Now Playing screen in the Sonos app, but instead of having just a couple of options, you'll now have four new modes (Low, Medium, High and Max), all powered by the company's first use of an AI sound-processing tool. They should be available today (May 12th) to all users. These modes were developed in a year-long partnership with the Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID), the UK's leading charity for people with hearing loss.I spoke to Sonos and the RNID to get the inside story on its development here– but you can read on here for more of the details. The update launches today on Sonos Arc Ultra soundbars, but won't be available on any other Sonos soundbars because it requires a higher level of processing power, which the chip inside the Arc Ultra can provide, but the older soundbars can't. The AI element is used to analyze the sound passing through the soundbar in real time, and separate out the 'speech' elements from the sound so they can be made more prominent in the mix without affecting the rest of the sound too much. I've heard it in action during a demo at Sonos' UK product development facility, and it's very impressive. If you've used speech enhancement tools before, you're probably familiar with hearing the dynamic range of the sound, and especially the bass, suddenly get massively reduced in exchange for the speech elements getting pushed more forward. That's not the case with Sonos' new mode – powerful bass, the overall soundscape, and the more immersive Dolby Atmos elements are all maintained far better. That's for two reasons: one is that the speech is being enhanced separately to other parts, and the other is that it's a dynamic system that only activates when it detects that speech is likely to be drowned out by background noise. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It won't activate if dialogue is happening against a quiet background, or if there's no dialogue in the scene. And it's a system that works by degrees – it applies more processing in the busiest scenes, and less when the audio is not as chaotic. On the two lowest modes, dialogue is picked out more clearly with no major harm to the rest of the soundtrack, based on my demo. On the High mode, the background was still maintained really well, but the speech started to sound a little more processed, and on Max I could hear the background getting its wings clipped a little, and some more artificiality to the speech – but the speech was extremely well picked out, and this mode is only really designed for the hard of hearing. I mentioned that the mode was developed with the RNID, which involved Sonos consulting with sound research experts at the RNID, but also getting people with different types and levels of hearing loss to test the modes at different stages of development and provide feedback. I spoke at length to the Sonos audio and AI architects who developed the new modes, as well as the RNID, but the key takeaway is that the collaboration led to Sonos putting more emphasis on retaining the immersive sound effects, and adding four levels of enhancement instead of the originally planned three. Despite the RNID's involvement, the new mode isn't designed to be solely for the hard of hearing. It's still just called Speech Enhancement, as it is now, and it's not hidden away like an accessibility tool – sound is improved for everyone, and 'everyone' now better includes people with mild to moderate hearing loss. The Low and Medium modes can also just function for those of us who need a bit of extra clarity in busy scenes. This isn't the first use of AI-powered speech separation I've seen – I've experienced it onSamsungTVs, and in a fun showcase from Philips TVs, where it was used to disable the commentary during sports but preserve the crowd sounds. But it's interesting that this is the first use of AI sound processing from Sonos, and the four-year development process, including a year of refinement with the RNID, shows that Sonos has taken a thoughtful approach to how it's best used that isn't always apparent in other AI sound processing applications.Here's my piece interviewing Sonos' AI and audio developers with researchers from the RNID. It's just a shame that it's exclusive to the Sonos Arc Ultra for now – though I'm sure that new versions of theSonos RayandSonos Beam Gen 2will be along before too long with the same upgraded chip to support the feature.

    "title": "Google's new AI video feature is rolling out on another company's smartphones",
    "article_text": "Honor smartphones are first in line for the new image-to-video feature When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google is showing off a new AI image-to-video feature using its Veo 2 model, but Google Pixel owners won't be able to use it just yet. Instead, Chinese phone company Honor, spun out of Huawei, is beating Pixel to the punch by incorporating the feature into its upcoming Honor 400 series of smartphones. The feature processes still images straight from your photo gallery into five-second animated clips. You don't need a Gemini subscription or even a cloud connection to make the videos. Honor 400 owners will be able to feed the tool any image, whether a new photo, an AI-generated cartoon, or even a classic painting. After about a minute, you'll see a video of some kind of motion based on the initial upload. The AI can simulate camera moves, make subjects breathe or blink, or otherwise imbue life into the pixels. Honor's place as the first home of the feature is born out of a deal with Google Cloud. It marks the first time the Veo 2 AI video model has been integrated directly into a smartphone. And while Gemini Advanced users can access a web-based version of Veo, Pixel owners don't have any special access to the video maker. Beyond a snapshot. HONOR 400 Series can effortlessly transform your images into captivating videos with AI Image to Video - breathing new life into your stills. Spark Daily Wonder with HONOR 400 Series - coming 22nd May, 2025. #HONOR400 #SparkDailyWonder pic.twitter.com/ddRPYohGitMay 12, 2025 Honor has pitched a lot of AI plans for the 500 series of phones. Google is providing several AI tools beyond the video generator. Google's Magic Eraser, AI Outpainting, and other creative flourishes are also baked into the smartphone's native camera and gallery apps. Of course, even the most magical AI gimmick won’t mean much if the phone itself is junk. But by the looks of it, the Honor 400 and 400 Pro are coming in hot with some decent mid- to upper-tier specs and a starting cost of around $550. The Honor 400 phones will debut in China and Europe and are likely to appear in India too, but may not be seen much in the U.S. The ability to shoot, edit, and animate all from the same device without hopping between different apps might entice a lot of content creators and AI fans to pick the phone. Honor getting early access to Veo 2, when even Pixel phones don’t have it yet, hints at a broader shift in how Google is approaching AI distribution.

    "title": "How a designer turned an iPad and Apple Pencil into the heart of a creative business",
    "article_text": "Mandy Corcoran runs her business and creates all her designs on iPad When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Part of what makesApple’s iPad experience so compelling is the sheer versatility of the tablet. Back when I reviewed the newiPad Air with M3, I called out the multiple ways of using it: touch, Apple Pencil, or via a Magic Keyboard. It’s a pretty winning formula. Here in the States, it was Small Business Week last week, and I had the chance to chat with Mandy Corcoran, a surface designer whose work has been used on products sold at Home Goods, TJMaxx, and Nordstrom Rack, to name a few. Now, I love a good design in its own right, but the tech angle here lies deep as Corcoran – who goes byAmanda Grace Design– uses an iPad Pro, Apple Pencil, and Procreate to do it all. It all started in 2018 on Christmas morning, when her husband gave her an iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, and as Corcoran says, “it changed everything.” “I downloaded Procreate that day, and something just clicked,” she explained, noting that the Apple Pencil felt natural. After sketching digitally within Procreate, she had a realization that this would be a larger part of her life. Before jumping into design work, Corcoran was rooted in tech; she was a programmer, which she described as very logic-based – “it’s structure, flow, and problem-solving, which always appealed to my brain. When I found seamless pattern design in Procreate, it felt like a creative extension of that mindset.” And she got her start with drawing – pre iPad – using a Wacom Cintiq andAdobePhotoshop. When she designs patterns with Procreate, Corcoran says it lets her use her “tech-brain” creatively. She explains that there is a mathematical precision to the creative and design process, as she needs to fit various designs together, figure out the right flow, and ultimately end up with something meaningful. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. “For me, it’s all about giving people tools to unlock their creativity faster,” explains Corcoran on creating templates and patterns. She noted that when she first started, there weren’t many templates or charts to help with layout and eyeflow. So, when she first began designing, she went on a deep dive within the app and ecosystem, learning every part of it. This helped her create her first course and become one of the first educators offering customizable pattern templates in 2023. And her focus, or special sauce, is really all around surface design – creating the tools herself, but also offering courses to let others create with these tools and design their own. It’s sort of an iPad ecosystem for design, and a well-brewing one at that. She explains it as, “I run a design business, create online courses, build templates, test brushes,” all on the iPad, and it’s one device where she can have everything live without worrying about if there’s enough power or speed. Corcoran uses aniPad Pro, a 13-inch one with the M4 chip under the hood. In TechRadar’s testing, it performed incredibly well, letting you blaze through almost any task you’d want to on an iPad and running more intensive creative workflows without a hitch. She has been a fan of the Apple Pencil, describing it as “an extension of your thinking.” Corcoran’s been using theApple Pencil Prowith her iPad Pro, which offers a bit more functionality, including barrel roll support and squeeze functionality. “As someone who loves creating systems, I really appreciate how hover, double tap, and now squeeze with Apple Pencil Pro give me shortcuts at my fingertips – without ever putting my pencil down. That’s huge,” explains Corcoran. Using it all together within Procreate and other creative apps, it allows for more precision when creating a design, and when Corcoran is teaching, it’s an easier way to explain “how to move faster” and with more confidence. It’s clear that iPad and Apple Pencil have been a key part of Corcoran’s career, allowing her to create her own business but also encouraging other folks to create and design on their own. “iPad and Apple Pencil have allowed me to build a creative career on my own terms – and that’s not something I take for granted.” Further, she says that you don’t need to be an expert to get started with being creative on iPad, encouraging folks and TechRadar readers to “just open an app like Procreate, tap around, and start playing.” A few weeks back, on April 26, 2025, at the Apple Carnegie store in Washington, DC, Corcoran hosted a Today at Apple Session for 30 participants on creating within Procreate using patterns around a fruit theme. She described it as a full-circle moment, ultimately allowing her to teach what has been a life-changing process for her. After creating countless patterns and designs – some now featured on products in major retailers – she left the crowd feeling inspired and confident. “A few people told me afterward they’d never even realized how many things in their lives had patterns – and that this opened their eyes in a completely new way,” noted Corcoran.

    "title": "Are you due a payout from Apple's $95 million Siri settlement? Here's how to claim",
    "article_text": "'Hey Siri, can you fill out class-action lawsuit claim forms'? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Back in January,Appleagreed to settle a class-action lawsuitrelated to its Siri voice assistant. The case saw some Apple device owners claim that Siri had disclosed their private conversations to advertisers, following \"unintended Siri activations\". Apple denied all wrongdoing and agreed to settle the case to \"avoid additional litigation\" (more on that below). But the result of the 'Lopez vs Apple Inc' suit means that, if you owned and used an Apple device between September 17, 2014 and December 31, 2024, you could be due a small slice of the payout. Those who are eligible could be a line for a maximum payout of $100 (that's $20 per device, for up to five Siri devices). Not exactly a lottery jackpot, but worth investigating if you think you've been affected by unintentionally activating Siri during a private conversation during that period. AsThe Vergereports, many of those affected will have received an email titled “Lopez Voice Assistant Class Action Settlement\" (from the address 'info@lopezvoiceassistantsettlement.com'). Despite sounding like spam, this is a genuine email containing details like your 'claimant identification code' and more. But even if you didn't receive this, you can also submit a claim. Here's a quick breakdown of what happened, how Apple's responded and how to file a claim if you think you've been affected... The lawsuit's plaintiffs alleged that \"confidential or private communications\" were \"obtained by Apple and/or shared with third parties as a result of an unintended Siri activation\". According to thesuit's homepage,that took place sometime between 17 September, 2014 and 31 December, 2024. But how? Apple has always maintained that iPhones don't 'listen' to their owners, aside from when wake words like 'Hey, Siri' are used. Well, the key is that phrase \"unintended Siri activation\". Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The plaintiffs say that Siri not only tuned into private conversations by mistake – perhaps by mishearing a wake word – but also used that information to subsequently trigger ads. Again, Apple denies that this is possible, stating that \"Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose\". Nevertheless, asReutersreported, two plaintiffs claimed that their mentions on Air Jordan sneakers and Olive Garden restaurants later resulted in them getting ads for those products, while another plaintiff claimed they got ads for a brand name surgical treatment after talking about it with their doctor. Despite agreeing to pay $95 million to settle the Siri lawsuit, Apple was pretty bullish in its response – and admitted no wrongdoing, despite settling the suit. Apple told us that \"Siri data has never been used to build marketing profiles and it has never been sold to anyone for any purpose,” adding that collected data is only used to improve the virtual assistant. In a separate statement, it added: \"Apple settled this case to avoid additional litigation so we can move forward from concerns about third-party grading thatwe already addressed in 2019. We use Siri data to improve Siri, and we are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private.\" That's fairly emphatic then, but the settlement means that potentially millions of Apple device owners could be eligible for a claim – here's how to check to see if you're one of them. If you think you're eligible for a payout in the 'Lopez v Apple Inc' lawsuit, you'll need to use theofficial claim formand submit it byJuly 2, 2025. You'll need to meet some pretty specific criteria in order to be eligible for a payout. That criteria is below and the claim form asks you to confirm all of the below under oath: You can make claims for up to five Siri devices – these can include iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, MacBooks, iMacs, HomePods, the iPod touch, or Apple TVs. As mentioned above, many of those who are potentially eligible will have received an email titled \"Lopez Voice Assistant Class Action Settlement\". But you don't necessarily need to have received that email to make a claim – if not, just click \"New Claim\" in theclaim formand enter your details from there.

    "title": "Google Messages is getting another wave of updates – here are 7 you can expect to see soon",
    "article_text": "WhatsApp, watch your back When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google Messages has already improved a lot since it landed over 11 years ago – and over the past couple of weeks we've seen Google test more new features that could roll out widely very soon. Though Google has been dropping new features in Messages since the beginning of the year, these past few weeks have been a particularly busy time, especially for group chats in Google Messages. But in addition to itsnew chat iconsandgroup chat links, there's a number of other new design features and overdue functions that could help enhance the Google Messages user experience. Despite not all of these features being widely available, Google has hinted that they will be rolled out very soon, and we have a lot of APK teardowns from the likes of9to5Googleto thank for an early peek at them. Here's a look at what's likely coming to Google Messages very soon... Google Messages''Delete for everyone' functionis the latest of the new features that have emerged.First spotted back in February, more users are starting to see it crop up in their Google Messages app but it's not yet available for everyone - suggesting that it will be rolled out gradually. There's already a 'Delete for me' option but this new update will allow you to remove messages from the view of everyone in a chat. Users who have access have noticed that 'Delete for everyone' only works in larger group chats, and have yet to find a 1:1 chat where they can use it. There's also a 15-minute time window, meaning that if you want to remove a text from a conversation, you’ll have to be quick. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Just like other messaging platforms, group chat links make it easier to gather your contacts into one big conversation hassle-free, and Google Messages is following suit. It was first uncovered in an APK teardown byAndroid Authorityand will allow you to create invite links that you can share in standard link form or through a QR code that others can scan. In the image taken from the teardown, there’s a toggle you can enable that will give you two options; to create a single-use link, or one that can be reused and distributed. Links will expire after 30 days. On the topic of group chats, Google Messages is paying a lot of attention to this aspect of its messaging platform and is introducingnew group chat icons. A number of users noticed this in the Google Messages app by opening a group conversation, navigating the top bar to reveal the group details. If a pencil icon appears at the right of your group chat’s existing image, it means you have the freedom to set your own icon. After experimenting with the feature users have noted that you won't be able to set gifs as icons, and you won't be able to return to a previous icon once a new one has been set. At the moment, group chat icons in Google Messages only show up to four circle profile images, which doesn’t make it easy to distinguish between chats, so a smaller feature like this will not only be a great design upgrade but a practical one, too. For a while, Google Messages hasn't been a user's best friend when it comes to composing longer texts, but that's all about to change as Google Messages is expanding its 4-line view limit. The new text field limit will allow up to 14 lines per message making it easier for you to view longer messages before you send them. At the same time as group chat links were spotted in Google Messages, there was also speculation ofa new group chat muting feature– and it looks as though it's ready to roll out. This will see a new button added to the toolbar at the top of the screen when you long-press on a chat, which will then show a second menu where you can choose to mute a group chat for one hour, eight hours, 24 hours. There's even an 'always' option, and the menu reassures you that other members won't see that you have muted the chat. Live location sharing is a God-send, especially when it comes to finding your friends in larger crowds, and this new feature has been teased by an in-app code. Users can currently share their location with another person throughGoogle Maps, but it only shows up as a staticGoogle Mapspin. If you move around, this means you’ll have to send your location again – but Google could be working to combat this. Last time we checked the feature wasn't live for us, however there's a chance Google could be experimenting with it behind the scenes. Additionally, Sensitive Content Warnings went live in a Google Messages' beta a few weeks ago for some users. Accounts owned by users under 18 will automatically have this setting enabled, and users over 18 will have the option to turn it off. In addition to a redesigned gallery, you'll be able to send photos and videos on Google Messages in their original quality which was first spotted in beta in February. The new layout includes a “HD” icon which you can find in the top-right of the final screen before sending an image. When you tap the icon, a new menu appears allowing you to select from two options; “Optimized for chat”, which trades some quality for a lower file size, or “Original quality”, which sends the original image as found on your phone’s built-in storage.

    "article_text": "FTC agrees with DOJ's remedies for Google When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has spoken out in favor of the Department of Justice's (DOJ) proposal for Google to share search data with competitors, stating that the resolution would include sufficient privacy safeguards. The proposal aims to break Google's illegal monopoly in online search, per an August 2024 federal judge ruling. The company accounts for nine in 10 of all searches globally as of April 2025, according toStatcounterdata. In order to comply with DOJ proposals, Google must \"share targeted portions of its search index, user, and ads data with certain competitors for a limited period of time with suitable security and privacy safeguards.\" The Commission explained in abriefthat any remedy, including in the case of Google, should \"effectively pry open to competition a market that has been closed by defendants’ illegal restraints.\" The brief concludes that the DOJ's Revised Proposed Final Judgement is \"well designed to protect user privacy as it seeks to \"pry open' long-monopolized markets.\" It's hoped that, by increasing competition, Google will be forced to enhance its privacy practices, marking an overall win for American citizens. The proposal also includes appointing a compliance committee, but the DOJ is still urging the court to force Google to divest its Chromebrowserand to stop payingAppleand others to set Google as the default search engine for millions globally.

A German consumer protection group is calling on Meta to halt its plan to start training its AI models with EU users' data. The Verbraucherzentrale North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) has sent a cease and desist letter to the Big Tech giant on April 30, 2025, to demand that Facebook and Instagram stop their AI training plans. The group also threatens further legal action if Meta decides not to comply. \"It is imperative to act quickly, because once data has been incorporated into AI, it is difficult to retrieve it,\" said Christine Steffen, data protection expert at the North Rhine-Westphalia Consumer Advice Center, in anofficial announcement. All public posts and users' interactions are set tofeed Meta AIstarting from May 27, 2025. If they don't wish this to happen, EU users need to actively opt out.

To take part, click the link below:https://futurenet.questionpro.eu/tr-vpn Meta, the parent company that owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, successfully launched Meta AI in the EU in March, almost a year after the firm paused the launch amid growingconcerns among EU data regulators. In itsofficial announcement, the company ensures that its approach complies with European laws and regulations. \"We welcome the opinion provided by the EDPB in December, which affirmed that our original approach met our legal obligations,\" Meta wrote. Specifically, theEDPB opinionprovides a guide to help the Irish Data Protection Authority (DPA) assess the use of legitimate interest as a legal basis for AI models. German consumer experts, however, are now arguing that a reference to legitimate interest is insufficient for Meta AI. They also point out how users should not accept that the personal information they shared with Meta over the years could now be used for AI training. \"Furthermore,it cannot be ruled out that particularly sensitive information, which is particularly protected under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is also used for AI training purposes,\" said Steffen. \"In that case, a so-called opt-out – as offered by Meta – is not sufficient; those affected would have to actively consent to this.\" #Meta Skips Consent, Breaches #GDPR with EU Data AI Training. 📊🚫 #DataProtectionMatters #MakePrivacyReality pic.twitter.com/nYwZQOxtyLApril 18, 2025 Austrian privacy advocacy group noyb (None of Your Business) also believes that Meta AI may not be compliant with GDPR laws. \"Meta is deliberately trying to ignore European law and is putting its commercial interests above the fundamental right to data protection of those affected,\" said noyb's co-founder and lawyer Max Schrems in anofficial announcement, sharing his total support with Verbraucherzentrale NRW's actions. \"Meta should simply ask the affected people for their consent. But if Meta ignores EU law, there will be consequences for the whole of Europe,\" Schrems added. With the Meta AI officially kicking off in about two weeks ' time, we might see more actions from other European consumer groups, privacy authorities, or the DPA itself. In the meantime, privacy experts like Proton, the provider behind one of thebest VPNand encrypted email apps, are urging people in Europe concerned about their privacy to opt out of Meta AI training. \"It's hard to predict what this data might be used for in the future – better to be safe than sorry,\" Proton wrote on aLinkedIn post.

A security researcher wrote ransomware code that infects the computer’s CPU, making it invisible to virtually everyantivirus programout there, and making it persistent even when the victim takes out and replaces the computer’s hard drive. This is according to The Register, who recently spoke with Christiaan Beek, a cybersecurity researcher from Rapid7, who claims to have created a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) for such ransomware. Malwareat the CPU level is not exactly arcane science. We’ve seen it in the past, with the likes of JoLax, CosmicStrand, and other UEFI firmware rootkits. However, this is the first time someone’s successfully played with ransomware this way. Save up to 68% for Techradar readers TechRadar editors praise Aura's upfront pricing and simplicity. Aura also includes a password manager, VPN, and antivirus to make its security solution an even more compelling deal. Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Beek said that he got the inspiration from a bug inAMDZen processors that allowed threat actors to load malicious microcode and break the encryption at the hardware level. This would have allowed them to modify the behavior of the CPU as they saw fit. Beek says that the leaked Conti chat logs from 2022 suggested that actual cybercriminals were discussing the same idea before, but they haven’t yet gotten to a working solution. At least, not that the cybersecurity community knows of. \"If they worked on it a few years ago, you can bet some of them will get smart enough at some point and start creating this stuff,\" the researcher told the publication.

Ransomware remains one of the biggest threats out there, with companies of all sizes losing billions of dollars every year. In fact, a recent Veeam study, which gathered insights from 1,300 CISOs, IT leaders, and security professionals across the Americas, Europe, and Australia, found thatnearly three-quarters of businesses were impacted by ransomware over the past year.

    "title": "Google to pay $1.4 billion in unauthorized biometric data collection and geo-tracking lawsuits",
    "article_text": "Google agrees to a $1.375 billion settlement in Texas When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google has agreed to pay $1.375 billion to the state of Texas to settle lawsuits over unauthorized tracking and data collection. It was deemed that the company had been unlawfully tracking users' geolocation, including while 'Location History' was disabled. Google had also been collecting biometric data, such as facial geometry and voiceprints, without consent, as well as tracking incognito searches and other private user activity. The colossal sum might not be much to a company that generated $350 billion in revenue in the most recent fiscal year, but it's still a sum that could hit the company hard, marking the largest ever state settlement that Google has had to pay out of data privacy issues. In September 2023, Google paid out its then-largest-ever state settlement of $93 million over allegations of misleading users about how their location data was collected. Earlier in November 2022, the company settled a similar data collection complaint in a payout worth $391 million, but that was to 40 states – not one. \"For years, Google secretly tracked people’s movements, private searches, and even their voiceprints and facial geometry through their products and services. I fought back and won,”saidAttorney General Ken Paxton, who declared that \"Big Tech is not above the law.\" Google's 10-figure settlement follows a similar payout from Meta in July 2024, when it coughed up $1.4 billion over unlawfully collecting and using facial recognition data.

Paxton added: \"This $1.375 billion settlement is a major win for Texans’ privacy and tells companies that they will pay for abusing our trust.\" A Google spokesperson toldTechRadar Pro: \"This settles a raft of old claims, many of which have already been resolved elsewhere, concerning product policies we have long since changed.

    "title": "Sony’s next Alpha camera gets rumored launch date – and it could have an unusual EVF feature",
    "article_text": "Details are scarce but Sony seems to have at least two new mirrorless cameras on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. IsSonyabout to announce a new camera? Or maybe even two? The evidence is pointing that way, even if details are extremely thin on the ground. Sony Alpha Rumors hastoday updated a short news story, adding ‘confirmation’ that the company will unveil a new E-mount mirrorless camera on May 28, 2025. As to what that camera might be, the story barely speculates – although it does say that it will not be a successor for theSony A7 IV. We’ve long suspected that a new Sony A7 model is on its way, however, and the fact that the price of the currentSony A7 IV, released back in 2021, has recentlydropped to record lowsstrongly suggests that something is in the offing. So, we’re still expecting a new baseline full-frame model from Sony to be announced this year – just maybe not as soon as May 28. While the piece is light on detail, Sony Alpha Rumors’ story does mention that the new camera may feature a reworked ‘tilting EVF design’. Tilting viewfinders are a rarity on mirrorless cameras, but we have seen them before – perhaps most notably on the 2018-releasedPanasonic Lumix GX9. The GX9 has a compact rangefinder-style design, where allowing the viewfinder to tilt up makes it more comfortable to use, so perhaps Sony’s rumored camera will have a similarly compact body. Sony has released plenty of APS-C E-mount cameras with this sort of design over the years, such as theA6500andA6100. Could the model supposedly being announced on May 28 be something new in that line? But the Sony news doesn’t stop there. Asecond story on Sony Alpha Rumorsseemingly reveals that Sony has recently registered two new cameras in China: one on 21 April and another on 9 May. Both models will feature dual-band Wi-Fi but the first will be manufactured in China while the second will be manufactured in Japan. If the May 28 launch claims are true, one of these cameras will likely be announced on that day. Could the other also be revealed at the same time, or will it be held back until the autumn, another popular time of the year for new cameras launches? Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. We’ll be waiting to report on any concrete news or further rumors, but in the meantime let us know what you’d like to see from Sony’s reveals in the comments below.

    "title": "Mercedes-AMG just teased its 1,000bhp Porsche Taycan Turbo GT rival –and it'll need to dip deep into its performance past to beat it",
    "article_text": "AMG once ruled the ICE kingdom but now seems lost at sea When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Mercedes-AMG has teased its first electric ‘super sedan’ via a series of images released on its social media channels that show the large, imposing four-door fastback wearing a thin camouflage. Both the front and rear lamps have been inspired by the star design used on the upcoming CLA – causing somewhat of a furore on socials – while the low-slung ride height and enormous aero-enhanced wheels signify its performance intentions. Above all else, the design already sets apart from the slightly confusing Mercedes-AMG’s EQE and EQS mash-up models that have arrived to date. But the good news is, this is tipped to be the first dedicated, high-performance electric Mercedes-AMG product, complete with its very own platform (dubbed AMG.EA) and in-house tweaked electric motors. Where AMG was once the final word in high-performance combustion engines, arguably peaking with its fantastic and ferocious naturally-aspirated 6.3-liter V8 (I’ve personally owned one and it was amazing before the fuel bills financially ruined me), it has yet to be permitted to properly have its wicked way with an electrified powertrain. Reports suggest that the upcoming electric super sedan will use axial flux motors, which are much lighter and more energy dense than the radial motors used in most of today’s high-performance EVs. According toAutocar, a total power output of 1,000bhp and 1,000lb-ft of torque are quite feasible from a twin-axial flux motor set-up. But we will have to wait for a full reveal to find out. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. However, this would bring it directly in the firing line of the Taycan Turbo GT, which is capable of smashing the 0-62mph sprint in just 2.3 seconds thanks to its 1,020bhp power. It can also return an impressive 347 miles on a single charge. Since the automotive industry made the switch towards an increasingly electric future, Mercedes-AMG has been downsizing and turbocharging its internal combustion engines, as well as adding plug-in hybrid options in order to meet more stringent emissions regulations. Speak to any AMG fan and they will likely admit that this has had a negative effect on the products leaving the famous Affalterbach factory. Let’s not get started on the expensive, bizarrely-styled and slightly disappointing Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 and EQS models. But this latest project could be the first time we really see what the famous tuningarmof Mercedes-Benz can do when it gets its hands on the brand’s battery and motor technology, with the results finally able to take on the might of Porsche and Audi. The former would likely be its closest rival, as it has been pushing its EV tech to the limits for years, with the Taycan Turbo GT arguably one of the most mind-bending and impressive high-performance electric vehicles I have ever been lucky enough to drive. Simply imbuing an EV with enormous amounts of power isn’t good enough, as so much work has to be done in order to translate that into useable, real-world performance. The Taycan Turbo GT – complete with the Weissach Package that removes the rear seats and adds a fixed carbon rear wing in pursuit of lightness – is arguably too much for the road, but it redefines what it means to go fast. The handling is exquisite, the feedback through the steering wheel pure Porsche and the acceleration with Overboost activated borderline painful. Launch Control is so aggressive that the driver can only handle a handful of runs before they throw in the towel… or throw up. However, it can make even ham-fisted drivers look like the GOAT, thanks to its seemingly endless amounts of grip and poise. But despite this, the market is still relatively slow for high-performance EVs, with sales of Taycan reportedly plummeting by 49% in 2024. The poor residual values are also knocking consumer confidence in new cars. Mercedes-AMG entering the game should help prove to the market that this really is the future of high-performance motoring, building on the work that Audi, Porsche and Xiaomi (in China at least) have already done. What’s more, it will hopefully signal a return to AMG doing what it does best when it is left to its own devices… chiefly creating phenomenal driver’s cars.

OpenAIandMicrosoftare believed to be negotiating their partnership terms to enable OpenAI to potentially go public, while ensuring that Microsoft can continue accessing the AI startup's technology. Reutersexplained that the two companies could be in the midst of rewriting their terms, however Redmond's extensive involvement in the ChatGPT-maker's recent history could be adding further complexities to any potential IPO. Details of the alleged deal could have considerable consequences for Microsoft, which currently has an agreement allowing it to access OpenAI's models until the end of the decade. Being a private company, we have no real indication of how much OpenAI might be worth and how much it may wish to list for, however Microsoft's estimated $13.75 billion stake in the company is certainly a considerable sum. It's been reported that OpenAI is reconsidering its transformation from a nonprofit to a fully commercial enterprise after pushback from employees, academics and competitors, including Elon Musk. \"OpenAI was founded as a nonprofit, and is today overseen and controlled by that nonprofit.

    "title": "I saw Panasonic’s 2025 TV lineup in person, and here are the 3 models you should be most excited for",
    "article_text": "OLED and mini-LED TV standouts When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Panasonichas announced its2025 TV lineup, and there’s something for everyone, from flagship OLEDs to entry-level LEDs, gaming TVs and more. I recently got to see the full range at an event, and it featured in-depth demonstrations of particular sets. Panasonic is known for making some of thebest TVson the market, with its flagship Panasonic Z95A scoring four and a half out of five stars in our review and earning a place on our list forbest OLED TVs. 2024 was an exciting year for Panasonic as it not only began to use Fire TV as its new smart TV platform but it re-entered the US market for the first time in almost a decade. We’d already seen the Panasonic Z95B, the 2025 flagship OLED, in action at CES 2025and were suitably impressed with its picture quality. Now that I’ve seen the 2025 range in action, I’ve picked three models that I think you should get excited for. Panasonic’sOLEDTVs rank among the top TVs every year for their picture quality, dynamic sound and full array of features. The Panasonic Z95B, the company's new flagship OLED, looks to take things even further. Seeing the Z95B in person, it demonstrated the vibrant colors and rich blacks I’ve come to expect from Panasonic’s flagship OLEDs, but it also showcased stunning new brightness levels. The Z95B features a newPrimary Tandem RGB OLED panel, the same used in theLG G5, and seeing it next to its predecessor, the Z95A, which uses a micro lens array (MLA) OLED panel, the brightness boost and improved color was obvious. A clip of dancers in colored outfits showed the Z95B's extra vivid punch compared to the Z95A, and the white droplets of water reflecting light demonstrated its brightness boost in areas around the screen. Even black levels were deeper. The Z95B also features a new ThermalFlow cooling system to regulate airflow, which Panasonic says allows for better brightness retention on screen. Even the Z95B’s audio system has been tweaked. Although still the same 5.1.2 channel speaker array from the Z95A, the rear effects have been more accurately positioned, and an audio demo proved this. During the demo, where the same clips were played through the Z95B and Z95A, it was clear that the Z95B had a wider soundstage and a more dynamic sound. It also felt more powerful, which Panasonic explained was thanks to the new, larger drivers and side-firing and up-firing speakers. The Z95B has also gone through a design change, taking on a more uniform look across the whole unit. It uses fabric around its frame and across its front external speaker array, and the corners have been rounded to give it a more premium look overall. Put all this together with a list of gaming features expected from thebest gaming TVs(4K144Hz, VRR,AMDFreeSync Premium Pro,NvidiaGSync, Dolby Vision gaming and ALLM) and you have one powerhouse OLED TV. Get the price right, Panasonic, and this could be a TV of the year contender! The Z90B, the step-down OLED model from the flagship Z95B, doesn’t have that model's Primary Tandem RGB OLED panel, but it still has the Z95B's HCX AI Processor MK II and the same list of gaming features. It also comes in a wider array of sizes. In Panasonic's demo, the Z90B sat amongst the Z95B and Z80B OLEDs in different sizes, and still showed exceptional contrast, dynamic colors and solid brightness. A clip of colored glass showed the Z90B's precise detail and accurate color, along with its inky black levels. Where the Z90B gets interesting, though, is in its smaller 42 and 48-inch sizes. That OLED size range is usually dominated by theLGC-series OLEDs, but the Z90B includes a front speaker array that could give it the edge over its LG rivals. The LG C5 earned five out of five stars in ourLG C5 review, but the built-in sound was its biggest disappointment. If Panasonic can get the Z90B's price right, then it could give the C5 a run for its money. It’s worth noting for our US readers that the Z90B is only available in the UK and Europe, so if you’re looking for a mid-range OLED, the C5 is likely to be your best option. Just add one of thebest soundbarsto make it a more complete package. The last of the three models is the Panasonic W95B, the brand’s only mini-LED offering for 2025. In an extremely competitive market, thebest mini-LED TVsare often made by brands likeSamsung,TCL,Hisenseand evenSony. Panasonic is not a company that immediately comes to mind, as it's often known for OLED TVs. The W95B is a feature-stacked mini-LED that again comes with the flagship HCX AI Processor MK II, a comprehensive list of gaming features, and the new Prime Video Calibrated picture mode and Calman Ready AutoCal (both in the Z95B as well). Seeing the W95B next to its predecessor, the Panasonic W95A, it showed better backlight control with less blooming (an artifact of LED TV tech) and better black levels with more accurate colors. A demo of a fire handler showed brighter oranges and reds on the W95B than on the W95A. Not only were colors and contrast more powerful, but the W95B had brighter highlights, as seen in the ball on the staff at the center of the flame (shown in the picture above). From the demo I saw, the W95B could be a great entry in the Mini-LED TV market. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.

According to Al Jazeera, Abdul Ghani al-Kikli, head of the UN-backed government’s Stability Support Apparatus (SSA), was killed in a firefight in southern Tripoli. The incident reportedly took place inside the headquarters of the 444th Combat Brigade after“failed negotiations.” Local media reported fighting and troop movements in the Abu Salim and Mashrou neighborhoods. Al Jazeera cited witnesses as saying that soldiers from the 111th and 444th brigades stormed the SSA headquarters, with gunfire and explosions heard in various parts of the city. The extent of the fighting and casualties remains unclear. Graphic images circulating on social media appear to show multiple bodies. Al Jazeera reported that at least six people were injured. According to Al Arabiya, militias from Misrata and other cities began moving toward Tripoli last week. The SSA was established in 2021 by the Government of National Unity to maintain security in the capital and combat organized crime. Fighting has erupted in the Libyan city of Tripoli following the assassination of the head of the Stability Support Apparatus. Multiple key installations appear to have been captured by different groups in the middle of the chaos. The airport has been closed.#Breaking#Libyapic.twitter.com/a6OeXNXS43 The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) said it was“closely monitoring reports of the military build-up and escalating tensions in Tripoli and the broader western region.” “We urgently call on all parties to immediately de-escalate the situation, refrain from any provocative actions, and resolve disputes through dialogue,”the mission said in a statement. 🇱🇾#Libia: tras el asesinato de Ghani al Kikli, alias Ghniwa, jefe del Aparato de Apoyo a la Estabilidad estallan combates en Tripoli.pic.twitter.com/sDW8qNa0K9 Libya descended into civil war in 2011 after a NATO-backed uprising that resulted in the death of longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi. The fighting eventually led to a stalemate between rival governments based in Tripoli, in the western part of the country, and Tobruk in the east.

    "title": "Moldovan leader promises to join EU by 2028",
    "article_text": "Moldova’s President Maia Sandu has said her country could join the EU by 2028, despite growing opposition to her pro-Western policy. The former Soviet republic has pursued EU and NATO membership since 2020, when Sandu, a vocal critic of Russia, came to power. Moldova was granted EU candidate status in 2022, alongside Ukraine. Re-elected last year in a contested and much debated runoff, Sandu has stepped up efforts to speed up the accession process. Asked during an interview on Monday with local broadcaster TV8 about the timeline, Sandu said she intended to conclude negotiations by the end of 2027. ”By 2028, we expect every EU member state to have ratified our agreements. That way we will complete the process by the end of the current European Commission’s mandate,” Sandu said. The Commission's mandate, led by President Ursula von der Leyen, runs from December 2024 to December 2029. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said last month that Moldova’s accession by 2028 depends on the pace of the country's reforms and unanimous support from the bloc’s 27 members. Sandu’s policy has drawn mounting criticism at home. This month, thousands of protesters rallied in the capital Chisinau over the country’s economic direction and her government’s handling of opposition voices. The demonstration, led by the Party of Socialists and its leader, former President Igor Dodon, was billed as the start of their parliamentary election campaign ahead of a vote expected in September. Sandu has said the upcoming elections will be decisive for Moldova’s EU course. The Socialists, who refused to recognize Sandu’s re-election, accused her government last month of“an unprecedented act of spiritual terror”after a senior Moldovan Orthodox Church bishop was barred from traveling to Jerusalem for Easter. The Sandu administration has also been embroiled in longstanding political standoff with the autonomous region of Gagauzia. Her government, driven by a strong pro-European and anti-Russian vision, reportedly sees Gagauzia not just as an ideological outlier, but as a strategic challenge. The region's governor, Yevgenia Gutsul – a fierce critic of Sandu – was arrested in April amid an investigation into alleged irregularities in her 2023 campaign. Gutsul accused Chisinau of targeting Gagauzia in retaliation for its support of opposition figures, including herself. Opposition described Gutsul’s arrest as a“purely political persecution.” Sandu had claimed she was fighting against“pro-Russian”actors within the country as she launched a crackdown on opposition parties and media outlets, branding them as criminals.",

    "title": "US oil industry unhappy with Trump – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "The US oil industry is growing increasingly disenchanted with President Donald Trump’s policies, according to Bloomberg. Falling crude prices and tariffs are making the situation untenable for producers, especially smaller ones, the media outlet has reported. During his campaign, Trump adopted“drill, baby, drill”as one of his signature slogans, promising to revitalize the industry, which he claimed was being strangled by former President Joe Biden’s environmental policies. While the US oil industry strongly supported Trump’s candidacy,“some executives are now feeling shortchanged”as crude prices have slid by 20% since he assumed office in January. West Texas Intermediate tumbled to as low as $55 per barrel last month. The downtrend in oil prices is helping the US president make good on his campaign pledge to lower inflation, but this is coming at a cost for domestic oil producers, according to the outlet. While industry giants such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron are more resilient to low oil prices, smaller independent producers are already feeling the impact. This is evidenced by a combined $1.8 billion in spending cuts announced by such firms over the past several weeks, according to Bloomberg. The news outlet quoted Andy Hendricks, the CEO of Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. as saying that“$50 oil and ‘drill, baby, drill’”are“incompatible.” The multi-front tariff war that Trump has unleashed against much of the world is also hurting American oil producers, since much of the equipment they use is imported from China, Korea, Brazil, and Mexico. This means that routine repairs have now become a“source of anxiety”for the industry, the article claimed. The media outlet quoted Kirk Edwards, former chairman of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association, expressing incredulity over why the US oil and gas industry is“being picked on as a scapegoat in this whole tariff plan.” Bloomberg, citing company officials, reported that executives representing a number of private and independent oil companies have met in recent weeks with Texas Senator Ted Cruz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lee Zeldin and congressional representatives to convey their grievances. Several executives interviewed by Bloomberg reportedly said they want Trump to establish a price floor for oil by persuading OPEC leaders to cut production during his Middle East visit, as well as to provide tariff exemptions for oil field equipment. The president is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates from May 13 to May 16.",

    "title": "Trump mulls participation in Russia-Ukraine talks",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he expects a“good result”from possible direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, suggesting he may participate himself. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, the US president called the potential talks a“very important”event. A resumption of direct negotiations between the two sides, which was proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, could take place in Istanbul, Türkiye on May 15. “I think you may have a good result at the Thursday meeting in Türkiye between Russia and Ukraine. I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over. I don’t know where I’m going to be on Thursday, I’ve got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there,”Trump said. Trump’s suggestion was welcomed by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, who described it as the“right idea”and reiterated his claim that he was ready to meet Putin in person. Thus far, Moscow has remained silent on the prospect of the Russian leader traveling to Türkiye for negotiations. In proposing a return to direct negotiations, the Russian president reiterated Moscow’s commitment to resolving the crisis. The settlement process must start with talks, Putin stressed, and the negotiations could ultimately lead to“some kind of new truce and a new ceasefire.” “We are set on serious negotiations with Ukraine. Their aim is to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and to achieve a long-term lasting peace for a historical perspective,”the president said. The offer has met a mixed reaction from Kiev and its backers, who continue to insist on their demand that any negotiations must be preceded by the establishment of at least a 30-day truce. However, Putin’s proposal was backed by Trump, who urged Kiev to“immediately”accept it. Following Trump’s call, Kiev seemingly shifted its position, and Zelensky proclaimed his readiness to participate in the meeting, while reiterating the truce demand. Türkiye has welcomed the initiative and expressed a readiness to host the talks. However, the Turkish presidency sent a somewhat ambiguous message on the matter on Monday, simultaneously stating that it was an opportunity that should not be missed but also that a ceasefire would have created the“necessary environment”for the negotiations.",

    "title": "EU nastier than China – Trump",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of the European Union, labeling it“nastier than China”regarding trade practices. In early April, Washington imposed a sweeping 20% tariff on all EU goods and a 25% tariff on all car imports and metals. While Trump later announced a 90-day reprieve on most trade duties, a baseline 10% tariff and the above-mentioned 25% tariff remain in force until an agreement is reached. “The European Union is in many ways nastier than China,”Trump stated during a press conference at the White House on Monday. “They treated us very unfairly. They sell us 13 million cars; we sell them none. They sell us their agricultural products; we sell them virtually none,”the president claimed, adding that Brussels has been“suing all our companies… Apple, Google, Meta.” The American leader predicted that the EU would“come down a lot,”since the US holds“all the cards.” Trump further stated that the bloc is also to blame, at least in part, for the excessively high prices that Americans have to pay for prescription drugs. According to the president, Brussels has been unfairly exerting“brutal”pressure on pharmaceutical companies to keep prices low in Europe, while refusing to shoulder the fair share of the firms’ research and development and other related costs. However, Washington is now set to“equalize”the situation, Trump promised, concluding that“Europe is gonna have to pay a little bit more…. And America is gonna pay a lot less.” Trump’s remarks came hours after Washington and Beijing agreed during negotiations in Geneva to scrap or suspend most of the new trade duties introduced since early April, pending further talks. As a result, overall US tariffs on Chinese goods will stand at 30% and Chinese tariffs on US goods will be 10%, starting May 14. The two nations will also set up a consultation mechanism to work out further trade policy steps. The EU, for its part, has made several attempts at negotiating trade and tariffs with the US, though none of them have so far yielded a breakthrough. Last Thursday, the European Commission presented a list of countermeasures which could affect €95 billion worth of US goods should negotiations fail. Trump’s trade adviser Peter Navarro warned Brussels that it would be“making a grave mistake”if it went through with the threat, which he described as counterproductive to the talks.",

    "title": "Egypt backs Russia’s peace talks offer to Ukraine",
    "article_text": "Egypt has welcomed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s proposal to hold direct talks with Ukraine, the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced in a statement on Monday. Cairo has maintained a neutral stance on the conflict, advocating for dialogue and a diplomatic resolution. On Sunday Putin urged Kiev to resume talks that were suspended in 2022, stating that discussions could take place on May 15 in Istanbul, Türkiye, without preconditions. Egypt welcomes the“constructive diplomatic efforts”aimed at resolving the conflict“peacefully,”the country’s foreign ministry’s statement said. Ukraine, with the backing of several West European states, has demanded that Russia agree to a ceasefire first as a precondition for talks. The Kremlin has rejected what it described as an ultimatum. Following calls by US President Donald Trump for Kiev to“immediately”accept the Putin’s proposal for direct unconditional talks, Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky said he would be“personally”waiting for the Russian president in Türkiye on Thursday. However, he insisted that Kiev still expects“a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow [Monday], to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy.” Moscow has maintained it seeks a permanent solution rather than a temporary one. It has rejected Kiev’s truce demand, claiming that Ukraine would use the pause to rearm and regroup its military. Putin accused Kiev of violating the three previous ceasefires offered by Moscow: the 30-day US-brokered moratorium on strikes against energy infrastructure, which expired last month, the unconditional Easter ceasefire, and the recently-lapsed 72-hour Victory Day ceasefire. Asked on Monday about the latest developments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow remained committed to“resuming direct talks in Istanbul without any preconditions.” Putin’s peace talks proposal has also been welcomed by several other countries, including China, which called for a“fair, lasting, binding peace agreement”through negotiations.Vietnam and Venezuela have also voiced their support, with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro saying the sentiment was shared by the“majority of the governments and people of Latin America and the Caribbean.”",

Trump delivered the remarks during a press conference on Monday, describing the proposed meeting in Istanbul, Türkiye, as“very important.”He even floated the possibility that he might participate in the negotiations. “I think you may have a good result at the Thursday meeting in Türkiye between Russia and Ukraine. I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over. I don’t know where I’m going to be on Thursday, I’ve got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there,”Trump stated.

    "title": "Ukrainian diplomat sentenced over ‘kill Russians’ remark",
    "article_text": "A Moscow court has sentenced a former Ukrainian ambassador to Kazakhstan, Pyotr Vrublevsky, to six years in prison in absentia over his call for the mass killing of Russians. Vrublevsky was found guilty of committing“acts aimed at inciting hatred and enmity”against a group of people“based on nationality…with the threat of violence,”according to the Basmanny District Court's press service. The charges stem from an August 2022 interview in which Vrublevsky stated that Ukraine was trying to“kill as many Russians as possible.” “The more Russians we kill now, the fewer our children will have to,”the diplomat told a local blogger in Kazakhstan six months after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict. His remarks sparked outrage both among the Russian community in the Central Asian country and in Russia. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram at the time that“only an ambassador of a terrorist regime can say such things.” Kazakh officials condemned his words as incitement of ethnic hatred and inappropriate for a diplomat. In September 2022, Astana stated that Vrublevsky had apologized for his remarks and subsequently went on vacation. Last year, Russian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Vrublevsky, placing him on both federal and international wanted lists, as well as adding him to the country’s registry of terrorists and extremists. The ruling on Monday effectively upholds a similar decision made by a Moscow court last August that was subsequently overturned by a higher court due to irregularities. The case was then sent to be reviewed again. Vrublevsky was fired from his post in Kazakhstan in October 2022. His whereabouts are currently unknown as he has not made any public appearances since his dismissal.",

    "article_text": "US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has issued a directive ordering all military service academies to stop considering diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) criteria in admissions decisions. The memo, signed on Friday, states that MSA admission offices will no longer be able to apply any“considerations of race, ethnicity or sex”when considering applicants and must base their decisions“exclusively on merit.” Academies have 30 days to adhere to the new standards. Additionally, merit-based scores may also consider“unique athletic talent”or other experiences such as prior military service and performance at a MSA preparatory school.“This ensures only the most qualified candidates are admitted, trained and ultimately commissioned to lead,”Hegseth wrote in the order, adding that“selecting anyone but the best erodes lethality, our warfighting readiness and undercuts the culture of excellence in our Armed Forces.” In a separate memo issued on Friday and seen by the Associated Press, Hegseth also ordered military leaders and commanders at the Pentagon to go through their libraries and remove all books related to DEI issues. The document reportedly stated that educational materials at libraries“promoting divisive concepts and gender ideology are incompatible with the Department’s core mission”and that military leaders must“promptly identify”books that are not compatible with that mission and sequester them by May 21. The reforms follow a broader campaign by the administration of President Donald Trump to remove DEI-related programs and content from the military, including books in military libraries and instruction on gender ideology. Shortly after assuming office in January, Trump signed an executive order titled ‘Prioritizing Military Excellence and Readiness’, which prohibited any race- or sex-based preferences in the armed forces. That order similarly called for all military personnel decisions, including recruitment and promotions, to reflect a merit-based framework. The directive also outright banned transgender individuals from serving in the US military and instructed the Department of Defense to identify and dismiss all service members who have a history of gender dysphoria. Last week, the US Supreme Court upheld the president’s ban.",

    "title": "Ukrainian membership of EU would drag bloc into war – Hungary",
    "article_text": "Admitting Ukraine into the EU would only prolong the hostilities between Moscow and Kiev and risk dragging the bloc into the conflict, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has warned. Ukraine, which has made EU membership a national priority, formally applied to join the bloc in February 2022, days after the escalation of the conflict with Russia. Hungary has repeatedly pushed back against the EU’s goal of admitting Ukraine by 2030 – a target recently reiterated by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. On Monday, Orban reiterated Budapest’s opposition to accession, calling it a decision that could shape the bloc’s future for the worse. “As a country neighboring Ukraine, we believe that if Ukraine is admitted to the European Union, it will mean war,”Orban told the conference of EU parliamentary speakers in Budapest. The EU has never accepted a country at war – and for“good reason,”he added. The Hungarian leader also expressed regret over the commitment of some EU leaders to continued military aid for Kiev. “We have a different view. We think the longer the war lasts, the more lives will be lost and the worse the situation will become on the battlefield,”Orban said. Ukraine still faces major hurdles on its path to joining the bloc, with full membership requiring unanimous EU approval and sweeping reforms, including anti-corruption efforts, improved governance, and legal alignment with EU standards. Orban has long opposed Ukraine’s integration into Western institutions, including NATO, arguing that its accession could escalate tensions with Russia. He suggested that the country should instead remain a“buffer”between Russia and the West. While Russia has consistently rejected the idea of Ukraine joining NATO, its position on EU accession has been more restrained. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said Ukraine has the“sovereign right”to join the bloc, provided that it remains a matter of economic integration and not military alignment. However, Russian officials have warned that the line between civilian and military in the EU is becoming blurred. Peskov has accused the bloc of actively working to prolong the Ukraine conflict by repeatedly expressing its intention to support Kiev in its desire to“continue the war.”He has also criticized Brussels for undermining peace efforts by portraying Russia as the bloc’s primary adversary. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has stated that the EU is“becoming militarized at a record pace,”adding that there is now“very little difference”between the EU and NATO.",

Vietnam has consistently backed the idea to settle the conflict between Russia and Ukraine through diplomacy, she said, and approves of the latest talks proposal made by the Russian president, the spokeswoman stated during a press conference on Monday. “We welcome the recent proposal made on May 11 by Russian President Vladimir Putin to resume direct negotiations with Ukraine,”the spokeswoman stated. Early on Sunday, the Russian president proposed that“the Kiev authorities resume the negotiations they interrupted in 2022”without any preconditions, on May 15 in Istanbul, Türkiye. Putin made the remarks while addressing the media at the conclusion of celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, during which Moscow hosted numerous foreign leaders and dignitaries.

Kiev somewhat shifted its stance following Trump’s remarks, as Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky claimed he was actually ready to meet Putin in person in Istanbul.

    "title": "UK proposes stricter immigration rules",
    "article_text": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled plans to reduce immigration as sentiment in the country turns against the influx of foreigners. The new measures, detailed in a government white paper published on Monday, include extending the residency requirement for citizenship from five to ten years, raising English language proficiency standards, lifting the skilled worker threshold, and ending overseas recruitment for social care roles. “My government will take back control of our borders,”Starmer wrote on X. The issue ranks as one of the top concerns for the British public, alongside the state of the national healthcare system (NHS), an Ipsos poll found earlier this year. Immigration has surged since 2004, when the UK, then part of the EU, opened its labor market to arrivals from the bloc’s Eastern European members such as Poland. In 2016, widespread frustration over the government’s inability to control the influx of migrants from the EU played a big role in Britain’s vote to leave the bloc. Brexit, however, failed to solve the issue as net migration almost quadrupled between 2019 and 2023. Critics have pointed out that Starmer, previously a staunch anti-Brexit advocate, has now adopted the language of the pro-Brexit campaign. They argue that Labour’s tough new approach on immigration is an attempt to outflank the Reform UK party. Green Party co-chair Carla Denyer has accused Starmer of impersonating Reform leader Nigel Farage, adding this“won’t save him from wipeout at the hands”of the right-wing party. Reform has surged in influence in recent years, capitalizing on anti-immigration sentiment and frustration over economic stagnation. It has also positioned itself as a challenger to the traditional two-party system. In the 2024 general election, Reform secured five parliamentary seats and 14.3% of the national vote. In local elections earlier this month it won 677 council seats out of a total of 1,641, gained control of ten councils, and claimed two mayoralties. Reform’s rise comes amid a wider rise of anti-immigration and Euro-sceptic sentiment in Europe. Right-wing parties are now part of governing coalitions in several EU countries, including Italy, Finland, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, and the Czech Republic.",

    "title": "Got coke? Just cope: Macron’s Ukraine trip was powered by drug-like delusion",
    "article_text": "A brief scandal erupted last weekend during a visit to Ukraine by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, when a couple of ‘suspicious’ objects they were handling were speculated to be drugs and drug paraphernalia. They almost certainly were not, so let’s cut Macron some slack. He did hop on the official Elysee Palace social media account to clarify that,non, he wasnotdoing rails while riding the rails to Ukraine alongside Merz and Starmer. They weren’t on drugs – just on good old-fashioned EU unity. Which, to be fair, seems to induce an equally brain-cell-crushing delirium. “When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation goes so far as to make a simple tissue look like drugs,”read the post. So, Macron suggests, it wasn’t a party starter on the table, just the world’s most suspiciously placed tissue – alongside what appeared to be an unfortunately shaped spoon. And anyone suggesting otherwise is just spreading fake news. The press walked in, the photo went up, and the internet did what it does. But the real dodginess started after they disembarked and got to work in Ukraine – presumably with clearer sinuses. But not from any drugs. Perhaps just from the sinus-blasting“industrial amounts”of Dior Eau Sauvage cologne that Macron is known for wearing, as Le Parisien’s Olivier Beaumont recentlydescribed it.Or not. If they aren’t actually high, they’re sure acting like it. Finally, with Russian President Vladimir Putin proposing direct talks between Moscow and Kiev in Türkiye starting this week, there’s finally a chance on the table to put an end to this conflict, something that the entire world has been demanding – EU leaders included. As far back as May 2022, Macron and recently-former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz spent 80 minutes on the phone with Putin andinsistedon“direct, serious negotiations”with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky. But now suddenly the EU is all like,“Well, no, sorry. That doesn’t work for us.”Hey guys, does your unity come in powdered form now? Okay, so what changed? Well, nothing, really. Other than the fact that a bunch of European leaders just did a big powwow with Zelensky in Kiev – a photo shoot to show them all rallying around their boy. Maybe so he also didn’t get too triggered during Moscow’s big Victory Day parade against the World War 2 Nazis and start tossing toys out of the pram. They emerged with a big demand: that Russia accept a 30-day ceasefire or else. Or else what? They’ll unleash epic sanctions. And no doubt even more epic grandstanding. Because that’s totally worked so far. So it looks like they can’t have Ukraine doing direct peace talks now because that would mean that they wouldn’t get to stage their new little script that they just came up with.“There can be no negotiations while weapons are speaking. There can be no dialogue if, at the same time, civilians are being bombed. A ceasefire is needed now, so that talks can begin. For peace,”Macronsaid. So Macron apparently sees himself as the director of this whole charade. If that’s the case, then he might want to start by making sure Zelensky doesn’t have his pants on backwards. It kind of looked like that was the case. Although perhaps he’s just starting a new line of pants with the fly in the back to go with the sweatshirts he wears when he visits world leaders to beg for money. With Macron directing, it also looks like Germany is doing the filming and the musical score, andposteda cringey video of their bromance show to Merz’s social media account. So, Director Macron says, first there needs to be the ceasefire – which Moscow said Ukraine couldn’t even respect for the three days that one was in place over the Victory Day holiday, let alone for a whole month. Then after that come the talks, Macron insists. The French foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, alsosaidon French radiothat the EU representatives want to be present for any direct peace talks in Istanbul. Because apparently Zelensky is like a college kid who can’t go on a job interview or a date without his helicopter parents hovering around. Merz was also saying, yes, yes, first the weapons“must be silenced.”Then, he says, they can“create space for talks.”Then maybe comes the“just and lasting peace.”Is Germany doing the choreography for this charade, too? You sure you don’t want an intermission or two in there, as well? Maybe some champagne and snack breaks out in the lobby? As for Zelensky, he’s now justparrotingthe Europeans about the offer to negotiate being a“positive sign that the Russians have finally begun to consider ending the war.”But he also said that he needed to know by Monday whether they’re going to do the 30-day ceasefire. Because they have to get their show on the road, I guess – so they can begin the official countdown to more sanctions and grandstanding. But get this. For once, it seems like the US and Venezuela actually agree on something. That’s huge unto itself – the geopolitical equivalent of pigs flying… first class. And the thing on which they both agree just happens to be the need for these direct peace talks. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has said that“we must embark on a peaceful path… Russia has the right to peace.”Trump said on Truth Social that Putin’s proposal represented a“potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine! Think of the hundreds and thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending ‘bloodbath’ hopefully comes to an end.”Trump also underscored that Putin“doesn’t want to have a ceasefire agreement with Ukraine, but rather wants to meet on Thursday, in Turkey”and that“Ukraine should agree to this immediately.” So it looks like peace is finally on the table in a major way, with this new development. But apparently the EU needs some time for its own center-stage sermon and limelight-hogging monologue first. Probably to send as their official entry to the Nobel Peace Prize committee for when peace manages to break out despite their best efforts. Priorities, priorities.",

    "title": "Trump rejects criticism over being gifted a Qatari jet",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has lashed out at Democratic lawmakers who condemned his plans to accept a luxury Boeing jet from Qatar. In a post on his Truth Social platform Trump stated on Monday that the Defense Department was receiving a 747 aircraft“as a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE”to temporarily replace the aging Air Force One, calling it a“very public and transparent transaction.” He claimed that the arrangement upset what he described as“Crooked Democrats,”who, according to the president, insisted the government pay“TOP DOLLAR”for the plane instead. Trump dismissed the deal’s complexity, saying:“Anybody can do that! The Dems are World Class Losers!!!” The US president is set to receive a super-luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family. ABC News first reported the pending aircraft deal ahead of his upcoming Middle East trip. The gift is expected to be officially announced this week, sources told the outlet. Valued at around $400 million, the plane, popularly known as the“flying palace,”could become the most expensive gift ever given to the US by a foreign government. Trump previously toured a Qatari-owned aircraft of the same model in February at Palm Beach International Airport. Trump is set to visit Qatar during a trip to the Middle East this week. Qatari officials told The Hill the plane would not be handed over during the upcoming trip. While the White House declined to confirm details, the president stated that the Defense Department would receive the gifted aircraft, which is expected to be refurbished into the new Air Force One. White House and DOJ lawyers reportedly determined that the gift is legal and does not violate bribery laws or the Constitution’s foreign gift ban. However, reports of the gifted plane drew sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who accused Trump of using the presidency for personal gain. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, labeled the deal“a grift.” “Trump must seek Congress’ consent to take this $300 million gift from Qatar. The Constitution is perfectly clear: no present ‘of any kind whatever’ from a foreign state without Congressional permission. A gift you use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift),”Raskin wrote in a post on X. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to confirm details of the deal but said:“Any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws,”according to Reuters. The White House’s current Boeing 747-200 jets, in service since the early 1990s, have faced ongoing technical issues, prompting a longstanding effort to replace them. A Boeing contract for two new Air Force One planes based on the 747-8 has been plagued by delays and rising costs, pushing delivery from the original 2024 target to as late as 2027 or 2028.",

    "article_text": "Senior EU officials, such as foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, represent a“tragedy”for the bloc, Slovak MEP Lubos Blaha has told RT. Blaha also accused top officials in Brussels of supporting fascism. The MEP’s remarks come after Brussels criticized Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico’s attendance at Russia’s May 9 Victory Day celebrations in Moscow last week. Kallas warned EU officials and candidate countries against taking part in the event, urging them to travel to Kiev instead. Other EU officials warned that candidate states such as Serbia would have their status renewed if their leaders attended the celebrations in Russia. According to Blaha, the criticism directed at Fico and other leaders, such as Serbia’s Aleksandar Vucic, wasn’t genuinely about the conflict in Ukraine.“The real truth is different. The real truth is that their anti-fascism is pretended,”he said. Blaha used the example of this year’s ceremony in the European Parliament commemorating the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, describing it as somber. “It was like a funeral. Everyone was so sad, and in the end, Beethoven was playing,”Blaha said, noting that the same music was used by Germany broadcasts after the Battle of Stalingrad.“This is the same tradition.” “If the European Union is governed by people like Kaja Kallas, then it’s a tragedy,”he added. Kallas, who previously served as the prime minister of Estonia, has repeatedly spoken out harshly against Russia and has labeled Moscow as the EU’s primary adversary, while advocating for increased militarization of the European bloc. Her warnings to EU member states and candidate countries about attending the Moscow Victory Day celebrations were met with condemnation from Russian officials, who labeled her threats as“blackmail.” “Euro-Nazism is being reborn before our eyes,”Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in response to Kallas’ threats.“This is how the fascists 80 years ago forced those they considered ‘second-class people’ to renounce their homeland, ethnicity, and faith,”she wrote on Telegram. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has also criticized Kallas as a“rabid Russophobe,”and recently claimed that“manifestations of neo-Nazism in Europe”are“significant,”and called for extensive efforts to combat the trend. Echoing these sentiments, former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev recently claimed that neo-Nazism is on the rise in Europe. He called for a comprehensive“de-Nazification”effort not just in Ukraine, but across the entire continent.",

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU)claimedon Friday that it uncovered a Hungarian military intelligence network operating in the border Transcarpathia region – home to a significant Hungarian minority. Two Ukrainian nationals accused of spying on behalf of Budapest have been detained. On Sunday, Levente Magyar, the Hungarian parliamentary state secretary for foreign affairs, announced the cancelation of a scheduled meeting which he and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishina agreed to last month. He explained that“good-faith constructive negotiations”have become impossible following Kiev’s public allegations. Stefanishina urged continued dialogue despite the fallout. The talks were due to take place in Uzhgorod, a Ukrainian city near the Hungarian border, and were set to focus on the rights of ethnic Hungarians living in the country. In response to the espionage claims, Budapest has deported an alleged former Ukrainian spy who government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs described as“a serious threat to Hungary’s sovereignty.”He posted a video showing the arrest of the person, mirroring the SBU’s reporting of its crackdown. ‼️Yesterday evening, Hungarian counterterrorism forces (TEK) detained a Ukrainian national in downtown Budapest.

Hungary, a NATO and EU member, has often been at odds with Kiev and its Western backers regarding the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Budapest has refused to supply weapons to Kiev and has instead called for a ceasefire with Moscow, which has frustrated Ukrainian officials. Budapest also opposes Ukraine’s bids to join the EU and NATO. Among other things, it has cited Kiev’s treatment of ethnic minorities, including laws that restrict education and cultural rights in minority languages.",

    "title": "French government dismisses Macron cocaine claims",
    "article_text": "French President Emmanuel Macron’s office has denied claims that he had a bag of cocaine with him during his weekend visit to Ukraine after social media users spotted what looked like the substance in a viral video. In footage circulating on social media, Macron, Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer are seen posing for a photo while on a train to Kiev. The first few seconds show Macron subtly removing a crumpled white object from the table where the three are seated, while Merz appears to cover what social media users claimed looked like a cocaine spoon with his hands. Macron is then seen putting the object in his pocket, with multiple users noting he smiles guiltily while doing so. The video has quickly gone viral and triggered widespread speculation online over whether the three officials were taking drugs during an official trip. 🚨DEVELOPING: Macron, Starmer, and Merz caught on video on their return from Kiev. A bag of white powder on the table. Macron quickly pockets it, Merz hides the spoon. No explanation given. Zelensky, known cocaine enthusiast, had just hosted them. Connect the dots.pic.twitter.com/aROGuf06Nm On its official X account, the Elysee Palace insisted the object in Macron’s hands was a tissue. “When European unity becomes inconvenient, disinformation goes so far as to make a simple tissue look like drugs. This fake news is being spread by France’s enemies, both abroad and at home. We must remain vigilant against manipulation,”the post reads, alongside a zoomed-in screenshot of the object Macron removed. No one hides a kleenex this way ! Please… While many note that the object does appear to be a simple tissue, more skeptical users quickly pointed out that Macron’s office only addressed that specific item, not the broader question of whether drugs were present during the trip. Some claimed the tissue shown in the image posted by Macron’s office appeared computer-generated or digitally altered, fueling further speculation. Many users also noted that Macron was acting strangely during the photoshoot, with some suggesting that he“appeared stoned.” Macron, Starmer, and Merz caught on camera with cocaine after a secret meeting with Zelensky in Kiev. White powder on the table, a hidden spoon, and erratic behavior.pic.twitter.com/MCF7xobEF7 There has been no official comment on the object that Merz appeared to conceal. Some media reports suggest it could be a coffee stirrer or a toothpick, while many social media users insist it is a snuff spoon used for inhaling powdered substances. Commenting on the incident, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the video“opened the veil of the stinking Sabbath”of Western politics. “Having pushed [Ukrainian leader Vladimir] Zelensky into another hellish intrigue to disrupt the settlement and continue the bloodshed in Europe, a Frenchman, an Englishman and a German boarded the train and... got stoned, just like the joke,”Zakharova wrote on Telegram, referring to the leaders’ visit to Ukraine. Following their talks, Zelensky demanded Russia accept Kiev’s call for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire before agreeing to negotiations, which Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to start later this week in Istanbul. Moscow rejected what it described as foreign pressure surrounding the proposed truce. “The fate of Europe is decided in every sense by drug addict placeholders,”Zakharova added. She also recalled that in 2022, after the Ukraine conflict escalated, she asked a Western ambassador how they could send weapons to Kiev amid reports that Zelensky was using cocaine. The diplomat, she said, told her it was“normal”to take drugs in the EU, and that many Western leaders used cocaine. Putin’s investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev alsocommentedon the footage, writing on X that if the objects spotted by social media users are indeed drug-related,“it explains a lot of recent ideas and proposals”coming from Kiev’s Western backers.",

    "title": "Kurdish militant group ends 40-year struggle against Türkiye",
    "article_text": "The Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) has said it will disband and has ended its armed struggle against Türkiye. Ankara welcomed the move as a milestone towards a“terror-free Türkiye”but said the group must fully implement its decision. The PKK, which has waged an insurgency against Türkiye since 1984 to gain autonomy for Kurds, chose to lay down arms at a party congress in early May, but only announced the decision on Monday. In a statement, it said that the PKK has“carried the Kurdish issue to a level where it can be solved by democratic politics, and the PKK has completed its mission in that sense.” The move came after a public call in February by PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been confined in a Turkish jail on separatism charges since 1999, urging the group to dissolve and adopt nonviolent methods. At the time, Ocalan sent a letter to party members saying,“there is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit and realization of a political system.”Following the message, the PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire. Omer Celik, the spokesman for Türkiye’s ruling Justice and Development Party welcomed the decision as“an important stage in terms of the ‘terror-free Türkiye goal”. “If terrorism is completely ended, the door to a new era will open,”he added, cautioning that“this decision needs to be implemented in practice and realized in all its dimensions.”Celik also insisted that the dissolution should also apply to“all branches and extensions of the PKK and its illegal structures.” He was apparently referring to the Kurdish-led People’s Protection Units (YPG), which Ankara deems an extension of the PKK. The group, which enjoys US backing and mainly operates in Syria, has yet to comment on the PKK decision. Founded in 1978, the PKK launched an armed insurgency against the Turkish state, initially seeking independence and later autonomy and civil rights for Kurds. Ankara sought to suppress the group for decades. The conflict has killed an estimated 40,000 people, many of them civilians, and displaced hundreds of thousands in southeastern Türkiye. The group is listed as a terrorist organization by Türkiye, the US, and the EU.",

    "title": "Israel issues warning over Palestine recognition",
    "article_text": "Israel will respond to any nations who move to unilaterally recognize the state of Palestine, Foreign Minister Gideon Saar has claimed. Saar issued the warning at a joint press conference with his German counterpart, Johann Wadephul, on Sunday, following announcements by several countries of their intent to recognize Palestine. The Israeli diplomat claimed that any such unilateral moves would undermine prospects for the peace process and would compel the Jewish state to take measures in response. Palestine’s sovereignty is recognized by 147 countries, including Russia and the majority of nations in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia. However, most Western European countries, as well as Israel and the US, do not officially consider Palestine a sovereign state. Many nations have advocated for Palestinian recognition as the only way to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict, which escalated in 2023 when Israel launched a military operation in Gaza following a surprise Hamas attack. Saar claimed such initiatives were“not constructive but counterproductive”and served“as a prize for Hamas terror.” Wadephul, however, said that a two-state solution remained“the best chance for Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace, security, and dignity.” The Media Line news outlet reported on Sunday, citing unnamed diplomatic sources, that US President Donald Trump could formally recognize the state of Palestine at the upcoming Gulf-US summit in Saudi Arabia. Although US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee has denied any such plans, speculation has grown in the wake of comments Trump made earlier this month in a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Trump repeatedly hinted at“a very, very big announcement about a certain subject,”which he said would be revealed either before or during his upcoming trip to the Middle East. Last month, French President Emmanuel Macron indicated that Paris could move to recognize a Palestinian state as early as June, during a United Nations conference in New York. Russia has long advocated for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict, reaffirming its stance during a recent meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Moscow. Russia has also called for an immediate end to the violence in Gaza.",

    "article_text": "Beijing has voiced support for renewed peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. The statement follows a proposal by Russian President Vladimir Putin for negotiations to begin as early as Thursday, and an offer from Ukraine's Vladimir Zelensky to appear in person at the negotiations. Putin on Sunday urged Kiev to resume talks suspended in 2022, stating that discussions could take place in Türkiye, which Ankara has reportedly agreed to host. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said on Monday that China supports“all efforts dedicated to peace”and hopes both sides can reach a“fair, lasting, binding peace agreement acceptable to all parties”through negotiation. Lin added that Beijing has consistently called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict and would continue to play“a constructive role in defusing the crisis.” Ukraine and the European NATO members that make up the ‘coalition of the willing’ have demanded that Russia agree to a 30-day truce before any direct negotiations take place. US President Donald Trump, however, has called for Russia-Ukraine negotiations to start as soon as possible, arguing that Washington has done its part in creating the conditions for diplomacy. Moscow has expressed concern that Kiev would use a ceasefire to reconstitute its military forces before renewing hostilities. Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, who banned direct negotiations with Russia in 2022 as long as Putin remains in office, said on Sunday that he is willing to meet with the Russian leader in Istanbul if his conditions – including a 30-day truce – are met. Axios subsequently cited a senior Ukrainian official who said Zelensky will be present in Türkiye on Thursday even if Russia does not announce a ceasefire on Monday, as Kiev has demanded.",

    "title": "Trump teases ‘important and impactful’ executive order",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump is set to sign a sweeping executive order to cut prescription drug prices in America by up to 80%, in what he teased as“one of the most important and impactful”orders in the nation’s history.In a post on his Truth Social network on Sunday, Trump cryptically announced that his“next TRUTH will be one of the most important and impactful I have ever issued.”Three hours later, the president announced that he will sign“one of the most consequential Executive Orders in our Country’s history,”aimed at cutting prescription drug costs by aligning them with the lowest global prices. The signing is scheduled for 9am Monday.“I will be instituting a MOST FAVORED NATION’S POLICY whereby the United States will pay the same price as the Nation that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World,”Trump said in a follow-up post.“Prescription Drug and Pharmaceutical prices will be REDUCED, almost immediately, by 30 percent to 80 percent.”The US currently spends around $400 billion a year on prescription drugs, often paying triple what other countries do and more than any other nation, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts.Trump argued that the change will,“for the first time in many years, bring FAIRNESS TO AMERICA,”save trillions, and lower healthcare costs nationwide. “Our Country will finally be treated fairly, and our citizens Healthcare Costs will be reduced by numbers never even thought of before,”he added. The policy will affect Medicare, which insures around 70 million older Americans. During his previous term, Trump sought to cut prices for physician-administered drugs by benchmarking them against rates in peer nations with government-set pricing. The order was blocked by US courts and later rescinded by the administration of former President Joe Biden. Legal barriers to these policies were removed in 2022 when the Democrat-led Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act, granting Medicare limited negotiating powers. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, which has sued the Trump administration over similar efforts, told the Financial Times that“government price setting in any form is bad for American patients”and blamed rising costs on“middlemen in the system.”The pharmaceutical sector has also campaigned against price caps, warning they could limit innovation and reduce spending on research. Trump rejected the claims, accusing drug companies of using research costs as an excuse to overcharge consumers.“All of these costs were, and would be, for no reason whatsoever, borne by the ‘suckers’ of America, ALONE,”he said.",

    "title": "Voice from China: This is why Moscow and Beijing stand together, now more than ever",
    "article_text": "On May 9, 2025, Moscow held a grand military parade on Red Square to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory in the Great Patriotic War. Approximately 27 foreign heads of state attended the Red Square parade, highlighting Russia’s influence on the international stage and signaling a break from Western diplomatic isolation. It also reinforced Russia’s ties with friendly nations. However, the parade was not merely a response to Western sanctions and containment. More importantly, it served as a powerful historical symbol and collective memory – a tribute to the immense sacrifices made for the victory in the global anti-fascist war, and a solemn reaffirmation of that great triumph and enduring honor. At President Putin’s invitation, President Xi Jinping paid a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 and attended the Victory Day events. President Xi Jinping’s visit to Russia signals a shared commitment by China and Russia to promote an accurate understanding of World War II history, defend the post-war international order centered on the United Nations, and uphold the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. At the bilateral level, the two countries will continue to deepen their partnership through high-level exchanges, using the stability of their relationship to offset global uncertainty and advancing strategic coordination to safeguard international fairness and justice. Eighty years ago, China and the Soviet Union fought side by side in the World Anti-Fascist War (World War II), forging a deep friendship through shared sacrifice. At this year’s military parade, President Putin praised the Chinese people’s significant contributions to the victory. In a signed article in Rossiyskaya Gazeta, President Xi Jinping also emphasized the decisive roles played by both countries. Today, Western countries manipulate ideology through historical nihilism, double standards, and discursive reconstruction, deliberately downplaying, distorting, or even rewriting the historical contributions of China and the Soviet Union in World War II. By reshaping the narrative, they seek to undermine the foundations of the post-war international order and perpetuate their global dominance. Against this backdrop, the renewed call by the Chinese and Russian leaders to“jointly uphold a correct view of WWII history”serves as a powerful rebuke to historical revisionism and falsification. It reflects a shared strategic resolve to break the West’s monopoly on historical discourse and to defend international justice and collective memory. This is not only a shared responsibility to safeguard historical truth, but also a deep convergence between China and Russia in promoting the democratization of international relations, building a fair and equitable global order, and opposing unilateral hegemony. On May 8, China and Russia signed a series of cooperation documents, including two major joint statements. The first focuses on further deepening the China-Russia comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for the new era; the second is a joint statement on global strategic stability. In addition, the two heads of state witnessed the exchange of multiple cooperation agreements in areas such as education, investment, culture, and science and technology. These documents not only ensure the continuity and stability of bilateral ties at the strategic level, but also reflect the steady deepening of practical cooperation across key sectors. The 'Joint Statement on Further Deepening the China-Russia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership of Coordination for the New Era' not only reaffirms the two countries’ firm commitment to safeguarding the international system with the United Nations at its core and the international order based on international law, but also elevates the promotion of a correct view of World War II history to a strategic element of institutionalized bilateral cooperation. Key measures include jointly organizing commemorative events, conducting research and exhibitions on the crimes of Nazi Germany and Japanese militarism, locating the remains of fallen soldiers, restoring memorial sites, and deepening cooperation on WWII historical memory in education, archives, media, and youth exchanges. The 'Joint Statement on Maintaining Global Strategic Stability' reaffirms the two countries’ consistent stance on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, safeguarding the international arms control and disarmament system, and more. It also systematically establishes a comprehensive dialogue and cooperation framework that includes nuclear security, strategic deterrence balance, and governance of militarization of emerging technologies. Notably, this statement marks the first time that biological security, chemical weapons control, and military ethics in artificial intelligence have been included in the global strategic stability agenda, signaling a significant breakthrough for China and Russia in shaping a new international security paradigm for the future. At the bilateral cooperation level, President Xi Jinping and President Vladimir Putin witnessed the exchange of 28 cooperation documents between China and Russia, covering areas such as trade, biosafety, investment protection, digital economy, scientific facilities, quarantine, media, film, and youth exchanges. This broad agenda strengthens traditional sectors like energy and trade, while strategically positioning both countries in emerging fields like digital economy and scientific innovation, and deepening people-to-people ties through cultural, educational, and youth cooperation. Amid unprecedented global changes, the trajectory of China-Russia relations continues to attract international attention. Some speculate about a formal alliance or potential rifts due to diverging interests. In response, China and Russia have demonstrated through deepening cooperation that they are building a new type of major-country relationship based on“highest mutual trust, coordination, and strategic value.”As President Xi has emphasized, their relationship is driven by clear historical logic, strong internal momentum, and shared civilizational heritage, not aimed at or influenced by any third party. History is not only a repository of memories of the past, but also serves as the foundational basis for contemporary international relations, shaping value identities and acting as the spiritual pillar for a fair and just international order. The outcomes of World War II crystallized into the cornerstone of multilateralism, with the United Nations at its core, establishing the fundamental principles that govern modern international relations. These principles, derived from the collective sacrifices of the war, have provided a framework for diplomacy, conflict resolution, and global cooperation. As the world faces new challenges, the importance of these historical lessons becomes increasingly evident – reminding us that the stability of the global order rests on our ability to respect shared values, adhere to international norms, and safeguard the multilateral system. In this context, the victory in WWII is not just a historical event, but an enduring legacy that continues to shape global governance and the international system. As the renowned Russian historian Vasily Klyuchevsky once said,“Those who refuse to learn from history will ultimately pay a heavy price for their ignorance and arrogance.”China also has a saying:“Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it.”The significance of history lies in guiding us forward. Upholding the achievements of WWII and safeguarding the international system centered on the United Nations is a shared responsibility and mission for both China and Russia.",

    "article_text": "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has rejected a key US demand to dismantle his country’s nuclear infrastructure, during the latest talks in Oman. He insisted that Iran’s nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes only. Addressing a cabinet meeting on Sunday, Pezeshkian said Tehran is“serious”in its renewed engagement with Washington.“We are negotiating [seriously] because we desire peace.” However, he dismissed the US demand regarding nuclear infrastructure, calling it“unacceptable,”while stressing that Iran“will continue to pursue these peaceful activities in a powerful manner.” Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reported progress in the negotiations with the US in Muscat, Oman, noting that the sides have reached“a better understanding.” “The fourth round of discussions was much more serious and candid than the previous three rounds,”Araghchi told reporters.“We’ve moved beyond generalities and started dealing with more detailed issues,”he said, calling the talks“constructive.” Araghchi stressed that uranium enrichment and the removal of sanctions are central to Iran’s position.“From our point of view, enrichment is an issue that must definitely continue, and there is absolutely no room for compromise there,”he stated. He added, however, that the level and scale could be subject to certain limitations for“confidence-building purposes.” The US and its allies have expressed concern about Iran’s enrichment activities, which they fear could provide the country with a head start to quickly produce weapons-grade uranium. Tehran has repeatedly dismissed the allegations that it is seeking to create a nuclear bomb. Commenting on the talks, an unnamed senior US official told CNN that the discussions“were again both direct and indirect”and that Washington“was encouraged by today’s outcome and looks forward to their next meeting, which will happen in the near future.”He added that the sides are now expected to focus on“technical elements.” The US unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal just three years later. US President Donald Trump argued that it did nothing to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. The agreement focused on easing sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.",

    "title": "18 Best Beard Trimmer Picks, Tested by GQ Editors in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Every guy needs the best beard trimmer for his situation. Whether he grows itpatchy, keeps itperma-stubbled, or is as lustrousas the A-List beards, a trimmer is mandatory in everybeard kit. And not all beard trimmers are alike, which is why the best one for yourfacial hair stylemay be different from the next guy’s. I tested a bunch ofbeardtrimmers to deliver you a real who’s who ofmen’s grooming devices. This list reflects a range of options—some multitaskers, some detailers; some top-shelf, some a better buy for lower budgets. Above all, though, I ask you this: Make sure that the device you choose allows yourbeardto reach its full potential. That doesn’t mean you need abig bushy beard, but rather, you should be able to achieve whichever style (or a suite of styles) you want to wear over the next few years—which is the minimum amount of time any of thesedevicesshould last. Ideally, they’ll hum on for 5-10 years, anyhow. Here are the bestbeardtrimmers, after I tested pretty much every last one of them. (And while you’re at it, consider my rosters of other grooming tools, fromrazorsandelectric shavers, tomanscapersandhair clippers.) Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart No sense in burying the headline: Philips Norelco’s Multigroom 9000 Series is, hands down, the best beard trimmer you can buy. And that’s before factoring in how much more it can do than just keep your facial hair in check than other electricrazorsthat are found in your everyday grooming kit. (It’s also recently been renamed the “All-in-One 9000” but answers to both names.) For the last 5 or 6 years, this has been my single go-to trimmer. Everything else is trying to dethrone it, and so far, no true contest has emerged. In terms of customization and power, this device checks all of the boxes. It all starts with the beating heart: \"The Multigroom does not compromise on power or battery life, and it's very intuitive to use,\" saysFellow Barber’s Head of Education Emily Clark. The battery life truly over-delivers: your mileage may vary since Philips Norelco only claims a (still impressive) six hours of charge, but I got a ridiculous 17 hours of consecutive runtime fresh out of the box, thanks to a lithium ion battery. Speaking of the box, there’s a lot in there, all of it useful. Between the small tooth-like detail attachment and foil shaving head, the Multigroom 9000 makes it easy to style and sculpt with precision. One trimmer even adjusts by tenths of a millimeter to help you get the perfectdesigner stubble, if that's your aim. And that’s just itsbeardtrimming bona fides. The Multigroom 9000 is also a solid hair trimmer (shout out to that brawny motor and battery again) andbody hair trimmeras well. Covering off for three products, and doing it well, suddenly makes the $90 price tag look like a deal. Long-term testing notes:Wouldn’t you know it… I lost the beloved little shaver on this one recently. Heartbreak. (Yeah, I can test a new one, but I realize now how much of my love for it is pinned on that micro shaving attachment.) I stand by the fact that it’s the best on the market, but without that shaver, the window has opened for me to spend time with other devices, like the Braun below. Let this be a lesson: Don’t unpack your Philips Norelco all-in-one in a hotel room without carefully auditing every single piece when you pack it up again. Specs Number of tools and accessories:21, including nose and hair trimmer, detailer, body trimmer|Run time:6 hours| Charge time:3 hours|Trimming lengths:0.5-16mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:8 years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"This trimmer is great! It comes with so many attachments to use for your trimming needs. The battery lasts a long time, i have yet to have to charge mine and i've had it for a few months now. The trimmer is super quiet as well as very well made. It's all made up of metal, not plastic, and feels like it will last a long time. It's fairly lightweight and easy to handle when [using] it. It also comes with a small cleaning brush that makes cleaning it up a breeze!\" Philips Norelco Amazon Walmart Given how much I love the Philips Norelco Multigroom 9000, it’s no surprise that the more affordable model, the Multigroom 5000, is my budget choice to keep things manscaped. It offers most of the same steel-bladed precision and customization benefits as its fancier family member, albeit in a less durable body (plastic instead of stainless steel) and half the battery life. Still, its a three-hour battery power beast that bests many beard trimmers twice the price. And the lighter plastic body is nice for travel. The Philips Norelco Multigroom 5000 is great for anyone on a budget, but it’s not “budget.\" Whereas other lower-pricedbeardtrimmers can’t handle precise detailing, the Multigroom 5000 includes a detail trimmer and nose trimmer, not to mention hair clipper and body trimmer guards for versatility. It does lack the shaving detailer and the body shaver (as does the in-between 7000 model), which is important to note if you wantthatlevel of customization and don’t otherwise own a detail shaver that you also rely upon for bare-faced stretches of facial real estate. For this reason, I find it a little less perfect across the board compared to the 9000, but the price-to-precision ratio is hard to match. And if you want a great value above all—and a straightforward beard trimmer—meet your optimal Multigroom, the 5000. Long-term testing notes:Recently, I used the 5000 consistently, and got quite cozy with it. Sure, it lacked the key shaving features of the 9000, but I think this is truly the best value device in the game when you only want a trimmer. Terrific muscle, terrific customization, great endurance. Five stars for this one. Specs Number of tools and accessories:18 including beard trimmer, nose and hair trimmer, detailer, body trimmer| Run time:3 hours| Charge time:70 minutes| Trimming lengths:0.5-16mm |Waterproof:Yes| Warranty:5 years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"This Phillips/Norelco trimmer works great. It is very quiet, the battery life is pretty long and it does exactly what I need it to do. It comes with a lot of attachments - haven’t used them all, but the ones I have used worked just fine. This is a good quality trimmer.\" Hatteker Amazon Walmart Hatteker is a surprise of a buy—it’s that “out of left field” Amazon brand that most of us recognize by name, despite not knowing anyone who uses it. This all-in-one kit covers every kind of hair-trimming task, from lineups to sideburns to beards, eyebrows, and body hair. What's more, its a hair cutting machine for full beards and stubble alike with multiple plastic guards. I bought the tool with little expectations for quality and care, but was consistently surprised at how well it held its own compared to the more reputable brands. This device won’t win any design awards and certainly hasn’t reinvented the wheel, but most consumers won’t care about that stuff; they want a good beard trimmer that meets all their grooming needs, and Hatteker’s checks all of those boxes. I do wish its detailing trimmer was a bit narrower, but that’s me minding some very fine details. It’s also not up to the same quality as, say, Philips, Andis, Braun, Wahl, etc, but it’s also not low quality either. For $40, you get your money’s worth, especially considering that LED battery display and vast range of trimming lengths and clipping attachments. It’s still a great option if you’re not looking to spend a lot, or if our other best value winner, the Philips Norelco Multigroom 5000 Series, is out of stock. Long-term testing notes:Every time I bring this one out, I am amused by how surprisingly great it is. It goes to show that those Amazon reviews really are one of the most accurate depictions of value; I long wrote the brand off because of its non-image compared to the big names, but in terms of performance and return on spend, Hatteker really clears the bar. Granted, I’m not using most of these devices more than a few times a quarter (since by and large I stick with my own favorites or test new ones) but my Hatteker remains strong and sturdy and has endurance, some three years after I first acquired it. Specs Number of tools and accessories:5 trimming and clipping heads with various guards| Run time:90 minutes| Charge time:90 minutes| Trimming lengths:0.5-10mm, 12, 14, 16mm| Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:none What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"The trimmer is easy to use and the charge lasts a very long time. I have not had to recharge since the initial charge after taking it out of the box, trimming bi-weekly. It is not heavy. It’s easy to handle. They adjustment guides stay where you select. I don’t worry about them shifting during use. Beard maintenance is an easy job with this.” Braun Braun Tested by Adam Hurly, Video by Tyler Chin Like the Philips Norelco Multigroom models, Braun's All-in-One Trimmer Series 9 is a jack-of-all-trades option that can do far more than tidy up your beard; the box is packed with anoseand ear trimmer, a precision head, and longer guards, too. But what separates this trimmer from the rest of the pack is the built-in dial that offers 40 trim-length settings. It’s top-notch precision in minimalist packaging. I think it’s the only real contender for the top spot on this list—perhaps that price and slightly less enduring battery are its shortcomings compared to the Philips Norelco 9000, but I do find it a superior device in terms of ease and design. Where other devices require you to swap out different heads or attachments, or ask you to pick between bigger length gaps than you’d prefer, Braun’s Series 9 offers half-millimeter increments from 0.5 to 20 without having to futz with extra accessories. In my testing, that made the trimmer the most user-friendly device on this list—no swapping guards as you fade your beard or neckline. Plus, the Series 9 is fully waterproof for those of you shaving-in-the-shower fans looking to speedrun your morning regimen. (And I’ll admit, shaving in the shower certainly makes clean-up—of both the beard hair mess and the trimmer—faster and easier.) Bottom line, Braun’s All-in-One Trimmer Series 9 is exactly what the name promises. If it seems a little expensive, that’s because a beard trimmer that can handle all these tasks, and handle them well, isn’t cheap. Long-term testing notes:Like I said above, this one has been getting lots more mileage from me lately, and I am so pleased with that fact. I absolutely adore how easy it is to navigate between the smallest minutiae of trimming lengths without swapping guard heads, and that detail shaver has been so clutch at keeping my neckline, cheeks, and beard perimeter cleaned up. My one complaint from a recent trip was that it’s quite difficult to repack everything into the carrying case, if you bring along all attachment heads. Besides that… perfect grooming tool. Specs Number of tools and accessories:13 including a mini foil shaver, body trimmer, T-blade and adjustable beard comb|Run time:3 hours| Charge time:2.5 hours |Trimming lengths:0.5-20mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:2 Years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “Before this trimmer came into my life, I made a couple of cheap purchases. The style I like it's 1mm overall with a 2mm on my chin and 2.5 on my mustache. The problem was the other trimmers could not handle it on a daily basis. I am the type of guy whose beard grows back really fast, so I'd trim my beard. Then, the next day, you could see clear growth, and when I tried to do it again, it just wouldn't trim the same. I'd end up hurting my face a little bit. Not this trimmer. This trimmer can handle my beard on a daily basis without hurting my face. It's that good and efficient. It's built for heavy performance and durability. For the first time I am able to maintain my beard on a daily basis.” Wahl Amazon Walmart Wahl is a pedigreed name in the professional and home grooming worlds, but that doesn’t mean it’s done innovating. Its new High Visibility trimmer has a killer app: the trimming attachment is angled so the teeth sit “above” the base, letting you get eyes on the action in the mirror as you mow through facial hair. It’s maybe not a priority if you’re just doing leisurely trims, but if you’re trying to get the perfect line at your cheek, sideburns, or neck, that little bit of offset is a godsend. Suddenly I’m seeing very clearly exactly where the blade is hitting. If you’ve ever had to drop that cheek line too far down or do the back-and-forth thing with your burns, you’ll recognize what a game changer this is. The Wahl High Visibility trimmer’s laser-pointer precision is boosted by some of the best ergonomics in the game. The body’s relatively thin with an excellent rubber grip, which lets you hit difficult angles like a professional pool player. The High Visibility trimmer is new to the market, but I’m betting it’ll become a barber favorite—and yours, too, if you’re doing daily touch-ups to keep those lines looking sharp. Long-term testing notes:I find myself using this more often as a detail trimmer than a full-on trimmer—probably most comparable to the Andis Slimline on this list. I think it’s a fantastic trimmer through and through, but I pull it from the bullpen as a closer; that’s where I hold it mostly in my mind—and happily! Specs Number of tools and accessories:13 including an exposed T-blade for error-proof cleanups, plus a swappable nose hair trimmer and dual foil shaver|Run time:Up to 2 hours| Charge time:2 hour charge time |Trimming lengths:1.5-13mm |Waterproof:Yes| Warranty:5 years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"Absolutely amazing product. Heavy, rock-solid construction makes the hand feel confident, has great ergonomics, and has a solid grip even when the hand is soapy. But the best part is the forever blade makes it easy to see what’s getting cut, even with guard on (I used the 2). Most precise edge for a jawbone line beard I’ve ever had. And with the guard, it combs as it cuts with the grain of the hair, keeping stray whiskers knocked down. I’ve been pinched/cut before with fatter spaced blade rakes, but I didn’t feel threatened trimming under the nose.\" Remington Amazon Walmart Vacuum trimmers keep you from having dozens of errant clippings dropped amongst your sink-ledge grooming products. But this one is more than just a vacuum—it has a detailing and edgework attachment and can trim up to 18 mm with a line-drawing detail head that rivals most T-blade trimmers. While it feels noticeably less sturdy and powerful than the others on this list, Remington's trimmer has no performance issues and even holds a decent 90-minute runtime. While this may be the last significant vacuum trimmer left standing, it is for good reason: Remington's trimmer saves you tons of time and stress by sucking up the majority of your facial hair shearings—up to 95% of clippings, according to the brand (I'd posit it's more like 85%, but hey, that's still a huge win). To me, it’s the obvious choice if your roommate or s/o constantly complains about clippings on the sink ledge, no matter how much you try to clean up after the fact. Perhaps Remington’s device can actually save your relationship? That’s a stretch, but it would make for a not-too-passive-aggressive gift from said s/o to the bearded fellow in question. Long-term testing notes:My one-time favorite trimmer was a vacuum device from Philips Norelco, which they discontinued. And for a long time, I was crushed, because I so loved that one. I thought that Remington would be my new mainstay, and as much as I really like it, I just don’t get the same mileage out of it as that previous PN model. I can’t say why; it certainly checks all the same boxes and I find it extremely customizable and easy to clean up. I don’t mean to do them a disservice here, but I think the competition has grown stiffer in the past five or so years, which might also explain the dearth of vacuum options. Still, I stand by the fact that this is a great device, and delivers on its promises. Specs Number of tools and accessories:1 adjustable comb|Run time:1.5 hours| Charge time:1.5 hours |Trimming lengths:2-18mm |Warranty:60 days| Waterproof:Yes What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying \"This is fantastic. Over the years I have gone through many different kinds and even a few other brands that offer a vacuum function but this one is by far the best. The edger works great. The attachments are also very sturdy. I charge it maybe every two weeks or more and I use it just about every day. Easy to empty out, and it grabs a good amount of the hair so it’s not a big mess to clean ups. I absolutely recommend getting this.” MANSCAPED Amazon No attachments; no problem. For a beard trimmer that can only do one thing (but is damn good at doing that), Manscaped's Beard Hedger will make light work out of the bushiest, burliest beards. Its zoom wheel controller lets you dial in the comb's length between .5 and 10 millimeters for even shaves, while the waterproof construction means you can shower and shave to save time on your morning or nighttime rituals. The built-in comb is great for picking up hairs that are stuck to your face so that every strand gets whacked, because few things are more unsightly than stray long hairs poking out from an otherwise well-groomed beard. Specs Number of tools and accessories:None|Run time:60 minutes|Trimming lengths:0.5-10 mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:90 days What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “I've owned maybe 5 or 6 beard trimmers over the last 15 years. Make no mistake, this is the most expensive, but hands down it's also the best (that includes competition from Braun, Philips Norelco and Wahl). The quality is the first thing you notice as soon as you unbox it - the feel of the handle and the quality of the blade, even down to the USB charging cable which doesn't have the usual cheapness you'd expect from an accessory that's something of an afterthought.” Bevel Amazon Tested by Timothy Beck Werth If you’re researching beard trimmers, you’ll see the term “zero-gap” a lot. So, what’s a zero-gap trimmer? A zero-gap trimmer cuts as close to the skin as possible, effectively a 0mm cutting length. That can make them dangerous for novices, as you can easily cut your skin or ears while you trim. But for the highest possible level of precision, that’s what you want. (The Bevel Trimmer can also be adjusted so it has a slightly longer taper.) This trimmer was designed by Black men, for Black men, and damn does it look good. It’s a work of art that design lovers will appreciate. This sculptural device will look mighty impressive on your bathroom counter and feels phenomenal in your hand. It’s a true barber-quality trimmer, perfect for guys with curly or Afro-textured hair. It’s also one of the most powerful trimmers for home use, with a 6,000 RPM motor. Despite that, it beats all comers in terms of battery life, with an 8-hour charge that will last for months. A word of warning: This trimmer doesn’t come with any attachments or comb guards. That’s by design, as it’s a precision trimmer for making clean lines and shaping up longer beards. If you want to cut precise hair lengths, opt for theBevel Trimmer Proor purchase extra attachments like theT-Blade. Specs Number of tools and accessories:None|Run time:8 hours| Motor power:6,000 RPM |Trimming lengths:Zero gap (0 to 2.5 mm) |Waterproof:No |Warranty:1 Year Philips Norelco Amazon A lot of grooming brands tout the number of accessories that come with their trimmer as a major selling point. The Braun Series 9 trimmer comes with 13 tools (whereas the Braun Series 7 has a measly 12). Philips Norelco brags about the 21 accessories that come with the MultiGroom 9000. And with the Panasonic MultiShape, the long list of accessories is the whole point of the device. But to be honest, keeping track of dozens of accessories can be a major pain in the ass. (Maybe that’s because I have a dozen beard trimmers in my apartment at any given time.) But if you want to trim your beard without breaking out an entire tacklebox full of blades and comb guards, then theSeries 9000will be a godsend. It’s the best beard trimmer with an adjustable dial, and it couldn’t be easier to use. A few clicks of the dial expands the length setting, and it comes with one—and only one—attachment. For shorter beards, even that extra 10mm cutting attachment isn’t necessary. Like its sister product, the MultiGroom 9000, it has a sleek, ergonomic, and waterproof design that combines a stainless steel handle with a rubber grip. You can easily see where you’re cutting, which makes it easier to shape your beard and make clean lines. The steel blades and integrated comb guard provide an even trim, and you only need one or two passes to clean up your hair. Specs Number of tools and accessories:1 comb guard|Run time:2 hours| Trimming lengths:0.4-10mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:2 years Andis Amazon Walmart Tested by Adam Hurly, Video by Tyler Chin This is an industry-staple device—just ask any barber or professional groomer.  Andis makes dozens of professional-grade tools that the pros swear by, with powerful motors and sharp stainless steel blades (that you can alsoreplace easilyif they rust or dull). But perhaps none is as ubiquitous as this one. It’s certainly a staple in my grooming kit, as the go-to detailer for neck, cheeks, burns, and mustache. A frequent collaborator of mine, celebrity groomerMelissa DeZarate, has at least two of the Slimline Pro on her at all times. \"I'll use it to reshape beards or provide a larger trim,\" she says, adding that it’s powerful but “small enough to handle most detail work and shaving off length.” Longer beards need not apply: the Slimline Pro’s four included guides only range from 1/16” to 3/8”—but if that works for you, it’ll give you a barber-caliber line-up along the cheeks, sideburns, mustache, and neck. And along the back of your hairline along the neck, too—though we’d suggest calling in a steady-handed significant other or best friend to do the work for you. Long-term testing notes:This one is so nice, I got a second device. (Just like DeZarate.) Not because I expect the first one to crap out, but because Andis launched agalaxy purpleone and I knew I wanted to have that in rotation; now I can expect my treasured Slimline(s) to last twice as long with half as much individual usage, since I have them in routine rotation for neckline, cheek line, mustache, and sideburn cleanups. A+ device right here—ask any barber! Specs Number of tools and accessories:5 including a T-blade and attachment combs|Run time:2 hours| Charge time:2.5 hours |Trimming lengths:0-9.5mm |Waterproof:No |Warranty:1 Year What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “A must have in any barber setup. Probably my most used trimmer from designs to lineups and small areas around the lip/mustache it’s perfect!” // “Bought as a gift for my husband. The battery stays charged for a long time. Very durable and the added attachments are nice.” Philips Norelco Amazon Target Tested by Adam Hurly, Video by Tyler Chin One morePhilips Norelco device, for good measure and good reason: This tool is adored by both our expert source and me: I love the OneBlade for its ability to switch between trimmer, shaver, T-blade, and body groomer with aplomb. I think it's one of the best-designed tools in facial hair care right now, and a dozen other brands are releasing dupes to chase the same high. “I appreciate how affordable it is and how easy it is to find at drugstores since so many clients ask me where to buy it because they love it too,” says DeZarate. “There was one week where I needed to buy three of the OneBlade for different clients during press events, so that they were able to actually travel home with it because they loved how easy it is to use and that it's universal. It does a really nice job at creating clean lines and is great for sensitive skin.” This one is easy to torque in different directions, too, allowing its shaving function to act like a T-blade trimmer while also offering familiar cartridge-shave movement for anyone who wants an entirely clean mug or simple a neckline tidy up. Get one with the body grooming attachment, too, and you could have an all-in-one grooming device for all facial and manscaping needs; it really does it all with that one singular blade. Long-term testing notes:Like DeZarate, I frequently reach for this guy to mind the details; it’s an easy tag-along for any trips (especially if I need some body trimming all the while) and will certainly be with me on a big 3-month trip I have to take soon; it’s a terrific head-to-toe customizer, though I don’t necessarily rely on it when I’m at home and have dedicated devices for each task. It is a terrific middle ground pick, for the guy who wants things streamlined. Specs Number of tools and accessories:5 length settings|Run time:1 hour| Charge time:4 hours |Trimming lengths:.2-5mm |Waterproof:Yes |Warranty:2 years What Amazon Reviewers Are Saying “I have to admit, I’ve avoided this product for the past few years. For some reason I didn’t think it was something I needed. I recently started maintaining my beard on my own more and needed something with a bit more precision. Safety razors and straight razors were cutting up my face. My $200 electric razor cuts good, but is terrible at getting straight edges. So I figured I would give this a try and I must say I’m very happy with it. This is a very high quality product for the price. Not only does this razor provide the precision I needed to line up my beard, but it also shaves very very well.” Wahl Amazon Wahl is the name of the game when it comes to barbershop-quality trimmers, and this wet/dry model is a great way to bring that professional-grade power into your home. Plus, they throw in a nose-hair trimmer with a grip of different attachments. Panasonic Amazon A display screen on your beard trimmer? In this economy? If it seems too good to be true, we get it, but this easy-adjusting trimmer from Panasonic is, in fact, the real deal. Braun Amazon We're huge fans of the Braun 13-in-1 that we recommended above, and the brand's 9-in-1 is another great option. It's got a similar length adjustment and an even more attractive price point. Wahl Amazon This all-in-one kit has everything you need to keep your scruff in order—including your mustache and nose hair. You want a beard trimmer that’s simple, effective, and doesn’t come with useless features or add-ons. Here are a few features to consider when looking for a great beard trimmer. I’ve been a grooming editor since 2013, and I’m constantly testing products, including the best (and not-quite-best) beard trimmers, shavers, and hair clippers (as well as skin, hair, and hygiene products). My favorite is (and has been, since 2021) the Philips Norelco Multigroom, and I use that beard trimmer as my measuring stick for other beard trimmers across factors like customization, cost, durability, power, ease of use, and more. As a longtime professional reviewer, I often test productsbeforethey come to market. Given beard trimmers are products that should last for 5-to-10 years, I’m conservative in my approach. There are plenty of innovations, but many reinvent the wheel in a way we don’t actually need. I’ll keep testing beard trimmers, month after month, and I’ll be eager to let you know if something new impresses me enough to make it onto GQ’s best beard trimmers list. What is the best beard trimmer? There’s no denying: The Philips Norelco Multigroom 9000 is the best beard trimmer you can buy these days. If its $90 price tag is too steep, the baby-brother Multigroom 5000 is a solid fallback. It’s not shower-proof, has a shorter warranty (five years to the 9000’s eight years), has a plastic body instead of steel, and comes with a few less attachments. But at $40, it gets the basics done nearly as well as it’s pricier sibling. Can you use a beard trimmer to cut head hair? Beard trimmers are not meant to be used as hair clippers, since clippers require much more power to cut through thicker patches of hair. However, some beard trimmers have the muscle to multitask, and they’ll proudly hype that skill—usually by declaring the work for “beard and head” or similar language. We usually verify those claims against product reviews, too. And frankly, we’d probably just opt to buy a dedicated hair trimmer (you can find our roundup of thebest hair trimmershere), especially if you’ll be using it often. Which beard trimmer do barbers use? The professional barber interviewed for this article recommends using the Philips Norelco Multigroom for all sorts of needs—not just beard trimming. The celebrity groomer we interviewed relies on the Andis Slimline Pro to draw clean lines and manage her A-list clients ahead of photo shoots, awards shows, and movie premieres. They give bonus points for following with a beard oil to keep your facial hair soft. What do professionals use to trim beards? The best professional-grade beard trimmer is the Wahl Pro Series High Visibility Cordless Trimmer. Trusted by barbers all over the world, Wahl makes seriously high-quality products that are built to last. Which trimmer number is best for a beard? That's going to depend on what beard style you're going with. In order to play around with trimmer numbers, we like the Braun All-in-One Trimmer Series 9 9440 fo its easy-to-use adjustment wheel.

    "title": "14 Best Convertible Pants, According to GQ",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. The best convertible pants (a.k.a, zip-off pants) are proof that, even ifgorp-core is on the come-down, fashion and function are still a magical menswear pairing. For the same reasons that a goodfleece,hiking shoes, andutility vestsall belong in your closet even if you don’t have a loyalty card for Yosemite, once-humble zip-off pants have started making their way into concrete canyons. You know the ones: they unzip at the knees to become shorts at a moment’s notice. The originals arrived on the scene in the ’80s as a staple of hikers and campers who needed relief once the noonday sun showed up, but zip-offs also anchor the Y2K nostalgia pack. With asling bagand somerunning-style sunglasses, you’re channeling peak Robin Williams orEven Steven-era Shia LaBeouf. That said, they're even more versatile style-wise than they are when it comes to leg length. Not a whole lot has changed when it comes to clocking a great pair of zip-offs—you’re still looking at lightweight breathable fabrics (nylon or a nylon blend). Reinforced knees are nice, but an adjustable waistband is even nicer. And if you’re planning to actually make the pants-to-shorts transition, make sure the zippers work smoothly. Below, we’ve rounded up the best convertible pants—from pairs that can summit peaks to swim-ready versions to styles from fashion labels bringing new vibes to the zip-off revival. Because in this economy? A 2-in-1 pair of pants just makes sense. Patagonia REI It’s no surprise that Patagonia, the brand that lists Earth as its only shareholder, makes its Quandary Convertible Pants from recycled fishing nets. But they’re more than just a feel-good pair of pants. Okay, actually: part of what makes Patagonia’s zip-offs great is that they feel good. The slim-straight fit is backed by just a little stretch in the fabric, so they stay comfy without making you like a yoga influencer. An integrated carabiner loop (front-left pocket), and a built-in repair patch (front-right pocket) are reminders that Patagonia expects these pants to be put to work. Same goes for the water-repellant finish and UPF 40+ sun protection. The only caveat: the shorts have a 9” inseam, which can feel pretty long compared to an average 7” length. The North Face SSENSE After reviving one of itsera-defining ’90s jackets, The North Face is now giving you the Swiss Army knife of pants. Its Paramount Convertible Pants are trail-tested, gym-approved, and ready for action—but as you might not have noticed, they’re also being sold (on sale!) bySSENSE, the Internet’s reigning fashion emporium. That’s because, even with all the functionality, North Face’s Paramount pants will add an extra wrinkle—okay, zipper—to your fits. All black, crisp, and slim-straight in silhouette, you can sub them in for trousers if you’re looking to add a little gorp without going full -core. And of course, if you want to take them for a stroll in the woods, The North Face’s FlashDry-XD fabric (as in “eXtreme Durability”) can resist snags, scrapes, and those prickly bushes you pushed through when nature called. Gramicci Gramicci The Stonemasters werea crew of free-spirited climbers based in Yosemitewho brought sex, drugs, and fun to free climbing in the ’70s. When Gramicci founder Mike Graham launched the brand over 40 years ago, he channeled some of that energy, creating gear that could handle Half Dome and feel chill around the fire pit. Gramicci’sshortsgo toe-to-toe with Patagonia’s Baggies and itsGadget Pantsmay be the brand’s defining piece, but the zip-off Creekmont Pants deserve a spot in your rotation. Reinforced knees and seat panels, Gramicci’s signature built-in belt, and enough utility pockets to rival a construction worker’s toolbelt, walk the walk (or, climb the climb). A pair ofKEENsand autility vestwill take you from a cliff face to the bar comfortably. Nike ACG SSENSE Inspired by a trip to Oregon’s Smith Rock state park, the designers at Nike ACG whipped up these convertible cargo pants with a secret weapon: Cordura fabric. Known for resisting abrasions, rips, and scuffs (a.k.a, the perils of scrambling up and climbing rocks), it covers the knees for added protection and a cool colorblock effect. (Speaking of, that burgundy stands out nicely in a sea of khaki and olive.) A built-in webbed belt and carabiner on the waistband loop work nicely on trail or off. And while the Smith Summit pants obviously convert into shorts, adjustable drawcords in the pant hems let you go for a breezy cropped-leg option for when zippers are too much work. Aaron Levine Aaron Levine Whatever sauce designerAaron Levineis cooking with, you won’t find it at your local grocer—but youwillfind it in histhermals,matching workwear sets, and now, zip-off pants. Crafted from Italian fabric and made in the USA, these aren’t your average trail-to-bar convertible cargos. The pants have a tailored structure that dodges the dreaded gym teacher vibe, while the shorts clock have a 7\" inseam, a universally flattering sweet spot. Keep them zipped and pair with someDanner bootsfor rugged refinement, or zip 'em off and hit the streets inVenetian loafersfor a high-low flex. Todd Snyder x Woolrich Todd Snyder This is what happens when reigning “elevated everyman” designerTodd Snydertakes over as creative director for Woolrich’s Black Label. By partnering with the legendary Italian mill Olmetex, he’s made ripstop pants that manage to be handsome, lightweight, and tougher than a $10 steak. The oversize fit (blessedly) feels more style-forward than the usual slim-straight cuts. Also, we remain a sucker for stash spots. Cargo pockets at the hip, zippered hand pockets, and a snap cargo pocket offer more storage than the average Brooklyn apartment. And though we wouldn’t wear everything at once, the matchingvestandjacketcomplete the gentleman-angler fantasy. Bonus points if you catch something besides compliments. 18 East 18 East Relwen Huckberry Snow Peak Snow Peak Klättermusen Klättermusen GU GU L.L.Bean L.L.Bean Columbia Amazon Lululemon Lululemon Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping GQ readers get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the best affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ expertise is built on decades of combined men’s fashion knowledge, years of hands-on experience with these brands and products, and an insider awareness of what’s happening in menswear. So while GQ writers and editors can’t try on every single piece of clothing that we write about, the pieces we endorse are backed by first-hand knowledge of a brand’s strengths, bolstered by a deep understanding of the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing to craftsmanship and sustainability. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own experience with all the brands we select, review, and endorse, while also taking into account how a brand’s clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs.",

    "title": "22 Best Shampoo for Men 2025: Stellar Hair-Saving Salves",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Let's come right out and say it: The dollar store brand you've been using?Not good enough.When it comes to the best shampoo for men, we’re being sold short, gents. A one-size-fits-all approach will wreck yourhair, to say nothing of the parabens and sulfates you'll find in the average hair wash. “It is important to consider your hair type when choosing a shampoo,” says celebrity groomerSonia Lee. “Men should be tailoring their shampoo and upgrading to one that fits their hair type from the jump so it can grow into healthy hair.” (Think: scalp oil levels, hair texture, strand density, fullness, lifestyle habits, formula preferences, sensitivities, and hairstyling preferences.) So, if every guy has differentshampoo needs, how do we recommend the best shampoo andconditioner? We've broken down our favorite shampoos for every hair type based on personal testing, along with advice and picks from the hair stylists and dermatologists we trust most. Amazon Dermstore Sachajuan Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredients:Argan oil hydrates strands while the brand’s proprietary “Ocean Silk Technology” complex delivers sea-sourced nutrients to balance strands and scalp alike. There’s no reason we can’t just crown Sachajuan the “best shampoo brand” here, given its range of washes that address all different hair types and needs—even one called “Scalp Shampoo” that keeps things perfectly balanced and simple. But the most universal option from the deliciously scented Swedish salon staple is the brand's Moisturizing Shampoo. This comes as close to a two-in-one shampoo-conditioner without actually being one (Sachajuan, of course, hasconditionersfor the whole spectrum of hair needs, too); but this product gives any user what they need: a non-stripping and proactively nourishing rinse that helps even the most vulnerable or difficult of strands. (We’re talking those prone to breakage and frizz, as well as those with stubborn coarse hairs or evencurlsand brittle grays.) While my partner and I both have a respective Sachajuan line that we reach for, this is one of the few products from any brand that we both share—him with his fine, dry, and wavy strands; me with my coarse, dense, oily, and straight ones. Whenever one of us finishes showering, the other comments (from two rooms away): “Oooh, Sachajuan shower?” because that delicious smell permeates the air. Geologie Amazon Geologie Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredients:Tea tree oil balances sebum levels and mitigates both inflammation and flaking; menthol stimulates circulation and soothes alongside aloe, while panthenol nourishes and squalane hydrates. Geologie has two co-washes—this relatively universal one, plus asmoothing optionfor thicker hairs. Of all the conditioning washes that have passed through this household, this one always gets drained first. It has supremely purifying prowess thanks to the tea tree oil and leaves the scalp feeling refreshed after a rinse, despite not actually being a shampoo. (Read up onco-washing, if you’re uninitiated.) I’ve used it as an actual conditioner, too, after a full-on shampoo, but moreover rely on this product to get me reset on the second or third day, when I’m just not feeling a full flushing-out. My partner and I even bring it on weekend trips as the sole hair care product for those few days—it satisfies our very different hair needs while streamlining our regimen. Frederick Benjamin Walmart Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredients:Hydrolyzed wheat proteins fortify strands and magnify moisture, while menthol purifies and stimulates the scalp. Spearmint refreshes the scalp, and its tingle lingers. Here's a pick from Davie, which should satisfy guys all along the curl spectrum. \"This shampoo is a first-class ticket to refreshment paradise,\" says Davie. “Coily hair is very prone to dry scalp and dandruff. You need a shampoo like Frederick Benjamin's that can settle into the scalp and provide great texture.” It won’t strip away the much-needed moisture from your curls, and instead will flood them with the proteins necessary to stay defined. “I encourage people to leave this particular shampoo on hair, with intent to reach the scalp, for a couple of minutes before rinsing out allowing those oils to retrieve full coverage,” Davie says. “The longer you keep it in and evenly massage into the head the better chances the scalp is stimulated for healthier growth.” Davines Amazon Sephora Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredients:Olive extract coats the cuticle to prevent frizzing, while Vitamin E moisturizes strands. If this article were called “Adam Hurly's Favorite Shampoo of All Time,” then Davines's LOVE shampoo would be in the first spot. But my needs do not match every reader's needs, so this product will have to settle for \"Best Thick Hair Shampoo\" in the meantime. It is so difficult to find a product thattamesmy thick hair while it cleanses. The entire LOVE line is like a relaxer for my untenable and rigid-straight strands and becomes even more essential whenever I decide to grow my hair out. If you have coarse or thick hair—and especially if it's on the straighter side—then this shampoo (and LOVE assortment) is a game-changer. Corpus Naturals Amazon Revolve Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredients:Rice and jojoba proteins strengthen hairs, while squalane and panthenol provide the nourishment and hydration. This shampoo is more than just its delicious aroma, yes. However, we cannot ignore it: Corpus’ woodsy scent is on the more masculine side of the scent spectrum, should you want some aromatherapy that might pair nicely with your cologne. (Vetiver, cypress, and cedar take center stage in this one.) I would pump this scent throughout my home, and happily deploy this moisturizing, fortifying wash through my strands any day of the week. Use it as a beard wash, too, if you want to smell it even more each day. OUAI Amazon Target Sephora Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredients:Hydrolyzed keratin forties and volumizes each strand while chia seed oil prevents frizz and boosts moisture retention. Here is an all-time favorite of my fine-haired partner, who demands a shampoo that fights gravity and gives his hairs extra height and fullness. OUAI's formula here has the ability to deeply rinse without causing any frizzing or fraying, unlike many shampoos that give volume by virtue of parching the hairs. So with OUAI, you get volume, density, and body, plus mega moisture to top it off. Neiman Marcus The Grey Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredients:Camphor and menthol boost circulation; the former purifies the scalp while the latter is antimicrobial. Rosemary oil also stimulates blood flow while mitigating dandruff. Creatine fortifies strand structure, glycolic acid hydrates and exfoliates the scalp, and lastly, vitamin E deeply hydrates and reduces inflammation. If cost were no object, this would be our best overall shampoo, too. However, I do think that a $75 bottle of shampoo is tough to promote as a universal option—but as a luxury pick, The Grey is a no-brainer. But this Dutch men’s label really packs on the active ingredients, a difference you feel in the strands after rinsing (you can peep the “key ingredients” above for that long list, which benefit far more than just thinning hair). While I never really advertise shampoos as the solution for hair loss—you need to takemore clinical measures—however, a shampoo like this can be a game-changer when it comes to maximizing the potential of your precious hair. If you have a stylable length—let’s say an inch or more, then you might notice your styling regimen performing slightly better after a rinse from The Grey. It’s nourishing, it’s smoothing, it’s tingly and refreshing, and it smells brilliant. Prose Prose Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredients:This differs for every person, but look for vitamin B, honey, biotin, peppermint extract, green tea, and acacia collagen. Given that basically no single shampoo will work for every guy, the easiest way to find onefor youis to go to a customizing brand like Prose. Among the brand's many made-to-order hair and skin care products, this shampoo factors in everything from your hair's density and curl pattern, as well as scalp oil levels and sensitivities, plus the environmental conditions in your area (think: water hardness, air quality, humidity, and more). So, you receive something that doesn't just suit your hair and scalp needs, but that considers all the variables that make for a good hair day. It's hard for me to tout this as a standalone product, too, considering the fact that Prose builds out entire regimens targeted to your hair and skin, all of which work together to achieve those results. I've always been impressed with Prose, even as my variables have evolved (more hair density due to hair growth efforts, a few zip code changes, seasonal shifts, and length variance). But if you're wonderingif Prose lives up to the hype, the answer is yes, absolutely. Sephora K18 Video by Adam Hurly; Tested by Adam Hurly Key ingredient:Peptides (signature of K18’s formulas) pump proteins back into strands to prevent and target damage. Few brands have skyrocketed quite like K18, which went from 0-60 in a couple years’ time thanks to fantastic reparative formulas. (The brand'sleave-in hair mask, despite the $75 sticker shock, is worth every penny if you have long and/or damaged strands.) And naturally, this balancing shampoo is part of its recipe for success. Not only does it flood your strands with fortifying proteins as it flushes away grime, but it also balances the scalp and strand pH levels. By collectively reducing inflammation and closing off the cuticles, it fights everything from frizz to breakage to swelling, all while giving your head its happy little rinse. If I need to look my absolute best on any given day, I’ll do a full K18 routine, starting with this shampoo. It ensures I have no frizz, style-cooperative strands, and eye-catching natural shine for the next 24 hours or more. Nizoral Amazon Target Key ingredient:Ketoconazole neutralizes the fungus that causes dandruff—and it likely even mitigates follicle-shrinking DHT levels around the scalp,studies suggest. For my job, I can call in just about every product I want to test, to use up, to restock…It’s a nice gig, I admit. But sometimes there’s a product or brand that I don’t have a “professional relationship” with, and I actually pay for the thing myself. Nizoral is one of those products I always keep stocked. I can’t have a single conversation about dandruff control with my go-to dermatologist sources without this one being recommended. Not only that, but the active ingredient here, ketoconazole, is more than a fungal foe: It’s arguably the singleworthwhile ingredientyou can find in a shampoo that can temper follicle-thinning DHT (dihydrotestosterone) on contact, making it potentially the only true ingredient to seek out in “hair loss shampoos.” Though not a body wash, I spot-treat other parts of my body with this one too, since sometimes I get flakes around my nose or beard dandruff. It’s a great groin-area wash too, if you’re prone to jock itch after a sweaty buildup. It isn’t something you want to overuse, though: This one is drying, so I would only recommend using it as an active treatment to counter dandruff, or every couple weeks to keep the problem at bay. But damn, does it work quickly and effectively. And, if you have severe flaking or itching up top, you can ask your derm for a 2% upgrade of this one, which is available via prescription. Wonder Valley Wonder Valley Key ingredients:Various oils cleanse while detoxifying; aloe hydrates and soothes; glycerin hydrates. The first thing you'll notice about California-cool grooming brand Wonder Valley's shampoo is that it smells refreshingly natural—none of that overly synthetic, \"shampoo-y\" scent. The second? Nearly every ingredient is recognizable and easy to pronounce. This silky formula doesn't explode into a dramatic lather but instead forms a subtle foam that cleanses and helps detoxify your hair from daily buildup. It leans heavily on oils—cedarwood, grapefruit, frankincense, lime, yuzu, and leaf extracts—giving it an old-world simplicity. There's a faintly ecclesiastical vibe, like a quiet chapel filled with incense, which is right up my alley. There are few extra bells and whistles—just simple cleansing via Mother Nature, and we could all use that from time to time. Flamingo Estate Flamingo Estate Key ingredients:Various oils cleanse while fortifying; aloe hydrates and soothes; Biotin thickens strands; Vitamin B5 retains moisture. Oh, Flamingo Estate, I always have one of your products in rotation—whether it’s a fantastically aromatic candle or one of the herbaceous bricks of soap. Mostly everything in the line carries the brand’s unmistakable DNA: an ode to the lush foliage of their estate and, of course, olive oil. This shampoo is so packed with goodness that it feels like feeding your hair a nourishing meal after a long fast. A powerhouse blend of babassu, jojoba, avocado, meadowfoam seed, and olive oils works to cleanse while fortifying. Aloe hydrates and soothes the scalp, biotin thickens strands, vitamin B5 boosts moisture retention and shine, and various antioxidants support overall hair vitality. As expected, the Rosemary & Bergamot scent is herbal and transportive, bringing the garden into your cleansing ritual. Aveda Aveda Key ingredients:Kaolin clay absorbs excess oil and adds texture; acacia gum volumizes and lifts; aloe nourishes and maintains moisture. Volumizing and thickening aren’t quite the same, though with similar outcomes. Volumizing shampoo lifts hair at the roots for more body, while thickening (or densifying) shampoo strengthens and plumps strands, making hair feel fuller. This Aveda volumizing shampoo uses acacia gum—a natural ingredient from said tree—and does both. It forms a lightweight shield around each follicle while locking in moisture at the root and enhancing lift. There are no unnecessary chemicals here—just pure volumizing mojo for flat hair. Plus, acacia gum tames frizz and adds shine, so your hair won’t just have more volume; it’ll flaunt it with a luscious sheen. Necessaire Necessaire Key ingredients:Hyaluronic acid hydrates; niacinamide supports scalp health and strengthens hair; panthenol (pro-vitamin B5) enhances shine and moisture; Apiscalp calms irritation. Think of Nécessaire's shampoo as skin care for your scalp. We've said it before, but healthy hair starts at the root, and this shampoo cleanses your follicles and the skin beneath, using powerhouse ingredients found in top-tier skin care. A hyaluronic acid complex delivers multi-level hydration, vitamin B3 (niacinamide) boosts circulation and regulates oil production, while vitamin B5 (panthenol) strengthens strands and locks in hydration. A proprietary plant-based infusion calms irritation, creating a fertile foundation for follicles to flourish. It all sounds scientific, but in practice, this shampoo felt gentle AF—cleansing my hair and scalp without a stripping feeling and setting the stage for stronger, healthier hair over time. Oribe Oribe Key ingredients:Pea sprout extract densifies; red clover extract reduces shedding; peptides strengthen strands. Luxury hair care OGs Oribe have a shampoo for every need—color-treated, moisture control, you name it—but their brand-new densifying shampoo deserves a special shoutout. The Oribe team went all in, consulting a trichologist to craft a formula that adds serious heft to hair. This shampoo packs a bioactive blend of pea sprout extract to support follicle density over time, red clover extracts to help reduce shedding, and peptides to strengthen and fortify. The shampoo plays the long game but as someone with finer hair, I noticed a difference after several uses, and my strands felt denser and fuller. For thicker hair, it adds depth; for finer hair, it’s a no-brainer. Malin+Goetz Amazon Key ingredients:Peppermint extract invigorates and stimulates; amino acid-based surfactants cleanse, smooth, and soften; glycerin hydrates. Sometimes, you just need a wake-up call, and Malin+Goetz’s OG cult-classic Peppermint Shampoo is precisely what the old-school follicular physician ordered. This cooling, invigorating formula lathers exceptionally well (thanks to a coconut-derived surfactant) and is always a go-to for me, especially in the warmer months. The formula is packed with plant-based amino acids and vitamins to soothe and soften all hair types, and in M+G apothecary fashion, the packaging and font are on point. But the crisp, minty scent steals the show, delivering an energizing, tingling boost for both your hair and senses. R+Co R+Co Key ingredients:AHAs like papaya and pineapple enzymes gently dissolve scalp buildup; volcanic ash exfoliates; glycerin maintains moisture, leaving hair refreshed and scalp clarified. R+Co is foremost name in luxury hair care, known for its cool packaging, clever names, and targeted formulas. While we’ve highlighted the brand’s products countless times, this Exfoliating Shampoo deserves some accolades. Exfoliating shampoo, you ask? Yeah—this isn’t your everyday cleanser; it’s a concentrated, once-a-week treatment formulated for a scalp and hair detox. Much like a facial exfoliator, it uses naturally derived enzymes and fruit alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) to gently dissolve excess skin cells and buildup. The formula is also packed with botanicals: bilberry extract, rich in tannins and anti-inflammatory properties to calm; radish root to nourish and soften; and tomato extract to stimulate the scalp and regulate sebum. Again, this isn’t a daily driver, but when your follicles need a reset—clearing away flakes, oils, and buildup—this shampoo answers the call. Bumble and Bumble Bumble and Bumble Key ingredients:Mineral blend provides natural texture and volume; kelp extract for hydrates and nourishes; coconut water maintains moisture. You've showered, washed, and blow-dried your hair. Then, you reach for atexturizing pasteor wax. With the Surf Wax Shampoo from hair care stalwart Bumble and Bumble, you might skip that last step—or at least gain a styling enhancer. This shampoo works like a hybrid, cleansing while infusing hair with a mineral-rich blend that amplifies natural waves, leaving hair with a soft yet textured,beachyfeel. I have finer hair that sometimes looks best in the morning with that \"I woke up like this\" tousled texture, and this shampoo nailed that effect on its own. Staying the course with the oceanic theme, sea fennel and kelp extract nourish and strengthen. Fair warning: if your hair runs dry, this might not be your best bet, as the formula helps create a signature grit. But for those with normal to oily hair? Lather up for just off-the-coast texture—no actual beach required. Aesop Aesop If you want a grooming product that smells good, look to Aesop. And if smell isn't all you're looking for, know that the brand's volumizing shampoo offers a low-foaming solution to give your locks the extra boost of volume (hence the name) that it's been dying for. Highland Amazon A little goes a long way with this incredibly high-foaming shampoo from Highland. It comprises only ingredients that are good for your hair, so even if you're a daily shampooer (guilty as charged) you won't risk overdrying or damaging your hair in the long run. But seriously, maybe consider going a day or two between washes? OUAI Amazon Product buildup got your hair looking greasy? Ouai's detoxifying shampoo will erase all the gunk that's accumulated in your hair since your last shampoo, leaving it—quite literally—squeaky clean. Just know that it does leave your hair smelling a lot like apple cider vinegar, so do what you will with that information. Cécred Ulta Whether or not you believe the Cécred rumors are true (can that hair oil really help you regrow hair?), its shampoo is at least the real deal. It leaves the top of your head feeling clean and exfoliated, with a bottle that you'll happily leave out to let people know that you have taste. The first step to finding the right shampoo is to understand your “variables.\" This means your strand’s overall texture (so, it’s curl or wave pattern, or lack thereof), as well as the individual strand density, the oil levels in your scalp, any sensitivities, etc. Finding a shampoo that matches your needs—and learning theright cadence of using it—is crucial for healthy hair. “I recommend everyone tailor their routine to what works best for them and not just use products that are popular at the time,” Lee adds. “Whether you have short or long hair, yourscalp healthis important to focus on and make sure you give it what it needs.\" Celebrity groomerDan Perri(with A-list clients like Post Malone, Gerard Butler, and Brendan Fraser) adds that men's hair needs and variables might even change as time goes on—aside from just natural thinning. “If you are someone who’s had the same shampoo for years it, may be time for a switch,” he says. For further evidence of why this is important, here is insight from Lee and Perri into how different textures, lengths, and oil levels impact your shampoo needs, plus advice on what kind of product to seek with each variable. And remember, you may have to combine variables (like, if you havecurly hairor straight hair, you will also need to consider if it is coarse and thick, or fine and fragile, as well as oil levels or dryness). What is the best shampoo for men? In our testing, and based on expert opinions,Sachajaun's Moisturizing Shampoois our top pick for shampoos. If you want to shop a shampoo specifically for your hair type or scalp, we also have recommendations for that. What's the best shampoo brand? Our favorite brands that offer this variety includeDavines,Paul Mitchell Tea Tree,Kevin Murphy,Ouai,Living Proof, and Kérastase. How often should I shampoo? We'll say this right off the bat: You don't need to shampoo every day. Instead, only shampoo your hair when it feels particularly dirty or if there's a large accumulation of product buildup. Most people can go two to five days without needing to shampoo their hair. If our roster doesn’t lead you to a new favorite shampoo, then here’s the best way to discover one that suits your needs: Look for the salon-favorite brands that offer a wide range of shampoos and conditioners, since their entire focus is on providing customized care to different curl patterns, hair densities, and so forth. Our favorite brands that offer this variety includeDavines,Paul Mitchell Tea Tree,Kevin Murphy,Ouai,Living Proof, and Kérastase. Note that these arenotbrands that have built their identity on targetingonlymen; rather, they’re largely built on a foundation of professional hair care—which is why we’d encourage you to look towards them for the solution if you aren’t otherwise satisfied with our picks above. (Half of them do appear on our roster, though.) Many of these kinds of roundup articles are initiated by calling in a bunch of products and testing them in a short window of time (maybe a few weeks or months), and then claiming expertise. For me, I am basing my choices on a decade of experience in this field (and 8 years withGQ, at that). And while I have one head of hair with a limited number of variables, I have always outsourced expertise for other things, such as to my partner of four years, whose hair is thin, wavy/curly, and dry, compared to my thick, straight, and oily pelt. Ditto for expertise from a curly-haired stylist for products pertaining to curls and coils, as well as doctors' advice for dry, dandruffy scalps and guys fighting hair loss.

    "title": "George Clooney Found Your $90 Adidas Samba Alternative",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. George Clooney has never really been a sneaker guy. Pretty much every time we see him, he's either in Italian-madeleather Oxfordsor equally luxesuede loafers. So when he steps out in sneakers, it counts as something of a special occasion. In New York last week, the actor was seen playing a bit of softball with the cast and crew ofGood Night, and Good Luck,a stage adaptation of his 2005 film that also marks his Broadway debut. While pitching, Clooney wore a specific pair ofAdidas sneakersthat, to the uninitiated, might look a lot like theSamba OG, or even theGazelle. But the sneakers in question are actually a little less buzzy, and a lot more inside-baseball (heh): the GOAT'd, glorious Rod Laver. The Rod Laver is very much a low-key banger, especially compared to its Adidas stablemates. First introduced in collaboration with the eponymous tennis player in 1970, it hasn't changed much in the 55 year since. The upper is still dripped out in clean leather, while a dash of suede keeps the toe box protected from scuffs and scratches. It's finished off with special branding around the heel and a portrait of the man himself on the tongue. In other words, the Rod Laver is the kind of shoe you buy if you don't really care about hype. (Funnily enough, the specific version Clooney's wearing here is one of the few exceptions to the rule—it notably features the Three Stripes' signature, uh,three stripes, a flourish limited to a special-edition 2023 release.) It's not the type of sneaker you typically need to queue up for, or pay ridiculous resale prices to snag. It's more of a quiet, confident silhouette—a little like George Clooney. And while his specific riff isn't available anymore, there are plenty of general-release options you can cop right now.

    "title": "Are the Benefits of Going Barefoot Worth, Well, Going Barefoot?",
    "article_text": "Grounding (or earthing)—essentially, the practice of making physical contact with the Earth’s surface, also known as walking barefoot—hasbeen a thingamong true wellness heads for a minute now. Self-proclaimed “human biologist” and The Ultimate Human podcast hostGary Brecka is into it.So is Deepak Chopra.And, yes, Arch Manning. This guywalked barefoot all over London. Ethiopian marathon runner Abebe Bikila famously won the 1960 Olympic marathon in Rome shoeless. But what about you—should the average person be going barefoot anywhere other than the beach (if even there)? Therearelegitimate benefits of barefoot walking. But let us turn to the podiatrists for more on that. AsIlya Makarovskiy, DPM, a podiatrist with Northwell Health, points out, enjoying a barefoot stroll is reason enough to do it. “A lot of people like to walk around barefoot because they like how it feels. I do it as well,” he says. If your feet have been stuck in uncomfortable shoes all day, it’s relaxing to sink your feet into the ground and feel the grass between your toes (or even just the carpet in your living room). As to the science-backed benefits of walking barefoot, there are several—though Dr. Makarovskiy says not to expect any life-changing benefits from it. These are small ways that walking barefoot can support your health. The primary benefit of walking barefoot is that it strengthens the body’s ability to sense its position and movement, which is known as proprioception, explainsSuzanne C. Fuchs, DPM, a concierge podiatric foot and ankle surgeon atLuxePodiatry. “Barefoot walking increases sensory feedback from the feet, which can enhance awareness of foot position and movement,” she says. Says Dr. Makarovskiy: “You have nerve endings in your feet. When you’re making contact with the ground, it fires information back to the brain through the nervous system.” This, both doctors say, helps with balance and coordination; it’s easier to stay balanced when you have a heightened knowledge of your position and movement.Scientific research backs this up, showing that just three minutes of barefoot walking can help with posture and stability. As long as you don’t have any current orthopedic concerns, barefoot walking can strengthen your feet, says foot and ankle surgeonBruce Pinker, DPM. Dr. Fuchs explains that walking barefoot engages the foot muscles more than walking in shoes. And when you strengthen your feet muscles through barefoot walking, they say, it can improve gait, or your walking ability. There are a lot ofscientific studiesshowing that walking barefoot helps improve gait because it activates the foot and ankle more than when you’re wearing shoes. What does improved gait mean exactly? More stability and stronger strides. “Going barefoot promotes a more natural gait, potentially leading to a more efficient walking pattern that may reduce the risk of injury,” Dr. Fuchs says. If you’re in good health, you likely don’t need to improve your gait, but it’s a meaningful benefit for those with a neurological condition (like Parkinson’s), who have experienced a stroke, or who have had a knee or joint replacement. For people whose feet feel stiff—whether from wearing uncomfortable shoes or dealing with arthritis—walking around barefoot could help improve their range of motion. “Walking without shoes allows for greater mobility of the foot and ankle. This can lead to improved flexibility in the joints, particularly in the toes and arches. The absence of restrictive footwear can encourage the foot to move through its full range of motion, which is important for overall foot health,” Dr. Fuchs says. In other words,shoes restrict range of motion, while walking barefoot offers more freedom. No wonder it feels good. There is some scientific evidence suggesting that walking barefoot can improve cognitive function because it helps increase circulation, and better blood flow to the brain can improve cognition.In one study, adolescents who spent 40 minutes walking barefoot four times a week for 12 weeks experienced an increase in cognitive speed and were able to concentrate for longer periods of time than the participants who didn’t walk barefoot.Another studyfound a link between running barefoot for 16 minutes and improved memory. What about grounding—walking barefoot in the outdoors, specifically? Considering the wealth of science showing the stress-reducing benefits ofspending time in nature, it’s not too much of a leap to say that walking barefoot could lower stress.Scientific research showsthat it can increase serotonin when done regularly. In the study, the stress-reducing benefits were greater for barefoot nature walkers than for people who walked the same nature trails in sneakers. For some people, walking barefoot can do more harm than good. Dr. Makarovskiy says that if you have high-arched feet, you shouldn’t do it. He explains that people with high-arched feet typically put a lot of pressure on the ball and heel of their feet, causing calluses to develop under these pressure points. He says that walking barefoot puts even more stress on these parts of the feet, which is why it’s better to have the padding of shoes or at least socks. Dr. Makarovskiy says that people with flat feet shouldn’t walk barefoot either. “People with flat feet have a collapsed arch, so their muscles have to work extra hard. Without the support from shoes, this can lead to achy feet,” he explains. If you have obesity, Dr. Makarovskiy says walking barefoot can also lead to achy feet because you’re landing harder without the benefit of extra cushioning. It’s also, of course, important to make sure that you’re in a safe area to walk barefoot. “Barefoot activity must be practiced on clean, safe surfaces,” Dr. Pinker says. In other words not, as Dr. Makarovskiy says, in urban areas. “One of the safest ways to practice barefoot activity is in a gymnasium on mats. It’s also acceptable on grass, as long as there are no rocks or foreign objects,” Dr. Pinker says. If you have a yard that you keep tidy yourself, that can be the perfect place to do some barefoot walking. What about channeling your inner Abebe Bikila and doing your next run barefoot? Or if, like most people, you don’t have acres of clear grass available, running in minimalist shoes, such as the ones that keep your toes separated? Dr. Makarovskiy doesn’t recommend this because it can lead to stress fractures. And if barefoot walking can change your gait, running barefoot or in minimalist shoes, Dr. Makarovskiy says, can trigger too drastic of a change. “When you run barefoot, you’re striking repeatedly with the forefront, which can cause stress fractures,” he says. “If you are going to run barefoot or in minimalist shoes, I would recommend doing it very, very gradually. Start off walking and listen to your feet. If they’re aching, don’t do it.” People in cultures where going barefoot is the norm may excel at running without shoes, but that’s because, Dr. Makarovskiy says, their feet are structurally different from those in shoe-centric cultures. Spending most of the time barefoot changes bone structure. Over time, foot bones become thicker, which gives them the ability to withstand high impact for extended periods of time. But our thinner bones just aren’t made for continually striking down hard on the ground—which is why US runners wearpadded running shoes. In short, if you want to walk around barefoot somewhere safe (like your yard), knock yourself out—as long as you don’t have any orthopedic reasons not to. But the benefits aren’t great enough to do it all the time. And you should probably leave barefoot running to the pros.",

    "article_text": "“Just got a haircut,” Tyler Williams says. He’s looking straight into the camera, flexing his fresh fade. “It’s time to run some errands and show this thing off. Cause as the old saying goes: if a tree falls in the woods and no one’s around to hear it, then how are the hoes supposed to know?’” It’s the kind ofcocky-dumb TikTok videothat keeps the Nashville content creator’s 800,000-plus followers coming back. But there’s a kicker: thehaircutisn’t entirely his. At least not in the way you might think. Williams is wearing a hair system—a modern-day toupee that blends so seamlessly into his scalp and tapered sides that most viewers would never guess. “The people that know, know, and the people who don't, can't tell. So they think I'm talking about a regular-ass haircut,” Williams tellsGQ. In reality, the 33-year-old is bald up top. When it’s time for a “cut,” his hairstylist tapes a new system to his bare dome and fades the grown-out sides so cleanly, you'd swear it was all homegrown. “I view this as a normal solution tohair loss,” Williams says. “I hate that there's any stigma around it.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Williams quietly embraced the faux flow during the pandemic, but when a salty ex started airing his secret, he beat her to the punch with a confession video that blew up online. “It was received so positively across the internet—like yeah, everyone deserves to feel good about themselves,” he says, noting a growing post-pandemic craving for “authenticity and realness” on social media. “It's not my fault that I went bald. I'm not required to just accept it and shave my head. I can do something about it, and that's what I chose to do.” He’s hardly alone. On TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, the toupee—once your weird uncle’s not-so-secret shame—appears to be having a moment. Barbers are sharing jaw-slackening before-and-afters and formerly self-conscious dudes are flaunting their transformations like just-copped Jordans. Those in the industry say the social media momentum is doing more than just generating views—it’s translating into real-world demand, with barbers in major cities reporting a sharp uptick in millennials and Gen Zers booking appointments to get fitted for tailor-made tresses of their own. London hairstylist Adam Fletcher first offered hair system installations on the side, but as requests surged, he sold his barbershop and went all in a couple years ago. “The demand was there. More people with hair loss aren’t wanting to have a surgical procedure done in Turkey because it’s pretty invasive,” says Fletcher, adding he’s slammed with back-to-back hair system bookings every day. Fletcher says many of his clients are wary of dropping tens of thousands onhair transplant surgerythat could leave scarring and still might not deliver the results they’re after. “Hair systems are a non-surgical thing, so obviously they can try it beforehand. But most people who get one done just end up keeping them because it's an instant result. Within three hours you’re leaving with a full head of hair.” 32-year-old Juha Seppänen prefers the flexibility over his hair system to the risky permanence of a transplant. Could the rug-aissance be a recession indicator? Juha Seppänen, a 32-year-old salesperson in Helsinki, has been on the fence about a transplant but cost is a deterrent. “I have a lot of scalp area without hair, so I would need multiple transplants. Maybe two to three visits. It’s quite a lot of money,” Seppänen says. He gave a center-parted hair system a shot a few years back and has been satisfied with the results. He prefers the flexibility of a unit to the uncertainty of a graft gamble. “What if it’s still thin after two visits? What if it’s done wrong? What if the hairline’s too straight or high or I want more of a widow’s peak?” says Seppänen, who nowmakes TikToks about his mane makeover. “With a hair system, I can just bring down the tape and place it a little closer to my eyebrows.” After her TikTok of a toupee transformation on her handyman went viral a few years ago, Calgary hairstylist Dani Niven was flooded with DMs from balding men begging for the same man-weave magic. Her barbershop has now hit capacity with hair system clients—she sees about five men a day—and she’s training staff just to keep up. “It’s exploding because hair systems just look way better now than they ever have. And guys that are stepping up and showing their transformations on social media are making a very positive impact on it. Other guys are just seeing how realistic and high quality they are,” Niven says. “I feel like before, anytime anybody ever heard the word toupee, they just pictured some guy with a horrible hairpiece flapping in the wind looking likeDonald Trump.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Long the butt of sitcom jokes, toupees have leveled up in recent years thanks to advancements in materials and craftsmanship. Unlike the chonky, sweaty mops of the ’80s, modern hair systems use whisper-thin lace or polyurethane bases that basically vanish into the scalp, built to fool even the closest mirror check. High-end versions are hand-tied with real human hair matched to your natural texture, color and growth patterns. “It feels like you're wearing just your own skin. It becomes invisible, like you’re not wearing it,” says Aaron O’Bryan, a Toronto-based TV personality and hairstylist whorocks a system himself. Beyond comfort, the latest adhesives have staying power—you can work out, shower, even swim without worry. “I can wear my hair system for two or three weeks without it moving or coming off my scalp,” O’Bryan says, crediting stronger, less irritating glues and tapes. To keep everything looking crispy, toupee wearers typically go to the salon every few weeks for a reapplication, a trim and a meticulous blend with their natural hair. The piece itself gets a full replacement every five months or so. Unit prices range from $300 to $1,000, depending on quality. “It’s almost like a subscription service,” O’Bryan says. O’Bryan underwent two hair transplants in his thirties but couldn’t achieve the fullness he was after. Meanwhile, the hair-loss drug finasteride—often prescribed after surgery—came with unwelcome side effects, including erectile dysfunction. He opted for a system, styled into a high-volume pompadour, four years ago. “I was very excited that I finally had the hair I wanted. I was a bit apprehensive about how I would announce it to people and I was self-conscious for about two weeks,” says the 42-year-old. “But after that, I was like, ‘Oh, I don't even care if people know that I'm wearing it.’” He decided to reveal his hair hack on the Canadian morning show he appears on. While Fletcher and Niven note several of their clients keep their systems under wraps, O’Bryan advocates for full transparency. “I think most men should just own it at the end of the day,” he says. “Hair should be seen like an accessory, like jewelry or like if a woman wears extensions. It's an accessory to amplify our appearance and to make us feel more confident.” Isidro Almaraz, a comestologist, loves to switch up his look depending on the day. L.A.–based actor and hairstylist Elena Maravelias echoes the sentiment, calling for greater gender equity in how society views beauty and grooming. “If I was dating a guy and while we were making out, I put my hand in his hair and figured out he's got a hair system, I wouldn’t care. Like, I wear hair extensions. I enhance my image with makeup. What is the problem if a guy wants to do that?” she says. “I'd rather date a confident man that feels good about himself and isn't walking around with a chip on his shoulder because he lost his hair and doesn't like how he looks.” Sure, you might say, but what about truly accepting yourself for who you are? Embracing authenticity, practicing self-love and other things your therapist tells you? Isn’t realness about owning every part of yourself, flaws and all, and finding peace in your own (follicly challenged) skin? For Idaho cosmetologist Isidro Almaraz, rocking bespoke locks is all about having the freedom to look however the hell you want to on any given day. “I can have short hair one day and then completely change it and have long hair. I’ve rocked a bowl cut. I’ve gone blonde and done a short fringe. I’ve had it like a faux hawk. Right now I think it’s turning into a mullet,” says the 37-year-old. “If I want to be bald, I can just take it off. You can literally do anything.” Life’s a simulation, anyway. Might as well have fun with it. Why play with the same character skin when you can keep unlocking new ones? “The way the world is right now, ain't nobody real,” Almaraz muses. “Everyone's fake. Everyone's had something done. There's so many different things that you can do and it's fine. If that makes you happy, then that makes you happy.”",

Trends aren’t something thatAuraleefounder Ryota Iwai has ever seemed particularly concerned with. The Tokyo-based label’s focus has always been on timeless elegance rather than what’s popping at the moment, on quality materials and craftsmanship rather than rushing a product to shelves to capitalize on something that may end up being fleeting. The sneaker world often operates on the inverse of this. Trends strike fast and most brands in the space rush to keep up. With Auralee’s ethos so at odds with that of the sneaker world, a collaboration with a brand would have to mean one that shares more common ground with their approach to design—and there’s no brand better suited for that collaboration thanNew Balance. Boston’s best are no strangers to trends, be itsetting themorchasing them. When the dad shoe wave got going a few years ago theyreaped the benefits in a big way, and they’ve had their share of buzzy collaborators over the years. Still, more often than not New Balance doesn’t rush to meet trends. Trends simply find their way to them. They’re far more inclined tofocus on quality, craftsmanship, and heritage. It makes them the perfect partner for Auralee, who will be launching their latest kicks with New Balance this week. After launchingsome stellar 990v4sin December, the brands have collaborated again on two killer pairs of the New Balance 475—a pared-down runner that’s long been a staple of the NB arsenal.

    "title": "Tom Cruise Wears a Top-Tier Rolex Daytona",
    "article_text": "WithMission: Impossible –The Final Reckoningdropping in cinemas at the end of the month, Tom Cruise is on his last ever press tour for his portrayal of super spy Ethan Hunt.Whether it's riding motorcycles off cliffs, clinging on to the side of planes mid-air, or scaling the tallest building in the world, the 62-year-old is still doing his own eye-catching stunts. This week, in South Korea, he pulled off something equally eye-catching on his wrist. That's right, the actor wore a Rolex Platinum Daytona ref. 116506 at his latestMission: Impossiblepress conference. It's a god-tier kettle that is highly sought after in full gold and stainless steel, but with an ice blue dial, full platinum case and bracelet, and killer chestnut brown Cerachrom bezel? There’s something even sexier about this version of the beloved watch. Platinum is by far the sturdiest of precious metals, and it’s also a lot rarer than its counterparts, so it ticks the red carpet rizz box nicely. But despite its high-end properties, it doesn't look too different from stainless steel. Its killer credentials are under wraps, like the hyped watch equivalent of a secret agent. Cruise has been digging the Crown for a while and has a collection packed with rare models, including a Panda Daytona anda meteorite-dial Daytona. Rolex’s speedy chronographs are clearly Cruise's type, which is bang on for a guy so familiar with action (it’s named after the speed records set in Daytona Beach). Pulling up to his latest press gig wearing this mighty platinum model proves his watch tastes go beyond just aesthetics. Platinum tickers are booming in 2025. Chopard, Cartier, A. Lange & Söhne, and Vacheron Constantin all unveiled platinum models at this year’s Watches and Wonders showcase in Geneva. But Cruise’s Daytona dropped in 2013, and he's been wearing it since at least 2024, so he’s ahead of the trend. This is a guy who“really enjoys working hard”and putting in the graft. It seems this dedication extends beyond acting and into his wrist game, where his timepieces match his tough guy status. Sadly, unless you’re cozy with your authorised dealer, getting a ref. 116506 for retail is going to be your ownMission: Impossible. And given the demand for platinum watches and general hype around this model, you’re looking to shell out well over $50k on the secondary market. Mission: Impossible –The Final Reckoningwill be the last time we see Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt. Judging by his press tour watch game, though, he’s going out with a bang.

    "title": "Why Willy Chavarria Remixed an Unsung ’70s Hoops Shoe for His Latest Adidas Collaboration",
    "article_text": "On Thursday night, Willy Chavarria strolled into the Adidas store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles to celebrate the launch of his latest Three Stripes collaboration. Given the week he’d had—dressing a crew of celebrities for Monday night’s Met Gala beforestealing the show on the red carpet himself—no one would’ve blamed him for seeming a little sluggish. But this is Willy Chavarria we’re talking about: the menswear maestro who’s racked upback-to-back CFDA honors, linked up with Kendrick Lamar onhis Super Bowl merch, put on arguablythesingle buzziest showof the most recent Paris Fashion Week. There wasplentyof pep left in his step, especially given the magnitude of this new Adidas drop, which features three sneakers (all plays on the ’70s-era Adidas Jabbar), tees, shorts, tracksuits, and a crewneck sweatshirt emblazoned with “CHICANO” under the collar. Chavarria glided through the room, greeting several store employees like old friends and hugging me immediately upon meeting. In conversation, he maintains eye contact, smiles and jokes freely, and thoughtfully ropes others in to make sure nobody feels excluded. Perhaps it’s hard to feel exhausted when the work you’ve dedicated the last decade of your life to is finally receiving its due. You don’t need to pound a Celsius when you’ve found yourself among the most vital designers of the moment. This Adidas partnership is, in Chavarria’s eyes, key to furthering his mission. “Before we ever started designing, we talked about feeling, meaning, period influence, and message,” he explained. Chavarria’s work has a distinct aesthetic shaped by Chicano culture, his time working in queer nightlife, and a smattering of other meaningful odds and ends. (While chatting with two of his frequent collaborators—photographer Carlos Jaramillo and art director Jess Cuevas—Chavarria noted that his all-time favorite movie isThe Exorcist, which he plays on repeat in the background as he works.) Chavarria’s visual identity remains deeply personal—and he’d never distill it for the sake of penning a partnership with a flashy brand. “Any brand I work for, I like to take a close look at what they do,” he said. “When I was younger I placed myself in the wrong spots, so now I always do my homework.” Through what he describes as “a lot of back-and-forth sampling” with Adidas, he landed on something that felt true to both his vision and theirs. “In this case, we honed in on the Civil Rights era,” he said, “especially with regard to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. We loved having that connection to the collection.” Abdul-Jabbar is one of the Three Stripes’ most notable brand ambassadors over the last century, with his work off the court as an activist as notable as his NBA tenure. For Chavarria, tying Kareem’s signature kicks into the collaboration felt like an extension of a message he’s always been working to communicate. It’s hard to talk about Chavarria’s work without talking about that message, especially now. Fashion operates on long lead times—collections like the ones he’s launched in 2025 are often completed a year or more ahead. You can’t predict the moment in which your work will be received, which has made the designer’s emergence over the last year all the more compelling to witness. Chavarria’s work is unapologetically rooted in Latino identity and queer culture, paying homage to people who have only become more and more marginalized in the current political climate. A celebration of both communities like the one Chavarria has crafted feels vital at this moment. But it’s nothing new. “The message has always been there,” Chavarria said. “It hasn’t changed. If anything, when we do shows sometimes, it’s like,How do we say this differently? It’s just that right now more people need that message.” For Chavarria and his team, the integrity of the message is preserved in the ground from which they build the work. “We go straight to the source,” he said, “We go to the places that we are from and we spend time with our friends.” He gestured around the store’s display for the collaboration, adorned with photography shot by Jaramillo. “Everyone in these photos are actual friends,” Chavarria explained. “We try to tell their stories in the most beautiful way possible, and in doing so we tell the story of ourselves.” It’s his connection to that source that has made the last year more manageable for him. When I refer to Chavarria’s “whirlwind 2025,” he chuckles and jokes that it’s been more like a “whirlwind 10 years.” Still, his public profile has elevated and the demand for his work has skyrocketed. He credits many of the people in the room (and the ones in the photographs) for keeping him grounded. “I don’t meditate or anything like that,” he said. “I have very good friends. I have my husband. And I have my dog.” The group around him laughs—no matter how many celebrities you’ve dressed that week, nothing reminds you of your place in the world picking up your pet’s number two. “A night like tonight helps, too,” he added. The store soon filled with many of the loved ones in those photos, along with a few fellow designers and Los Angeles-based friends. Local favorite Leo’s slung tacos and burritos outside next to a pristine orange low-rider. There were strong drinks, a good DJ, and hardcover books of Jaramillo’s work being handed out. In other words: It was a true celebration. “We go and we do the Met Gala, and then we come back to our friends. We come back to our people,” Chavarria said, smiling. “That’s grounding.”",

    "title": "No Helmets, No Pads, Full Tackling. Is This the Future of Football?",
    "article_text": "In high school, Ryan DePaul starred as a defensive end and tight end. But to earn playing time as a freshman at Kean University, he got relegated to special teams, blocking and tackling during kickoffs—one of the most brutal plays in all of sports. On kickoffs, teams often send out their most dispensable players to charge down the field, build up speed, and ram into each other like crash test dummies. A few years ago, the National Football Leaguefoundthat players were four times more likely to suffer a concussion on kickoffs compared to running or passing plays (and has since changed kickoff rules to reduce high-speed collisions). At Kean, it didn’t take long for DePaul to suffer a concussion, and then more concussions, which eventually forced him to stop playing. “I really banged myself up pretty good,” he says. “But I still had this itch to want to play football.” In 2006, a few years after college, DePaul recruited some guys from high school for a football league that resembled a backyard game—seven-on-seven, no kickers or kickoffs, no helmets or pads. Unlike flag football leagues, however, tackling was still very much encouraged. He called the league Town Beef and gave it a slogan: Football for the forgottens. “If you played basketball, you could go down to the courts and play a pickup game, but if you were a football player, there was really nothing you could do,” he says. “I put out ads on Craigslist and MySpace, and started to realize how many guys actually still wanted to play football.” Trenton Brothers In Christ offensive lineman Skyler Lash. Town Beef took off. By the second year, 18 teams competed across New Jersey and Pennsylvania. By 2010, there were 55 teams in eight states, stretching all the way to Florida. Guys piled into vans to travel to games for a chance to extend their glory days. Some never had glory days to begin with, they just liked tackling people. Then, in 2015, DePaul partnered with a childhood friend, Sener Korkusuz, to turn the league into a business. They crowdfunded $700,000, concentrated the football talent (including many former college players) on fewer teams, added a cash prize to be split among the champions, and rechristened the league the American 7s Football League. They’ve since partnered with local TV networks and smaller streaming services like DAZN and Fox Soul, and are on the hunt for a big media rights deal. This year, 15 teams are competing for $25,000. Think of it assemisemi-pro. The thought of former players signing up for more hits—without equipment—can sound masochistic. It might seem like a step backward for the sport, towards football’s brutal early days, when helmetless prep school players died so frequently that President Theodore Roosevelt staged an interventionthat led to rule changes and, eventually, helmets. Today, youth league participation is in decline, partly due to worries about safety, and some NFL players retire in their 20s over concerns about brain damage, even if it means forgoing millions of dollars. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell recentlyannouncedthe league was “aggressively” trying to create a pro flag football league. Defensive end Isaac Negron. Running back/linebacker Donnell Hubbert. But the A7FL actually represents a different theory about how to make football safer: What if the best way to address head trauma in football isn’t to trade tackling for flags, or to tweak helmets, penalties, and injury protocols, as the NFL has done? What if it’s to remove helmets altogether? The A7FL’s logic is that without helmets, football players tackle more like rugby players, with proper form that spares their heads from concussions and lowers the risk of debilitating long-term health problems like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which plagues many former NFL players. The A7FL advertises itself as a less risky alternative to helmeted football—and a more hardcore alternative to no-tackle flag football. If you’re a fan, player or parent who wants a safer sport — and for the hits to keep coming — the A7FL offers an alluring alternative. But is it exciting enough to compete with traditional football? The A7FL is still small, but players say it’s different in a way that’s thrilling. “It gives you a different perspective of the game and shows your ability,” says former Arizona Cardinal Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. After 12 years as a pro cornerback, the two-time Pro Bowler became the first NFL veteran to join the A7FL. “When you’ve got 11 on 11, it’s easier to make up for someone’s mistake,” Rodgers-Cromartie says. Not so in the A7L. There’s nowhere to hide, and, without helmets and pads, no protection from contact. “They’re hitting for real,” he adds. “I was shocked. I was like,This is definitely my type of sport.” Wide receiver/cornerback Ciyir Hancock. “There’s something not rightwith us in the head,” Kenny Stansbury says, looking across the field. Stansbury has been with the A7FL since 2015, and he still marvels that grown men keep signing up to hit each other. Around him, players are stretching, jogging, and lacing up cleats. Guys in football jerseys vape by a bench. A few kneel down to pray. One guy picks up a white football and throws it to someone sprinting down the sideline. It’s March in Asbury Park, New Jersey. We’re a hail mary away from the Jersey Shore, but it’s too cold and windy for anyone to think about the beach. Players file into Asbury Park Stadium for the 2025 season kick-off—or, rather, throw-off. A7FL games begin with three defenders trying to stop one returner, who receives a ball thrown by the defense. DePaul invented the rule when he started Town Beef, along with a few other modifications. A7FL teams play on a narrower field than the NFL, 37 yards wide instead of 53.3 yards. And the quarterback starts with the ball instead of taking a snap from the center. Stansbury used to be a defensive tackle for the Trenton BIC (Brothers in Christ) and now coaches the squad, which lost by one point in last season’s championship game to the Las Vegas Insomniacs. Today, Trenton takes on the East Orange Renegades, so there’s local pride on the line, North Jersey vs. South Jersey. The back of players’ jerseys spell out nicknames instead of surnames. There’s Hercules, Jookz, Baby Thor. A sturdy running back on the BIC goes by Ice Cream Truck. And from the first whistle, the trash talk is relentless. Verbal jabs range from the basics (“You soft, little bro”) to the modern (“I got 10,000 views on your ass’) to the downright personal (“You smell weird. How you musty on a Sunday?”). After the coin toss, the teams gather on opposite sides of the field. Stansbury ends his pre-game speech with a booming message: “Knock somebody the fuck out.” Some of the hits that follow look painful, but nobody lowers their head, and everybody gets up quickly. Without pads, the contact is more physical than what you see on a typical NFL Sunday, but less violent. There’s a lot of grappling, and players go down slower. Defenders grab jerseys and wrap up opponents with their shoulders to gain leverage, like in rugby. Tackles sound different too, without the cruel crunch of helmets colliding. “When you take off the helmet, you remove the invincibility,” says A7FL co-founder Sener Korkusuz. Here, the intensity runs high, but the volume is more muted. “[The A7FL has] the thing that UFC had early,” says league adviser David Isaacs. “It looked rougher… but it’s actually safer.” “Without the pads, it’s still pretty good. A lot of arm tackling, slamming, that kind of thing,” says Trenton quarterback and reigning league MVP Sterry Codrington. Prior to joining the A7FL, Codrington played defensive back in a German pro league. He’s one of the more accomplished guys in the league, which features a variety of skill levels. A number of players bring college experience. Meanwhile, Dondre Haynes, a 6’7” defensive lineman and tight end for the Renegades, works as a mailman and never played organized ball in high school or college. Michael Walker, who goes by “Hersch” as a nod to NFL Hall of Famer Herschel Walker, is 61 years old and still active in the league for the BIC even though he’s retired from the actual workforce. The last time these teams played, Trenton routed East Orange 44-0, but today they trade scores, ending the first half tied at 19. The Renegades boast some new players including Anthony Service, a former D3 quarterback at Western New England who graduated in 2018 with the school record for touchdown passes. Service hadn’t played a down of tackle since then, but joined the league after hearing about it from friends on a flag football team. It’s a common story across the A7FL, which has grown steadily by word of mouth. Without a draft, each team handles their own recruiting, and good players with college and pro pedigree boost the legitimacy of the A7FL, which could persuade even better players to join. “The people that see it, they love it because it’s a little rough around the edges,” DePaul says. “This is organic football.” The relevance of A7FL’s vision of footballdepends on how concerned you are about the sport’s status quo and how important tackling is to your enjoyment of it. There appears to be more public awareness about concussions and CTE, but the existential threat of player safety seems like more of a long-term issue. NFL games remain enormously popular,accountingfor 72 of the 100 most watched TV broadcasts in America last year. Other football leagues, like the XFL and USFL (which merged into the UFL and began play in March of 2024), have popped up in recent years trying to capture some of that attention during the NFL’s offseason. Full-contact entertainment thrives in other sports as well, like the UFC and even Power Slap, the upstart slap fighting league owned by UFC CEO Dana White. In 2019, the A7FL brought on David Isaacs, who helped found the UFC, to head the league’s advisory board. Isaacs saw potential for the A7FL to carve out a distinct following in football culture. “That was the thing that UFC had early: It looked rougher… but it’s actually safer,” he says. “We're like a tiny speck of whatever compared to the NFL. But I think the NFL's problems with CTE are existential. I think this is reverberating throughout the league, and I don't think they've done a great job at it.” “If you ask the lay person about helmets and football and concussions, they'd say, ‘Yes, helmets definitively reduce the risk of concussion.’ But it didn't seem like that's really the case,” says Dr. Pavan Patel, a neurologist who worked with the University of Florida football team during a fellowship at the school’s College of Medicine. “A helmet gives you a false sense of security sometimes where you think you can just go all out and go helmet first, head first, and you'll be fine.” An NFL spokesperson told me the league has never considered eliminating helmets. “Helmets are just one aspect of the NFL’s holistic approach to reduce concussions and head impacts,” the spokesperson says. “That strategy also includes rule changes, research into better understanding of concussion causing events, education related to proper technique, and the expansion of the Guardian Cap mandate.” According toNFL data, concussions decreased by nearly 17% from 2023 to 2024, and have trended downward since the league first made the data public in 2015. The newer Guardian Cap, which offers extra padding compared to standard helmets, reportedly improves protection against concussions. However, researchers atStanfordand theUniversity of Wisconsinhave published studies that cast doubts on the benefits. The A7FL doesn’t track injury data, and there’s not much research on no-helmet football. The most notablestudycomes from researchers at the University of New Hampshire, who followed 50 D1 college players over the 2015 season and found that helmetless tackling drills in practice reduced impact to the head by 28 percent. Compared to the UFLs of the world, the A7FL needs to work harder to explain how it works and build buzz with new fans. It exists in a different tier than other tackle football leagues, with tinier stadiums and smaller crowds. Most players don’t get paid. They’ve partnered with local TV networks and smaller streaming services like DAZN and Fox Soul—and are on the hunt for a big media rights deal—but, for now, the easiest way to watch a game is on a YouTube livestream. Still, the A7FL has managed to survive and fill a niche for over a decade while other leagues have not. “It turns out when you look exactly like the NFL but your football isn't nearly as good, it's not so interesting,” Isaacs says. “There is room for alternatives. But I don't think the alternative can be RC Cola to the NFL's Coca-Cola.” At halftime in Asbury Park,some guys chug water and move around to stay warm, some players vape, and some suck on orange slices. With the score tied, the Renegades are hyped, ready to take the field and build on their momentum. Across the sidelines, BIC players are pissed, arguing with each other about what adjustments to make. Tomorrow, they’ll clock in to regular jobs — cops, security guards, high school coaches — to make ends meet. Codrington, the reigning MVP, is a truck driver. Kyle Ward, a sure-handed wide receiver for the Renegades, works as a personal trainer, Lyft driver, shipping manager for a plastics company, and also plays in a professional arena football league. For the next hour, though, winning is all they care about. The BIC score the only touchdown in the third quarter to take the lead. In the fourth quarter, Dondre Haynes, the massive mailman with quick feet, catches a short pass behind the defense and gallops in for a 60-yard touchdown that ties the game. Both teams trade scores again and head to overtime. After the BIC march in for a quick touchdown, Ward streaks into the end zone to bring the Renegades within one. They line up for a two-point conversion to finish the game. Service, their new quarterback, fires a low throw to a receiver in the back of the end zone, but it bobbles out of his hands. The BIC win 40-39. As both sides line up to shake hands after the game, most guys show love to each other. Two guys start arguing and almost have to be separated, but as they move to the parking lot, guys from both teams huddle up. One player serves Mexican food on the hood of his car. They talk more trash. The vibes are good. Nobody got injured.",

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Star Isabela Merced Talks Dina and Ellie and ‘Peacemaker’ Season Two",
    "article_text": "Any good feeling inThe Last of Usis fleeting.After last week’s episodecemented the love story between Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced), this week’s installment, “Wolves,” puts the pair right back into the thick of it. While the two got a taste of the ongoing war between the Seraphites and the Washington Liberation Front, aka the Wolves, Dina and Ellie get more than they’ve bargained for this time, running across both groups in a way that proves just how dangerous Seattle is, intensifying the already high stakes. Doubly so if, like Dina, you’re newly pregnant. “Wolves,” helmed by veteran television director Stephen Williams and once again written by series co-creator Craig Mazin, allows Ellie to offer Dina one last option to pull off the road before the going gets tougher. Instead of shying away, Dina doubles down, telling Ellie (and the audience) a harrowing story about her past. This powerful revelation not only proves why Dina’s willing to go to the edge of the earth for Ellie but also underscores the strength of their bond, giving critical insight into the whys and wherefores of Dina’s personality. Isabela Merced’s performance as Dina is one of season two’s biggest and most welcome surprises, as the young actor is putting on a superlative showcase for her talents ahead of a big summer with turns in bothSupermanand a recently revealed appearance in the sophomore season ofPeacemaker. In the wake of last week’s barn-burner and this week’s tension-filled episode, GQ sat down with Merced for a conversation around how Dina uses humor to deflect, motherly inspiration for her character, the importance of a queer love story, insight into thatPeacemakerappearance, and much more. GQ:How were you, Bella, and Craig working to ensure the love story between Ellie and Dina unfolded at a pace that felt even? Isabela Merced:We definitely had a restructuring of the story from the game, and I really appreciated that. I love when adaptations change a few things, hence the name, but I also appreciated it as an actor. It gave me much more to chew on. The scene where I'm holding Ellie at gunpoint is so conflicting, so charged, and it comes to a really great climax—no pun intended—and ends with the really sweet scene between the two of us and Dina explaining where she's at mentally, with the pregnancy, what's going on there. It allows Ellie's growth as a character to also shift simultaneously. Next episode, too, episode five…you then start to understand why Dina, being pregnant, is still gung-ho about the whole revenge plot against Abby. You mentioned elsewhere that when you and Bella where doing the sequence in the theater at the end of the episode that they [Ramsey, who uses they/them pronouns] helped navigate through those moments. Can you share some insight into just how they helped you? Well, Bella's really levelheaded, calm, and tends to be a bit more introverted, whereas I tend to be very extroverted. Having their energy balanced me out. We had each other's back. I was always encouraging Bella to be more outspoken about what they need, when they need it, and to really play a bit more in the scenes. Even though Bella's really good at being fun, I think when it comes to romance, it's a different beast. But we felt really, really comfortable with each other. We had an allyship. Before we even started shooting, I called up Bella asking for advice as to what the set energy is like, how prepared should I be, and what do they prefer when it comes to any approach to the scenes pre- and post-production. Bella gave me a rundown, but overall, wasn't making it sound like it was going to be that crazy. I just found that hard to believe, but they ended up being very correct about that. It was a very surprisingly relaxed and fun set to be on, despite the material that we're working with. One of the standout moments for me in episode four is when Dina and Ellie are on the roof, and Dina recommits herself by saying that “together” line. Did that have any extra importance or significance when you filmed it? What I really loved about it was the devastation of the reality that we might be heading into. We are heading into something that is much bigger than us. It was terrifying, and also beautiful and romantic. When I was accessing that emotionally, it was something I'd never been through other than with my family. So to have it be someone, a romantic connection, it was a feeling that made me kind of sad I hadn't felt yet. It felt real in the moment, and it's something that I look forward to feeling in the future. That sort of devotion and blind faith that some could say is synonymous with delusion. When do you think is the moment that Dina first fell in love with Ellie? Dina had always been infatuated with Ellie, I think, due to their dynamic as people. Then, for me,the moment that she fell in love was when Ellie was playing \"Take on Me.\"It was really palpable that day, and it wasn't even that suggested. It was something we felt grow in the room with us, and it was very magical. A lot of episode five involves Dina starting to open up to Ellie aboutherpast. Do you think this would have eventually happened even if they hadn’t bonded the way they did in the last episode? I think it was a moment thing. It depended on the circumstances. In another world where Dina, when she initially came out, wasn't rejected by her mother and turned down, or where her first time kissing a girl wasn't followed by a homophobic slur, I think there is an opportunity for her to overcome those obstacles eventually, that hesitation, and maybe they end up together happily ever after. It's unfortunate these are the circumstances, but one cannot deny their sexuality for their whole life. It'll come up naturally, and it's all circumstantial when it comes to when that plays out. Is the tragedy of Dina's backstory why she has a tendency to deflect with humor? Oh yeah, absolutely. That was a big component for me as well, to make sure that came across. I think Dina's way of processing her trauma is very blunt. In a way, that transpires and shows itself in her humor. Her humor is also very blunt, so she'll take dark things and give them levity. She's done that throughout the wholeapocalypse, actually. That is a great coping mechanism that we don't see often in these post-apocalyptic shows. We see it, maybe, with goofy characters, but they tend to be a bit more one-dimensional because there's not a lot of time to explore them. So this was a cool and rare opportunity for me. I love the way that she was written. Craig Mazin really sees me, and I understand his humor. A lot of his own personal humor is infused into Dina. Sometimes when I would be delivering certain lines, I would just think, \"How would Craig Mazin deliver this?\" Another person that I accessed a lot when it came to Dina, in certain scenes where she's taking charge, is probably my mom, honestly. My mom is really gung ho about a list, a schedule, and organization. Whereas I'm more lax and type B. When it came to \"Boom, boom, boom, this is what we're doing here. We're going to be here, don't be late,\" that was very much so in my mother's tone mixed with a little bit of Craig's humor. I definitely look to the people around me, the people that I love, to shape these characters. After they’ve cemented this bond, Dina starts to step up and be more of a true, equal partner as the two head into the next stage of their relationship. How important was it for you to show this evolution? We've discussed this at length in regards to the first season, when it comes to my conversations with Bella, personally, about the characters and where they're going with them. In a lot of ways, Ellie becomesJoel. Dina becomes the Ellie of this season because this show's notorious for following two people intimately on a journey with one common goal and mission. With that, it's important you have the humor that Ellie had, that Dina reminds her of throughout the journey and brings out of her occasionally. Which is exactly what Joel and Ellie's dynamic was. When it comes to the planning and stuff, I think they added a lot of value to Dina's character and made them more of a dynamic couple by making sure that Ellie [is] the brawn of the mission and the one who is probably physically a lot more capable. Dina had her own strengths that were more intelligence-based, so it made her a devoted, capable, and loyal partner. Also, Ellie is impulsive, lest we forget. Ellie was hotheaded in the first season, and it's important that even though she's aged, she still carries some of that stubbornness in her, and that someone's able to clock it. Otherwise, in this version, Ellie could very well be dead without Dina's help. I noticed that in the game, too. Dina was very helpful, not so much in combat. I will say I had a little bit of trouble. Dina wasn't always the best when it came to being a shooter, but this is a bit different than that and a good change, I think, in the adaptation. I noticed in the framing director Steven Williams did in this episode is that Dina’s leading the charge as they walk through the city, as she’s telling the story about her past. Was that intentionally blocked that way? I'd have to ask Craig Mazin about that. You'd have to ask him about that. It was all introduced to me also each week with the script. For me, a big physical example of that, other than just the plans and lists, was Dina being the sound assist, where she's counting the clickers. She can even differentiate the tones of the clickers. That just goes to show how perceptive she is. Their similar impulsivity allows them to make semi-dumb decisions when it comes to the battles they choose, but also leads them to plow through the plot and get to the really juicy scenes. That was probably my favorite addition, Dina counting the clickers and her ability to distinguish the differentiation in tone of each clicker screech. Dina says it doesn't matter how she got to Jackson, but did you and Craig come up with a backstory for that at all? Or is it one of those situations where it truly doesn't matter? It was probably a traumatic story that I am hoping Craig will get into. It was something else that we didn't want to dive into, so I didn't want to know until Craig told me, basically. Craig's definitely done a great job of answering all my questions when I have them, but he's also a guy who's very present in the story and won't divulge unless it's helpful to the storyline. He even told the actors, \"Don't play the game if you can.\" He's very careful with what information he shares with us. Would you want to have a standalone episode where we get to see more of that? It would be an actor's dream to have a standalone episode in this series. But honestly, only if it serves this storyline. I'm aware of my place in the grand scheme of things, and I'm happy with whatever I can get. How important it's for you to play a part in depicting a queer relationship like this on television? It resonates really deeply with me—somebody being closeted out of being complicit and somebody who has accepted, maybe suppressing their queerness for their environment, basically, and to adapt. I grew up in Ohio, raised Catholic, severely Catholic. I was baptized, communionized, and confirmed, so I definitely only got to explore that side of me, really [trails off for a second]—actually not that late, but my acceptance of it was late. I think the first time I was exposed to the gay community was on Broadway when I didEvitaat 10; I was actually there the day they legalized marriage, and we were working. Seeing that joy and their freedom to finally be able to marry the people that they love, as simple as it may seem, sparked something in me and a warmth towards this community that I hadn't really considered that much. I didn't even know of its existence, really. It warmed my heart when they go to Seattle and they're in their pride town and not aware of even what it means. It reminded me of my own journey of being introduced to that, and how much it's grown. The fact [that] it's a central storyline for a character that I love, being presented worldwide in such a huge way, feels very full circle to me. I even have friends from Cleveland texting me and congratulating me. It's cool they get to see that side of me that I suppressed for a really long time. I askedGabrielthis question, but I’m curious about your perspective on it. What do you think the story is trying to say about that fine line between justice and vengeance? We all like to take fate into our own hands, thinking we can play a bigger part in it than the universe does. It's about our inability to accept that we can't play God, and we can't justify things in our journey for vengeance. I think a huge portion of that is a commentary on the karmic cycle that we perpetuate in our lives. I really believe in that. It can be generational, it can be carried in one individual and perpetuated til the end of time, until someone breaks that cycle. I think they try to say that vengeance will never appease you, it will only drive you mad, and usually the thing that you're running from is the thing you're running towards. You’ve spoken a lot about spending time behind the scenes, being in the edit room, or even just spending a lot of time on set during this and then going on to direct your own music video. Would directing an episode of the show or other shows on your radar as a goal? Oh my God, yeah. I would take any opportunity. I love control. I love controlling the environment, like having a good team around me. I think I'm taking it slow because I know a director is only as good as their team, so I have to take the time to meet those people that I really want to work with and share my soul with. One of those people, if he'll have me, would be Craig Mazin. I would want him to be my godfather on everything that I do. I really do trust his input, his brain, his kindness, and his ability to work with people. I've been most inspired by him when it comes to head honchos on set. He's definitely got what it takes and has taught me, more than anything, to believe in myself. If that opportunity ever came up, I would absolutely jump at it, but I would still be hesitant because I know I'm young and I have a lot of life to live. Someone can come up with shit to say, but at the end of the day, they'll only say it when it's supposed to come out. I am trusting the process and that the universe will guide me where I need to go. Music’s a really big part ofThe Last of Us. Is there a song that exemplifies or unlocked the Ellie/Dina relationship for you? There was a song recently that I was like, \"This is it. This is it for me.\" I can't even remember what it was, but the more that I'm sitting with it, \"Zombie Girl\" by Adrianne Lenker, not only speaks on their current relationship, but also what happens emotionally throughout the whole season. Not just where we are now, but where it ends. It's like losing someone you love and only being with the ghost of them, basically. A lot of the lyrics are about [how] she's with this person, but there's emptiness there now. \"Maybe I've been getting you wrong. I cover you with questions, explanation, music, and then I only dream of who you were,\" is the message. It's really sad, but it's also someone just wanting to truly connect with someone once again. I think there was some surprise when thePeacemakerseason two trailer dropped and you were a critical part of that. I know you probably can’t talk too much about it, but what was it like being with James Gunn in that more comedic tone and environment? It was so much fun. Sean Gunn is so amazing. I'm really glad they cast him as Maxwell Lord. I lovePeacemaker. I'm a huge fan of it. It's so raunchy, so real, and actually genuinely funny. It's one of those productions that you can feel they had fun making it. I feel like that's everyJames Gunnproduction. The energy translates so beautifully, and they're really in the business of making sure the environment's great. That's exactly what it was. It was in the middle of filmingSupermanandThe Last of Us, so I had to squeeze that in there. I thought it was a really clever scene. I'm excited to be able to see the rest of it. When are you going to take a break? [laughs] I feel like you're working so hard right now. Never, hopefully. I'm crazy, and I'm actually far busier when I'm unemployed and when I'm just doing self-employment side quests. I just like to stay busy. I actually like to work, to be inspired by people, and the things that I'm doing. I'm always working on my own projects as well, trying to get those in development. So many side quests aside from what I'm getting interviewed about, usually. That keeps me really engaged, I think, as an artist, so that when I get back on set, I'm not like, \"Hey, what is acting?\"",

    "title": "Trump's Luxury Jet From Qatar Is \"a Very Dangerous Situation,” Says Former Bush Ethics Czar",
    "article_text": "The luxury jetDonald Trumpis set to receive from Qatar wouldn’t just be a massive ethics violation—“foreign influence with extra legroom,” as Senate Minority LeaderChuck SchumerquippedSunday. It comes with dangerous implications for national security. “Think of what would’ve happened in World War II if the [German and Italian governments] were able to give lavish gifts to American politicians,” asRichard Painter, who served as ethics czar inGeorge W. Bush’s White House, put it to me Monday. “It’s a very dangerous situation.” ABC NewsreportedSunday that Trump, who toured the plane in February, planned to accept a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet from Qatar’s royal family for use as Air Force One; it would then be transferred to Trump’s presidential library foundation, allowing him to use it personally when he leaves office. All told, the estimated $400 million jet, which has been described as the “flying palace,” would represent perhaps the largest ever gift to the US from a foreign government. It comes as Trump’s family businessdeepens its ties to the Middle East, and as Trumpvisits the regionthis week for the first international trip of his second term. Trump defended the Qatar gift Sunday evening,claimingit was a “very public and transparent transaction.” But the lavish gift raises the specter of a foreign government buying influence over the US—an especially concerning prospect in this instance, given Qatar’srecord of human rights abusesandfinancial support for Hamas. Accepting a luxury jet from “any country is unconstitutional,” Painter said. “But this country has literally supported a terrorist organization.” Democrats, meanwhile, have vowed to fight the transaction. On Sunday, CongressmanJamie Raskin,ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, called on Trump to seek congressional approval, as required by the Constitution. “A gift you can use for four years and then deposit in your library is still a gift (and a grift),” Raskinwrote. New York RepresentativeRitchie Torreswent even further, calling for an investigation into the “flying grift,” in aletterto the comptroller general of the United States Government Accountability Office, the acting director of the Office of Government Ethics, and the acting inspector general of the Department of Defense. “The American presidency is not a personal inheritance. It does not exist to enrich Donald Trump,” Torres wrote. “It belongs to ‘We the People.’ If we fail to draw the line here, there may soon be no line left to draw.” And Connecticut SenatorChris Murphyvowedto block weapons sales to any country doing personal business with Trump, citing the United Arab Emirates’ investment in Trump’s crypto endeavor and the Qatari plane gift as “unacceptable corruption of our foreign policy.” But it remains to be seen if Democrats, who hold the minority in the House and Senate, can take concrete steps to block the move without GOP support. Trump dismissed his critics in a Sunday nightsocial media postas “World Class Losers,” and Republicans, to this point, have mainly refused to exert their legislative authority to meaningfully check Trump’s power. Trump’s attorney general—Pam Bondi, who has herown ties to Qatar—has reportedly greenlit the transaction as “legally permissible.” But what is clear is that not everyone in Trump's inner circle is on board: “This is really going to be such a stain on the admin if this is true,”postedLaura Loomer, the right-wing conspiracy theorist who has exerted considerable influence over Trump. “And I say that as someone who would take a bullet for Trump.” Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act How anOrgasmic Meditation GroupSparked a Troubled Federal Case The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter Deconstructing Trump’s ElaborateOval Office Makeover Revisit All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet All ofQuentin Tarantino’s Movies Ranked Elon Musk’s 14 Children and Their Mothers (That We Know Of) From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "Why Buckingham Palace Tried to Stop a Photo of Princess Diana and David Bowie",
    "article_text": "By 1987,Princess Diana's marriage had already failed, but many of her admirers still believed in her fairy tale with the thenPrince Charles. British photographerDenis O'Reganhas revealed that, to avoid gossip about her love life, Buckingham Palace tried to stop the publication of an image of the Princess of Wales with singer David Bowie, whom she went to see perform at his Wembley Stadium concert in June 1987. The princess was 25 years old and still quite shy, because according to O'Regan's version she asked him if he thought Bowie would want to have his picture taken with her. \"It seems to me that she would,\" replied this photographer, author of a recent book in which he reviews the many portraits he took of Bowie in the more than 30 years he accompanied him on his tours. Finally, the photo of the two stars became a reality, but it was about to be filed in a drawer. \"The next day, my agent got a call from the palace asking him not to use the photos,\" O'Regan has toldtheTelegraphon the occasion of the publication of his book. \"I simply didn't want Diana to appear in the press.\" The underlying reason he would later discover: Princess Diana had attended the concert withJames Hewitt,the man who as everyone now knows had just become her lover. \"For the palace, the fewer photos there were of the princess the better, because someone might have realized that she was with James Hewitt. But by then no one knew who he was and I was left without a multimillion-dollar photo of the two of them together.\" Their affair had begun a year earlier, in 1986, when after the princess met him at a cocktail party this former cavalry officer and major offered to give her riding lessons. \"Hewitt, a born womanizer, provided her with the attention and affection she sought, and then the passion she craved,\"Ken Wharfe, Diana's former bodyguard and confidant, would recount in his bookDiana: Closely Guarded Secret. \"The couple used to meet in an old cottage in Devon that belonged to Shirley, Hewitt's mother, where the creaking of the bedroom floorboards told the story far louder than any confession.\" The relationship ended five years later when Hewitt was posted to the Gulf War. In 1995, Diana herself confessed the affair in her famous BBC interview, confirming what everyone knew even then: a year earlier, her beau had betrayed her by collaborating on a book about their relationship. \"I was in love with him.

    "article_text": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.has a lot of curious ideas about how to Make America Healthy Again. Time to add taking illicit swims in bacteria-infested creeks to the list. On Sunday, the Department of Health and Human Services secretary postedshirtless photos of himselfswimming in Washington D.C.’s Rock Creek with his grandkids for Mother’s Day. It’s a cute enough scene, except, of course for the fact that swimming is banned in Rock Creek because,according to the National Park Service, “Rock Creek has high levels of bacteria and other infectious pathogens that make swimming, wading, and other contact with the water a hazard to human (and pet) health.” Oh, that. It’s unclear whether Kennedy was aware he was violating park policy or whether he was aware of why that policy exists. HHS didn’t respond toVanity Fair’s request for comment. But Rock Creek’s water quality issues are hardly a secret.One 2021 reportfound “high E. coli values, indicating sewage pollution,” likely resulting from “antiquated sewers that have long since passed their useful life.” Earlier this month,DC Water announcedit would undertake an emergency repair of a major sewer line, putting Rock Creek at even further risk of contamination, after finding a 200-foot-long crack in a section of piping that dates back to the 1800s. Of course, if there were absolutely anyone who seemed like they might take the risk of knowingly swimming in sewer water, it’d be hard to come up with a more likely candidate than Kennedy. This is a man whoswears by raw milk, who hasquestioned whether germs cause disease, and who (deep breath for this one)has speculatedthat he may have been exposed to theparasitic worm that ate part of his brainwhen he stuck his hand in the bloody mouth of a dead bear before driving with the carcass to Manhattan and abandoning it in Central Park (exhale).

    "title": "When Simone Silva Caused a Topless Scandal at the Cannes Film Festival",
    "article_text": "More than seven decades ago, the Cannes Film Festival was in its relative infancy. At its seventh-ever edition in 1954, Jean Cocteau was president, and the Palme d’Or, then known as the Grand Prix, was awarded to not one, but two films:Gate of Hell,directed by the Japanese filmmaker Teinosuke Kinugasa, andViva Zapata!,from the American Elia Kazan. But a few days before the awards ceremony, the festival was rocked by a scandal that reverberates to this day. It all happened when a group of stars werelounging aroundat a picnic on the Lérins Islands, a 15-minute boat ride from the Cannes harbor. They all had come together to enjoy the sea air, the sunshine, and a game of pétanque. Simone Silva, an actor based in Britain with French and Italian heritage, was among them; she’d recently been elected that year’s Miss Festival, a title that had existed since the very first Cannes in 1946. (The title was given out until 1960, then returned in 2017 before being retired again.) Silva had curly hair trimmed below the cheeks, soft eyes, and a carefree smile. She was known for her roles in John Gilling’sEscape by Nightand Compton Bennett’sDesperate Moment.A few months before the start of the festival, she had divorced Briton James Silver, to whom she had been married for eight years. But on April 3, 1954, her reputation collapsed. Some of the men she was with had removed their polo shirts in the spring heat; Silva, after beinggoaded by photographers, decided to do the same. She removed her bustier during a photo shoot that had her nestling in the arms of American actor Robert Mitchum. Her breasts were exposed to a flurry of photographers, sending shockwaves through the international press. In describing the rush to capture the images, an Australian paper wouldlater write, “One photographer broke an arm; another a leg, and three more fell into the water and ruined their cameras.” Simone Silva and actor Robert Mitchum on the Lérins Islands during the 1954 Cannes Film Festival Simone Silva and actor Robert Mitchum on the Lérins Islands during the 1954 Cannes Film Festival The photographs circulated around the world, sparking a particularly harsh response in the American media—which denounced Cannes as a festival of debauchery with libertine practices. The event’s organizers urged Silva to stay away from the public, horrified by the “vulgar publicity” that the photos had stirred up. Silva waskicked off the Croisette. Grace Kelly, Princess of Monaco, even declined to attend Cannes so that she could avoid tarnishing her reputation, and America threatened to withdraw her films from the festival. Mitchum, however, didn’t suffer much due to the scandal—even though he’d also appeared in the photographs, hiding Silva’s breasts with his hands and bringing their bodies closer together. In fact, the incident boosted his popularity. His role in Otto Preminger’sRiver of No Return,which he filmed with Marilyn Monroe, remains highly acclaimed. Mitchum continued to enjoy fame and prestige until his death in 1997 at the age of 80. But Silva had a completely different future ahead of her. After the scandal, she moved to the United States to pursue a career and try to restore her reputation. But her request for a work permit wascategorically refusedin 1955. Silva was forced to return to England, where she received only minor film and TV roles. On November 30, 1957, after an intense period of crash dieting in an attempt to lose weight, shediedof a stroke—although those close to her did not rule out the possibility that she had actually died by suicide. She was only 29 years old. Original story fromVFFrance.",

    "title": "Why the Diddy Trial Will Be a Content Miner’s Dream",
    "article_text": "During jury selection for the trial ofSean “Diddy” Combslast week, JudgeArun Subramaniancalled the celebrity defense attorneyMark Geragosinto his chambers for a lecture. Geragos cohosts a podcast with TMZ founderHarvey Levin,and during a recent episode, hedescribedthe prosecutors trying Combs as a “six-pack of white women.” Geragos’s daughter,Teny,is on Combs’s defense team, and Geragos—whose client list has includedLyleandErik MenendezandWinona Ryder—told Subramanian that he is currently representing Combs’s mother in an unspecified matter.Accordingto theNew York Post,he has been observing the Manhattan courtroom proceedings in Combs’s case from the defendant’s friends and family section. Subramanian told Geragos that his remark “would not be tolerated in any court from any lawyer anywhere across the nation.” Geragos said that Combs, with whom he speaks frequently, believes he’s being targeted because he’s Black, and defended his commentary on the case. “It’s an observation,” Geragos said. (Per thePost,Combs’s lawyers have agreed not to argue in court that the star was targeted by the prosecution due to being Black.) To an extent, this is the rough shape of every celebrity-adjacent legal affair at this advanced stage of the social media and podcasting era. There are the courtroom proceedings—inevitably drier than understood in the public imagination—and then there are the observations. Combs has pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, and with opening arguments slated for Monday, his trial will almost certainly bring the dynamic to a new peak. A year and a half ago, Combs’s ex-girlfriendCasandra “Cassie” Venturaaccused Combs of extensive sexual and physical abuse in a lawsuit. They quickly settled, and Combs denied any wrongdoing, as he has in response to a long series of civil suits filed against him in the time since.The complaint gave wayto a kind of lexicon around Combs and the allegations against him, with the termsDiddy partyandfreak-offbecoming commonplace, and baby oil and IV drips taking on newly sinister valences. The rapper and social media gadfly50 Cent,who is also working on a documentary for Netflix about the accusations, saw his profile rise as the face of Combs antagonism; Teny Geragosplayed defense on TikTok. After leaving the courthouse following the second day of jury selection,Stephanie Soo,a leading true-crime podcaster, recorded a video on the street as she ate a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, recalling her experience of the day. She discussed how “intense” it was to be in the same room as Combs, describing him as looking akin to “koalas when they get fuzzy.” Part of the appetite has to do with the particular nature of Combs’s fame. Jury selection began on the same day as the Met Gala, where Combs, only a few years prior, had turned himself into the star of the show by sprawling across the carpeted museum stairs. He had long had what appeared to be an intuitive grasp on this sort of spectacle making, and his White Party in the Hamptons elevated him to what seemed to be his natural place. For a general audience, the original source of Combs’s rise—his contributions to foundational moments in the development of hip-hop—is now secondary to the ambient sense of him as impresario, mogul, and connector. Arecent headlineinThe Independentput the intrigue inherent in Combs’s case plainly: “The celebrities mentioned during Diddy’s sex trafficking trial.” As the #MeToo movement picked up steam several years ago, the trials of high-profile men accused of sexual misconduct were often portrayed as broad cultural reckonings. In recent times, though, they have more readily played as fodder for content. As Subramanian and Geragos finished their exchange last week, the judge eventually took a lighter tone. “I’m going to be watching and I’m going to be listening,” Subramanian said. “You have one more listener for your podcast.” “As long as you subscribe,” Geragos replied, “I’m all for it.” Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act How anOrgasmic Meditation GroupSparked a Troubled Federal Case The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter Deconstructing Trump’s ElaborateOval Office Makeover Revisit All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet All ofQuentin Tarantino’s Movies Ranked Elon Musk’s 14 Children and Their Mothers (That We Know Of) From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "Baby Reindeer’s Richard Gadd on the “Borderline Unbearable” Scrutiny of Fame, Plus What’s Next",
    "article_text": "Richard Gaddhas changed. Physically, the man sitting down in the corner of a bougie London hotel lobby this past Sunday, on the morning of the BAFTA TV Awards, is more than 50 pounds of muscle heavier than the character that first brought him to the world’s attention in the unexpected Netflix megahitBaby Reindeer.He’s in a compression shirt and shorts, ready for the daily gym session he has made a part of his routine over the past nine months as he has bulked up for a new show he’s creating for the BBC and HBO.Half Manhas been shooting in Glasgow in between his stops on theBaby Reindeerawards circuit. Mentally, he’s adjusting to a life that shifted overnight in April of last year, a nosebleed transition from jobbing comedian and actor to one of television’s most scrutinized creators. It hasn’t been an easy shift; he has endured paparazzi on his doorstep, reporters tracking down his exes, and the hit of a lawsuit filed against Netflix byFiona Harvey, the woman who claims to have been misrepresented as a stalker inBaby Reindeer,a show drawn heavily from Gadd’s past. ButBaby Reindeer’s success has been driven by the audience that discovered it on Netflix, and it has weathered the “hurricane”—as Gadd calls it—to gather up gold from awards shows, so he’s trying hard to focus on the positives. Six Primetime Emmys, including three for Gadd himself, two Golden Globes, a BAFTA craft award for Gadd’s writing (later this same evening costarJessica Gunningwill pick up a BAFTA of her own), three Independent Spirit awards, a Peabody, and wins and nominations from just about every other organization keeping an eye on the small screen. Gadd has lived a lifetime in the span of a single year, and he’s ready to get some things off his chest about the road he’s taken to get here. Vanity Fair:You appeared on the red carpet at last year’s BAFTA TV Awards as a presenter, amid the first flush of success forBaby Reindeer.A year later, you return as a multiple nominee. How has it felt? Richard Gadd: I was so new to the whole thing—I had no idea how any of this would work. I remember they told me, “We’re going to do an Emmys campaign.” I was like, “What’s a campaign? What does that mean?” I didn’t really understand the whole process around it, and I didn’t know how many [award shows] there were. I had obviously heard of the Golden Globes, the Emmys, and the SAG Awards, but there were so many great individual ones along the way as well. It’s cliché, but “the best of times and the worst of times” always comes to mind when thinking about it. I always think that the industry never lost sight of what we set out to do, which was to make an interesting and important story. I’m so glad that didn’t get lost along the way, because there were times where the hurricane around the show was so great that I questioned if people would ever be able to see it the same way again, as a standalone piece of art. There were times when I honestly felt like the whole world was talking about me, or the show, or both. Did it feel overwhelming to suddenly be the name on everyone’s lips? There was a moment one of the tech [people] at Netflix told me, “The past couple of days you’ve been the most googled man in the world.” I don’t know whether that’s true or not, but that level of visibility was quite scary. I think it would have been scary if everything was positive, but it was positive and negative all at once, and that was very difficult to come to terms with. I’m probably still processing it to a certain degree, even if I can acknowledge and appreciate the fact that it’s calmed down a lot. They talk about press fatigue, don’t they? I never thought I’d want press fatigue to exist around something, but I felt like I was so in the public consciousness for three to four months, and when the press fatigue did happen aroundBaby Reindeer,I was a bit relieved. I remember going to [UK supermarket] Sainsbury’s, still adjusting to the fame, and the puzzled looks when you passed people—people photographing you as you took eggs from a shelf. In the front, there was a Daily Mirror, and [the headline] was, “Richard Gadd’s Struggle to Cope With Fame.” How did they know that? It makes you paranoid about who’s saying what, and much as I tried to pretend it wasn’t happening—that I would soon fade back into fringe obscurity—I just couldn’t escape it. Do you remember that episode ofThe Simpsonswhere Marge has got that Chanel dress, and she traps it in the sewing machine, and it rips? She says, “I suppose all you can do now is laugh,” and then she just stays staring out, not laughing. I genuinely would sit in my living room and feel like I was Marge in that episode. Just staring out with a thousand-yard stare, and then I look at the clock and realize an hour has passed. Who did you have to help navigate all this? Did you know anyone who’d been through a similar situation? There were some famous people who I’d never known before who reached out to say, “Hold tight, I’ve been there, it doesn’t last forever.” I probably shouldn’t say their names, but really famous people who didn’t need to do that. They gave me pep talks. I remember one very famous person said, “I haven’t seen the press treat anyone this bad since [the way they treated] me.” He said, “Hold tight, I got through it, you’ll get through it, and remember you’ve done a good thing.” I’ll never forget that call. And I have a great team of agents and publicists, and they were protecting me from it too. There was a lot of cynicism from the press in terms of wanting to see it a certain way and wanting to make it out to be a certain way. The reality is, I think, if you just strip all the noise away, it was a very heartfelt and, in my opinion, nuanced show, that could have beennota very heartfelt, nuanced show. I could have made myself look perfect in it and been all, “Oh, woe is me,” but I didn’t. I think if you strip away all that noise, even the most ignorant can see that the aim of the piece was to send a heartfelt message to the world about the fact that everyone’s kind of damaged, everyone has problems, and we’re all struggling in our own weird ways. And that trauma manifests in very strange ways. The sheer level of interest certainly made me question the whys and hows of how it all happened, but I always tried to bring myself back to the positives as well. That got me through it, because I still get messages every single day from people saying how it affected their lives or allowed them to have conversations they couldn’t have had before. That’s the thing that has outlasted a lot of the negatives. You offered to testify in the lawsuit filed against Netflix, right? I’m under such strict instructions not to say anything about it, but it is surreal, and a big pressure in my life. In the middle of all this, you’ve been working on a new show for the BBC and HBO calledHalf Man.Was that a helpful distraction? It’s been a little surreal working on a new show among all this. It has been two shows back-to-back without even a day’s break, and in the past year, I’ve been writing the [new] show, acting in the show, producing the show, while all this stuff has been going on. It has been so hard amongst press calls, and legal calls, and your neighbors knocking, and your exes messaging you to say the press are at their door. But we’re actually filming now. You’re costarring with Jamie Bell, who found fame when he was 13 inBilly Elliot. I was 34 whenBaby Reindeercame out, thinking, “God, this is crazy. I don’t feel ready for this.” He was 13 years old, having delivered one of the best performances ever by a child actor, and he’s a total gent. I’m such a control freak when it comes to my work, though I’ve been told not to use that phrase…I’m very fastidious, or obsessive, or whatever. And I’ve always felt resistant to fame in my shows, because sometimes famous actors come with certain caveats or demands. Jamie is by far the most famous person I’ve ever worked with, and he’s completely reframed my opinion of fame, because he is so humble. He throws in, he takes notes, he brings great ideas, and he has a great attitude. He’s funny, and kind, and all those things. I’ve worked with actors who were one-eighth as famous as he is, who almost derail a set with how difficult they are. And if he can do it, there’s no excuses for anybody. I think he’s really going to shine in the show, and there are times when I look at him and think, Oh, wow, people are going to see a very new Jamie Bell. You haven’t revealed much about the show. What can we expect? I’m under some quite strict embargoes, but I’ll tell you more than I’ve told anyone else. It’s about two dysfunctional brothers, but their relationship is a little weirder than brothers. You meet them in a very peculiar situation, and you don’t really know why or how they got there, and they’re having a very weird conversation. It then flashes back to six epochs in their lives, six different moments, one in each episode, and you start to understand how they’ve gotten to this point. It’s an exploration of masculinity, and I’m reticent to say toxic masculinity because I think that expression has become quite tired. But, for something to be toxic, it has to be intoxicating first. Drugs are toxic, but they’re intoxicating. I really wanted to get some sort of understanding back into male camaraderie and male relationships. The euphoric, captivating, and exhilarating parts of that, as well as how it all goes wrong. Tonally, is it similar toBaby Reindeer? I would say it borrows from the same world of broken people asBaby Reindeer,but it’s probably a little more dramatic—though it still has comedy moments. It borrows from a similar world and traverses the darkest human experiences, but it’s a little more on the dramatic end. Every episode is hourlong, which is a huge challenge in itself becauseBaby Reindeerwas half-hour-ish. You’re also about three times bigger physically than you were inBaby Reindeer.It looks like you’ve spent a lot of the past year in the gym. Was that for this character? I guess I just wanted to challenge myself by taking on something very, very different to Donny Dunn [inBaby Reindeer]. So, I have put on a lot of mass. I realized I hadn’t ever been this level of in-shape before because I was working out loads, but my diet wasn’t on point, and nothing was changing. Then they got a nutritionist on board, who gave me all this fruit to eat at certain times of day. And within a month or two, my body had started changing. It’s all about diet. But it’s my birthday today, so I’m going to have a cheat day. Maybe I’ll have a McDonald’s or something. Has it made navigating in public easier, given how different you look from the character with whom people most associate you? The beard, the haircut, and the size all have helped. People are now puzzled, because they see a face they vaguely recognize who’s a bit bigger, through a beard, and sometimes through sunglasses. WhenBaby Reindeerfirst came out, I looked exactly like Donny Dunn, and it was borderline unbearable. I’m always fine with people coming up to me, because I know where I stand with them, but what I hate is the secret photos, and the whispering and pointing, because I’m like, What are they saying? Is it something negative? I still don’t feel like I could go out in public properly, especially by myself. If I’m with someone, people tend to leave you alone. By myself, it’s free rein. Jamie’s really great at going out by himself. I said to him, “Do you not get pestered? Do you not get annoyed?” He’s like, “Yeah,” but he’s cool with it. He’s such a pro. You’re about to don yet another tux for the BAFTA carpet—do you enjoy that side of fame, getting dressed up? I’m wearing Dior tonight, and I really do love Dior. They dressed me for the Globes. I loved that outfit, and they gifted it to me afterwards, which I couldn’t believe. They also gifted me the kilt from the Emmys, and I almost want to frame it because I’m definitely not going to wear it again. What if I snag it on a park bench or something? I don’t know why I’d be wearing it to a park… I do like a suit, but tonight I’m going a bit more casual, with a sweater underneath. I think it looks quite classy, and I’m excited to wear it. I quite like the red carpet. I like it because it feels like this weird escape. I like the buzz of it, and you feel tapped into life, which is quite nice. I’m not a big industry [person], in that I don’t hang out at the private members’ bars or anything like that, so the red carpet is sort of my chance to connect, which feels quite good. Is the new show also a limited series? It will be. I quite like a limited series.Baby Reindeertook four years, and I don’t know if it’d have been four years per season, but let’s say it did run—it would have wound up being almost a decade of my life. I like the idea of a limited series defining your life for a period, and then you move on. There have been so many calls for me to [bring back] theBaby Reindeerlive show. Maybe I’ll do it—I’m toying with the idea of a 10-year anniversary [in 2029]. But life is so fleeting, and it would be nice to keep it varied and interesting. I think I’m probably leaning more towards moving on to new things. I do want to get back on stage. I miss live performance. Maybe an acting gig in a play? Get Sam Mendes on speed dial? Oh yeah, for sure. I’ve actually had quite a lot of acting offers sinceBaby Reindeercame out. It’s the crazy twists and turns of, pre–Baby Reindeer,going to auditions for Servant No. 5, and then suddenly, after the show came out, there were straight offers for leads in Netflix shows and films and all this stuff. But I think it has to feel really right. The biggest challenge is doing all the stuff [in my shows], because I’m so hands-on. It’s like three jobs at once—writing, acting, and show-running. I get in at midnight, and I get up at 4 a.m., and my days repeat like that. So, the idea of being an actor with just one thing on my mind, that feels quite nice to me actually. If Sam Mendes calls, I’ll definitely be returning that call, for sure. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

The two new additions to “the Heard gang” are her daughter,Agnes,and her son,Ocean.Heard welcomed her first daughter,Oonagh Paige,via surrogate in 2021.

Alongside a picture of three pairs of feet, Heard wrote, “Becoming a mother by myself and on my own terms despite my own fertility challenges has been the most humbling experience of my life. I am eternally grateful that I was able to choose this responsibly and thoughtfully. To all the moms, wherever you are today and however you got here, my dream family and I are celebrating with you.” When Heard sharedthe birth of her first child, theAquamanactor also wrote about embracing motherhood as a single woman. “I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way,” Heardwrotein July 2021. “I hope we arrive at a point in which it’s normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib.” She also called Oonagh’s arrival “the beginning of the rest of my life.” Heard’s now-complete family currently resides in Madrid, where she moved after thehighly publicized legal battleswith her ex-husband,Johnny Depp,according toPeople.The actor, who was also previouslyinvolved with billionaireElon Musk,toldToday’sSavannah Guthriein June 2022 that she was eager to focus on being a mother. “I get to be a mom, like full-time, you know?” said Heard. “Where I’m not having to juggle calls with lawyers.” Rita Hayworth’s Heartbreaking Vanishing Act How anOrgasmic Meditation GroupSparked a Troubled Federal Case The Nuances ofCasey Means’s Medical Exit and Antiestablishment Origins Molly Jong-FastReflects on Her Mother’s Dementia and the Fleeting Nature of Fame Wes Anderson’sNext Breakout StarJust So Happens to Be Kate Winslet’s Daughter Deconstructing Trump’s ElaborateOval Office Makeover Revisit All the Fashion, Outfits, and Looks From the2025 Met Gala Red Carpet All ofQuentin Tarantino’s Movies Ranked Elon Musk’s 14 Children and Their Mothers (That We Know Of) From the Archive:Princess Margaret’s Not So Happily-Ever-After",

    "title": "In ‘Too Much,’ Lena Dunham Makes a Bold, Subversive Return to TV",
    "article_text": "It began, as things often do these days, with a DM.Megan Stalteropened her Instagram inbox and saw a message fromLena Dunhamasking to discuss a project. A mega-fan ofGirls,Stalter couldn’t initially believe that one of her TV idols had made direct contact. But Dunham had. And in a follow-up Zoom, Dunham offered Stalter a lead role in her new series,Too Much,on the spot. “That’s why the internet is so great,” Stalter tells me. “TikTok is so amazing to let us post our videos and have people see our stuff. I’m not a good auditioner.” Whether or not that’s true, Stalter had this role locked down. The part was written for her, Dunham says. “Andrew Scottsent her my videos,” Stalter adds, referring to theviral comedyshe posted on social media before emerging as the most reliable scene-stealer onHacks.But that only scratches the surface of what Dunham saw in her new leading lady. “When she does naughty things or she makes mistakes, you believe in her in this way that I certainly never was able to pull off,” Dunham tells me. “It was really important to me that the character be somebody that people could root for—that she had that really beautiful openness.” Lena Dunham in production onToo Much. Dunham soldGirlsto HBO when she was only 23 years old. She wrote, directed, and starred in that series for six seasons, receiving eight Emmy nominations. But since then, she’s hardly worked in TV; she co-created the short-livedJennifer GarnervehicleCamping,which aired in 2018, but otherwise contributed to other writers’ shows, like directing the pilot ofIndustry. Dunham kept busy, though. She helmed a few films, including the teen-comedy gemCatherine Called BirdystarringBella Ramseyand Andrew Scott, and wrote some books. She moved to London and got married to the musicianLuis Felber. Now 38—she turns 39 tomorrow—Dunham is finally returning to the medium where she made her name, more assured and in control. Except, unlike inGirls,she is not playing the lead. “It was always written for Meg, and it wasn’t me,” Dunham says. “I don’t have a strong desire to be in front of the camera these days.” Too Much(premiering July 10 on Netflix) is very loosely inspired by Dunham’s life of late—highlighted by the fact that Felber serves as a cocreator. The 10-episode first season follows Jessica (Stalter), a New Yorker in her 30s reeling from an ugly breakup. Her job, assisting filmmakers working on commercials, moves her to London and away from her family. She dreams about falling into a romantic British fantasy, only for reality to set in. She’s told that her new flat is located in an “estate,” which she takes to mean Jane Austen splendor—not British public housing. But Jessica also manages to step into her own rom-com when she sees a musician, Felix (Will Sharpe), performing at a nearby pub. It’s messy, complicated love at first sight. Too Muchis a swoony love story that refuses to take the sorts of short cuts we usually see in rom-coms. It’s dreamy but tough, equally funny and sad. “When I met my husband, I was dazzled by just how much baggage two people could bring to the table. It was almost like we had Mary Poppins bags. It was like, It’s still coming out, it’s still coming out!” says Dunham, a die-hard rom-com fan. “I thought, ‘What would it look like to try to situate something in that rom-com space and then be honest about all of the stuff that’s trailing behind them?’” Girlsalums: Andrew Rannells as Jessica’s brother-in-law and Rita Wilson as Jessica’s mother. Dunham stresses that the show’s broad autobiographical strokes should not be read as anything beyond jumping-off points. “My least favorite thing would be if people were to try toBaby Reindeerit, because it would be impossible. It’s so many influences, so many stories from friends,” she says. “I would like 34-year-old women anywhere to be able to look at Jessica and—while of course they won’t all connect to every aspect—see something of themselves in her.” Whatshouldbe attributed to Dunham is her level of authorship overToo Much.She only directed a minority ofGirlsepisodes any given season, and shared creative oversight with her then creative partnerJenni Konnerand executive producerJudd Apatow.“We were still subscribing a little bit more to the model of television in which one person cannot have all the jobs,” Dunham says. “I had a strong feeling about what this show was supposed to look and feel like. Hopefully this is going to be a tone that only I could hit.” With Felber by her side, her voice comes crisply through in every script, and she directs eight of the show’s 10 episodes. “One time she was pitching to cut a page out of a scene, and someone else was like, ‘Oh, but then you lose this joke,’ and she was like, ‘Well, I’ll write something else funny tomorrow,’” says Sharpe, taking on his first TV role sinceThe White Lotus. “I was immediately aware of how fast her brain works—how quickly she can make connections and have ideas.” Though the strokes may be broad, art did sometimes imitate life on the set ofToo Much.Sharpe was taken slightly aback when he saw that his character was wearing a jacket similar to one Felber had in real life. “Felix is a grunge musician like Lu is, and is mixed-race British,” Sharpe continues. “But I definitely felt in the writing of it, he necessarily becomes his own character.” Once, Stalter and Dunham showed up to set wearing the literal same shirt. (“It said ‘I love soup’ or whatever,” Dunham recalls.) People would call Stalter “Lena” when they saw her from behind, even though the two women don’t look particularly alike. “We just became so close,” Stalter says. “Lena makes me feel like a teenager, just laughing and gossiping and telling secrets. When you’re little, girls aren’t always told that you can be weird and wild—and I think we both have remained that way as adults.” Dunham felt the same way. Though she didn’t intend to appear on the show at all, she eventually cast herself as Jessica’s sister. “It felt like we could be okay lying in each other’s lap for an afternoon,” she says. “There was just a spiritual thing, a melding that was happening.” Before Jessica leaves for London, we get a vivid glimpse of her life at home, with her sister, her mother (Rita Wilson), and her grandmother (Rhea Perlman) Dottie—named after Dunham’s own. “I brought in pictures of my grandmother, of her outfits, of her house,” Dunham says. “It was like the alternative version of reality, if my mom and grandma and I had just fullyGrey Gardensed-in instead of expanding into the world—which could have happened, don’t get me wrong.” Stalter felt empowered by Dunham as both a director and a friend.Too Muchis the most dramatically intense role of her career: “I wanted to make Lena proud, and wanted to do a good job. But I also was really ready to take it on,” she says. Keeping with theGirlstradition, the show has several rigorously, authentically staged sex scenes. “It was the most supportive, warm-hearted set I’ve been on,” says Sharpe, himself a director of films including 2021’sThe Electrical Life of Louis Wain. “Almost every sex scene, if not all of them, was storyboarded.” Guest stars include Naomi Watts as Jessica’s boss’s wife. Emily Ratajkowski as the new girlfriend of Jessica’s ex. Stalter concurs: “You are, all of a sudden, asking things you didn’t know that you'd have to ask. Like, ‘Oh, what kind of sounds are we supposed to make?’ But Lena is so good at directing that she lets you know exactly what’s going to happen for how long.” One other element helped too: “I was obsessed with the intimacy coordinator,Miriam.I’d be like, ‘Miriam’s here!’ She was also my acting coach.” AsToo Muchrolls on, it takes a fascinating shape. The show is as much about the blossoming beauty of a new romance as the lingering pain of an old one. “They keep doubting, they keep finding reasons to doubt this new relationship and maybe even sabotage it a little bit,” Sharpe says. For Jessica, the trouble is rooted in the wounds of her previous relationship with an aspiring writer, portrayed byMichael Zegen(who played Dunham’sGQcolleague inGirls).Much will be read into the portrait of this often unkind ex-boyfriend, given Dunham’s high-profile breakup with songwriter and music producerJack Antonoffin 2017. But before I even get the chance to ask, Dunham waves off any such interpretation. “That ex-boyfriend is very much an amalgamation of every ex that I’ve had, or that a friend’s had,” Dunham says. “It’s this quotidian acceptance of unkindness that eats away at a person over a long period of time and degrades their sense of self. If someone were to say, ‘Who inspired that character?’ I’d be like, ‘Do you have time for me to give you the 42 examples?’” “She’s in a love triangle with her past—with someone who probably has her blocked on his phone and with her new boyfriend,” Dunham continues. “It’s about how hard it is to accept the joyful thing that’s in front of you as you’re seductively brought back to the painful thing that’s behind you.” Stalter with Rhea Perlman, who plays Dottie, and Rita Wilson. WhileToo Muchcertainly showcases Dunham’s experience as a filmmaker and showrunner, it’s also a reminder of what made her work feel so fresh in the first place. For all the discourse it stirred,Girlspreceded the streaming revolution, and ended just before the bubble burst.Too Muchlands on the other side of that industry arc, amid cost-cutting measures and a renewed focus on how to make durable television. Yet it feels remarkably unaffected by all that noise. The series is simply what you’d expect from—or perhaps hope to see in—a Dunham show nearly a decade out fromGirls. “TV is returning to the idea that everything needs to, in some way, have a procedural engine to be allowed to live, or a larger meta wrapping,” Dunham says. “Medical dramas and romantic comedies are what I play when I need comfort. I’m talking to you,The Pitt.” She points toThe White Lotusas another example of meeting the moment. “I’m so amazed thatMike Whitehas, through his love of reality TV and his passion for these contained environments, found this way for us to just watch people talk and be,” she says. “Maybe it helps some people knowing that there’s going to be a murder at the other end. That’s not why I tune in. I tune in because I want to watchCarrie Coon.” Too Muchreveals its structural ambitions gradually. There’s an episode set entirely in Jessica’s flat, over a long night spent with Felix, and later, an agonizing flashback that plays like scenes from a breakup. The eighth episode is directed byZola’sJanicza Bravo,who also appears in the series as Jessica’s coworker; her mandate was to “make your own Merchant Ivory movie inside of this TV show,” and Bravo ran with it. “Netflix never asked any questions,” Dunham says. “They never said, ‘Are they leaving the apartment?’ There was total, pure support.” Jessica’s coworkers, played by Janicza Bravo and Leo Reich. Girlswas known for these stylistic departures too. “I didn’t even appreciate the luxury I was given onGirlsto do things like bottle episodes, where I stayed with two characters for a night, or let three characters circle around each other. It was just what made sense to me because I’d always written for low budgets,” Dunham says. “I always felt that I had to give people the traditional A, B, and C storylines until episode five. Now I’m much more living under the motto of, ‘If you feel it, go for it.’ We never know how many we’re going to get. You don’t get six seasons of everything.” Dunham references her hopes for a second season during our conversation, but for now, she’s still in the anxious waiting phase. Even by the time of our interview, feedback is a long way away. “The only people who’ve seen it are literally my mother, who says, ‘It’s the best thing you’ve ever made,’ and then my father, who says, ‘I can’t understand what anybody’s saying,’” Dunham says. “Then one friend just said, ‘Will Sharpe is hot’ over and over.” This being a Lena Dunham show, she’ll be hearing all sorts of reactions before long.

    "title": "Wagner Moura Makes a Deeply Personal Return to Brazilian Cinema in ‘The Secret Agent’",
    "article_text": "WhenWagner Mouralast attendedthe Cannes Film Festivalexactly 20 years ago, he metKleber Mendonça Filho,then a critic and journalist. Mendonça Filho was interviewing Moura about the filmLower City,which was set in Moura’s hometown of Salvador. The two hit it off over their shared Northeast Brazil background, with Mendonça Filho hailing from the city of Recife. They stayed in touch. Mendonça Filho would emerge as a powerhouse director, most recently winning the Cannes Jury Prize forBacurau, while Moura landed on Hollywood’s radar, portraying Pablo Escobar inNarcosand starring oppositeKirsten Dunstin last year’s box office hitCivil War. But Moura attributes the strength and endurance of their bond to their strong political beliefs as much as their artistic sensibilities. “We are both left-wingers and very vocal, and Brazil under[Jair] Bolsonaro,it was not easy, man. It was tough,” says the actor. “We were part of a group of artists in Brazil, supporting each other and figuring out a way to resist. It was resistance that connected us a lot.” After the impeachment ofDilma Rousseffin 2016, Mendonça Filho adds, “artists were suddenly attacked and seen as degenerates. That’s how the far right sees us. So we kind of gravitated toward each other, even if we lived in very different geographies.” So the timing feels auspicious in all kinds of ways forThe Secret Agent,which Mendonça Filho wrote specifically for Moura. The film comes on the heels ofWalter Salles’s Oscar-winningI’m Still Here,which provided a joltto the Brazilian film industry. Like that movie,The Secret Agentis set in the ’70s, in the midst of the previous military dictatorship in Brazil. The story follows Moura’s Marcelo, an academic hiding out in Recife circa 1977. He finds himself unwittingly on the run while embarking on a personal project to retrieve buried records. Mendonça Filho infuses this “memory piece,” as he calls it, with vivid landscapes and naturalistic performances—chiefly from Moura, who’s at his most complex and moving in the role. Paced as a character-driven thriller, the film draws from the director’s childhood memories and the era’s long-open wounds. It’s also a showcase of Mendonça Filho’s distinctive sensibility, from its surrealist bent to its subtle evocation of the ’70s conspiracy thriller. “The tricky thing is to make a very Brazilian film with some of these unusual tools for a Brazilian film,” the director says. The Secret Agentnot only brings Moura back to Cannes, but marks his long-awaited return to the cinema of his birthplace. This is his first starring role in a Brazilian feature film in more than a decade. There are a lot of reasons for that delay: the censorship of the Bolsonaro era, Moura’s own career growth, the offers that had been coming his way. But as Moura tells it in his first interview about the project, it feels damn good to be home. Vanity Fair:Kleber wrote this with you in mind. How do you think your prior relationship led to this collaboration? Wagner Moura:Bolsonaro did the things that all the autocrats do: He attacked universities, journalists, and the cultural sector. I directed a film in 2018,Marighella,and it wascensoredin Brazil. It was crazy. I could only release the film there in 2021. Kleber suffered a lot too. He has this capacity of being a man who’s seen so many movies and can regurgitate all that he’s seen into something very Brazilian. I’ve been trying to work with him for a long time. The idea of him even writing something with me in mind was just amazing. Am I right that this is the first Brazilian film that you’ve starred in for about a decade? Yeah, it’s insane. I’ve been doing things outside. I didNarcos,which was a series—it took a long, long time—and I directed a film that took three years. And also, I wasn’t excited about anything that was going on in Brazil under Bolsonaro. Nothing was going on. There are other filmmakers that I’m excited about, but not many, to be honest with you. I was starting to be concerned about this generational gap: Do I know the young Brazilian filmmakers doing things? Are they interested in working with me? I went through all of this. WithSecret Agent,it was the fact that it was in Recife and was with Kleber and being such a Brazilian film—it meant a lot to me just to act and to say things in Portuguese again, to be connecting to that culture. I can’t even describe how important that was to me.Javier Bardemsaid something once that I really love: He works in English as if there’s a big office in his brain, filled with things going on, and when he works in Spanish, the office is empty. It’s a great metaphor. I didn’t speak English when I was a kid; I had to learn that. Even when I work in Spanish, it’s different, you know? Portuguese is my mother tongue. It’s the culture too. This film specifically was everything at once. I was so happy. This film is set right around when you were born. Were you drawing on memories, family history, things like that? I totally remember my parents—the way my father used to wear the same kind of shirt [as Marcelo], and how he used to put his pack of cigarettes in his pocket. A lot of [the film] connects you to something where, even if you didn’t live it, you feel it. My mind worked in that sense: I thought about the photos of my father. I have this video of my parents’ wedding, and it’s in that part of the country. The film that I directed also took place back in the ’70s during the dictatorship, but my film isaboutthe struggle. Kleber’s film is interesting because it’s very political—it is about people that resisted the dictatorship—but it’s more like another circle when you throw a rock in the river and there’s those ripples. It’s like what we can feel now in the US—these governments and how they empower people in their words. I think this film is a lot about values and the kinds of values that come with a mindset like that. There’s a beautiful scene where your character and other “refugees,” as they call themselves, essentially reveal they’re all using fake names with each other. They don’t say more than that, but it tells you that these are people who have resisted in one way or another. I love the Ibsen play calledAn Enemy of the People,and I always think about that play when I think aboutThe Secret Agent: Someone is punished for doing the right thing. It feels a little naive, but it’s what happens when values are upside down. I’m reading this very interesting book calledThe Invisible Doctrineabout the secret history of neoliberalism. One part is about when citizens stop being called citizens and start being called consumers. There’s a big shift in the idea of citizenship and that kind of mindset. This film is a lot about how the values of a government can shape the minds of people in general—but the ones that are not in conformity with that idea really pay a price. I think here, Kleber is talking about himself and that specific time when we all lived in Brazil under Bolsonaro. We all paid a big price by not obeying or not agreeing with what was going on. Kleber Mendonça Filho at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival In many ways, this is a film about memory and people who are forgotten. It’s universal, but I imagine there’s something politically charged there too. Can you give me some of that context? The history of Brazil, like any history, I think, is told by the point of view of the so-called winners. When I was a boy, the history was still very colonialist: “Oh, the Portuguese came to Brazil and they brought the Africans and they….” Even when we were talking about the military coup d’état, it “saved Brazil from communism”—I remember literally studying that kind of shit when I was a kid. With art in general, we have the capacity to recreate the narratives. I want to see more films in Brazil made by Indigenous communities, for example. But when a collaborator is very interested in the archives, as Kleber is, like [his documentary]Pictures of Ghosts—he likes to open boxes and physically manipulate things like tapes. It’s a way of talking about the potential threat of autocratic governments nowadays by talking about a time in our country from ’64 to ’85 where things went bad. People forget. It’s crazy how Walter Salles’s film,I’m Still Here, became a thing among young people in Brazil. They didn’t even know that we had a dictatorship! It has a pedagogical aspect of it that I think is interesting, although the artistry is what makes us connect with it. Kleber’s films are always an event, but do you feel this kind of renewed enthusiasm around Brazilian cinema right now, coming off ofI’m Still Here? I lovedI’m Still Hereand the connection it drew after Bolsonaro. The right-wing narrative in Brazil was, as always, anti-cinema, anti government spending money on culture and incentives for art—you know the thing. It’s exactly what’s going on in the US right now.I’m Still Herereconnected the Brazilian audience with our cinema, as a film for adults and a film about a very specific time in our history, which a scar that’s not yet healed. We have in Brazil a horrible thing called the law of Amnesty, where torturers and killers and everybody just got free from what they did. When Walter Salles makes a film about that, and it’s seen by the amount of people that saw it, and with the amount of young people that went to the movies—and the amount of people that were rooting forFernanda Torresat the Oscars and looking at her and saying, “That artist represents us. There is a Brazilian artist that represents us in Brazil”—that is great. It says a lot about our country that is in this horrible polarized moment. It was an artist representing the country. The narrative that film brings matters to us, and beyond that, people are going, “Oh my God, so this really happened? Holy shit, that’s fucked up.” Kleber’s film has a different approach to that time—like I said, the stone in the river thing—and I think it will have a political effect, but also an artistic effect. It’s as Brazilian as you can get. It’s a beautiful film directed by someone that knows a lot about films and has seen many movies. He is an artist with a lot of sensibility. You’ve played some bad guys, and Marcelo is fundamentally good. Was there anything about him that excited you or scared you? I feel that my temperature as an actor is usually very hot. [Laughs] Kleber’s temperature is low. He’s a low-pulse artist. He’s cooler. When he wrote this character thinking of me, he thought of something that he hadn’t seen me do yet. We never had this conversation, by the way—this is me just thinking. But the character also is a lot of who Kleber is. He takes his time. The emotions are very subtle and in the right place. The last scene of the film was my last day of shooting, and he hugged me and I felt he was crying—he was shaking. The challenge for me was to understand what Kleber wanted to do with him, to understand what he thought when he cast me—that this was also a reflection of who he is. The performances are so naturalistic even as the filmmaking goes in specific, surreal directions. As a filmmaker yourself, acting for Kleber, what do you make of that? He has a very accurate understanding of what he wants, the kind of acting he wants. Kleber makes you dive into the universe that he’s creating, makes you understand what he’s doing, what he wants, and then you’re just doing it. How about that older actress in the beginning of the film? The lady that takes care of the refugees? Tânia Maria. I looked her up after I saw the credits, she’s incredible. She’s not even an actress! She had a line inBacurauand Kleber was like, “She’s interesting.” Just looking at her, in many moments I was like, “This is the best acting.” Funny and crazy and smoking that cigarette and speaking with that voice. I was like, “This is absolutely amazing.” There are scenes in the film where I’m basically reacting to her as me, smiling. So absurdly great. I don’t know how he finds that. We all get immersed in his universe. This story is part ofAwards Insider’s in-depthCannes coverage, including first looks and exclusive interviews with some of the event’s biggest names.

    "title": "Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld on Trump, the Manosphere, and Hosting the “Strangest Game Show Ever”",
    "article_text": "“We live in a time where we have a president that’s making news every day,” says Fox News’Greg Gutfeld,“and some of it is just unreal, and some of it is unbelievable.” The rapid-fire, often mind-boggling nature of theDonald Trumpnews cycle is an asset to Gutfeld in putting contestants through the paces onWhat Did I Miss?,his zany new Fox Nation game show. The streaming program, which will have a three-episode run starting on May 12, is also something of a social experiment, featuring four people who have opted to remain in complete isolation from Inauguration Day until mid-April, with no media consumption or contact with the outside world. They’re welcomed back into society by coming face-to-face with Gutfeld and a live studio audience for a showdown to see who is best at separating actual news stories from bogus ones. I recently caught up with the busy Fox News personality as he was in a car traveling from the network’s Midtown headquarters, where he cohostsThe Fiveand late-night showGutfeld!,to his home in the city. I was curious if Gutfeld, beyond making the show for its pure entertainment factor, was trying to drive home a larger point about the credibility of the news media. “Not a lot of deep thinking” was involved in the making of the show, says Gutfeld, who adds: “I think you can draw conclusions that in this world, it’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s not.” Gutfeld, a former top editor atMen’s Health, Stuff,andMaximUK, and a TV host who mixed comedy with conservative politics on his old wee-hours Fox News show,Red Eye,arguably blazed a trail for today’s manosphere, which we discussed, along with why he considers it “incredibly healthy” to question the legitimacy of the media; how Fox News fits into that equation; and, of course, Trump. Gutfeld, a Trump supporter, says that as far as politics and entertainment go, the president didn’t just blur the line—“he erased it.” This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Vanity Fair:I watched the first screener, and you called it the “strangest game show ever created.” I have to know—where did the idea come from, and how involved were you in shaping the format? Greg Gutfeld:We had a couple of meetings on it, and I think originally we wanted to do it before the election because we thought the big question would be who becomes president. But these things take forever, so we ended up doing it in the new year. The contestants went in on Inauguration Day. Fox approached me with the idea, and I was like, I can’t believe this hasn’t been done before. It combined the reality show feel with a game show. And the idea that we get to make stuff up is fun too. Was it meant to be purely funny, or was there an intention to say something deeper about the insanity of the news cycle or the media? I think that’s a byproduct. It was just, Let’s do it. The concept itself didn’t need any heavy thinking. It was like, These people are going to miss the news; let’s talk about the news. And it just so happens that we live in a time where we have a president that’s making news every day, and some of it is just unreal, and some of it is unbelievable. That just added to the charm of it. Whatever you saw there was just us having fun, not a lot of deep thinking. But I think you can draw conclusions that in this world, it’s hard to tell what’s real and what’s not. The termfake newsis used a lot in the show, and Trump has used that for years to attack the mainstream media. Are you deploying the phrase in the same way here? And also, do you agree with him doing that? I’ve been on both sides of the pen. I’ve been an editor and a writer for, I don’t know, it might have been 15 years before I got into TV, maybe even longer. I do believe it’s healthy not to trust the media. I think the concept of fake news, or calling the news fake, is incredibly healthy for people to understand that they should not be believing everything or anything they read. And I assume that goes for Fox as well? I think Fox is really great about presenting both sides. If you look at something likeThe Five,I think we’re the only show that does that. We also do something that neither CNN or MSNBC do, which is, we label our views and our commentators. When I’m talking, I’ve got an opinion. I’m not a reporter; I’m a guy with an opinion, sitting around a table like I’m at a bar. We don’t pretend to be anything else. What do you see as your role at Fox? Are you a comedian, a political commentator? A mix of both? I’m basically doing whatever I feel like doing. People ask my opinion, and I give it. Sometimes it’s serious, sometimes it’s funny, sometimes it’s bold. I never ever said I was a comedian, because I’ve never performed as a comedian. I was an editor and a writer for many years. I’ve always felt that I was a writer first. So basically, I’m just a guy who likes to talk and has a good time doing it. Have you ever been told by anyone at Fox, executives or producers, to tone it down or avoid certain topics? Never. I’ve never had anyone tell me to change an opinion at all. The only times might be about language, if I get a little too coarse. But that’s tiny, and it doesn’t affect me. I usually just do it. I think people have learned not to give me guidance, because I always end up leaning into the opposite. Do you think your success is a signal of how audiences are changing and how they want to consume news in this era? Well, I think it was there for the taking. All I did was comment on what I saw. A brutal honesty about the world is necessary. I’m probably the harshest critic on media and I’m in media. I think that’s healthy. What are your thoughts about the role of comedy in politics right now? People like Elon Musk have said something to the degree of “legalize comedy.” Do you agree with that sentiment? Is comedy under threat? I think people self-censored each other. They were worried that they would lose gigs or would lose their status. The late-night shows were very careful to stick to one side because that was the prevailing assumptions of the industry they’re in. The proof is in the explosion of people likeJoe Rogan, Shane Gillis,Theo Von,and me. It’s like people needed it. It was very sad to watch comedians have to walk back things they said in the past, which is the most absurd practice ever. It was pathetic and cowardly when comedians would do that. You mentioned people like Joe Rogan. Do you see yourself in that world of media, which many are calling “the manosphere”? I don’t know because I’ve never aimed for anything. I’ve always done my thing and let the world—the entertainment consumption—come to me. I think things just happen, and then the media struggles to find a way to describe it so it makes sense to them. They’ll dismiss it—“Oh, it’s the manosphere.” We were discussingVanity Fairandtheir pieceon how protein is part of the manosphere. Why is everything healthy now a part of MAGA? Why are you giving that up? It was like, Fitness is now conservative. No, it wasn’t. Why are you politicizing it? [Editor’s note: Thanks for reading, Greg!] You’re going to end up on the outside of that, doesn’t do anybody any favors. There should be more liberal podcasts. Why isn’t there? I don’t know. I think it’s more of an organic thing that just happened, rather than me choosing it. Speaking to MAGA, do you personally think Trump is good for the country? Oh, awesome. Definitely. Did you vote for him? Yeah, I voted for him. He’s the first nonpolitician that I’ve ever seen. He’s probably the most persuasive leader I’ve seen. He’s also, I would say, apolitical. I have conservative friends who are appalled by his trade stance. But my argument with Trump? You have to accept the total package because there’s so many good things in it that you’re bound to be upset by one thing or another. Do you have a personal relationship with him at all? I know him and I’ve met with him more than a few times. We talk infrequently. I guess I would say I have a relationship with him, but I wouldn’t want to overplay it. He’s done my show a couple of times and we get along. I was very critical of him for a long time, but I changed. Where would you say you sit on the political spectrum? Do you identify with the Republican Party? I kind of outgrew the whole party thing, and I feel like it’s a mono-party, which is why Trump is attractive—because he’s outside the mono-party. I always felt that I was a libertarian, but I’m coming to question that. I’ve always been for the decriminalization of drugs, and maybe I still am, but I have to be honest with myself. I look at the streets of New York and LA and other cities. Was that a good idea? Can I still hold on to those beliefs, seeing what it’s done to the nature of how we live in these cities? You said that you see Trump as apolitical in a way, but I think some would argue that there’s a blurring of the lines between politics and entertainment. He just happens to be very entertaining and persuasive, and he likes to get shit done. That pretty much muscles out the politics. I don’t see him as a political animal at all. I’ve been around enough politicians. I can see why they have so much discomfort with him, because he’s an entertainer and a persuader and a businessman who entered their world, and he doesn’t go by their rules, and that has made them uncomfortable. It’s not the blurring of the lines. I think he erased it. And you see that as a positive? Definitely. Politicians suck. They’re designed to employ language to obscure truth. He doesn’t do that. He uses the language we use. He’s the most transparent leader I’ve ever seen. You want to know what he’s thinking? Ask him. He’s going to tell you and he’s not going to shut up. He’s the opposite of every politician. They’re all so careful about what they’re going to say. It’s funny that people are critical of him for basically having the time and generosity to tell you everything, so much you might not even like him. But he doesn’t care; he’s just going to tell you. That is a tremendous respect for people that he tells you what he thinks. I’d take that over a politician any day—left, right, you name it. Those are pretty big shoes to fill. Who could possibly be next? That’s the question. It could be somebody on the left because, like you said, those lines, they don’t really exist anymore.[Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]has been pushed because she does have charisma, and that matters. I honestly don’t know. He’s kind of broken the mold. What does your media diet look like? When I get up in the morning, I work out to podcasts. I will listen toScott Adams.He’s the guy behind “Dilbert.” I’ll listen to theAll-Inpodcast. I will see who was onLex Fridman.I loveTim Dillon’s podcast, which is always great. I’ll go on YouTube and look for the people that I’m interested in, whether it’sPeter Thielbeing interviewed or—I don’t listen to short-form stuff. I don’t get news that way. I deliver it in that way, but I like listening to people who are interesting talk about stuff. Could beJordan Petersonone day. I likeBret Weinsteinand his wife,Heather;it’s called theDarkHorse Podcast.They talk about biology and social issues, and I find that really interesting. I obviously always checkRogan.I listen toRed Scarebecause they’re really funny. The left has been behind in this because they don’t trust themselves to go beyond a sound bite. I think that’s whyKamala [Harris], they were fighting so hard to keep her offJoe Roganbecause they didn’t trust that she could do it. Whereas Trump sat down and went, like, for two and a half hours. They couldn’t trust her to go beyond what the handlers wanted her to do. I think you’re going to know who that person is. Maybe it isStephen A. Smith.Somebody who could talk and is not afraid of taking a risk on an idea. You have to take risks for people to trust you, to be authentic. You’ve got to defend some people. And I think the left got too scared of the woke to actually defend themselvesagainstthe woke. I think there’s going to be a push away from identity politics. That’s going to be a really healthy thing for the Democratic Party to start thinking about. Are you still living in New York City? I’m curious if you have any thoughts on the mayoral race? Yeah, I’m still living in the city. I don’t know what to make of it. To be honest with you, I have a feeling that it’s probably going to be[Andrew] Cuomo,if he wants it. I do know that whoever is tough on crime is going to win. Any closing thoughts on Cuomo? He’s got some baggage, but desperate times, you know—people may overlook that baggage, whether it was the COVID rest home stuff or the sexual harassment. [Cuomo has denied all allegations against him.] People are worried about walking to work, using the subway. I think we need to get the citizens to regain confidence that they can go outside and use the subway without worrying. I’m pulling up! Just in time.

    "title": "‘The Last of Us’ Recap: Ellie Gets Reckless, and Commits to a Grim Path. So Does the Show",
    "article_text": "Generally speaking,The Last of Ushas taken a lot of care to be a self-sufficient adaptation—a TV series that even someone unfamiliar with the video game can follow along just fine. But that sturdy feeling has started to slip a bit in the last few episodes of season two, as the show introducedthe Seraphitesandthe soldiers of the WLFwithout a whole lot of context. As discussed in previous weeks, it might be a very long while before that context comes—making recent episodes feel a little lacking. But Sunday’s episode, \"Feel Her Love,\" is the first time this season that it’s really felt like knowing the source material would be genuinely helpful. So much happens so quickly—in the shortest episode of the season thus far—that it's genuinely a little disorienting, even if you've played the games. As writer/co-showrunnerCraig Mazinis fond of doing, the episode begins with an original vignette in which a WLF officer (played byHetienne ParkofHannibalfame) is being interrogated for killing the men under her command. She explains it wasn't that simple. After hunting down some infected in Seattle’s hospital, she sent a team down to its basement levels, where they disappeared. She then sent another team after them, led by her best soldier, Leon, who radioed back with terrible news: The cordyceps growth beneath is out of control, filling the basement with spores. She listens to Leon's last moments: The spores are choking him, and he knows he's doomed, so he tells his commander—his mother—to seal everyone in. As the interrogation concludes, the WLF officer is commended for her sense of duty, and given condolences for her loss. Here's the first little annotation worth making: This scene isn't just setting up the episode's ending, which takes place in the hospital's basement levels. It's also revisiting the show's most substantial change from the video game. In the PlayStation version ofThe Last of Usand its sequel, the cordyceps infection spreads via spores, much like other real-world fungi. As you know by now, things are a bit different on the show; the infection spreads via tendrils that penetrate hosts, usually through bites. When the TV version ofThe Last of Uslaunched, Mazin and co-showrunnerNeil Druckmanntalked about this change at lengthwithout entirely leaving spores off the table. Now here they are—but it's not really clear why, other than as further evidence that the cordyceps infection is changing. Those changes, and the hospital basement, are also setting up one ofThe Last of Us Part II's most memorable monsters—but we likely won't get to see the HBO version of it until the show's third season. After the cold open, we then rejoin Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced) in the theater where they're holing up. As Dina works out a safe route to sneak into the hospital, Ellie roots around the theater stage, finding a rack of guitars. She picks one up, plays the first few bars of a song, and then seems to get too emotional to do more. It's a little strange, considering she just finished playing all of \"Take On Me\" last episode—but this episode in particular feels like it’s trying to cram in a lot of relevant bits of plot from the game in a very limited span of time. Ellie had been playing \"Future Days\" by Pearl Jam. The song also appears inThe Last of Us Part II; it's used in a scene where Joel tells Ellie that he'll teach her how to play guitar. (It is also the title of the TV show’s season two premiere.) In the game, Joel sits down and plays the first verse of the song, singing lyrics that mapveryclosely to how Joel feels about Ellie. Showing Ellie strum out the beginning of the song here likely means we'll see this version of Joel (Pedro Pascal) crooning Eddie Vedder's lyrics himself in a future flashback. But the rest of the episode is quite grim. The only gap in the WLF patrols lies through a warehouse full of infected—the smart, stalking kind from the premiere. Ellie and Dina are nearly overrun before they’re saved by Jesse (Young Mazino), who reveals he's been following them with Tommy (Gabriel Luna, mentioned but not yet present) this whole time. Unfortunately, Jesse's rescue involves very loud gunfire, which draws the attention of the WLF. Under fire, the trio escapes to a nearby park that the WLF will not follow them into, because it's controlled by the Seraphites. Almost immediately, Ellie and company run into the cult members, who are performing a ritual disembowelment of a captured WLF soldier. The whole thing is abrupt and cartoonish, as we still don't really know any of the Seraphites the way we do WLF members—even the cruel ones like Issac Dixon. We won't be getting to know them here either, as they spot Dina and fire an arrow into her leg, prompting the group to split up. Ellie draws their attention running one direction as she fires her gun, while Jesse carries Dina off to safety. The logistics of this scene are strange. This is the last we see of Jesse and Dina, and between the Seraphites we saw in the park and the WLF waiting outside the park, it's hard to feel good about their chances of making it out. Meanwhile, Ellie finds a way to sneak into the hospital—a strange choice, since Dina has just told Ellie that she loves her. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Ellie to barrel onward without making sure Dina is safe. As far as adaptation quirks go, what's happening here is largely a ruthless excision. The show is truncating large swathes ofThe Last of Us Part IIthat aren't very plot heavy, but do a lot for pacing, underlining how determined Ellie is. In a video game where solo characters are regularly expected to take on entire armies, excessive gunfights are par for the course. But in live-action television, they would strain credulity. What we get in \"Feel Her Love,\" then, is some pretty severe tonal whiplash, as the episode's home stretch suddenly pivots to Ellie's cold-blooded hunt for Nora (Tati Gabrielle), the first member of Abby's (Kaitlyn Dever) team she's been able to track down. It's all in service of an ending that is controversial by design, as was the comparable moment in the video game. After chasing Nora through the hospital, she and Ellie end up in the basement, overrun by spores. As Ellie looks for Nora, you can see two men—one of whom is presumably Leon from the prologue—still alive and wheezing spores into the air. Eventually, Ellie corners Nora, who is choking on the spores. Nora, who remembered Ellie from Joel's murder (and doesn't regret the incident one bit), now puts together that Ellie is the rumored immune girl. In a fit of fury, she asks if Ellie knows what Joel did—how he doomed the world to save Ellie. Ellie says she knows, then beats Nora to death with a pipe. It’s one thing forThe Last of Usto depict Elliesayingthat she's going to kill Abby and her team. But watching her follow through on that threat is another. It's a dark, uncomfortable turn—one that Mazin and directorStephen Williamsseem to concede might be hard for viewers to accept, as the episode doesn't end there. Instead, there's a quick cutaway to a flashback. Ellie is younger, and happier, and Joel is telling her it's time to go. It seems like next week, we'll be going to a happier place, the flashback episode that's been teased all season—but with only two episodes left to go, this seems like a very precarious place forThe Last of Usto pause.

    "article_text": "Authorities say 17-month-old girl had not received vaccine, while 13-year-old girl had been inoculated but suffered from underlying health conditions Two children have fallen seriously ill with Covid-19 in Hong Kong, with one in a critical condition, prompting renewed calls for high-risk groups to get inoculated amid a rising trend of infections. According to the Centre for Health Protection, a 17-month-old girl, previously in good health but unvaccinated, developed a fever and cough on Friday. She sought medical help at Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam on Sunday before being admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit. Her respiratory specimen tested positive for the virus that caused Covid-19, as well as adenovirus and rhinovirus, the centre said. Doctors diagnosed her with Covid-19, adenovirus and rhinovirus co-infection, complicated by croup. She remained in a critical condition. An investigation by the centre showed she had not received a Covid-19 vaccine and had no travel history during the incubation period. The second case involved a 13-year-old girl with underlying health conditions. She developed shortness of breath on Friday and sought care at the same hospital on the same day. She was also admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit.",

St Teresa’s Hospital, a private facility in Kowloon City, confirmed to the Post the air-conditioning system for its operating theatres broke down on July 31 of last year. The fault resulted in condensation dripping from surgical lights, forcing staff members in some operating rooms to resort to using an umbrella, according to surgeon Dr Liu Chi-leung. Liu, who was performing an operation in one of the affected theatres, told the Post the stability of an endoscope he was using might have been affected by the sudden rise in humidity and a surgical display was disrupted for about five minutes. “All the [surgical] apparatus were dripping with water and infected,” Liu said. “It was a catastrophic scene.” In response to Post inquiries, the private hospital said the chillers of its air-conditioning system for the operating theatres stopped working at around 7pm on the day in question.",

    "title": "First white South Africans arrive in US after Trump grants them refugee status",
    "article_text": "The first group of white South Africans granted refugee status by Donald Trump’s administration has arrived in the US, stirring controversy inSouth Africaas the US president declared the Afrikaners victims of a “genocide”. The Afrikaners, a minority descended from mainly Dutch colonists, were met at Dulles international airport outsideWashington DCby the US deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, and deputy secretary of homeland security, Troy Edgar, with many given US flags to wave. Reuters reported that the group numbered 59 adults and children, citing a state department official, while Associated Press said there were 49. At Dulles airport, Landau told the assembled white South Africans: “It is such an honour for us to receive you here today … it makes me so happy to see you with our flag in your hands. He invoked his family’s history, saying: “My own father was born in Europe and had to leave his country when Hitler came in … We respect what you have had to deal with these last few years.” He added: “We’re sending a clear message that the United States really rejects the egregious persecution of people on the basis of race in South Africa.” On the same day the group arrived in the US, Trump’s government also ended legal protections that had temporarily protected Afghans from deportation, citing an improved security situation in the country, which is ruled by the Taliban. One consideration for resettling Afrikaners not Afghans was that “they could be easily assimilated into our country,” Landau told reporters at the airport. Trumpsuspended the US refugee settlementprogramme in January, leavingmore than 100,000 peopleapproved for refugee resettlement stranded. Then, in February, hesigned an executive orderdirecting officials to grant refugee status to Afrikaners, whose leaders ruled during apartheid while violently repressing the Black majority. “It’s a genocide that’s taking place,” Trump told reporters at the White House, when asked why white South Africans were being prioritised for resettlement above victims of famine and war elsewhere on the continent, echoing a far-right conspiracy theory that has also been amplified by hisSouth African-born billionaire adviser Elon Musk. Trump added that the Afrikaners’ race “makes no difference to me”. He said South Africa’s leaders were travelling to meet him next week, but that he would not attend the G20 leaders’ meeting in Johannesburg in November unless the “situation is taken care of”. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion South Africa’s president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said at a conference in Ivory Coast that he had told Trump by phone that he had received false information about white South Africans being discriminated against, from people who disagreed with government efforts to redress the racial inequalities that still persist three decades after white minority rule ended. “We think that the American government has got the wrong end of the stick here, but we’ll continue talking to them,” he said. White South Africans typically have 20 times the wealth of Black people, according to anarticlein the Review of Political Economy. The Black South Africanunemployment rate is 46.1%, compared with 9.2% for white people. Laura Thompson Osuri, executive director ofHomes Not Borders, a refugee care non-profit in the Washington area, stood in the airport check-in area with a sign reading: “Refugee. Noun. A person who has been forced to leave his or her country due to persecution, war or violence. Afrikaners are not refugees.” Osuri said of Trump’s policy: “It’s for showing: ‘Look at us. We do welcome people as long as they look like us.’” Democrats also condemned the Afrikaners’ resettlement. The Maryland senator Chris Van Hollentold a thinktank event: “To watch the Trump administration apply what I call their global apartheid policy … is just an outrageous insult to the whole idea of our country.” Meanwhile, the Episcopal church said it wasending its decades-long work with the US government supporting refugees, after it was asked to help resettle the white South Africans, citing its “commitment to racial justice and reconciliation”.",

    "title": "Trump could take part in Russia-Ukraine talks",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has said he expects a“good result”from possible direct talks between Moscow and Kiev, suggesting he may participate himself. A resumption of direct negotiations between the two sides, which was proposed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, could take place in Istanbul, Türkiye on May 15. Speaking at a press conference on Monday, the US president called the potential talks a“very important”event. “I think you may have a good result at the Thursday meeting in Türkiye between Russia and Ukraine. I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over. I don’t know where I’m going to be on Thursday, I’ve got so many meetings, but I was thinking about actually flying over there,”Trump said. Trump’s suggestion was welcomed by Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky, who described it as the“right idea”and reiterated his claim that he was ready to meet Putin in person. Thus far, Moscow has remained silent on the prospect of the Russian leader traveling to Türkiye for negotiations. In proposing a return to direct negotiations, the Russian president reiterated Moscow’s commitment to resolving the crisis. The settlement process must start with talks, Putin stressed, and the negotiations could ultimately lead to“some kind of new truce and a new ceasefire.” “We are set on serious negotiations with Ukraine. Their aim is to eliminate the root causes of the conflict and to achieve a long-term lasting peace for a historical perspective,”the president said. The offer has met a mixed reaction from Kiev and its backers, who continue to insist on their demand that any negotiations must be preceded by the establishment of at least a 30-day truce. However, Putin’s proposal was backed by Trump, who urged Kiev to“immediately”accept it. Following Trump’s call, Kiev seemingly shifted its position, and Zelensky proclaimed his readiness to participate in the meeting, while reiterating the truce demand. Türkiye has welcomed the initiative and expressed a readiness to host the talks. However, the Turkish presidency sent a somewhat ambiguous message on the matter on Monday, simultaneously stating that it was an opportunity that should not be missed but also that a ceasefire would have created the“necessary environment”for the negotiations.",
