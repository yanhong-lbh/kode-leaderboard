Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe has been accused of sexual assault and battery in a $50 million lawsuit filed on Sunday, according to multiple reports. The formerNFLplayer denied all accusations in a statement through his attorney on Monday, calling the civil suit an attempt to \"blackmail\" him. According to the lawsuit obtained byProFootballTalk,Sharpe was accused of assault, sexual assault, battery and sexual battery. The 13-page complaint, filed in a Nevada state court, accused the three-time Super Bowl champion of engaging \"in the intentional infliction of emotional distress.\" Shannon Sharpe(Cindy Ord/Getty Images for SiriusXM) The plaintiff claimed that the two began a \"rocky consensual relationship\" sometime in 2023, which lasted around two years. According toUSA Today,the plaintiff was 19 at the time that she met Sharpe. She claimed she was sexually assaulted on two occasions, once in October 2024 and again in January of this year.

After many months of manipulating and controlling Plaintiff—a woman more than thirty years younger than he—and repeatedly threatening to brutally choke and violently slap her, Sharpe refused to accept the answer no and raped Plaintiff, despite her sobbing and repeated screams of ‘no.’\" The woman is seeking $50 million and damages and is being represented by attorney Tony Buzbee, who won settlements in favor of the women who accused NFL quarterbackDeshaun Watsonof assault.

Davis, responded to the lawsuit ina lengthy statementthe former tight end shared to his social media accounts. In the message, Davis shared sexually explicit messages that he said the plaintiff sent to Sharpe. Davis called the lawsuit \"a blatant and cynical attempt to shake down Mr. Sharpe for millions of dollars.\" \"It is filled with lies, distortions, and misrepresentations and it will not succeed. In her effort to extract a large financial settlement, [plaintiff] presented Mr. Sharpe with a secretly recorded video of a consensual sexual encounter. We believe the video has been heavily edited and taken entirely out of context, crafted to falsely portray a consensual act as non-consensual.\" Davis said releasing the messages between the plaintiff and Sharpe \"clearly indicate the nature of their relationship was consensual and sexual in nature in many cases, initiated by her with specific and graphic requests.\" Shannon Sharpe(Paras Griffin/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Mr. Sharpe categorically denies all allegations of coercion or misconduct – especially the gross lie of ‘rape’ – and will not submit to what he sees as an egregious attempt at blackmail,\" Davis continued. \"He stands firmly by the truth and is prepared to fight these false claims vigorously in court.

    "title": "Scott Peterson asks for murder conviction to be tossed, citing 'substantial new evidence'",
    "article_text": "Fox Nation's 'Scott Peterson: The Appeal of a Convicted Killer' takes a deep dive into new evidence, eyewitness accounts and the convicted killer's years-long quest to be exonerated. Lawyers forScott Petersonfiled a petition on Monday which they say contains evidence showing the 52-year-old didn't murder his unborn son and wife in 2002. TheLos AngelesInnocence Project, which has taken on Peterson's case, filed a writ of habeas corpus on Monday which the group claimed in a press release contains \"substantial new evidence.\" Peterson's lawyers claimed in the petition Peterson's rights to due process and a fair trial were denied during his 2004 trial, arguing his conviction should be overturned. \"This …Writ of Habeas Corpus presents new evidence that was not available at the time of trial, supports Petitioner’s claim of innocence, and shows he was wrongfully convicted,\" the petition filed on Monday states. \"This new evidence undermines the prosecution's entire circumstantial case against Petitioner, and shows that the jury relied on false evidence, including false scientific evidence, to convict him.\" Peterson's lawyers argued in the filing that the case against him was \"entirely circumstantial,\" adding that \"no direct, physical or forensic evidence was found supporting any part of the prosecution’s theory, or otherwise implicating Petitioner.\" WHAT SCOTT PETERSON'S RECENT COURT WIN COULD MEAN FOR HIS YEARSLONG QUEST FOR FREEDOM Scott Peterson and Laci Peterson in a still photo appearing in the forthcoming docuseries, \"American Murder: Laci Peterson.\"(Courtesy of Netflix) Scott Peterson, seated, speaks to attorney Pat Harris during a break in a hearing at the San Mateo County Superior Court in Redwood City, Calif., Friday, Feb. 25, 2022.

Laci Peterson disappeared from the couple's Modesto, California home on Christmas Eve in late 2002. A pedestrian found her unborn son's body, decomposed at the time, in the San Francisco Bay in April 2003. Lawyers argued in Monday's filing that jurors didn't hear evidence which they think would have impacted the trial's outcome and accused prosecutors of potentially destroying evidence.

    "title": "Trump will attend Pope Francis' funeral in Rome despite contentious past: 'Look forward to being there!'",
    "article_text": "Fox News host Will Cain has the latest on the mourning of the pontiff on 'The Will Cain Show.' President Trump indicated Monday – following news of Pope Francis's death – that he and first lady Melania Trump will be attending the Pope's funeral atthe Vatican,despite the president's somewhat contentious history with the late leader of the Catholic Church. Traditionally, papal funerals take place four to six days following their death, so Francis's funeral is expected to take place before the end of the month. Vatican spokesperson Matteo Brunitold reportersthat the General Congregation of Cardinals will occur Tuesday morning, during which an exact date for the funeral should be decided. \"Melania and I will be going to the funeral ofPope Francis,in Rome,\" Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social on Monday afternoon. \"We look forward to being there!\" POPE FRANCIS' FUNERAL WILL BE SIMPLIFIED VERSION OF PAST PAPAL FUNERALS, PER HIS CHANGE OF PAPAL FUNERAL RITES Pope Francis meets President  Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at the Apostolic Palace on May 24, 2017 in Vatican City, Vatican.(Vatican Pool/Getty Images) Trump's announcement that he would be traveling to Rome for the ceremony followed a separate announcement he made earlier in the day indicating that he had ordered all American flags on government grounds, including military installments and embassies abroad, to fly at half-staff until sunset Monday. Trump's relationship with Pope Francis over the years was one marked by ideological differences and – at times – tension. Amid Trump's first run for office, Pope Francis criticized one of Trump's signature campaign promises ofbuilding a wall along the southern border,calling the move \"not Christian\" in 2016. POPE FRANCIS AND US PRESIDENTS: A LOOK BACK AT HIS LEGACY WITH THE NATION'S LEADERS \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\" Francis told reporters during a mid-flight interview on his way to Mexico in 2016, according to a translation from the Associated Press. Pope Francis criticized President Trump's mass deportation plan on Sunday during an interview calling it a \"disgrace.\"(Photo by TIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty Images/ Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images) Trump, meanwhile, shot back at the pontiff's remarks, arguing it was \"disgraceful\" for the Pope, or any religious leader for that matter, to question another person's faith. \"If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, which as everyone knows is ISIS's ultimate trophy, I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed thatDonald Trumpwould have been President because this would not have happened,\" Trump said ina statementreleased by his team following the Pope's criticism. \"ISIS would have been eradicated unlike what is happening now with our all talk, no action politicians.\" TRUMP, WORLD LEADERS REACT TO DEATH OF POPE FRANCIS During Francis's life he also took aim at increasing nationalistic sentiments around the world, criticism that implicitly targeted Trump's \"America First\" agenda. Francis was also a believer in climate change posing a major problem for society, something Trump also differed with him on. In both Trump's first and second terms, he has pulled the U.S. out of the international Paris Climate Accords, which is an international initiative aimed at mitigating global warming. Pope Francis meets the President of United States of America Donald Trump in the Private Library of the Apostolic Palace with his wife Melania, his daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. Vatican City, May 24, 2017.(Vatican/Pool/Galazka/Archivio Grzegorz Galazka/Mondadori via Getty Images) Trump, who considers himself a Christian but is not a Catholic, only met with Francis once during his first term. By contrast,Joe Biden,who is a confirmed Catholic, met with Francis in-person on multiple occasions throughout his single-term presidency. Trump's Vice PresidentJ.D. Vance,a Catholic himself, was notably one of the Pope's last visitors, seeing him on Easter Sunday – one day before Francis passed.

    "article_text": "Fox News Digital spoke with Navy SEAL veterans and the CEO of VetComm about the sewage \"crisis\" sickening SEAL candidates as they train off the coast of San Diego County. \"Disgusting,\" said Navy SEAL veteran Rob Sweetman in describing the smell and mist ofMexican sewage spewinginto U.S. waters as he stood on a hill overlooking the Tijuana River estuary in California. Sweetman, a Navy veteran who served on the SEALs for eight years, spoke to Fox News Digital to sound the alarm on a water crisis rocking the San Diego area, including where SEALs train, taking a camera with him to show viewers firsthand how the contaminated water flows into the U.S. Just one mile away from where Sweetman spoke, SEALs and candidates train in the same water, which has sickened more than 1,000 candidates in a five-year period, per a Department of Defense watchdog report released in February. San Diego and the surrounding area are in a clean-water crisis that has raged for decades, but it is finding revived concern from theTrump administrationas SEALs and local veterans warn of a \"national security crisis\" that they say is on par with the Camp Lejeune, North Carolina,water crisis. Thousands of Marines and others were sickened  at North Carolina's Camp Lejeune base between 1953 and 1987 as a result of water contaminated by industrial solvents used to drink, bathe and cook at the training facilities and on-base housing. EPA CHIEF TAKES ON MEXICAN 'SEWAGE CRISIS' FLOWING INTO US WATERS WHERE NAVY SEALS TRAIN The Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) class participates in a surf passage training exercise at Naval Amphibious Base Coronado in Coronado, California.(Getty Images) Kate Monroe, a Marine Corps veteran and CEO of VetComm — which advocates for disabled veterans and those navigating the VA's complicated health system — told Fox Digital in an April Zoom interview, \"San Diego County is as big as some states. It's giant. Millions of people live here and are breathing the air of this water. It goes well beyond the military. It's a crisis. It's a FEMA-level travesty, and we have just been hiding it.\" The Navy has deep roots in the San Diego area, with the United States Naval Special Warfare Command headquartered in America's Finest City and where Navy SEAL candidates complete their arduous six-month Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL (BUD/S) at the Naval Amphibious Base Coronado. Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses among SEAL candidates between January 2019 and May 2023 alone.(Jeff Gum) The sewage problem flowing fromneighboring Mexico into the U.S.has percolated in San Diego for years. But the water crisis hit crisis level when it was reported in 2024 that 44 billion gallons of contaminated water imbued with raw sewage was released along the California coast in 2023, the most on record since at least 2000, the Los Angeles Times reported at the time. The issue of sewage water flowing into U.S. waters is largely attributed to outdated wastewater infrastructure across the southern border, local media outletsrecently reported, with Mexico reportedly in the midst of addressing its infrastructure to curb the leaks of sewage water. The Tijuana River has for decades been plagued by sewage and waste that has affected its beaches and neighboring San Diego. In February, the Department of Defense's inspector general released a report finding that the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses among SEAL candidates between January 2019 and May 2023 alone. Navy SEAL trainees are shown during Hell Week.(Getty Images) \"Navy SEAL candidate exposure to contaminated water occurred because (Naval Special Warfare Command) did not follow San Diego County's Beach and Bay Water Quality Program's beach closure postings,\" the inspector general report found. \"As a result of Navy SEAL candidate exposure to contaminated water during training, candidates are presented with increased health risks and NAVSPECWARCOM's training mission could be impacted.\" It was when Monroe, who is well-versed with veteran health through VetComm, was working with SEALs who were retiring that she realized the severity of the San Diego water pollution of the past few years. She observed an increase in health claims related to intestinal issues and \"weird cancers,\" which was a departure from typical claims related to PTSD or orthopedic ailments. US SENATOR BLASTS PRESIDENT OF MEXICO, SAYS TOXIC SEWAGE DUMP THREATENS ‘NATIONAL SECURITY’ \"I started creating relationships with the SEAL teams, the people that were exiting the SEALs, you know, at 14 years, 20 years, nearing their retirement,\" Monroe told Fox News Digital. \"And the claims that we were making for these guys were surprising to me because a lot of them, they have combat PTSD, a lot of orthopedic issues. But we were having guys coming to us with, like, IBS, GERD, skin issues, weird cancers, and they were all attributing it to their time spent in San Diego training to be a SEAL in that water here that we have in San Diego.\" Swimming and spending time in water contaminated with feces can lead to a host of illnesses, including bacterial, viral and parasitic infections that leave people nauseous, vomiting and rushing to the bathroom. Navy SEAL vet Jeff Gumwas only days from entering the SEAL's aptly named Hell Week — the fourth week of basic conditioning for SEAL candidates —when nausea hit him. He was trapped in a cycle of drinking water and vomiting when he realized a serious illness had its grips on him. Gum is a retired SEAL who served from 2007 to 2017 and was exposed to the contaminated water in 2008 during BUD/S training off the San Diego coast. Navy SEAL vet Jeff Gum(Jeff Gum) \"I couldn't stop,\" Gum recounted of how he couldn't keep water down without vomiting. \"You never really want to go to medical because they can pull you out or make you get rolled to the next class, but I couldn't even drink water without throwing up. It's the only time in my whole life that this has happened.\" Gum's nausea overcame him on a Friday in 2008, with Hell Week kicking off that Sunday night. Hell Week is a more than five-day training that puts candidates through rigorous training, including cold-water immersion, \"surf torture,\" buoy swims, mud runs, all while operating on minimal sleep. SAN DIEGO SUBURB FACES 'SEWAGE CRISIS' FROM LOCAL BEACH Navy SEAL vet Jeff Gum in Iraq.(Jeff Gum) \"The sun goes down, and the instructors come out with big machine guns, that kicks it off,\" Gum said of how Hell Week began. \"We run out to the beach, right into the ocean. You spend the rest of the week soaking wet, covered in sand. And everywhere you go, you have a 200-pound boat on your head that you and your boat crew of six to seven guys will share the weight of, and you just run everywhere.\" Hell Week training for the SEALs includes carrying boats.(Getty Images) \"You're just in the water. There's no escaping it. It's part of what makes BUD/S BUD/S. And it's part of what makes the Navy SEALs America's premier maritime special operators,\" he said. \"There's not getting around how comfortable we have to be in the water. Cold, wet, miserable, doesn't matter, we suck it up and we do it.\" MEXICO IS POISONING SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN A BORDER CRISIS ALMOST NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT Gum received IVs the weekend ahead of Hell Week and was able to keep food and water down by the time the intense training began, but he had been diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis, commonly known as the stomach flu and highly contagious, which then morphed into rhabdomyolysis due to exerting so much energy while dehydrated from viral gastroenteritis Rhabdomyolysis is a serious illness that causes muscle to break down quickly and can lead to \"muscle death\" and the release of high levels of myoglobin in the blood that can injure a person's kidneys. The border fence between Imperial Beach near San Ysidro, California, right, and Playas de Tijuana near Tijuana, Mexico.(Getty Images) Gum failed the first phase of BUD/S, but he was granted permission to return to training for a second time after senior leaders saw he had viral gastroenteritis. Gum again went through the first phase of BUD/S, but again he went to medical, where tests showed that his \"blood came back toxic\" from rhabdomyolysis. The SEAL was put on medical leave and able to fully recover in his home state of Pennsylvania before he \"crushed\" the hellish training on his third try. He served on SEAL Team Five, deployed to Fallujah, Iraq, and taught combatives and prisoner handling to SEAL trainees in San Diego from 2013 until his retirement in 2017. Sweetman told Fox Digital that \"everyone who goes through training is going to get sick.\" Tijuana, Mexico, top, and San Diego(Getty Images) \"They're going to get infections, and it's terrible,\" Sweetman told Fox Digital in an April Zoom interview. \"And some might argue that this is Navy SEAL training. You have to go through the toughest conditions to be able to survive and make it. I would say that it's gotten a little bit out of hand.\" The SEAL vet, who lives in the San Diego area, said the issue has gotten worse in recent years as Tijuana's population grows. I TRAINED WITH THE NAVY SEALS FOR A DAY. THIS IS WHAT I LEARNED \"When I went through training, it was absolutely a thing that they'd shut down the Imperial Beach because the ocean water was so bad, because the waste coming from Tijuana had infected the water,\" Sweetman said. \"You could always smell it. And oftentimes, even in the bay, we'd need to wash our wet suit after being out on a swim.\" Rob Sweetman served eight years as a Navy SEAL.(Rob Sweetman) \"Now, some of the training causes us to be deeply immersed in the water, and infections and all types of things can come up from being in the water. But I'll say that it has gotten significantly worse as the population has doubled in Tijuana.\" Raw sewage from Tijuana is flowing into the San Diego area, causing illness to spread among SEALs and candidates.(Rob Sweetman) Gum and Monroe both said that water issue is a crisis, with Gum identifying itas a national securitycrisis that could cull well-suited candidates from the SEALs due to acute illnesses as well as sicken active SEALs. \"This is a huge national crisis,\" he said. \"Like half the SEAL teams are located in San Diego, the other half are in Virginia Beach. So when you've got half the SEAL teams who are getting exposed to this, then it's a major issue.\" Monroe called it the \"next Camp Lejeune\" crisis, which sickened Marines with contaminated drinking water at the North Carolina Marine Corps base camp for nearly three decades. The crisis has cost the U.S. billions of dollars, including legal costs and settlements to vets and their families. \"This is going to be, in my opinion, the next Camp Lejeune water problem that cost our government $21 to $25 billion,\" she said. \"That's just in the compensation directly, like the lawsuit portion of it. That doesn't cover all the compensation you have to pay these veterans tax-free for the rest of their lives. I would say that this issue here in San Diego, if you look at it over the time that people have been training here, you're looking at another $21 to $25 billion, plus all of the compensation that's going to come. It would be cheaper for our country to fix this than it would to allow it to continue.\" The three veterans who spoke to Fox Digital all responded with optimism that the Trump administration will tackle the crisis and end it.

We are fully committed to ensuring warfighters at U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command train in a safe environment.\" Mexican sewage flows into the U.S.(Rob Sweetman) Ahead of Zeldin's visit, the water flowing from Mexico into the U.S. is as \"nasty\" as ever, according to Sweetman. \"What I see here is a tremendous amount of green, nasty water,\" Sweetman said while pointing at the murky water.\"I mean, you can smell it. This is disgusting. As it pours through, it doesn't clear up. There's no clarity to it. It just turns into a foam.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top sports headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Former presidentJoe Biden'sadministration attempted to give transgender athletes further protections in its revision of Title IX, but his reported true feelings were kept to himself. The proposal would have redefined sex inTitle IXas \"gender identity,\" but the proposal was ultimately struck down by a federal judge in January, less than two weeks before President Donald Trump took office a second time. However, a new report by theNew York Timessays that Biden himself did not agree with trans athletes participating in women's and girls sports. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM A former aide to Jill Biden recently told The Hill that former President Biden's handlers need to read the Democratic \"anger\" in the room and keep Biden away from the spotlight.(Jacquelyn Martin/AP/Bloomberg via Getty Images) \"According to a number of former Biden-administration officials, there remained a simmering debate inside the administration about whether those Title IX protections should extend to sports,\" the Times reported, saying that \"one side…maintained that there was no legal difference between letting trans students use bathrooms that align with their gender identity and letting trans student athletes play on sports teams that align with their gender identity.\" However, Biden was \"on the other side…who believed that the competitive, zero-sum nature of sports made them different from bathrooms — that some transgender athletes would enjoy unfair physical advantages over women. \"Most important, one of the officials holding this view was Biden himself,\" the Times wrote. The Times received a quote from a former Biden administration official who said Biden was \"particularly focused on the competition issue.\" Joe Biden reportedly was against transgender athletes in sports.(Associated Press) WASHINGTON FAILS TO PASS PROPOSALS THAT WOULD RESTRICT TRANS ATHLETES FROM COMPETING AGAINST BIOLOGICAL GIRLS However, the administration was mostly silent until 2023, because they didn't want to \"delve any deeper into the…debate ahead of the 2022 midterms.\" Recent polling shows that roughly 80% of Americans side with Biden's reported feelings on the issue. An agent for Biden did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Title IX, which was passed into law in 1972, prohibited sex-based discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. It stated, \"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" Tapper insisted that he has been curious about Biden's mental sharpness for years.(Screenshot/Biden speech) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump has since signed an executive order that bars transgender athletes from competing against biological girls and sports, but several states have defied the order,most notably Maine, which resulted in a freeze of federal funding.

    "title": "Harvard sues Trump administration over 'unlawful' multibillion dollar budget cuts",
    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams has the latest on questions over federal funding on 'America Reports.' Harvard Universityhas filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its \"unlawful\" multibillion dollar freeze of research funding to the university. \"Moments ago, we filed a lawsuit to halt the funding freeze because it is unlawful and beyond the government’s authority,\" Harvard President Alan Garber wrote in a post on X. The move comes just one day after the Trump administration planned to cut another $1 billion in federal grants and contracts to the university, according to the Wall Street Journal, which is in addition to the $2.2 billion freeze that was announced last week. In response to the lawsuit, a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital that Harvard's \"gravy train of federal assistance\" is coming to an end. TRUMP ADMINISTRATION PLANS TO PULL $1 BILLION IN FUNDING FROM HARVARD AMID CLASH WITH UNIVERSITY: REPORT Harvard sued the Trump administration in federal court on Monday over its \"unlawful\" multibillion dollar cuts to the university’s research funding. \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end,\" the statement read. \"Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege.\" In the 51-page complaint obtained by Fox News Digital, Harvard accused theTrump administrationof unlawfully freezing billions in research funding to pressure the university into restructuring its governance, academic programs and hiring practices. \"The tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: Allow the Government to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution’s ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions,\" Harvard’s lawyers wrote in the Monday filing. The complaint continued, stating that the \"University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.\" \"No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,\" it said. The complaint argues that the freeze violates the First Amendment by \"imposing viewpoint-based conditions on Harvard’s funding.\" ANTI-ISRAEL HARVARD STUDENTS CONSPIRE TO SMEAR LAW FIRMS CRITICAL OF CAMPUS ANTISEMITISM: REPORT Garber said in his message that \"the consequences of the government’s overreach will be severe and long-lasting,\" just days after the White House asked theInternal Revenue Service(IRS) to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status over its alleged failure to address antisemitism on campus. \"The government has cited the University’s response to antisemitism as a justification for its unlawful action. As a Jew and as an American, I know very well that there are valid concerns about rising antisemitism. To address it effectively requires understanding, intention, and vigilance. Harvard takes that work seriously. We will continue to fight hate with the urgency it demands as we fully comply with our obligations under the law. That is not only our legal responsibility. It is our moral imperative,\" - Harvard University President Alan Garber The complaint also addressed the school's commitment toaddressing antisemitism,and acknowledged that \"important steps have been taken,\" but \"there is still much work to do.\" \"Harvard is committed to combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms of bigotry\" and to \"broaden[ing] the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within [its] community,\" the complaint said, in part. COLLEGE PRESIDENT WHOSE SCHOOL TAKES NO FED FUNDING SAYS HARVARD 'COULD MAKE IT ON THEIR OWN' AFTER TRUMP CUTS The Trump administration announced it was freezing over $2 billion in grants and contracts after Harvard University said it would not comply with federal demands regarding antisemitism.(Reuters/Nicholas Pfosi) The complaint argues that the administration cannot tie a \"rational connection\" between antisemitism and the federal funding the university receives for research purposes. \"The Government has not—and cannot—identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America’s position as a global leader in innovation,\" the complaint reads. Additionally, the complaint claims that the \"Government has not acknowledged the significant consequences that the indefinite freeze of billions of dollars in federal research funding will have on Harvard’s research program.\" In March, the Justice Department began a \"comprehensive review\" of the school's federal contracts and government-funded grants. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)canceled $2.7 millionin DHS grants to the university. Garber also acknowledged the recent reports, saying they \"are hard-hitting and painful.\" \"No one in our community should experience bias, intolerance, or bigotry. We believe adoption of the recommendations and other measures will go far toward eradicating those evils on our campus,\" Garber said. In a recent social media post, Trump claimed that Harvard had \"lost its way\" and didn't deserve federal funding. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and ‘birdbrains’ who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students and so-called ‘future leaders,'\" Trump wrote. \"Look just to the recent past at their plagiarizing President, who so greatly embarrassed Harvard before the United States Congress. \"Harvard is a JOKE, teaches Hate and Stupidity, and shouldno longer receive Federal Funds.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment.

    "title": "Schumer's 'Apprentice' praise of Trump goes viral: 'Going to go places'",
    "article_text": "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said President Donald Trump is causing a \"constitutional crisis\" amidst his feud with a federal judge who ordered the president to stop deportation flights being conducted under the Alien Enemies Act. With PresidentDonald Trump'sformer reality TV show \"The Apprentice,\" streaming on Amazon Prime as of last month, politically astute viewers across the political spectrum have zeroed in on an episode from when Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., now one of the president's biggest political detractors, praised his fellow New Yorker as a business prodigy. During Season 5, Episode 8, of \"The Apprentice\" in 2006, contestants were given a challenge — as was typical during each episode — and the winners of said challenge got the chance to fly to the nation's capital and have breakfast withSen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.During the breakfast, Schumer sought to draw parallels between his family and Trump's, while also showering praise on the president, telling the contestants he always knew Trump, even as a young person, \"was going to go places.\" \"I was born in Brooklyn, the same place where Donald Trump's family comes from,\" Schumer reminisced with the contestants during breakfast at the famous Hay-Adams hotel inWashington, D.C.\"His father, and my grandfather, were builders together in Brooklyn.\" \"Wow!?\" one contestant could be heard replying. \"Really?\" asked another. \"Yeah!,\" Schumer responded to the room. FLASHBACK: ‘OPRAH WINFREY ONCE CALLED TRUMP A ’FOLK HERO,' A CONTRAST TO COMMENTS MADE DURING THE DNC Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., (LEFT) appeared on an episode of President Donald Trump's former reality television show \"The Apprentice,\" during which the pair were described as \"good friends\" and Schumer lauded Trump for his business acumen.(GETTY IMAGES/FOX NEWS) The show then cut to Schumer lauding Trump as a business prodigy. \"Even when [Trump] was much younger, you knew that he was going to go places,\" Schumer said, before a voice-over from one of the contestants present at the breakfast reiterated that \"Sen. Schumer and Mr. Trump are good friends.\" Despite Schumer's apparent friendly sentiment towards the president in 2006, as evidenced by his appearance on \"The Apprentice,\" the Democratic New York senator told Politico in 2016, ahead of Trump's first term, that, \"[Trump] was not my friend.\" Rather, Schumer described his relationship with Trump as a \"casual acquaintance.\" CHUCK SCHUMER FACING ‘UPHILL FIGHT’ AMID LEADERSHIP DOUBTS: ‘MATTER OF WHEN, NOT IF’ \"Donald Trumpis a lawless, angry man,\" Schumer said of the president during an interview last month. \"The fact that The Apprentice President Donald ‘You’re Fired’ Trump is refusing to hold people accountable just shows how weak he is,\" Schumer added in a post on social media earlier this month. Sen. Chuck Schumer's vehement animosity towards Donald Trump belies earlier kind things he'd said of the future president well before his run for office.(AP/Getty Images) Considering Schumer's vehement animosity towards Trump today, Michigan State GOP Sen. Aric Nesbitt, the Michigan Senate's minority leader, remarked \"How things change…\" in a post that highlighted the resurfaced clip of Schumer's scene on \"The Apprentice.\" But it's not just Republicans having fun at Schumer's expense. \"As Schumer sells outour Constitutionand democracy, you just gotta watch this clip of him sucking up to Trump on an episode of the Apprentice,\" remarked former Democratic Rhode Island legislator Aaron Regunberg. \"What a world class slug of a man.\" Shortly before taking office during his first term, Trump was asked by MSNBC's Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski about whether he will be able to get along withDemocratic leaders in Congress,such as Schumer. Trump struck a positive chord, saying at the time that he thought he would \"be able to get along well with Chuck Schumer.\" ELON MUSK SCRAPS WITH CHUCK SCHUMER, SUGGESTING THE SENATOR PROFITS FROM GOVERNMENT FRAUD \"I was always very good with Schumer. I was close to Schumer in many ways,\" Trump said at the time. As time has progressed, however, Trump's rhetoric towards Schumer has become increasingly critical of the senator, as the pair of political heavyweights continue to fight over whatever political issue is dominating Washington each week. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of N.Y., seated at a Senate Rules and Administration Committee.(Elizabeth Frantz/Pool via AP) Recently, Trump took a jab at Schumer's alleged lack of support for the Jewish community amid therise in antisemitism,particularly on college campuses, in the wake of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attacks against innocent Israelis. Schumer is Jewish. CHUCK SCHUMER WARNS ABOUT THE DANGERS OF ANTISEMITISM ON ‘THE VIEW’ \"Schumer is a Palestinian, as far as I’m concerned,\" Trump told reporters from the Oval Office last month. \"He’s become a Palestinian. He used to be Jewish. He’s not Jewish anymore.\" Trump's comments from earlier this month also mirror a similar sentiment he relayed about Schumer during his most recent campaign for the presidency, referring to him as a \"proud member of Hamas.\" In addition to Schumer, other high-profile public figures have praised the now-president, only to become his political enemy years later. In a 1988 interview withOprah Winfrey,the celebrity talk show host appeared to be amazed at Americans’ \"fascination\" with Donald Trump and even described him as a \"folk hero\" for being so popular.

Nonetheless, following the tragic politically motivated violence in Charlottesville during Trump's first term, Simmonsreportedly criticizedhis \"friend\" for leading the legacy of a \"great divider,\" and a \"destroyer of the environment and … everything we as Americans have fought so hard to call ours.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Schumer's office for comment but did not receive a reply in time for publication.",

    "article_text": "Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest on the Trump admin's illegal immigration crackdown from the White House. Texas AG Ken Paxton also joined 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss and address the fight to protect women's sports. Military members stationed in and around portions of the southern border have been given the authority to temporarily detain and search illegal migrants. Service members with the Joint Task Force-Southern Border (JTF-SB) are now authorized to conduct several security measures in the New Mexico National Defense Area (NMNDA), U.S. Northern Command said Monday. The NMNDA is part of theU.S. Army's Fort Huachuca military installation. The move allows the U.S. military to serve in a more active law enforcement role than in years past. Military personnel have typically been prevented from participating in civilian law enforcement activities such as search, seizure, or arrest.

Drew Scheffer, assigned to Joint Task Force Southern Border, provides surveillance over the southern border near Santa Teresa, N.M. on April 12.(Department of Defense) As part of their new duties, theservice memberscan search and temporarily detain trespassers on the NMNDA, as well as provide medical care and implement crowd control measures, until appropriate law enforcement can take them into custody. Task force members can also assist with the installation of temporary barriers, signage, and fencing upon request. \"Through these enhanced authorities, U.S. Northern Command will ensure those whoillegally trespassin the New Mexico National Defense Area are handed over to Customs and Border Protection or our other law enforcement partners,\" said USNORTHCOM Gen.

    "title": "Why did Pope Francis restrict the ancient Latin Mass?",
    "article_text": "Bishop Robert Barron reflects on his personal connection to Pope Francis and discusses faith in America. One of the most controversial aspects ofPope Francis’ legacyas the leader of theCatholic Churchis his decision to restrict an older form of the Catholic liturgy known as the Traditional Latin Mass. Francis explained that he decided to restrict the Latin Mass because he was concerned its use was leading to division in the Church. Francis said he felt the more ancient mass was \"being used in an ideological way\" in reaction to modernity, including the more modern Vatican II mass. The mass — from the Latin word \"missa,\" which means \"sacrifice\" — consists of the \"Liturgy of the Word\" and \"Liturgy of the Eucharist,\" the latter of which is considered the most sacred and highest form of worship by Catholics. The Latin Mass, which was formalized by Pope St. Pius V in 1570 and continues to be practiced by some Catholics today, has several key differences from the more common Vatican II mass, which was instituted in 1969. These differences include the entirety of the mass being said in Latin and the priest facing \"ad orientem\" (\"to the east\") rather than facing the congregation. BELLS TOLL AT VATICAN TO MARK POPE FRANCIS' DEATH One of the most controversial aspects of Pope Francis’ legacy as the leader of the Catholic Church is his decision to restrict an older form of the Catholic liturgy known as the Traditional Latin Mass.(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) During his 12-year pontificate, Francis took several actions to limit the use of the Latin Mass throughout the world. The result was that the Latin Mass was relegated to a very limited number of churches, with it often only being offered by priests belonging to specific orders expressly devoted to it. In 2021, Francis issued a set of instructions, called a \"motu proprio,\" in which he placed sweeping restrictions on the Latin Mass, including requiring priests wanting to say the mass to seek express approval from their local bishops. In 2023, Francis issued additional restrictions on the Latin Mass, requiring bishops to obtain express approval from the Vatican to allow it to be said in their jurisdictions and barring newly ordained priests from saying it. The instructions diverged from the policy of Francis’ predecessor,Pope Benedict XVI, who had allowed all priests to say the Latin Mass. In a conversation with Jesuits in 2023, Francis explained that he felt his predecessor’s allowances \"were being used in an ideological way, to go backward.\" VANCE WAS ONE OF POPE FRANCIS' LAST VISITORS During his 12-year pontificate, Francis took several actions to limit the use of the Latin Mass throughout the world. \"The danger today isindietrismo, the reaction against the modern. It is a nostalgic disease,\" he said. \"This is why I decided that now the permission to celebrate according to the Roman Missal of 1962 [the Latin Mass] is mandatory for all newly consecrated priests.\" Francis said the restriction was \"necessary to stop thisindietrismo, which was not in the pastoral vision of my predecessors.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Despite this, Francis clarified that specific orders of priests, such as the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter (FSSP), were not impacted by the restrictions. After a 2024 meeting between Francis and Father Andrzej Komorowski, the head of FSSP, the order released a communique in which it said \"in the course of the audience, the pope made it clear that institutes such as the Fraternity of St. Peter are not affected by the general provisions of the motu proprio … since the use of the ancient liturgical books was at the origin of their existence and is provided for in their constitutions.\" Peter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.",

    "title": "US confirms third round of nuclear talks with Iran after ‘very good progress’",
    "article_text": "Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the latest on the Trump administration's negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program and the president's effort to end the war in Ukraine. The U.S. andIranhave agreed to meet for a third round of talks later this week in Muscat, Oman, after they met in Italy with Omani intermediaries to discuss Iran’s nuclear program on Saturday. Details of the negotiations have not been released and any concrete progress in ending Iran’s nuclear program remains unclear, though a senior administration official told Fox News that \"very good progress\" had been made. \"Today,in Rome,over four hours in our second round of talks, we made very good progress in our direct and indirect discussions,\" the official said Saturday. \"We agreed to meet again next week and are grateful to our Omani partners for facilitating these talks and to our Italian partners for hosting us today.\" TRUMP SAYS IRAN MUST DITCH ‘CONCEPT OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON’ AHEAD OF MORE TALKS An Iranian newspaper with a cover photo of Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Aragchi and U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, in Tehran, April 12, 2025.(Majid Asgaripour/WANA (West Asia News Agency) via Reuters) Reports suggested that Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi at some point in the negotiations spoke face-to-face, the second time in as many weeks. But the negotiations have not solely been \"direct\" between Washington and Tehran as President Donald Trump earlier this month insisted they would be, which Iran flatly rejected – suggesting some form of compromise was reached regarding the format of the discussions. What Witkoff discussed directly with his Iranian counterpart remains unknown. Araghchi also expressed some optimism in his review of the negotiations from Italy, though his perspective appeared slightly more muted. \"Relatively positive atmosphere in Rome has enabled progress on principles and objectives of a possible deal,\" he wrote in apost on X. \"We made clear how many in Iran believe that the [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action] JCPOA is no longer good enough for us. To them, what is left from that deal are ‘lessons learned.' Personally, I tend to agree.\" COL. RICHARD KEMP DOUBTS TRUMP NEGOTIATIONS WITH IRAN WILL ‘ACHIEVE WHAT NEEDS TO BE ACHIEVED’ Technicians work inside a uranium conversion facility on March 30, 2005, near Isfahan, Iran.(Getty Images) \"The initiation of expert level track will begin in coming days with a view to hammer out details,\" Araghchi said. \"After that, we will be in a better position to judge. For now, optimism may be warranted but only with a great deal of caution.\" It remains unclear how this round of negotiations to end Iran’s nuclear program will differ from the original JPCOA, an Obama-era nuclear deal which Trump abandoned during his first term, though the president and other security experts have voiced asense of urgencyin finding a solution in the very near future. But experts have warned these talks need to be far more encompassing than the JCPOA given the current advanced state of Iran's nuclear program, and they need to happen very soon. \"The speed with which technical talks have been agreed to is worrying for those who hope to avoid a repeat of 2013 and 2015, as are allegations of Iran's offer of a three-step interim or phased proposal for a deal,\" Iran expert and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Behnam Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital. \"It would be the height of strategic malpractice and a political own goal to allow the Islamic Republic to force America under the Trump administration into a deal that only slightly modified the accord that Trump rightly criticized and walked away from in 2018,\" he added. Similarly, retired Gen. Jack Keane, a Fox News senior strategic analyst, many security experts are watching thesenegotiation attemptswith \"real concern\" because \"Iran in 2025 is not the Iran in 2015 when that first nuclear deal was made.\" Secretary of State John Kerry, third from left, and other U.S. officials meet with EU and Iranian officials for nuclear talks in Vienna, Austria, June 30, 2015.(Pool/Siamek Ebrahimi/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The difference is that Iran has the capability to manufacture advanced centrifuges which can enrich uranium from zero to weapons grade in just a matter of weeks,\" Keane said. Essentially, this means the U.S. must not only persuade Iran to get rid of its near-weapons-grade enriched uranium – enough to producefive nuclear weaponsif further enriched – but also dismantle its manufacturing capabilities. \"The other thing that is different in 2025 – they have ballistic missiles that can deliver the weapon,\" Keane added. \"It remains to be seen what’s going to be in the deal.\" Caitlin McFall is a Reporter at Fox News Digital covering Politics, U.S. and World news.",

    "article_text": "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the death of Pope Francis. Though controversial, one of the least contentious 2025 Oscar-nominated films was \"Conclave,\" an Edward Berger-directed mystery thriller starring Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini and Stanley Tucci, which brings to life the political and religious traditions regarding how Catholic cardinals elect a new pope. The conclave will gather again in actuality as the Vatican revealed thatPope Francis, 88, the leader of the Catholic Church, passed on April 21, 2025, the day after Easter Sunday. Though released in October 2024, \"Conclave\" struck a deep chord with viewers as Pope Francis’ declining health was made known to the public in February 2025. Pope Francis battledbilateral pneumoniain the months before his death. POPE FRANCIS REVEALED BURIAL WISHES JUST DAYS AFTER BECOMING POPE IN 2013 In the film, \"Conclave,\" starring Ralph Fiennes, Isabella Rossellini and Stanley Tucci, cardinals gather to elect a new pope.(Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images) The film closely follows the novel of the same name written by author Robert Harris. \"That was fairly accurate,\" Dennis Doyle, professor emeritus at the University of Dayton inOhio, told Fox News Digital. Doyle taught at the Catholic research university for 40 years. \"There were just a few differences, like some of the Latin wasn't exact, the carpet was red in the movie and its beige in real life,\" Doyle said. \"The seating arrangements were done very dramatically in the movie. They're not exactly that way in real life. And even the way the voting was done was not exactly the same.\" WHO COULD BE THE NEXT POPE? Pope Francis was elected pope in 2013, after Pope Benedict XVI stepped down from his role due to health concerns.(Gregorio Borgia/AP) Despite the creative liberties, Doyle felt the film was \"done very accurately.\" \"I was surprised at how well it was done and how they were able to present the characters in a way that every character in a certain sense was sympathetic,\" Doyle told Fox News Digital. In preparation for the film, Doyle read the book twice. \"In the book, the character was transgender but didn’t go through with the operation,\" Doyle said. \"In the movie, the character was intersex, somebody who was born both ways, but still who didn't go through with the operation.\" Some Catholics took to social media at the time the film was released to regard it as \"anti-Catholic\" and \"dishonest\". WHAT IS THE PAPAL CONCLAVE: INSIDE THE ANCIENT PROCESS OF CHOOSING THE NEXT POPE Dennis Doyle, professor emeritus at the University of Dayton, told Fox News Digital the Oscar-winning film \"Conclave\" was \"fairly accurate\" to the proceedings of a true conclave.(Yara Nardi/Reuters) \"I thought that everything in the movie was very realistic until the very end,\" Doyle said. \"I thought that, on a literal level, it really wasn't very realistic. I don't think that would happen, that somebody that was intersex would get elected pope. But symbolically, I thought the ending was very interesting.\" \"I could see that the ending could be a turnoff for some Catholics,\" he added. Doyle said that, while \"kind of far-fetched,\" the film spoke to the question of the role of women in the church and whether the Catholic Church can become equal to men and women. \"In the film, all of the people serving the cardinals are sisters,\" Doyle said. \"They're all nuns and in real life, in that building, there's simply a staff that works in that building, and they would be the people who would put out the meals and who would change the beds and that kind of thing.\" PHOTO GALLERY: POPE FRANCIS THROUGH THE YEARS Catholic cardinals will gather for a papal conclave in the weeks following Pope Francis' death on April 21, 2025.(Arturo Mari, Vatican Pool) The deeper issue, Doyle said, is that the film portrays men in leadership roles and women as servants. \"The conversation about transgender is relatively recent [in the church],\" Doyle said. \"I really think that the conversation is more in the United States and Europe than it is in theCatholic Churchglobally or even necessarily in Rome.\" The Vaticanreleased a declaration, Vatican's Dignitas Infinita, in 2024 where Pope Francis condemned gender theory. The document asserted that attempts to alter an individual's immutable gender are ultimately misguided attempts to play God. \"You could watch this whole movie and until the last two minutes it's not an issue in the film. It doesn't really come up. There’s a couple of foreshadowings of what the conclusion is going to be, but the movie is not about that,\" Doyle said. Following Pope Francis' death, Doyle believes the newly released film will generate interest in the Catholic Church.

Through his work and care for both people and planet, he profoundly touched the lives of so many. \"The Queen and I remember with particular affection our meetings with His Holiness over the years and we were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month. We send our most heartfelt condolences and profound sympathy to the Church he served with such resolve and to the countless people around the world who, inspired by his life, will be mourning the devastating loss of this faithful follower of Jesus Christ.\" POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88 YEARS OLD Pope Francis holds his homily during the weekly General Audience at the Paul VI Hall on Feb. 12, 2025 in Vatican City, Vatican.(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended condolences on behalf of his country. \"Deeply saddened to hear of the death of His Holiness Pope Francis.

    "article_text": "'America's Newsroom' co-anchor Bill Hemmer joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss Pope Francis' meeting with VP JD Vance before his passing and his reflection on the life and legacy of a Catholic leader. After a pope dies, theCatholic Churchchooses its next leader through an ancient electoral process called the \"papal conclave.\" In practice, since at least 1276, the conclave gathers the church’s top bishops – called the College of Cardinals – from around the globe. Though there are more than 240 cardinals currently, only those under the age of 80 are eligible to vote in the conclave and the number of cardinal electors is limited to 120. Nearly all prefects of Vatican offices lose their jobs when a pope dies, but a few stay on, including the foreign minister and the master of liturgical ceremonies, who play a key role in assembling the conclave. The conclave takes place in theVatican’s Sistine Chapeland cardinals are kept in strict isolation to keep them far from any outside influence from the rest of the world. This isolation is so important in the process that even the name conclave comes from the Latin \"con clavis,\" which means \"with key,\" indicating how the cardinal electors are locked up while they deliberate over who will be the new pope. POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS Incense is cast over the coffin of Pope John Paul II by German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger during the funeral Mass in St. Peter's Square on April 8, 2005, in Vatican City.(Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images) There is also an emphasis on choosing a pope quickly to lessen the amount of time the church spends without a leader. The cardinals cast their first vote the day the conclave begins. They then cast votes at least twice every day after – in the morning and evening – until a pope is selected. The common practice in the modern Catholic Church is for the cardinals to choose a pope from among their own ranks, though this was not always the case. POPE FRANCIS REVEALED BURIAL WISHES JUST DAYS AFTER BECOMING POPE IN 2013 Pope Francis receives Vice President JD Vance, at the Vatican on Easter Sunday, April 20, 2025.(Vatican Media via AP, HO) Conclaves will typically begin with a special Mass celebrated inSt. Peter’s Basilica,in which the cardinals invoke the Holy Spirit for guidance. Cardinals vote for the pope through a secret ballot. At each vote, a cardinal will write his choice on a piece of paper, process up to Michaelangelo’s giant fresco of the last judgment – which serves as a reminder of the gravity and sacredness of their responsibility – and drop his ballot in a chalice.

More than two-thirds of the eligible cardinal electors were appointed byPope Francis.However, these cardinals hold a diverse set of viewpoints and come from all different parts of the world. After each vote, the ballots are burned and the ashes are used to send a signal to the rest of the world about whether a decision has been made. Black smoke rising from the Sistine Chapel means there has not been a consensus, while white smoke means a pope has been chosen.

    "title": "Pope Francis' funeral will be simplified version of past papal funerals, per his change of papal funeral rites",
    "article_text": "The Vatican announced Pope Francis has died at 88 years old. Fox News' Lauren Green gives an inside look at his life and legacy. The funeral forPope Franciswill include many long-held traditions, but will also eschew some of the more intricate customs after the pope amended the Catholic Church's papal funeral rights. Francis died Monday at age 88, the Vatican announced. While much of the tradition associated with papal funerals – which dates all the way back toancient Rome– will continue, matters such as Francis' coffin structure, his death verification process, burial location, and how he will be viewed and referred to during the ceremony, will be different from how it has been in the past. Francis, who had battled pneumonia for weeks before being released from the hospital and appearing on Easter Sunday, had faced health complications for many years and had to have half of one of his lungs removed as a young person. POPE FRANCIS' MEDICAL CONDITION: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT BILATERAL PNEUMONIA Pope Francis greets cardinals as he unexpectedly appears during the Palm Sunday Mass in Saint Peter's Square at the Vatican, April 13, 2025.(Yara Nardi/Reuters) Francis' move to change thesepapal funeral traditions,some of which date all the way back to ancient Rome, stemmed from a desire to emphasize that the pope is \"that of a shepherd and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful man of this world,\" according to Archbishop Diego Ravelli, the head of papal liturgical ceremonies who reportedly worked with Francis to help make the revisions. The rewrite was also preceded by the unusual circumstances of Pope Benedict XVI's funeral, which deviated from traditional papal funerals on account of the fact he was a retired pope rather than a reigning one. The new funeral rites were formally approved by Francis in 2023 and were later published in the church's liturgical guidelines in early 2024. Around the same time he was working on these revisions, the pope revealed during an interview with a Spanish-language broadcaster that he would not be buried in the grottoes of the Vatican like his predecessors, but rather at Santa Maria Maggiore basilica in Rome. The new papal rights make it permissible for future popes to be buried outside the Vatican as well. POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS In addition to the different burial location, the new papal funeral rites have amended the way the pope will be viewed by the public following his death. In the past, the pope's body would be displayed on an elevated frame known as a bier. But, under the new funeral structure, the pope will be laid directly into an open coffin, eliminating the use of the bier. Pope Francis also eliminated the practice of being buried in three coffins made of cypress, lead and oak. The location of where Francis would be declared deceased changed too. It went from taking place in the papal bedroom to now inside the papal chapel located atthe Vatican.The new rules also require that Pope Francis' remains be immediately put into a simplistic wooden-lined coffin after he is determined to have passed. Incense is cast over the coffin of Pope John Paul II by German Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger during the funeral mass in St. Peter's Square on April 8, 2005 in Vatican City.  Cardinals under the age of 80 will start the conclave on April 18 where a new Pope will be elected.(Photo by Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images) Confirming the death of the Pope is the job of the camerlengo, a senior clergy member who manages the Vatican during transition periods between Popes. That position is currently occupied by Irish-born Cardinal Kevin Farrell, who said Monday, \"With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite merciful love of the One and Triune God.\" POPE BENEDICT'S VISION OF CATHOLICISM, VATICAN II, AND THE FUTURE OF THE CHURCH ENDURE THROUGH HIS TEACHINGS Another notable change includes how the pope will be referenced during the ceremony following his death. Rather than being referenced by past titles he has obtained as a clergy leader in theCatholic Church,officials will mostly use Latin terms for \"pope,\" \"bishop,\" or \"pastor.\" Archbishop Stanislaw Dsiwisz (Right) places a white veil over the face of late Pope John Paul II as Archbishop Piero Marini looks on, prior to closing the coffin for burial in the grottos beneath St. Peter's Basilica April 8, 2005 at the Vatican. The grottoes form a cramped underground cemetery beneath St. Peter's Basilica where pontiffs  throughout the ages, royals and even an emperor have been laid to rest.(Photo by Osservatore Romano-Pool/Getty Images) Archbishop Ravelli said during a 2024 presentation of the revised papal funeral rights that a new edition was reflective of Francis' view, stated on several occasions Ravelli said, \"of the need to simplify and adapt certain rites so that the celebration of the funeral of the Bishop of Rome may better express the faith of the Church in the Risen Christ.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Before the new edition of the papal rites was formally passed,the churchfollowed the guidelines in the \"Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis\"approved in 1998 by Saint John Paul II and published two years later, according to The National Catholic Register.

    "article_text": "'America's Newsroom' co-anchor Bill Hemmer discusses the life and legacy of Pope Francis. Pope Francis, 88, the oldest pope in over a century, died Monday morning, though quiet discussions on who could succeed him have reportedly already begun. While any male Catholic could in theory be chosen to sit in the papal seat, historically, succeeding popes have been selected from the Sacred College of Cardinals since 1378, according toReligion News Service. Currently, there are 252 cardinals in the body who have beenselected by the Holy Fatherto serve as his advisors and assistants. Here is a look at some of the most likely forerunners to serve as the 267th pope, according to public reporting. Pope Francis is seen delivering a homily during Mass with newly appointed cardinals.(Stefano Costantino/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, is the highest-rankingdiplomat in the Holy See– which is the governing body of the Catholic Church – and is believed to be among the cardinals most likely to be elected to the top position. His favor among cardinals in the Sacred College, who will vote on the next pope, is due to his politically moderate position and his career in diplomacy, reported The New York Post. Parolin, who spent part of his career in Mexico and Nicaragua, was appointed by Pope Francis in 2014 and would likely be seen as an extension of the current papacy.

He has been dubbed the \"Asian Pope Francis\" particularly for their similarities when it comes to their more embracing position of the LGBTQI community than their predecessors. In a 2015 interview, Tagle said the Church’s \"severe\" position on the LGBTQI community, divorcees and single mothers was doing it harm. According to theCatholic Herald, Tagle \"would be hailed by liberals, given the changing demographic of the Church.\" Pope Francis greets Philippine Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle during a ceremonial welcome at the Presidential Palace in Jakarta on Sept. 4, 2024.(Tiziana FabiI/AFP via Getty Images) US CONFERENCE OF CATHOLIC BISHOPS SUES TRUMP OVER IMMIGRATION, REFUGEE FUNDING FREEZE There are several conservative cardinals who are believed to be top contenders for the papacy, including Cardinal Peter Erdo, who has been critical of Francis’ position on divorceand immigration. Erdo has argued that divorced or re-married Catholics should not be allowed to receive Holy Communion due to his positionregarding the \"indissolubility of marriage.\" The Catholic Herald pointed out that appointing a conservative pope following Francis’ tenure would \"send a powerful message about the direction the Church would be taking.\" Erdo has also differed fromFrancis greatly on immigrationand argued in 2015 that permitting refugees to resettle is tantamount to human trafficking. Pope Francis greets the archbishop of Budapest, Cardinal Péter Erdő, after arriving in Budapest, Hungary, on April 28, 2023.(Vatican Media Vatican Pool/Getty Images) Another conservative cardinal thought to be a serious contender is Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu from the war-torn nation of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Membership of the Catholic Church in Africa is growing faster than anywhere else in the world, according to the Associated Press. Congolese Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) The 65-year-old Ambongo controversially rejected Pope Francis' blessing of same-sex couples by the Catholic Church. In a letter signed by other African priests, they said they refused to follow the pontiff’s declaration because such unions are \"contrary to the will of God.\" The Wisconsin native and former archbishop of St. Louis is considered to be the leading American candidate. The 76-year-old cardinal is also viewed as being from the conservative side of the Church. Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke attends the Consistory for the creation of new Cardinals led by Pope Francis at the St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City, Vatican.(Franco Origlia/Getty Images) He is a proponent of the Latin Mass, and has been critical of Pope Francis regarding the Church’s new language around artificial contraception, LGBT issues and civil marriages. Burke was made a cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2010. Pope Francis meets with Cardinal Matteo Zuppi during an audience at the Apostolic Palace on Aug. 24, 2023, in Vatican City.(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) Zuppi was born in Rome. He is the president of the Italian Episcopal Conference and is viewed as an insider in Francis’ Vatican, having served as the archbishop of Bologna. The 69-year-old Zuppi is seen as being one of Pope Francis' favorites. He was sent on a peace mission in 2023 to Ukraine, where he met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He was also sent to meet with President Joe Biden that same year. Zuppi was made a cardinal by Pope Francis in 2019. Of the 252 cardinals in the Sacred College, only 138 are under the age of 80 and therefore are permitted to participate in the conclave, the papal election process – though there are no age limitations for the candidate who would serve as the future pope. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Following the death of a pope, the conclave then holds a vote, and will continue to vote, until a pope is chosen by a two-thirds majority. At that time, the ballots will be burned with a chemical that produces white smoke, as opposed to black smoke, to alert the world that a new pope has been chosen.

    "article_text": "Children being treated at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital crafted numerous \"get well\" cards and drawings for Pope Francis as he received treatment at the hospital. JOHANNESBURG:The next pope could, and some analysts say should,come from Africa. Christianity is booming here. More people are becoming Catholics on the continent than anywhere else in the world, and millions of Africans proudly stay true to their faith despite persecution and death. \"As in previous years, increases (in the number of Catholics) were registered above all in Africa,\" the Vatican said in October 2024, stating that 7,271,000 Africans joined the faith last year. In 2023, the National Catholic Register reported \"Home to fewer than 1 million Catholics in 1910, the Catholic population of Africa is now 265 million.\" Fox News Digital understands there are three leading African papabile – \"pope-able\" candidates – Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, 65, from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson, 76, from Ghana, and Guinea’s Cardinal Robert Sarah, who is viewed as less likely due his being 80 years old. POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS Congolese Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu(AP Photo/Andrew Medichini) \"Is it time? Certainly, it is an appropriate time for the leader of the Catholic Church to come from Africa for reasons that would capture the world’s imagination,\" Greg Tobin, author of the novels \"Conclave\" and \"Council,\" and the biography of \"Pope John XXIII, the Good Pope,\" told Fox News Digital. He added, \"The Church has been growing at an amazingly rapid rate over the past few decades in the face of government opposition in many African nations, overt persecution of Christians and Catholics in many of the same nations, and violent opposition. Further, the leaders who have been appointed bishops and raised up as cardinals are generally highly educated, often in the West.\" Theologian and executive coachJonathan Morriswas also positive about the idea of a new pope coming from Africa, telling Fox News Digital, \"An African candidate for pope is not only interesting from the perspective of representation of the fastest-growing region of the Church, but also because an African candidate could bring together divergent ideological groups of cardinals.\" Catholic bishops attend a mass for peace in Goma, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, on Jan. 28, 2024.(Alexis Huguet/AFP via Getty Images) Morris, a Fox News contributor, added, \"The African Church is, as a whole, more conservative than the European and American Church. But wouldn’t these Europeans and Americans love to be part of making history!\" While this largely conservative approach from Africa’s papal candidates is a positive factor among traditional Catholics, many still don’t want a hardline pope, Gregory Tobin said. Tobin is right on topic, as he is currently writing a new book, \"The Mysteries of the Conclave.\" The Conclave is the meeting in the Vatican where the new pope is chosen. Tobin said, \"The (African) Church and its leaders can come across as either ambivalent or very hard conservatives – a mixed bag that is a ‘turnoff’ for cardinal-electors who seek more highly defined, clear theology and pastoral ‘style’ from the one whom they will elect.\" AFRICAN CATHOLIC PRIESTS TELL POPE FRANCIS THEY REFUSE TO BLESS SAME-SEX COUPLES Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson waits to exchange Christmas greetings with Pope Francis at the Clementina Hall on Dec. 21, 2013, in Vatican City.(Franco Origlia/Vatican Pool/Getty Images) Some analysts recommend it’s the right moment, with a pope from Africa, to reward Christians for their strength despite often horrific persecution. It’s easy to openly be a Christian in Texas. But recently in the DRC, where 95% of the population are Christian, no one stoppedIslamist rebelsfrom forcing 70 Christians into a church where they were butchered, beheaded with machetes. In 2023, Fox News Digital was told that more than 52,000 Christians \"have been butchered or hacked to death for being Christians\" since 2009 in Nigeria, according to Intersociety, a civil society group based in Onitsha. Yet Nigeria in 2023 was shown to have the largest number of practicing Catholics in the world – worshipers who attend Mass – by a long way, followed by another African country, Kenya. This is according to Georgetown University’s Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA), which reported \"weekly or more frequent Mass attendance is highest among adult self-identified Catholics in Nigeria at 94% followed by Kenya at 73%.\" Greg Tobin offered his take on the preferred candidates. First, \"Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, DRC, Archbishop of Kinshasa, is a leading African candidate, though he is not considered strong or consistent in his theological teachings, (and) he is a vocal opponent of the dictatorial leadership of his country.\" Pope Francis waves to the public as he leads the Mass at Martyrs Stadium in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo on Feb. 2, 2023.(Chris Milosi/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) And \"Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appia Turkson, from Ghana, [from] 2020 onward served Pope Francis as head of a multi-group task force to monitor widespread effects of (the) coronavirus pandemic on churches and Catholic institutions. Turkson is a viable choice, widely respected, liked by Pope Francis, and theologically and ‘politically’ palatable to Western prelates, but his visibility has dimmed in recent years. His election would be a major surprise along the same line that Bergolio’s (Pope Francis) was in 2013.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Guinean Cardinal Robert Sarah, center, attends a prayer at the Cathedral of Our Lady of Victories in Dakar on Dec. 4, 2023.(Guy Peterson/AFP via Getty Images) Tobin pointed out that Guinea’s Cardinal Robert Sarah, being 80, is \"ineligible to vote in the conclave due to age. A distinct long-shot, due to age and sense his time has passed.\" One final note: Should the next pope come from Africa, he won’t be the first. Victor I, from North Africa, served as the pontiff between 189-199, and was closely followed by Miltiades and Gelasius I.

Pope Francis, Bishop of Rome and Supreme Pontiff of the Catholic Church, who worked to instill progressive influences on the global church while maintaining unity with conservatives amid years of turmoil, died Monday morning, Vatican camerlengo Cardinal Kevin Farrell announced. He was 88 years old. \"Dearest brothers and sisters, with deep sorrow I must announce the death of our Holy Father Francis.

Less than a month into President Donald Trump’s presidency, the pontiff criticized the Republican’s plans for the mass deportations of migrants, stressing that the forceful removal of people simply for their immigration status deprives them of their inherent dignity and \"will end badly.\" In astrongly worded letterto U.S. Catholic Bishops, the pope appeared to counter remarks made by Vice President JD Vance — who had recently converted to Catholicism — after he suggested Americans should care for family, communities and the country before caring about others. \"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\" the pontiff wrote. \"Worrying about personal, community or national identity, apart from these considerations.\" POPE FRANCIS EXPOSES CONFIDENTIAL DETAILS ABOUT HIS ELECTION AND RELATIONSHIPS IN LENGTHY INTERVIEW Pope Francis meets with bishops, priests, deacons, consecrated persons, seminarians and pastoral workers in Our Lady of Perpetual Help Cathedral in Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, on Sept. 15, 2022.(Reuters/Pavel Mikheyev) Pope Francis in 2015 became the first pontiff to ever address aJoint Meeting of Congresswhere he spoke on a range of topics including immigration, family, the death penalty, climate change, extremism, religious freedom and the refugee crisis. He joined American bishops and urged American leaders to abolish capital punishment and said Congress has a \"role to play\" in addressing global warming. In 2022 he questioned then President Biden's conscience on abortion in an interview during which he described the commander-in-chief's religious identity and views on abortion as incoherent. \"A month after conception, the DNA of the fetus is already there and the organs are aligned. There is human life,\" the pontiff said in the interview with Spanish-language outletUnivision. He also weighed in on candidates Trump and Harris during the election campaign, where he bashed them both, saying, \"Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants, or be it the one who kills babies,″ he said, according to the Associated Press. Just weeks before President Trump’s second inauguration, he appointed Cardinal Robert McElroy to be the Archbishop of Washington. McElroy had been critical of Trump’s immigration policies during his first term as president. Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in 1936 to Italian immigrant parents in Argentina, Francis made history as the first pope from the Americas — as well as the first Jesuit to hold the office. He was elected pope in 2013 after the almost unprecedented retirement of his predecessor,Pope Benedict XVI. Bergolio’s father, Mario, was an accountant for the railway industry, and his mother, Regina, was a homemaker and caregiver for her five children.

He labored briefly in the stocking factory where his father was an accountant before moving on to other opportunities, including jobs as a bar bouncer and janitor. He eventually sought a career as a chemical technician, receiving a diploma in chemistry from the secondary school Escuela Técnica Industrial N° 27 Hipólito Yrigoyen. He also worked briefly in a food laboratory. However, his career in chemistry was short-lived. He entered the priesthood at the Diocesan Seminary of Villa Devoto in Argentina. Francis was ordained a priest in 1969 and made his final profession with the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, in 1973. The same year, he was appointed as a provincial for the order. His appointment as provincial was concurrent with the Dirty War, a period of intense state-led persecution of left-wing leaders and political dissidents. Bergolio experienced constant threats to his own safety as he worked to hide or aid in the escape of government targets, including many Catholic faithful.

Pope Francis has said he was forced to negotiate with the regime for their release. Bergolio would spend the next two decades bouncing from position to position at the direction of his superiors. He served as a professor of theology, seminary instructor, rector, doctoral student and parish priest. In 1992,Pope John Paul IIappointed Bergolio as titular Bishop of Auca and as an auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires. This was done at the request of Cardinal Antonio Quarracino, Archbishop of Buenos Aires, who consecrated him to the episcopacy. Bergoglio proved vital to the nation’s Catholic community, and he was quickly raised to the dignity of Coadjutor Archbishop of Buenos Aires, serving alongside Quarracino and taking over the archdiocese entirely after his death the following year. Bergoglio was given the crimson hat of a cardinal byPope John Paul II in 2001. In 2013, after the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI, Bergoglio was elected to the papacy, selecting the pontifical name \"Francis\" after St. Francis of Assisi — a choice that set the tone for the rest of his papacy. POPE DERIDES BIDEN'S ABORTION VIEWS, CATHOLIC SELF-IDENTITY AS 'INCOHERENCE' Newly elected Pope Francis, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina appears on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica after being elected by the conclave of cardinals, at the Vatican on March 13, 2013. White smoke rose from the Sistine Chapel chimney, and the bells of St. Peter's Basilica rang out, signaling at the time that the Roman Catholic cardinals had elected a pope to succeed Benedict XVI.(Tony Gentile/Reuters) Pope Francis’s teachings as a priest, bishop, cardinal and pope were deeply influenced by his Jesuit vocation — viewing each person as a unique creation of God, with whom they can have a personal relationship. His ministry and leadership were committed to keeping doors open and making the church approachable to the public. It was not only American politics that he had strong opinions of. He faced criticism for specific remarks he made against Israel’s military operation in Gaza, calling the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian enclave \"very serious and shameful.\" During that same speech, he condemned the growth of antisemitism throughout the world, Reuters reported. He also called for an end to the war in Ukraine and expressed concerns over climate change. In 2023, seemingly looking to strike a balance, he formally allowed Catholic priests to give same-sex couples a blessing, which was seen as being a radical shift in church policy, the Associated Press reported at the time. Pope Francis is also remembered for living a life of intense simplicity, denying himself a lavish papal apartment in the Vatican upon his election, and opting instead for a two-room suite in the Domus Santa Marta, a residence built by Pope John Paul II. Pope Francis celebrates the traditional rite of the washing of feet at the Casal del Marmo juvenile penitentiary on April 6, 2023, in Rome, Italy. On Holy Thursday, Pope Francis went to the outskirts of Rome to celebrate the Mass of the Lord's Supper at the Casal del Marmo juvenile penitentiary, where he carried out the traditional rite of the washing of the feet of twelve of the young people there.(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool/Getty Images) In contrast to his immediate predecessors, Pope Francis eschewed ornate robes or luxurious clothing. His outfit rarely consisted of more than a plain, white cassock tied with a papal fascia. Pope Francis even dressed down his Ring of the Fisherman — a piece of gold jewelry worn by popes to signify their office — by having it made with silver and only wearing it for ceremonies. Francis’s tenure continued the ongoing efforts to investigate decades of sexual abuse claims against priests across the world, including in the United States, with Francis vowing transparency in 2019. \"Transparency is now being implemented at the highest level,\" said Archbishop Charles Scicluna, the Archbishop of Malta and Adjunct Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, after Francis gave legal authorities access to documents about sexual abuse cases and abolished the \"pontifical secret\" of the cases.

Pope Francis proved frustrating for a wide variety of conservatives, liberals, traditionalists and progressives. His gentle — at times vague and confusing — language on key social issues, such as sexuality and divorce, frustrated conservatives hoping for a more aggressive champion of Catholic moral teaching. In July 2017, a group of Catholic clergy and academics sent Pope Francis a \"Filial Correction\" document alleging seven serious theological mistakes made by the pontiff in public statements. The document’s assertions proved controversial within the Catholic Church and the document was never explicitly addressed. Conversely, his refusal to back down from traditional church teachings on abortion, gay marriage, women’s ordination and priestly celibacy frustrated progressives hoping for a more modern church. Echoing his time as a prelate in Argentina, Pope Francis was at times criticized from both sides of the aisle for his heavy hand enforcing Catholic unity on national and international levels. Traditionalists voiced intense opposition to his apostolic letter \"Traditionis custodes,\" which restricted the celebration of the traditional Latin mass in an attempt to squash increasingly separatist conservative movements within the Church. Pope Francis meets with then-President Joe Biden during an audience at the Apostolic Palace on Oct. 29, 2021 in Vatican City.(Vatican Media via Vatican Pool) He similarly shut down discussion of many social issues that progressives have sought to reform. In 2019, Pope Francis told a nun asking him to approve the ordination of women that \"if the Lord didn’t want a sacramental ministry for women, it can’t go forward,\" adding, \"We are Catholics, but if anyone wants to found another church they are free [to do so].\" The hyper-progressive leadership of the Catholic Church in Germany was a target of his ire after the country’s clerical leaders attempted an upheaval of traditional teachings regarding gender and sexuality. The Vatican issued a series of letters, approved by Pope Francis, accusing the German church of risking separation from the Catholic Communion. The conflict with German bishops encapsulated his papacy’s recurring themes of authority and unity, best exemplified in a passage from his \"Letter to the Pilgrim People of God in Germany.\" POPE FRANCIS URGES CATHOLIC VOTERS TO 'CHOOSE THE LESSER EVIL' BETWEEN TRUMP AND HARRIS Pope Francis delivers a speech during the Holy Mass with newly appointed Cardinals.(Stefano Costantino/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) In the letter, Pope Francis wrote, \"The universal Church lives in and of the particular Churches, just as the particular Churches live and flourish in and from the universal Church. If they find themselves separated from the entire ecclesial body, they weaken, rot and die. Hence, the need always to ensure that communion with the whole body of the Church is alive and effective.\" Pope Francisvisited dozens of countries, including the United States and Cuba in 2015, and went as far afield as Papua New Guinea, as well as visits to predominantly Muslim countries including Egypt, Morocco and Jordan. Pope Francis struggled with health complications throughout his reign. The pontiff dealt for many years with sciatica, a nerve condition that caused immense pain in his leg and at times hindered his ability to walk. In 2021, Pope Francis was hospitalized for an intestinal surgery that removed 13 inches of his colon. In March 2023, Francis was again taken to the hospital after experiencing intense chest pain and difficulty breathing. He was treated for a respiratory infection and released after antibiotic treatment.

He was released after making a full recovery. He took a fall at his residence and suffered a contusion on his right arm in January 2025. In February, he was once again hospitalizedafter a bout of bronchitis.

    "title": "Flashback: Biden's Easter celebrations frequently marred by gaffes, controversy",
    "article_text": "'The Big Weekend Show' panelists criticize President Biden for recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility on an executive level on Easter Sunday. Former President Joe Bidenand his administration found themselves embroiled in a series of gaffes and controversies around the Easter holiday, including that time the Easter bunny abruptly whisked the 46th president away from a gaggle of reporters in 2022. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump joined families and children on the White House’s South Lawn on Monday morning for the 147th annual event, which dates back to Rutherford B. Hayes’ presidency in 1878. As the Easter Egg Roll tradition continues this year, Fox News Digital looked back on the handful of Easter controversies involving Biden and his administration throughout his term in office. During the 2022 Easter Egg Roll, a person dressed in a bunny suit was seen approaching Biden as he spoke candidly to members of the media about Afghanistan and Pakistan. The bunny stepped in front of Biden while he was speaking to the media and waved their hands with great animation before directing Biden away from the reporters. \"Pakistan should not, and Afghanistan should be…\" Biden was heard saying before the bunny approaches. \"Oh, the Easter bunny!\" someone can be heard saying off-camera, as Biden appeared visibly caught off guard by the interruption.

During the 2022 Easter Egg Roll, a person dressed in a bunny suit was seen approaching Biden as he spoke candidly to members of the media about Afghanistan and Pakistan.(Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) The bunny incident unfolded ahead of the fierce scrutiny Biden faced from Democrats and conservatives over his mental acuity and age in the lead-up to the 2024 election. Footage of the Easter bunny directing Biden at a public event was rehashed as concern mounted last summer over whether the president had the mental and physical ability to continue running for re-election and potentially remain in the Oval Office. Biden ultimately dropped out and endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democrat Party’s nominee. Harris ultimately failed to rally enough support to defeat Trump at the polls.

(ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images) The Biden administration landed in hot water with the religious faithful and conservatives during the 2024 Easter season when honoring \"Transgender Day of Visibility\" on Easter Sunday. \"On Transgender Day of Visibility, we honor the extraordinary courage and contributions of transgender Americans and reaffirm our Nation’s commitment to forming a more perfect Union — where all people are created equal and treated equally throughout their lives,\" said a White House statement recognizing Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter Sunday, Fox Digital previously reported. \"Today, we send a message to all transgender Americans: You are loved. You are heard. You are understood. You belong. You are America, and my entire Administration and I have your back,\" it added. 3 MONTHS AND 28 DAYS: LGBTQ EVENTS CLOG CALENDAR AS WHITE HOUSE FACES BACKLASH OVER EASTER ANNOUNCEMENT International Transgender Day of Visibility was created by activists more than 10 years ago and is celebrated each year on March 31, while Easter —t​​he most holy holidayfor Christians — moves its day of celebration each year, but is always observed on a Sunday. Conservatives, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., ripped the White House’s decision to recognize Transgender Day of Visibility on Easter, calling it an attack on Christianity. \"The Biden White House has betrayed the central tenet of Easter — which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ,\"Johnson posted to X lastMarch. \"Banning sacred truth and tradition—while at the same time proclaiming Easter Sunday as \"Transgender Day\"—is outrageous and abhorrent. The American people are taking note.\" Former White House spokesman Andrew Bates defended at the time that Biden, as a Christian, was working to bring \"people together\" with the event. \"As aChristian who celebratesEaster with family, President Biden stands for bringing people together and upholding the dignity and freedoms of every American,\" Bates told Fox Digital last year. Biden suffered another Easter gaffe last year at the White House’s Egg Roll when he apparently flubbed the pronunciation of \"Easter\" and appeared tosay \"oyster\" insteadwhile introducing a pair of Easter bunnies. CRITICISMS MOUNT THAT BIDEN IS A 'SHADOW' OF HIMSELF AFTER DISASTROUS DEBATE: 'NOT THE SAME MAN' FROM VP ERA \"God bless you all, enjoy the day, and I'm coming down to do that Easter Egg roll in just a minute,\" Biden said while standing on the White House’s Truman Balcony overlooking the South Lawn.

And by the way, say ‘hello’ to oyster bunnies. Come on up, bunnies. Get up here so they can see you,\" Biden appeared to say. The apparent gaffe drew mockery online as some users wished each a \"Happy Oyster.\" It stirred concern over the president’s mental acuity over the mispronunciation. Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre delivered a flat April Fools' joke in 2024 when the White House hosted the Easter Egg Roll. A person dressed as the Easter bunny was spotted in the press briefing room on April 1, 2024, before Jean-Pierre joined the media and delivered a joke that Biden was set to revoke the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act bans executive branch staffers, except the president and vice president, from engagingin certain forms of political activity. \"Happy Easter Monday. So, I have something at the top for all of you and I think you’ll be really interested in this. So, President Biden is scheduled to announce he is revoking the Hatch Act,\" Jean-Pierre said, grinning, while delivering the April Fools' joke. \"So as a gift to all of you, so now I can actually take all your questions about 2024.\" \"No? I thought you would love that,\" she responded as journalists demured. \"All right. OK. April Fools', April Fools', April Fools' — it is April 1st.\" DEMS LEFT WITH EGG ON THEIR FACE AS DNC APPEARS TO SNUB BIDEN ON EASTER The administration’s Hatch Act joke followed repeated instances of administration officials citing the law while dodging questions about Biden’s 2024 campaign. This year, the Democratic National Committee shared an Easter message celebrating Democratic presidents across the year, but notably did not include a photo of Biden. Instead, the post featured former Presidents Jimmy Carter, John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton.

    "article_text": "In the five years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, schools across the country have adopted new methods. TheDepartment of Educationis poised to resume collections on defaulted federal student loans in May for the first time since 2020. While the first Trump administration paused referring federal student loans to collections in March 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extended lapse has prompted Trump administration officials to worry that the federal student loan portfolio is \"headed toward a fiscal cliff if we don't start repayment in collections,\" according to a senior department official. \"The result has been that the federal government student loan portfolio has continued to grow, and we've got a record number of borrowers that are at risk of or in delinquency and default,\" the senior department official told reporters Monday. The official said that only 40% percent of borrowers are up to speed on their loan repayments, while the remaining 60% are behind. STAFFING REDUCTIONS AT EDUCATION DEPARTMENT HAVEN'T HIT FAFSA OFFICE AMID TRUMP CUTS, AGENCY SAYS President Donald Trump speaks at the White House on March 20, 2025. Altogether, the official said that there are 4 million borrowers who are in the late-stage delinquency stage on payments, meaning that they are between 91 days and 180 days late on payments. \"The Trump administration, [the] current administration, believes that American taxpayers can no longer serve as collateral for student loans,\" the senior department official said. \"Student loan debt must be paid back.\" Likewise, the official said the agency would roll out a communications plan to let borrowers know their status and encourage them to enroll in auto-debit to drive down the number of delinquent borrowers. The policy takes effect May 5, when the Education Department will partner with the Treasury Offset Program to start collecting overdue payments. The official also said the Department of Education is preparing to join with lawmakers on efforts to reform higher education and the student loan repayment system in place. \"Going forward, we totally believe that Congress has a role to play in fixing thehigher educationsystem that puts students in a position where they can afford their loan payments,\" the senior department official said. \"So we're looking forward to working with Congress on their efforts to streamline loan repayment as well as lowering college costs.\" Bipartisan legislation in the works includes the Employer Participation Repayment Act, which Sens. John Thune, R-S.D., and Mark Warner, D-Va., introduced in February that would make permanent a provision set to expire in 2026 authorizing employers to contribute up to $5,250 tax-free to their employees’ student loans.

    "title": "Pope Francis and US presidents: A look back at his legacy with the nation's leaders",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Greg Palkot reports the latest on the pope's death and the legacy he leaves behind. Former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Francis Rooney also joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to weigh in as top contenders emerge to replace his leadership. U.S. presidents mourned the death of Pope Francis, who served as the leader of the Catholic Church for 12 years, on Monday following the Vatican’s announcement of the pope’s passing. \"Rest in Peace Pope Francis!\" PresidentDonald Trumpsaid in a post on Truth Social on Monday. \"May God Bless him and all who loved him!\" The College of Cardinals elected Pope Francis, 88, to serve as the pope following Pope Benedict XVI in March 2013. His election marked the first time a non-European served as pope in more than 1,000 years. Pope Francis, born with the name Jorge Mario Bergoglio, originally hailed from Argentina. Pope Francis, who was hospitalized in February due to complications stemming from bronchitis and pneumonia, died Monday at the Vatican’s Casa Santa Marta. Vice President JD Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019, met with Pope Francis on Sunday in one of the reception rooms of the Vatican hotel just hours before the pope’s death. Vance acknowledged the visit in a post on X Monday while expressing his condolences to Christians who loved the pope, and shared a link to the transcript of one of the pope’s 2020 homilies.

I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill,\" Vance said in a post on X on Monday. \"But I’ll always remember him for the below homily he gave in the very early days of COVID. It was really quite beautiful. May God rest his soul.\" Trump also signed an executive order Monday ordering all U.S. flags be flown at half-staff on all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels to remember Francis. The order also applies to all U.S. embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including military facilities and naval vessels and stations. Here’s a look at Pope Francis’ legacy with other U.S. leaders: Pope Francis met with former PresidentBarack Obamaat the Vatican in March 2014. The two met again in September of the following year during Pope Francis’ visit to the White House, where the pope delivered a statement urging action on climate change. Following his visit to the White House, Francis also visited New York City and Philadelphia. Obama issued a statement Monday morning lauding the pope for his leadership. POPE FRANCIS EXPOSES CONFIDENTIAL DETAILS ABOUT HIS ELECTION AND RELATIONSHIPS IN LENGTHY INTERVIEW President Barack Obama and Pope Francis walk down the Colonnade before meeting in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on Sept. 23, 2015. \"In his humility and his gestures at once simple and profound – embracing the sick, ministering to the homeless, washing the feet of young prisoners – he shook us out of our complacency and reminded us that we are all bound by moral obligations to God and one another,\" Obama said in a post on X Monday morning. \"Today, Michelle and I mourn with everyone around the world – Catholic and non-Catholic alike – who drew strength and inspiration from the Pope’s example,\" Obama said. \"May we continue to heed his call to ‘never remain on the sidelines of this march of living hope.’\" Trump met with Pope Francis in 2017 during a trip to the Vatican, and told reporters later that they had a \"fantastic meeting.\" However, the two remained at odds with one another over Trump’s border policies for the last decade. \"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian,\" Pope Francis said in February 2016 amid Trump’s push on the campaign trail to build a border wall and crack down on illegal immigration.

Former President Joe Biden, the second Catholic U.S. president, visited the Vatican in October 2021, where he and Pope Francis met to discuss topics including climate change and advocacy for the poor, according to a readout of the meeting. Biden had previously met Pope Francis on several other occasions, including during the pope’s visit to the U.S. in 2015. Biden also met with Pope Francis in June at the G7 Leaders’ Summit in Apulia, Italy, where the two discussed the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, according to a readout of the meeting.

For decades, he served the most vulnerable across Argentina and his mission of serving the poor never ceased. As Pope, he was a loving pastor and challenging teacher who reached out to different faiths.\" Fox News' Emma Colton contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "Fox News correspondent Chanley Painter reports on growing concerns from lawmakers and travelers as the deadline to use Real ID-compliant licenses for air travel gets closer. Secretary of Homeland SecurityKristi Noem'sannouncement that REAL IDs will be required to fly starting May 7 has forced Americans to finally get compliant – 20 years after Congress passed the law. On May 11, 2005, PresidentGeorge W. Bushsigned the REAL ID Act into law to enhance national security in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Passed by the U.S. Congress, the act set federal standards for issuing identification cards, like driver's licenses. Starting next month, REAL ID will be required to access federal facilities, enter nuclear power plants and board commercial aircraft. REAL ID's rollout has faced nearly two decades of political pushback, setbacks and delays. In the two years after it was passed, the National Governors Association (NGA), the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (AAMVA) called for delaying its implementation,citing logistical concerns. 'MASS SURVEILLANCE': CONSERVATIVES SOUND ALARM OVER TRUMP ADMIN'S REAL ID ROLLOUT President George W. Bush signed the REAL ID Act into law to enhance national security in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Twenty years later, President Donald Trump's administration set a May 7, 2025, deadline for full REAL ID implementation.(Getty Images) Since its passing, states and advocacy groups have rejected its implementation. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) – a longtime opponent of REAL ID implementation –called it\"discriminatory, expensive, burdensome, invasive, and ultimately counterproductive\" in 2007 as disapproval grew nationwide. By 2009, at least 25 states hadenacted legislationopposing the REAL ID Act. TOP TRUMP AGENCY REVEALS KEY REASON WHY REAL ID WILL BE ENFORCED States rejected REAL ID for a range of reasons, including costs, states' rights and privacy concerns. Three years after the law was passed, REAL ID's first deadline was set for May 11, 2008. But in the face of opposition, DHS extended the deadline to May 11, 2011, under PresidentBarack Obama'sadministration. DHS later implementeda four-phase plan that extended beyond the 2011 deadline. By 2016, 23 states were fully compliant with the REAL ID Act, 27 states and territories were granted extensions, and six were noncompliant without extensions,according to a DHS letter. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visits the Mariposa Port of Entry on March 15, 2025, in Nogales, Arizona.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) By Jan. 22, 2018, travelers would no longer be allowed to use a state-issued ID for domestic travel, and by Oct. 1, 2020, REAL ID \"or another acceptable form of identification\" would be required for domestic air travel. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, President Donald Trumpextended the REAL ID deadlineto Oct. 1, 2021.

    "article_text": "Steve Hilton joins Fox News Saturday Night With Jimmy Failla to explain how the problems currently plaguing California can be solved if the Golden State has a change in leadership. EXCLUSIVE:The California 2026 gubernatorial race just got a major shakeup with Republican Steve Hilton entering the race to be Gov. Gavin Newsom's successor. The former Fox News contributor and author of \"Califailure\" said he's hoping to \"Make California Golden Again,\" especially for the \"working people\" of the state. \"A big decision that I've made, which I can now share with you, that I am, in fact, going to be running for governor of California for 2026. I love this state. It's the best place in the world as far as I'm concerned,\" Hilton told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. THIS IS HOW WE'LL KNOW IF CALIFORNIA GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM'S EPIPHANY ON 'LIBERAL GOVERNANCE' IS REAL \"But after 15 years of one-party rule, this state is barely recognizable. And I honestly think that the 2026 election in California is a life-or-death moment because if we continue with this one-party rule by the Democrats, things are just gonna really start to deteriorate very rapidly,\" he added. Steve Hilton is joining the race to succeed California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.(Fox News/Screenshot/Tayfun Coskun/Getty Images) The media personality was quickly endorsed by former presidential candidate and current Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. \"Steve Hilton represents American excellence. He’s a great entrepreneur & communicator, and he’ll be a dominant Governor of California,\" Ramaswamyposted to Xon Monday afternoon. \"I’ve known him for years & enjoyed welcoming him to Ohio for our launch in Feb. He has my full endorsement.\" Hilton was born in the U.K. and graduated from New College at Oxford. He served as a senior advisor to former British Prime Minister David Cameron, who was the leader of the Conservative Party. \"[California] really reminds me of Britain in the 1970s. The UK was called the ‘sick man of Europe’, Hilton explained in a campaign announcement video obtained by Fox News Digital. \"There’s no other way of looking at California today than the ‘sick man of America’.\" After moving to California in 2012, Hilton embraced the American entrepreneurial spirit and co-founded Crowdpac.com, a Silicon Valley tech start-up company. Hilton's contribution to the conservative media across various outlets throughout his time in the U.S. landed him his own show, ‘The Next Revolution’, on Fox News Channel. The Sunday night program aired weekly from 2017 to 2023. Newsom is termed out, and candidates are lining up for a shot for his spot in Sacramento. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Health and Human Secretary Xavier Becerra, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Rep. Katie Porter are among the long list of names seeking the job. On the Republican side, Riverside County SheriffChad Biancohas been on the campaign trail for the job. Hilton says it's high time for a change in the blue state.(Getty Images) Although Democrats have a supermajority in the legislature, a recent poll of likely California voters indicated that 48% would consider backing a Republican for governor, according to theSacramento Bee. \"We have a combination of idiots and ideologues who've been running this state into the ground, ruining what I consider to be the greatest state and the greatest nation on earth, and it's time for change,\" Hilton said. FOR KAMALA HARRIS, CHANCES OF A POLITICAL COMEBACK MAY BE BLEAK Most notably, former Vice President Kamala Harris is weighing a run following her 2024 presidential loss. Harris would quickly be considered the Democratic front-runner if she were to decide to join in. TheGolden Stateis facing serious questions about its future in the wake of not only the fires that ripped through Los Angeles County, but as it navigates issues such as crime, homelessness, and fiscal management for programs like Medi-Cal. Hundreds of thousands of Californians have moved out of the state each year at an accelerated rate after the pandemic, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The cost of living for many Californians is higher than in the rest of the nation, including when it comes to taxation andgas prices.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. TheState Departmentis pushing back against criticism of its changes to the process of reporting human rights abuses. NPR reportedlast week that the Trump administration was scaling back annual reports meant to inform congressional decisions on allocating foreign aid to countries, claiming the State Department was \"changing its mind on what it calls human rights.\" Fox News Digital is told the 2024 Human Rights Report has been restructured to remove redundancy, increase readability, and return the focus to human rights abuses – instead of a \"laundry list of politically biased demands and assertions.\" RUBIO ANNOUNCES CLOSURE OF STATE DEPARTMENT EFFORT THAT 'WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD ALREADY' The Department of State headquarters building in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood in Washington, D.C., on April 15, 2025.(Jim Watson/AFP via Getty Images) \"NPR’s report that the State Department is scaling back the Human Rights Report is misleading and misguided,\" a senior State Department official told Fox News Digital. \"This year’s modifications are critical for removing report redundancy, increasing readability, maintaining consistency to U.S. statutes, and returning focus to human rights issues rather than political bias.\" Fox News Digital is told the restructuring of the reports \"will be more responsive to legislative mandates that underpin the report\" and \"does not reflect a change in U.S. policy on promoting respect for human rights around the globe or in any particular country.\" The State Department notably has attempted to streamline the reports to better align with statutory requirements under both Republican and Democratic administrations. NPR andPolitico reportedon an internal memo that purportedly showed the 2024 Human Rights Report, which was finished in January but has been adjusted under the new administration, will no longer include references to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) or sections on discrimination or abuse against the LGBTQ+ community.

NPR said sections that called out countries for \"forcibly returning arefugee or asylum-seekerto a home country\" or the \"serious harassment of human rights organizations\" would be absent this year. NPR also stressed that prior reports had sections detailing countries' \"involuntary or coercive medical or psychological practices,\" \"arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy,\" \"serious restrictions to internet freedom,\" \"extensive gender-based violence,\" and \"violence or threats of violence targeting people with disabilities,\" but the new report would not. Paul O'Brien, executive director of Amnesty International, USA, criticized the changes under the Trump administration. He told NPR: \"What this is, is a signal that the United States is no longer going to [pressure] other countries to uphold those rights that guarantee civic and political freedoms – the ability to speak, to express yourself, to gather, to protest, to organize.\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio sits alongside President Donald Trump during a Cabinet meeting at the White House on April 10, 2025.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) During President Donald Trump's first term, former Secretary of StateMike Pompeocited what he categorized as a \"proliferation of human rights\" on the global stage.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior national correspondent Eric Shawn reports on the death of Pope Francis from St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. Pope Francis,who changed the face of the papacy, was broadly popular with the more than 60 million U.S. Catholics, according to recent public opinion polling. Seventy-eight percent ofAmerican Catholicsexpressed a favorable opinion of the pope in a Pew Poll conducted in early February, shortly before Francis' lengthy hospitalization for a case of double pneumonia. The 88-year-old pope died on Monday Francis' popularity among American Catholics was constant throughout his dozen-year tenure as pope, with his favorability peaking at 90% in a February 2015 poll by Pew. CLICK HERE FOR LIVE FOX NEWS UPDATES ON THE PASSING OF POPE FRANCIS Pope Francis, seen here on Sept. 26, 2024, died Monday at age 88.(Simon Wohlfahrt/AFP/Getty) \"Pope Francis enjoyed broad support among American Catholics – certainly exceeding the popularity of any elected officials in the U.S.,\" veteran political scientist Wayne Lesperance, thepresident of New England College, told Fox News. U.S. Catholics also generally viewed Francis more positively than his immediate predecessor in the Vatican,Pope Benedict XVI. Pope Francis succeeded Benedict XVI as pontiff in March 2013, the latter being the first bishop of Rome to resign office since the Middle Ages.(Maurix/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images) FIVE WAYS POPE FRANCIS IMPACTED THE CATHOLIC CHURCH Benedict’s favorability ratings ranged between 67% and 83% inPew pollingduring his eight years as pope. While popular with many Catholics, Francis' attempts to make the church more inclusive made him an enemy to some in the conservative wing of the church. And there was plenty of pushback against the pope's moves to overhaul a very divided church. Those divisions may have contributed to a partisan divide when it comes to U.S. Catholics' views of Francis. According to the February Pew Poll, 88% of U.S. Catholics who identified as Democrats or leaned towardthe Democratic Partyhad a positive view of the pope. But favorable opinions of Francis dropped to 69% among U.S. Catholics who said they were Republicans or leaned toward the GOP. Flags are at half-staff next to the Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart after the death of Pope Francis was announced by the Vatican, in Newark, New Jersey, April 21, 2025.(Eduardo Munoz/Reuters) CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"His reform agenda, emphasizing values that sought to lift up the poorest, most marginalized individuals in the world, played better with Catholic Democrats than Republicans,\" Lesperance noted. \"And despite being critical of the current administration's position on building the wall, mass deportations, and migrants, the late pope enjoyed the support of nearly two-thirds of Catholic Republicans. His legacy will be one of reform and social justice for Catholics across the globe.\"",

The outcome of this case will be revolutionary for religious liberty and education freedom, and Oklahoma is at the forefront,\" a spokesperson for Gov.Kevin Stitt, R-Okla., told Fox News Digital in a statement. As Stitt champions Oklahoma's leadership in creating the first religious public charter school, Drummond has been steadfast in rejecting taxpayer funding for St. Isidore, arguing for the separation of church and state as outlined in the First Amendment.

James Lankford, R-Okla., Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., Ted Budd, R-N.C., and Ted Cruz, R-Texas,filed an amicus briefto the U.S. Supreme Court. In the brief, the Republican senators flipped Drummond's First Amendment argument on the attorney general, arguing Oklahoma violated the First Amendment by denying St. Isidore a charter because it's a religious school. \"Upholding the Oklahoma Charter Schools Act with the included exclusion of religious organizations would set a dangerous precedent, signaling that religious organizations are not welcome in public projects. This would not only violate the First Amendment, but it would also deprive society of the valuable contributions that these organizations make,\" the Republican senators wrote. Sen. Ted Cruz joined fellow Republican senators in arguing Oklahoma violated the First Amendment by denying St. Isidore a charter because it's a religious school.(LM Otero/AP) When asked by Fox News Digital why Drummond, who is campaigning to be the next governor of deep-red Oklahoma, is at odds with conservatives on the issue, Drummond's communications director, Phil Bacharach, told Fox News Digital, in part: \"AG Drummond doesn’t make decisions based on what other politicians think.\" \"Attorney General Drummond isn’t guided by political pressure – he’s guided by the law,\" Drummond's gubernatorial campaign manager, Stephanie Alexander, added in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"His constitutional duty is to defend Oklahoma statutes, and state law is clear: public funds cannot be used for religious indoctrination. As the state’s top legal officer, he’s fulfilling his obligation, and will ultimately abide by whatever decision the U.S. Supreme Court makes.\" The U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington.(AP Photo) The debate began in June 2023, when the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board approved St. Isidore's contract request, which would have allowed public funding for the religious charter school for the first time.Drummond filed a lawsuitagainst the Statewide Virtual Charter School Board that October, and his position was later affirmed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court.

    "article_text": "Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy discusses Democrats' 2026 midterm strategy on 'The Ingraham Angle.' More than half a million immigrants failed to show up for theirimmigration courthearings under former President Joe Biden. Between Fiscal Year 2022, the first full year of the Biden administration, and the end of December 2024, immigration judges issued more than 507,000 in absentia removal orders, or removal orders for those who failed to show up for their immigration hearings, according to ananalysis by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS). The number represented a 45% increase in such cases compared to the previous seven years under former President Barack Obama and President Donald Trump’s first term, the analysis found, despite that period being more than double the timeframe. ALITO BLASTS 'UNPRECEDENTED' SCOTUS MOVE TO HALT TRUMP'S VENEZUELAN DEPORTATIONS: 'LEGALLY QUESTIONABLE' Over 500,000 immigrants skipped out on immigration hearings during former President Joe Biden's term in office.(Photo by Katie McTiernan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images  |   Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images ) \"Those 500,000-plus no-shows are a symptom of the Biden administration’s effort to deliberately break our immigration system, and it will now take years to get that system back on track,\" said CIS’s Andrew R. Arthur in the report. At issue, according to Arthur, was theBiden administration’s \"refusal\"to detain illegal immigrants when they were initially encountered at the border by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), releasing the \"vast majority\" of them with a Notice To Appear in immigration court. But such migrants are the most likely to skip out oncourt proceedings, Arthur argued. \"It is axiomatic under immigration law that aliens who aren’t likely to merit relief are less likely to appear in court if they are released — which is why Congress required DHS to detain the ones encountered by CBP at the border and the ports,\" Arthur said. ACLU APPEALS TO SUPREME COURT TO STOP VENEZUELAN DEPORTATIONS; BOASBERG HOLDS EMERGENCY HEARING FRIDAY NIGHT US President Joe Biden speaks with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers as he visits the US-Mexico border in El Paso, Texas, on January 8, 2023.(Jim Watson/AFP) Under current immigration law, immigrants encountered by CBP officers and Border Patrol agents that do not have proper admission documents are subject to expedited removal, which does entitlethose immigrantsto a hearing in front of an immigration judge, unless they show a credible fear of harm if they were to be returned to their country of origin, the CIS report notes. Those subject to expedited removal are required to be detained by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the report adds, something that was not happening under the Biden administration. Such disregard for that rule led to \"inevitable\" results, Arthur argued, including the massive number of missed immigration court hearings.

    "title": "Trump wants to revive the lagging US shipbuilding industry. Here are the hurdles he faces",
    "article_text": "Former NSC chief of staff Alex Gray analyzes President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy on ‘Fox News @ Night.’ PresidentDonald Trumpis turning his attention to the U.S. shipbuilding industry, which is leagues behind its near-peer competitor China, and recently signed an executive order designed to reinvigorate it. Trump's April 10 order instructs agencies to develop a Maritime Action Plan and orders the U.S. trade representative to compile a list of recommendations to address China’s \"anticompetitive actions within the shipbuilding industry,\" among other things. Additionally, the executive order instructs a series of assessments regarding how the government could bolster financial support through the Defense Production Act, the Department of Defense Office of Strategic Capital, a new Maritime Security Trust Fund, investment from shipbuilders from allied countries and other grant programs. But simply throwing money at the shipbuilding industry won’t solve the problem, according to Bryan Clark, director of the Hudson Institute think tank’s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology. \"It is unlikely that just putting more money into U.S. shipbuilding – even with foreign technical assistance – will make U.S. commercial shipbuilders competitive with experienced and highly-subsidized shipyards in China, Korea, or Japan,\" Clark said in a Monday email to Fox News Digital. \"In the near to mid-term, the government will need to also drive higher demand for U.S.-built ships.\" US RISKS PUSHING EUROPEAN ALLIES INTO CHINA'S ARMS WITH NEW TARIFFS, EXPERTS WARN President Donald Trump signed an executive order on April 10 aimed at boosting the U.S. shipbuilding industry.(Getty Images) Clark also said the executive orders appear to complement the SHIPS for America Act, a series of legislative measures introduced in December 2024 in both the House and Senate aimed at fostering growth within the U.S. shipbuilding industry and strengthening the U.S. Merchant Marine fleet that is capable of transporting military materials during times of conflict. Specifically, the SHIPS Act includes provisions establishing a Strategic Commercial Fleet Program, which would seek to develop merchant vessels that could operate internationally, but are American-built, owned and operated. The legislation would also seek to beef up the U.S.-flag international fleet by roughly 250 ships in 10 years. \"If we implement the EO and the SHIPS Act together, the government would create incentives to flag and build ships in the U.S. and provide capital to the shipbuilding industry so it could meet the increased demand with greater efficiency and lower costs,\" Clark said. \"This will not result in the U.S. surpassing China, Korea or Japan as shipbuilders, but it would provide the U.S. more resilience.\" The U.S. is drastically behind near-peer competitors like China in shipbuilding. China is responsible for more than 50% of global shipbuilding, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, compared to just 0.1% from the U.S. However, Trump has indicated interest in working with other nations on shipbuilding, and suggested working with Congress to pass legislation authorizing the purchase of ships from foreign countries when signing the orders. Specifics were not provided.

Morton, File/The Associated Press) But doing so could upend a century-old law known as the Jones Act – a controversial law fundamental to the current U.S. shipbuilding environment that requires that only U.S. ships carry cargo between U.S. ports and stipulates that at least 75% of the crew members are American citizens. It also requires that these ships are built in the U.S. and that U.S. citizens own them. Proponents of the Jones Act assert it is key to national security and prevents foreigners from gaining entry to the U.S. But experts claim the law has significantly hampered U.S. shipbuilding, and is undercutting competition while keeping shipbuilding costs high. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Efforts to repeal the legislation have failed amid bipartisan support in Congress. But some experts claim eradicating the law is a first step in changing the shipbuilding industry in the U.S. Drone shot of a massive container ship arriving in the Port of Long Beach, California.(istock) \"Anyone who is serious about reviving the shipping industry should basically start by getting rid of the Jones Act,\" Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told Fox News Digital Thursday. \"It's not everything, but it's a start.\" Colin Grabow, an associate director at the Cato Institute’s Center for Trade Policy Studies, said shipbuilding issues in the U.S. are multifaceted, but the Jones Act is a major part of the problem. Still, he doubts efforts to repeal it will prove successful. \"I think the bar has been set so low, it is hard not to think that, absent the Jones Act, that we’d be doing any worse,\" Grabow said. \"And in fact, I think we’d do better. And why do I think we’d do better? It's because… fundamentally, I think an industry that doesn't have to compete will become uncompetitive.

    "article_text": "'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts discuss a Democratic senator meeting with alleged MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador after he was deported by the Trump administration. Four more Democratic lawmakers traveled to El Salvador to visit an illegal immigrant and suspected MS-13 gang member deported by PresidentDonald Trump’sadministration. Reps. Robert Garcia of California, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, and Maxine Dexter of Oregon announced in a press release Monday that they had arrived in El Salvador \"to pressure the Trump Administration to abide by a Supreme Court order to facilitate the return ofKilmar Abrego Garcia.\"The four Democrats described Garcia as \"a Maryland man with protected legal status who was unlawfully deported by the Trump Administration.\" Their visit comes after Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., flew to El Salvador last week to visit Abrego Garcia, who had been transferred from the country's notorious mega prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT), in Tecoluca to the detention facility \"Centro Industrial\" in Santa Ana days earlier. DEPORTED ILLEGAL ALIEN AND SUSPECTED MS-13 GANG MEMBER TRANSFERRED FROM NOTORIOUS EL SALVADORAN MEGA-PRISON This undated photo provided by Murray Osorio PLLC shows Kilmar Abrego Garcia.(Murray Osorio PLLC via AP) In their press release, the four Democrats said their trip was not being financed by taxpayer dollars after House Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., denied Garcia and Frost’s request for an official congressional member delegation (CODEL). They argued the Trump administration's removal of Garcia constituted \"kidnapping\" or him being \"disappeared\" – a term used to describe abducted and murdered prisoners and dissidents during Argentina's \"Dirty War.\" Meanwhile, Trump weighed in on Abrego Garcia's case in another TRUTH Social post on Sunday. \"Radical Lunatic Democrats and their Comrades in the Fake News Media are falsely making Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia out to be a very sweet and innocent person, which is a total, blatant, and dangerous LIE,\" Trump wrote. \"Garcia has been found by two separate Courts to be a member of the violent,killer gang MS-13,was in our Country illegally, and is under a Deportation Order.\" \"It is despicable and unAmerican for Liberals and the Mainstream Media to hate our Country so much, and be obsessed with protecting criminals, instead of working to keep our Border, streets, and families safe,\" he added. \"Those lying to the American People on behalf of violent criminals have to be held responsible by the Agencies and the Courts. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" The four Democrats demanded the Trump administration bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States, arguing his deportation constituted a \"constitutional crisis.\" Sen.

CHRIS VAN HOLLEN, DEMOCRAT AT CENTER OF KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA SAGA, RESPONDS TO GRIEVING ANGEL MOM'S CRITICISM \"While Donald Trump continues to defy the Supreme Court, Kilmar Abrego Garcia is being held illegally in El Salvador after being wrongfully deported,\"  Garcia said. \"That is why we’re here – to remind the American people that kidnapping immigrants and deporting them without due process is not how we do things in America. We are demanding the Trump Administration abide by the Supreme Court decision and give Kilmar and the other migrants mistakenly sent to El Salvador due process in the United States.\" \"Donald Trump and his Administration are running a government-funded kidnapping program – illegally arresting, jailing, and deporting innocent people with zero due process. Kilmar Abrego Garcia is Trump’s latest victim,\" Frost said in a statement. \"As Members of Congress it is our responsibility to hold the President and Administration accountable for defying the constitution of the United States. Donald Trump and ICE are not above the law. Today it’s Kilmar, but tomorrow it could be anyone else. We cannot and will not let Donald Trump get away with this.\" Sen. Chris Van Hollen, is welcomed by supporters at Washington Dulles International Airport on Friday, April 18, 2025.(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana) \"My parents fled an authoritarian regime in Iran where people were ‘disappeared’ – I refuse to sit back and watch it happen here, too. Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s illegal abduction and President Trump’s complete disregard of due process and a unanimousSupreme Court rulingare deeply disturbing. We should all be appalled by this treatment by the United States government,\" Ansari said. \"What happened to Kilmar Abrego Garcia is not just one family’s nightmare – it is a constitutional crisis that should outrage every single one of us,\" Dexter said. \"We will not rest while due process is discarded, and our constitutional rights are ignored.\" The National Republican Congressional Committee – the campaign for House Republicans – meanwhile, said it is offering to pick up the tab for any House Democrat \"eager to hang out with their new poster child in El Salvador,a confirmed illegalimmigrant, MS-13 gang member, and alleged domestic abuser.\" \"We just have one condition:Livestream the whole thing. Snap plenty of selfies with your MS-13 buddies — the same violent criminals you’re trying to reimport into American neighborhoods to rape, kill, and terrorize law-abiding citizens,\" the NRCC said. \"If out of touch House Democrats are so desperate to cozy up to violent gang members, the least they can do is let Americans watch the show. We’ll pay for the plane tickets, they just can’t forget to smile for the camera while they sell out their constituents,\" NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella added. The Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia, 29, to El Salvador in what it described in court filings as an\"administrative error,\"and has since said that it is up to El Salvador whether Abrego Garcia returns to the U.S. Meanwhile, a federal court and the Supreme Court have instructed the Trump administration to coordinate Abrego Garcia’s return so that proper deportation hearings can occur. TheJustice Departmentunveiled documents on Wednesday detailing domestic violence allegations that Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez, included in a court filing in 2021. Vasquez alleged in the filing that Abrego Garcia beat her and that she had documentation of the bruises he left on her. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Additionally, a 2022 Homeland Security Investigations report obtained by Fox News claims that Abrego Garcia was suspected of partaking in labor and human trafficking. The report said a Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper pulled Abrego Garcia over in 2022 after swerving. The patrol officer found eight other individuals in the car with Abrego Garcia, who had just begun driving three days prior. The officer originally believed the incident qualified as a human trafficking case because no luggage was found in the car, but the officer ultimately only wrote up Abrego Garcia for driving with an expired license.

The chat was reportedly created by Hegseth, the New York Times reported Sunday, citing four people with knowledge of the chat. Trump chided reporters who asked whether he remained confident in Hegseth following the reports. \"Oh totally. Why do you even ask a question like that? We have recruitments at that center at all time high, the spirit and the armed forces is fantastic,\" he told a reporter. \"Great confidence.\" \"It's just fake news, they just bring up stories, I guess, it sounds like disgruntled employees,\" he said. \"You know he was put there to get rid of a lot of bad people and that's what he’s doing.

TheWhite Houselate Sunday similarly dismissed the report as a \"non-story,\" suggesting that disgruntled former Pentagon employees were spreading false claims. \"No matter how many times the legacy media tries to resurrect the same non-story, they can’t change the fact that no classified information was shared,\" said Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary. \"Recently-fired ‘leakers’ are continuing to misrepresent the truth to soothe their shattered egos and undermine the President’s agenda, but the administration will continue to hold them accountable.\" PENTAGON'S WEEK OF POWER STRUGGLES: LEAK FALLOUT AND SHOUTING MATCHES HIT HEGSETH'S INNER CIRCLE Former Pentagon spokesman John Ullyot, who announced he was resigning last week unrelated to the leaks, penned an op-edpublished in Politicoon Sunday that detailed what he called \"the Month from Hell\" inside the agency. \"President Donald Trump has a strong record of holding his top officials to account. Given that, it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer,\" Ullyot wrote. He wrote that \"the building is in disarray under Hegseth’s leadership\" after the defense secretary \"followed horrible crisis-communications advice from his new public affairs team\" regarding the first Signal chat. Ullyot wrote that Trump \"deserves better from his senior leadership.\" The first chat, set up bynational security adviser Mike Waltz, included several Cabinet members. The contents of that chat, which The Atlantic published, shows that Hegseth listed weapons systems and a timeline for the attack on Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen last month.

WHAT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE SCREAMING ABOUT TRUMP'S TARIFFS Trump put a 90-day pause on reciprocal, customized tariffs he had imposed on dozens of nations on April 9, which was an abrupt change of course after saying there would not be a pause to the tariffs, just negotiations. Simultaneously, the Trump administration upped the ante on its tariff on China to 125%.

    "article_text": "Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the rise in breast cancer rates among younger women. The annualcancer statisticsreport from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) — which was published in the journal Cancer on Monday, April 21 — shows some signs of progress in America’s fight against the disease. Overall, rates of new cancer diagnoses and cancer-related deaths have declined. Between 2018 and 2022, cancer death rates have decreased by 1.7% each year for men and 1.3% for women, the report stated. \"Cancer death ratesare falling among both men and women because of many factors — including better screening, early intervention, more advanced surgical approaches and better targeted therapies,\" Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, told Fox News Digital. COLORECTAL CANCER RISK REDUCED BY THIS COMMON VITAMIN, STUDY SUGGESTS Smoking-related cancers in particular (lung, bladder and larynx) saw significant declines in new cases and deaths, the researchers noted, likely driven byreduced tobacco useand changes in screening recommendations. Between 2018 and 2022, cancer death rates have decreased by 1.7% each year for men and 1.3% for women.(iStock) Foradult males, mortality rates declined for 12 of the most common cancer types between 2018 and 2022, including prostate, liver and intrahepatic bile duct, esophagus, melanoma of the skin, kidney and renal pelvis, urinary bladder, colon and rectum, leukemia, myeloma, stomach, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung and bronchus. Lung and bronchus cancer saw the biggest decline in deaths, falling by 4.5% each year in that four-year timeframe, according to the report. COMMON MEDICAL TEST LINKED TO 5% OF CANCERS, STUDY SUGGESTS: ‘USE THEM WISELY’ \"This is largely due to early and more effective screening, roboticlung surgery(which can get the cancer before it escapes the lung), and more effective targeted and immunotherapies when it does escape the lung,\" Siegel said. Men's death rates increased for cancers of pancreas, bones and joints, oral cavity and pharynx, and non-melanoma skin cancer during this period. Among women, 14 common cancers had reduced death rates, including brain and other nervous system, cervix, soft tissue including heart, urinary bladder, kidney and renal pelvis, breast, stomach, leukemia, colon and rectum, myeloma, gallbladder, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovary, and lung and bronchus, the researchers stated. Lung and bronchus cancerdeaths also declined the most for women, falling 3.4% annually between 2018 and 2022. Prostate cancer saw the sharpest increase in new cancer cases among men, rising 2.9% per year.(iStock) \"As of 2021, the death rate frombreast cancerfell by 42% from its peak in 1989, thanks to treatment and screening advancements,\" the report noted. Death rates increased for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, corpus and uterus, and liver and intrahepatic bile duct for women during this timeframe. Among children, cancer death rates fell by 1.5% per year between 2001 and 2022, the data showed. Among teens and young adults (15 to 39 years of age), cancer-related mortality decreased by 2.9% per year from 2001 to 2005 and 1% per year from 2005 and 2020. Death rates did not change for the above group between 2020 and 2022. Among men, new cancer diagnoses fell by 1.6% to 2.2% each year between 2001 and 2013. Those rates remained stable between 2013 and 2021, according to the researchers. PROSTATE CANCER DRUG NOW AVAILABLE TO MORE PATIENTS WITH AGGRESSIVE FORM OF DISEASE Between 2017 and 2021, men’s diagnoses decreased for cancer of the brain andother nervous system, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, colon and rectum, thyroid, urinary bladder, larynx, and lung and bronchus. Lung and bronchus cancer saw the biggest decline in cases, falling 3.4% per year. Among men, new cancer diagnoses fell by 1.6% to 2.2% each year between 2001 and 2013.(iStock) Six cancers saw an increase in diagnoses. Those included prostate, pancreas, oral cavity and pharynx, kidney and renal pelvis, myeloma and testis, as listed in the report. Prostate cancersaw the sharpest increase, rising 2.9% per year. New cases remained stable for the following cancer types: stomach, melanoma of the skin, esophagus, leukemia, and liver and intrahepatic bile duct. For women, the report noted that new cancer cases rose by 0.3% per year between 2003 and 2021. Women saw an increase in eight cancers: stomach, liver and intrahepatic bile duct,melanoma of the skin, breast, myeloma, pancreas, corpus and uterus, and oral cavity and pharynx. 16% of all breast cancer cases can be linked to alcohol consumption. \"The reduction in fertility rates, advancing age at first birth, and rises in obesity and alcohol consumption are likely driving rising rates of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,\" the researchers stated. The researchers also noted that 16% of all breast cancer cases can be linked todrinking alcohol. \"Cancer death rates are falling among both men and women because of many factors — including better screening, early intervention, more advanced surgical approaches and better targeted therapies,\" Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, told Fox News Digital.(iStock) Regarding the increase in uterine cancer cases and deaths, the researchers cited risk factors ofexcess body weight, physical inactivity, diabetes and early menstruation. Stomach cancer cases were the fastest-growing in women, rising 3.2% per year. EXPERIMENTAL WOMEN'S CANCER DRUG BOOSTS SURVIVAL RATES IN NOTABLE STUDY \"Women have rising rates of new cancer cases across more sites than men,\" the report authors wrote. \"However, the increase in stomach cancer cases likely relates to how certain tumors in the stomach —gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GISTs — are now all classified as malignant.\" \"This change happened based on better understanding of these types of rare tumors and does not reflect a change in the underlying cancer burden.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The report also pointed out that new cases offemale cancersincreased in areas associated with excess body weight — including the breast, uterus, colon and rectum among teens and young adults and the pancreas, kidney and liver among women.

    "article_text": "A 5-year-old boy is dead after an oxygen therapy chamber he was inside exploded at a medical facility Michigan. (Credit: WJBK) Boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya, 52, recently shared a beauty secret that is raising some eyebrows. \"These lasers only making me younger and cuter … sorry fellas,\" he recently posted on Instagram, along with a video of himself receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) along with a laser treatment. \"CO2 laser + hyperbaric chamber=sexy papichulo by next week,\" he went on. While HBOT can serve as a supplement for other therapies, it is not aprimary treatmentfor illnesses, experts emphasized. COMMON SUPPLEMENT COULD HELP YOU LIVE LONGER, RESEARCH SUGGESTS Fox News Digital spoke to the experts to find out whether HBOT is a safe aesthetic treatment. In everyday life, humansbreathe in airso that blood can deliver oxygen to cells for energy — but that air is only comprised of 21% oxygen. Boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya, 52, recently shared that he undergoes hyperbaric oxygen therapy.(Getty/iStock) Hyperbaric oxygen therapy works by pumping 100% oxygen to the tissues, which can aid in healing. (Tissues need oxygen to function normally, but they require more oxygen after injury, experts say.) For an HBOT session, the patient enters a long, tube-shaped chamber that resembles an MRI machine. They typically lie on their back while oxygen is pumped into the chamber for one to two hours, experts confirm. ANTI-AGING BENEFITS LINKED TO ONE SURPRISING HEALTH HABIT The chamber has two-and-a-half times more air pressure than normal, the National Institutes of Health notes. That increased pressure then \"floods\" injured tissues with oxygen-rich blood to help them heal. \"Exclusively relying on HBOT is not recommended.\" \"Adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has certainly gained more momentum in themedical community, assisting with the healing of severe diabetic foot ulcers, failing skin grafts/flaps and tissue severely damaged by radiation injury,\" Dr. Caesar A. Anderson, medical director at UCSD Hyperbaric Medicine & Wound Healing Center in California, told Fox News Digital. The therapy also helps to reduce inflammation and promote growth of new blood vessels, the doctor added. However, Anderson added, \"Exclusively relying on HBOT is not recommended.\" For an HBOT session, the patient enters a long, tube-shaped chamber that resembles an MRI machine. They typically lie on their back while oxygen is pumped into the chamber for one to two hours, experts confirm.(iStock) HBOT has also been shown to be effective in wound healing — \"especially in burns, infections and immunocompromised patients\" — and to treat carbon monoxide poisoning, according to Dr. Suzanne A. Trott, a double board-certified plastic and general surgeon in Beverly Hills. Additionally, the treatment is often helpful for improvingoutcomes after surgery. VETERANS' PTSD SYMPTOMS COULD IMPROVE WITH HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY, STUDY SHOWS \"Oral surgeons refer patients who have had radiation forhead or neck cancerand require tooth extractions,\" Anderson said. HBOT primes the radiated tissue with oxygen, which enables the body to better tolerate surgery while minimizing post-operative complications, he noted. Trott said that in her own practice, she recommends one pre-operative and five post-operative HBOT treatments for all aesthetic and reconstructive patients — \"because it really does improve recovery.\" Hyperbaric oxygen therapy works by pumping 100% oxygen to the tissues, which can aid in healing.(iStock) \"When you come out of it, you've got a nice glow, so it's a great red-carpet treatment — but that look is temporary,\" she added. Approximately 15 conditions are approved for hyperbaric oxygen therapy by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine Society (UHMS). CELEBRITIES LIKE BIEBER, BIALIK ARE USING HYPERBARIC OXYGEN THERAPY: HERE’S WHY IT’S TRENDING Some of these include carbon monoxide poisoning, burns, decompression sickness, severe anemia and severe wounds. \"Chronic refractory bone infections and/or necrotizing tissue infections are also approved indications for HBOT use, as severe anaerobic infections do not thrive in a hyper-oxygenated environment,\" Anderson told Fox News Digital. The ability for HBOT to reverse or abbreviate theaging processhas not yet been endorsed by the governing medical body, the UHMS, according to Anderson. \"The aging process is complex, and certainly we know that with aging, our ability to efficiently utilize oxygen on the cellular level is modified,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I don't think we are at the point where we can just target the parts of our body that we don't want to age.\" Past studies have shown that the treatment decreases cell death by maintaining and increasing the length of telomeres, which are extensions of DNA that prevent cells from degrading, Trott said. \"While this makes it sound like a cure-all for aging … I don't think we are at the point where we can just target the parts of our body that we don't want to age,\" she said. The chamber has two-and-a-half times more air pressure than normal, the National Institutes of Health notes.(iStock) For most people, the doctor surmised, that would likely include things likemaintaining skin elasticity, muscle mass, and hair volume and color. \"We have not yet harnessed the power of HBOT to visibly slow down or reverse the external signs of aging,\" Trott added. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says the treatment is generally safe and that serious complications are not common. The increased pressure and concentration of oxygen, however, can causemiddle ear infections, rupture of an eardrum, temporary vision changes and, in rare cases, collapse of the lungs, according to the agency.

Carlito, the third member of the Judgment Day, got involved in the match as he tried to help his friends out. He interfered with Breakker and Penta. But Breakker got his revenge. Carlito stood on one of the announce tables and across from him was Breakker. The son of the legendary Rick Steiner then speared Carlito through the table. Breakker speared Penta but Mysterio came back and hit the 619. Balor interfered with Mysterio’s frog splash attempt and it appeared he was on the verge of winning the match. As Balor tried to pin Breakker, Mysterio was on the top rope and hit the frog splash on top of him. Mysterio pinned Balor and picked up the incredible win.

San Diego Padresfirst baseman Luis Arraez was stretchered off the field at Daikin Park in Houston on Sunday night after colliding with Astros second baseman Mauricio Dubon while running out a bunt. Arraez was busting it down the line after dragging his bunt toward the bag, and Dubon noticed that first baseman Christian Walker and pitcher Framber Valdez were not going to get to the base in time to make the out. Walker flipped the ball to Dubon, who just beat Arraez to the bag, but he didn’t provide Arraez any way to run through the bag. In a blink, Arraez and Dubon collided, and the Padres star caught the worst of it.

The Padres released a statement later saying that Arraez was in stable condition. \"He is currently stable, conscious, responsive, and able to move his extremities,\" the statement reads. Arraez also gave a thumbs-up to the crowd at Daikin Park to show he was conscious and aware, which led to a positive reception from everyone.

Luis is a really, really tough guy, and to see him down like that, you know something is pretty serious. Took a pretty good blow, sounds like he’s stable now, has feeling in his extremities, is alert, aware of what took place, which is clearly good. Now we’re worried about – because he’s got a little bit of a cut on the jaw – worried about the jaw and what’s the stability of that. And, of course, the cervical, making sure it’s stable as well.\" Arraez’s Padres teammates on the field were visibly shaken, with Fernando Tatis Jr. andManny Machadopraying together. \"This is a very close group, man, this is a group that really, really genuinely loves each other,\" Shildt added. \"People say that a lot, but there’s a lot of real love.

    "article_text": "Preserving voicemails securely on Android: Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reveals easy methods to keep memories alive forever. Losing a loved one is never easy, and dealing with their digital life can add another layer of stress during an already difficult time. John from Northampton, Pennsylvania, reached out with a question that many people face but few know how to handle: \"Please explain how to remove a deceased person’s Facebook account.\" John, we're very sorry for your loss, and you're not alone in wondering what to do next. Managing a deceased person’s Facebook presence can feel overwhelming, especially if you’re not sure where to start. Facebook does offer a few options depending on whether you'd like to preserve their account as a memorial or have it removed entirely. Here's what you need to know, along with how to protect their digital legacy from misuse. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW A woman scrolling on Facebook(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) When Facebook is made aware that someone has passed away, their policy is tomemorializethe account. This turns the profile into a digital tribute, serving as a space where friends and family can gather, share memories and view photos and posts. A memorialized account: Memorializing an account not only honors the person’s memory but also adds a layer of security by locking the account from unauthorized access. Anyone can request a Facebook account be memorialized if they believe the user has passed away, but only verified immediate family or a legacy contact can manage the account afterward. HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SOCIAL MEDIA SCAMMERS If Facebook hasn’t already memorialized the account, you can request it yourself. While anyone can submit a memorialization request, Facebook may require proof if you're not a close family member. Here's how to request memorialization: If a legacy contact was assigned by the deceased before they passed, that person will be notified and may be able to manage the memorialized profile. If you're unsure what a legacy contact is or how to set one up for your own account, go toFacebook>Settings>Memorialization Settings and choose someone you trust. For more on legacy contacts and digital legacy planning, check out:One day you’ll leave this Earth, but your data will live on in a messy future. If you'd prefer to have the account permanently deleted rather than memorialized, Facebook provides a separate process for that, but only for immediate family members or legal representatives. Here are the steps to remove the account: Note: Even if you know the person’s login information, Facebook’s terms prohibit logging into someone else’s account, even after death. In cases where the deceased did not use their legal name on Facebook or was a minor, Facebook may request additional documentation to verify their identity.

    "title": "Apple Watch alerts woman to life-threatening leukemia diagnosis",
    "article_text": "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says an Apple Watch saved psychiatrist Amanda Faulkner by detecting deadly leukemia early. In recent years, smartwatches have gone far beyond just telling the time or tracking steps. These little gadgets on our wrists are becoming powerful health tools, quietly monitoring our bodies and sometimes even alerting us to serious medical issues before we realize something’s wrong. From tracking heart rate and sleep patterns to measuring blood oxygen levels, smartwatches are helping people stay more in tune with their health than ever before. STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS – SIGN UP FOR KURT’S ‘THE CYBERGUY REPORT’ NOW Apple Watch saves woman’s life (Amanda Faulkner)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) Take Amanda Faulkner’s story, for example. Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn’t think much of it. But her newApple Watchkept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s. At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life. Within hours of tests, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer. Doctors told her that if she had waited another 48 hours, she might not have survived. Apple Watch saves woman’s life (Amanda Faulkner)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH Amanda’s experience shows just how powerful these wearable devices can be, not as medical diagnosis tools but as early warning systems that encourage people to seek help sooner. Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren’t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference. Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy anApple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated.

She urges others, especially women who often have their symptoms dismissed, to trust their instincts and advocate for their health. Apple Watch saves woman’s life (Amanda Faulkner)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH YOUR APPLE WATCH While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it’s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone’s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It’s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses. SUBSCRIBE TO KURT’S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES Apple Watch saves woman’s life (Amanda Faulkner)(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THE APPLE WATCH COULD HELP YOU UNCOVER HIDDEN SLEEP APNEA Smartwatches are more than just tech accessories; they’re becoming essential health companions. While they don’t replace professional medical advice, their ability to monitor vital signs continuously and alert users to potential problems is transforming how we approach health. Amanda Faulkner’s story is a powerful reminder that sometimes the smallest devices can make the biggest difference, literally saving lives by catching warning signs early. So, if your smartwatch starts \"nagging\" you about your health, it might just be worth paying attention to it. Has a wearable device ever alerted you to a health issue or helped you take action?

    "title": "DAVID MARCUS: These 3 are auditioning to be Democrats' next George Floyd",
    "article_text": "The family of accused killer Karmelo Anthony read a prepared statement from their attorney during a press conference Thursday. Anthony is charged with killing Austin Metcalf at a Texas track meet. Democrats are still reeling from the debacle that was their 2024 election cycle, and still have not found a means to effectively fight back againstPresident Donald Trump’s ambitious agenda. So, naturally, they have decided to dip into the past and find a hero, or more specifically, a martyr. Auditions are already happening. As we speak, the holy trinity of the supposedly oppressed that graces the altar of the progressive media ecosystem are alleged murderersLuigi MangioneandKarmelo Anthonyas well as alleged MS-13 gang member and human trafficker in the country illegally,Kilmar Abrego Garcia. DEMOCRATS PRIORITIZING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS OVER CITIZENS IS ‘MIND BOGGLING,’ SAYS WHITE HOUSE First, we have Mangione, on trial for the murder of United Healthcare CEO, husband and fatherBrian Thompsonin a targeted hit to protest the insurance industry. Just last week liberal internet lady Taylor Lorenz, former doyenne of The New York Times and Washington Post, was gushing about him being the kind of \"moral man\" women love, on CNN. Then there is Anthony, the 17-year-old high school student who allegedly stabbed a fellow teenager to death at a track meet. Because the victim was White and the accused is Black, the left has been dropping race cards like they’re hot, and Anthony has raised hundreds of thousands of dollars online. Luigi Mangione appears in Manhattan Supreme Court in New York City on December 23, 2024. Mangione is facing murder charges for allegedly shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson earlier this month.(Curtis Means for DailyMail/Pool) Finally, we have the case of \"where in El Salvador is Kilmar Garcia?\" The Trump administration properly deported Garcia, but accidentally sent him to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. Now he is out of that prison, but still in El Salvador after Maryland Democrat Sen. Chris Van Hollen’s dramatic trip to visit him. But still, this would-be poster child for the abuses of the Trump immigration policy is an alleged gang member, credibly accused of human trafficking, whose own wife had a restraining order against him. Cesar Chavez this guy is not. Nonetheless, don’t be too shocked if liberal white women start getting Garcia-style knuckle tattoos in solidarity. It can be the new pink hat. It may seem strange to many people that Democrats would choose this rogue's gallery of ne’er-do-wells to be the faces of their rebrand, but then again, there are statues of George Floyd all over the country. In other words, it worked last time. The 2020 death of Floyd was no doubt tragic, but he was also a criminal with a long rap sheet, hopped up on drugs who was resisting arrest. The case against Derek Chauvin and his fellow police officers, who were convicted, was never black and white, but the national response sure as hell was. Kilmar Abrego Garcia meets with Sen. Van Hollen(X / @nayibbukele) Flames engulfed our cities in the fiery \"but mostly peaceful\" riots that occasioned Floyd’s passing, people died, a billion dollars of damage was done, but more importantly to Democrats, it helped them put Joe Biden in the White House. Talk about compounding a tragedy. Heading into this summer, Democrats fervently long for protesters to once again fill our streets, this time for Mangione, Anthony, and Garcia. There is not much reason to think they will mind if those protests turn to riots. A split of Karmelo Anthony and Austin Metcalf(FOX 4/Jeff Metcalf) But this time around there are a few things going against the Democrats as they once again try to recreate the protests of the 1960s. First and most obviously, Mangione, Anthony, and Garcia are alive, and most rational people think all three are legitimate subjects of legal actions. It's harder to be a martyr if you’re not dead. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Also, in 2020, and it still seems insane to even say this, protests over the death of George Floyd were quite literally the only way for Americans to legally gather in many cities. With straight faces, people on TV said that racism, too, was a disease, just like COVID. And yet, slowly but surely, we have seen protests pick up steam. First they were directed at Elon Musk’s role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, but now it has turned to a more amorphous charge of oligarchy, autocracy and fascism. Each of the left’s trio of new heroes speaks to elements of this vague charge against the Trump administration: Mangione represents the failing health care system, Anthony the supposedly racist criminal justice system, and Garcia, an alleged anti-immigrant fervor. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As summer approaches, we will soon know how well the Democrats manage to mobilize the masses on our streets, and whether any of their fiery rhetoric against all things Trump leads to violence. But make no mistake, the protests are coming, and Mangione, Anthony, and Garcia, are likely to be their symbols.

    "title": "Pope Francis was disruptive. Now, the next pope must clean up the 'mess'",
    "article_text": "The Vatican announced Pope Francis has died at 88 years old. Fox News' Lauren Green gives an inside look at his life and legacy. If there is any one thing that can be agreed upon by all parties aboutPope Francis’s pontificateit is that it was disruptive and ambiguous on several levels. Many will rush to make an assessment of his legacy but this is premature, if not injurious. After all, we are still assessing past pontificates—never mind the broader legacy of Vatican II—and their implications for the life of the Church. As the first pope from the Americas—though of Italian immigrant parentage—his election was historic. While improbable, it is not entirely inconceivable the next conclave could result in the first African pope since ancient times, especially considering the Church’s dynamic growth on the continent. If you go to most Catholic parishes these days, you are likely to see a priest from Africa (or even India) celebrating Mass. The French missionary priests to Africa who were once known as the \"White Fathers\" may soon be revived, but in reverse, with the \"Black Fathers\" evangelizing the West. It is, perhaps, best to first consider the role of the Petrine ministry in its historical context. Despite the widespread and immediate attention given papal homilies, allocutions, documents, and international visits, it is helpful to remember that, until recently, Catholics rarely heard from the pope directly. The idea of a hierarchy has, of course, been part of the Church’s self-understanding going back to the Apostles, but most of the actual governance has been carried out and implemented by local bishops and only, when clearly needed, by higher levels of ecclesial authority. Authentic \"synodality\" is more normatively seen at the local parish-level engagement and through subsidiarity, where needs are met by those closest to them. The contemporary micromanagement of the Church, at times right down to parish bulletins, is largely a phenomenon enabled by modern technology, the ease of travel, and instant communication. POPE FRANCIS DEAD AT 88, VATICAN SAYS Pope Francis spoke frequently and emphatically about the \"technological paradigm,\" warning against a worldview that reduces human dignity to technical problem-solving and manipulative engineering. He also worked, alongside figures like the late Cardinal George Pell, to reform Vatican finances—though admittedly with inconclusive results. His condemnation of Western \"ideological colonization,\" particularly regarding gender ideology, was strong. However, unlike his predecessor, John Paul II, Francis was far less forceful in his statements against the widespread persecution of Christians in China, Cuba, Nicaragua, and in theMiddle East. His own declarations, such as in \"Fiducia Supplicans,\" which permitted the spontaneous blessing of same-sex couples, were seen by some as highly problematic both theologically (contradicting established moral teaching), but also culturally, particularly inAfrica, where church leaders viewed them as akin to the cultural imperialism they experience from some international NGOs. As the Church prepares for its next chapter, the lessons of Pope Francis's papacy will undoubtedly shape its future trajectory. His legacy remains a work in progress, a testament to the evolving nature of the papal role in the modern world. Pope Francis’s off-the-cuff remarks, often mid-flight, sometimes referred to as the \"Airplane Magisterium,\" have caused confusion and often necessitated clarification from theVatican. While his approach to the environment has earned him the moniker \"The Green Pope,\" in practice he pretty much aligned with the teachings of John Paul II and Benedict XVI, particularly on population and life issues. In fact, to the surprise of some who have only superficially followed his pontificate, his stance onabortionwas uncompromising—calling it \"homicidal\" and even likening it to \"hiring a hitman\"—even if he suggested it ought not be the constant focus. The diplomatic rapprochement withChina, largely brokered by Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin, encompasses a vision for a closer relationship and eventual bilateral relations. His relationship with a nation of more than one billion Chinese, among whom 12 million are estimated to be Catholics (both clandestine and legal), has produced a provisional agreement as controversial as it is secretive. Cardinal Parolin's policy largely follows the Cold War-era policy of Ostpolitik of Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, his predecessor, whose tepid approach to the persecutions in the Soviet bloc did not come to an end until the more confrontational pontificate of John Paul II, who replaced Casaroli a year into his pontificate. At the inception of his papacy, Francis's call to \"make a mess\" in the Church led to debates, divisions, and polarization. Perhaps surfacing these differences was a good thing. But it is possible, and likely, this may cause the cardinal electors in the upcoming conclave to select a more stabilizing figure. Of course, even Bergoglio was seen by some at the beginning to be a kinder and gentler Ratzinger. Pope Francis waves to believers as he leaves the Cercle Cite after a meeting Luxembourg's Prime minister during a four-day apostolic journey in Luxembourg and Belgium, in Luxembourg city on September 26, 2024.(Simon Wohlfahrt/AFP/Getty) Francis laudably condemned ideological colonization and the commodification of the human person, while also recognizing the role of entrepreneurs in economic development. These kinds of statements have been, however, eclipsed by his more strident and un-nuanced critiques of capitalism, too often failing to distinguish between free markets grounded in virtue and the corrupt crony capitalism he witnessed in his native Argentina. In terms of preserving the continuity of the Church’s moral teaching, perhaps the most theologically deficient contribution of his legacy is to be found in his encyclical \"Amoris Laetitia,\" particularly where, in a single cautious footnote, he laid the ground for the possibility Catholics in irregular marriages (i.e., couples in marriages outside the Church’s teaching on marriage) could receive Communion in certain circumstances. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINIONLikewise, Pope Francis's updating of the Catechism's teaching on capital punishment to now being \"inadmissible\" has stirred an ongoing debate on whether the death penalty is intrinsically evil, putting it on the same level as abortion. This, too, needs clarification. Many people todaysee the Catholic Churchas largely anachronistic, closed, and harsh—not at all empathetic to the real-life problems people face. Pope Francis seemed bent on deconstructing that perception by presenting a merciful, open, and maternal face of the Church. He might say that it is not enough to teach people what the Catechism says, we must inspire them to live it. In this way, as the ministry of any priest, he must negotiate the tension between coming, in effect, upon the woman caught in the very act of adultery, protecting her from the stones of condemnation, and yet also finding a way to lovingly, credibly, and truthfully tell her to \"sin no more.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP As the Church prepares for its next chapter, the lessons of Pope Francis's papacy will undoubtedly shape its future trajectory. His legacy remains a work in progress, a testament to the evolving nature of the papal role in the modern world. And it is against this backdrop that the next pope or a future one will seek to clarify the myriad ambiguities and unclear messaging on moral and doctrinal matters that have defined the last 12 years. This is imperative not only to maintain the credibility of the Petrine Office, but for the health of the universal Church. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM FR. ROBERT SIRICO Rev.

    "title": "Five key things could sway Kohberger murder trial",
    "article_text": "Fox News' Chanley Painter reports the latest on Kohberger's case. The man accused ofkilling four University of Idaho studentsin 2022 is set to stand trial later this summer, with jury selection beginning July 30, 2025. Bryan Kohberger has been charged with four counts of murder in the stabbings of victims: Kaylee Goncalves, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen, and Ethan Chapin. Kohberger has entered a plea of not guilty. Though, if convicted, he may face the death penalty. As the trial date nears, here are five things to keep an eye on: 'DOOMSDAY MOM' LORI VALLOW'S ARIZONA MURDER CONSPIRACY TRIAL: WILDEST MOMENTS IN COURT SO FAR In any murder trial, calling the defendant to testify is a risk. On one hand, it’s impactful for the jury to hear the defendant claim innocence with information to support that claim. However, it sets up across-examination from the prosecution,which can rattle a defendant in what’s already a highly charged situation. Brian Kohberger in a Latah County Court for his Jan. 5, 2023, initial appearance(POOL) Evoking anger or frustration will help prosecutors paint a picture of the possibility that Kohberger could have performed such a heinous act. The prosecution in this case wants to use Kohberger’s testimony to disprove his alibi, though the defense is looking for other ways to corroborate it. No motive has been established, and Kohberger’s defense team wants to make the argument that someone else could have planted the knife sheath with his DNA at the scene of the crime. If Kohberger’s defense team plans to argue the possibility of another attacker or multiple attackers, a jury is going to want evidence that points to a specific person or persons. Even if the possibility of an anonymous attacker is on the table, there needs to be support through DNA evidence or some type of surveillance footage that captures someone other than Kohberger at or near the crime scene at the time of the murders. As of early April, the deputy prosecutor for the case, Ashley S. Jennings, filed the evidence list with theIdaho trial judgewho will be presiding. It includes records from a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Dick’s Sporting Goods where the prosecution claims relevance for Kohberger’s purchase of a black balaclava in January 2022. This type of mask was the one described by the student who also lived in the house of the four victims and witnessed the killer fleeing through the back door. Prosecutors also want to introduce video footage at the Sunset Mart in Moscow, Idaho, a half a mile from the crime scene. It allegedly captures Kohberger driving to and from the home where the students were murdered. The evidence is meant to support a timeline of Kohberger’s activity leading up to and after the crimes took place and fill in any gaps that dismantle the argument that another attacker was involved. Jay Logsdon, center, an attorney representing Bryan Kohberger, second from left, speaks during a hearing in Latah County District Court, Wednesday, Sept. 13, 2023, in Moscow, Idaho. Kohberger is accused of killing four University of Idaho students in November 2022.(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, Pool) Because the case has been so highly publicized, it’ll be challenging to find an impartial jury. A change of venue was already court-ordered by the Idaho Supreme Court, moving the trial to Ada County in Idaho, rather than Latah County, where the murders took place. It’ll be interesting to see who the state calls as its first witness, since it’s usually the strongest witness to set the narrative. Expected witnesses to be called in this three-month-plus trial include members from various law enforcement agencies and forensic experts. The prosecution’s list includes: Moscow Police Forensic Detective Lawrence Mowery, an investigator on the case; Latah County Coroner Cathy Mabbutt, and Spokane County chief medical examiner, Dr. Veena Singh. Other potential experts to be called are FBI Special Agents Tony Imel and Nick Ballance. Ballance is prepared to speak about the location of Kohberger’s cell phone before and after the student homicides. Another expert the prosecutor may call is Shane Cox. As a manager with Amazon’s Law Enforcement Response team, Cox is responsible for subpoena responses and search warrant requests. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This testimony may not provide the full context of the workings of Amazon or Kohberger’s account and would oppose his testimony as well. However, prosecutors argue the purchase of a Ka-Bar knife and sheath allegedly used to stab the four students makes it relevant. Boise-based expert Dr. Gary Dawson is also expected to be called to the stand by the prosecution to rebut the defense’s claim that there were multiple attackers. His testimony is expected to include information about the victims’ intoxication levels, which would render them unable to fight back against a single assailant. The evidence is meant to support a timeline of Kohberger’s activity leading up to and after the crimes took place and fill in any gaps that dismantle the argument that another attacker was involved. Though both sides have submitted their legal expert list, they have until later this month to disclose other non-expert witnesses to testify to their personal experiences. This may include the surviving roommates who were not harmed during the homicide. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Also, although the state claims it may call Kohberger’s family members, they’ve said they have no interest in helping. As the trial date nears, more evidence, experts and potential documents will be filed on both sides to sway favor before the case is presented to a jury. The trial date is currently set for August 11, 2025.

    "title": "This is what de-nuking Iran could look like if Trump orders military strikes",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump on Monday once again reiterated that Iran must abandon any hope of obtaining a nuclear weapon as the U.S. prepares for more talks in less than a week. Iran can either talk, or get its weapons facilities bombed.Iranhas gone too far and can make weapons-grade nuclear fuel for one bomb in less than a week, with more to follow. Two aircraft carriers and a fleet of B-2 stealth bombers are pointed straight at Iran. Never before have we seen such a big forward deployment of B-2 bombers. Do the options really include a military strike onIran’s nuclear facilities? \"Of course it does,\" President Donald J. Trump said Monday. TRUMP SAYS IRAN MUST DITCH ‘CONCEPT OF A NUCLEAR WEAPON’ AHEAD OF MORE TALKS What’s changed is that a campaign to attackIran’s nuclear weaponsproduction is no longer far-fetched. Frankly, the attacks on Iran’s air defenses carried out by Israeli F-35s and other planes last year have lowered the risk calculus, both political and militarily. With the recent confirmation of Gen. Daniel Caine as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Trump has a new top military advisor who is experienced in planning and carrying out precision airstrikes. Not that he wants to go to war; Trump in his first term proved cautious and calculating in his use of military force. But Iran simply cannot be permitted to build anuclear weaponand the moment is here. Iran could enrich enough fuel for one bomb in a week, former Secretary of State Antony Blinken said last summer. Iran can enrich enough fuel for up to 17 bombs in four months, according to analysis of the latest UN inspection report from February. Then it’s about six months to assemble and field a weapon; most nuclear weapon design testing is done by computer, and who knows if Russia might assist. \"If it requires military, we’re going to have military,\" Trump said on April 9. \"Israel will obviously be very much involved in that. They’ll be the leader of that. But nobody leads us. We do what we want to do.\" For now, Iran is at the table, with more talks scheduled for April 19 in Rome. To keep the talks going, a big part of Trump’s strategy is to deploy to U.S. Central Command the forces required to smashIran’s nuclear weaponsmanufacturing capability. The military calls this \"sovereign options,\" because Trump needs no other country’s permission to launch strikes from aircraft carriers and bombers. Here’s one way the battle plan could unfold. Israel opens the airspace. In the October 2024 strikes, Israel launched over 100 combat planes to attack about 20 target areas in Iran, including air defenses and missile and drone factories.  An attack to \"de-nuke\" Iran would again see Israel focus on destroying air defenses. Aircraft carriers hold the skies. The U.S. Navy aircraft carriers USS Harry S. Truman and USS Carl Vinson are already in the Arabian Gulf region. Yes, they are waging a steady campaign against the Houthis in Yemen, but I assure you they can turn their attention to Iran at any moment. If that happens, E-2 radar planes from the carriers will add to the intelligence and surveillance picture, while F-35 and F/A-18 fighters, and the EA-18G Growler electronic warfare planes add offensive capability. B-2 Spirit stealth bombers hit nuclear manufacturing sites. Iran’s weapons complex is underground, so it will take a lot of rubble to debilitate it. Enter the B-2 stealth bomber, which carries weapons like the 30,000-lb. Massive Ordnance Penetrator, fused to push through earth and concrete then detonate its blast in the underground Iranian facilities. This is why the massive forward deployment of the B-2 is so significant. On the first night of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003, three B-2 bombers flew from the Indian Ocean island base of Diego Garcia and three flew from Whiteman AFB, in Missouri to attack Baghdad. Now Trump has sent a reported six B-2 bombers to Diego Garcia, which indicates a plan for intensive, repeated strikes, for as long as necessary. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION U.S. Navy destroyersguard the skies against missiles and drones. The U.S. still has forces stationed in Iraq, Syria and at other forward locations around the Persian Gulf, and they must be protected from Iranian retaliation via missiles and drones. U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class destroyers armed with an array of Standard Missiles did this job well last year, and they will be ready to take those shots again to defend American forces. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Remember the purpose of U.S. strikes would be to degrade Iran’s nuclear facilities, and stoke Ayatollah Khamenei’s fears for the stability of the regime. Iran’s President Mahmoud Pezeshkian says he wants the nuclear talks to proceed – not that it will be easy, especially if China keeps purchasing 90% of Iran’s oil. It’s been almost ten years since the flawed Iran nuclear deal was touted as the way to stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon. This time it will be the U.S. military that swings the balance, hopefully for diplomacy, and if needed, for a swift end to Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

    "title": "VIVEK RAMASWAMY: Why it’s time to take on the administrative state",
    "article_text": "Ohio gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy tells 'Hannity' why he wants to eliminate the state's income tax. Mark Twain once quipped, \"No man’s life, liberty, or property is safe while the legislature is in session.\" In the 1800s, his wit was aimed at lawmakers — but if he were alive today, he’d likely reserve his sharpest criticism for unelected bureaucrats, who often wield more power than those we elect. Unlike legislators, these regulators don’t take recesses. They’re \"in session\" 40 hours a week, every week, quietly issuing rules that extend into nearly every corner of American life. Most Americans are aware that federal agencies — the infamous \"alphabet soup\" in Washington — have overstepped. But the problem is just as pervasive, and perhaps more dangerous, in all 50 state capitals. The truth is simple: in today’s America, the regulatory state isn’t solving problems — it is the problem. Take my home state of Ohio, where one state licensing board recently went after a small Cincinnati engineering firm. Its offense? Hiring a licensed engineer as an independent contractor instead of a full-time employee — even though Ohio law only requires a \"full-time\" engineer, with no mention of employment status. TEXAS POISED TO CREATE ITS OWN VERSION OF DOGE AS BILL PASSES BOTH CHAMBERS The board’s decision wasn’t grounded in law — it was based on their own interpretation of the rules. Thankfully, the Ohio Supreme Court consists of justices who practice judicial restraint, and in December 2022, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled that courts should not defer to regulators who go beyond the plain text of the law. The battle for Ohio's future should focus on cutting back the regulatory state. FILE: The State Capitol of Ohio in Columbus, Ohio.(Joe Sohm/Visions of America/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) This wasn’t just a win for one business. It was a victory for every entrepreneur trying to navigate a system stacked against them. Consider this: Ohio has 222 boards and commissions, each with the power toissue rules and red tape.From landscape architects to family therapists, every profession is burdened by regulations that are often arbitrary — and now, thanks to that ruling, legally challengeable. The Ohio Supreme Court’s decisionmarked a turning point, and the U.S. Supreme Court recently took a similar stance, signaling the beginning of the end for Chevron deference — a decades-old doctrine that gave federal agencies far too much leeway to interpret laws as they saw fit. Some ask why I’ve focused my policy efforts — formerly as a presidential candidate and now as a candidate for governor of Ohio — on the administrative state. It’s an esoteric concern to most Americans, as compared to their more pressing concerns about the economy, jobs and wages. But the truth is that the overgrowth of the regulatory state is actually the biggest impediment to the economy itself. Even worse, the regulatory machine often operates independently of the governor or the president. It has become an unelected \"fourth branch\" of government — one the Founders never envisioned, and the Constitution never authorized. In theory, our system is built on checks and balances. In practice, it’s often the bureaucracy doing the checking — without being held accountable themselves. President Donald Trump’s effortsto rein in the federal bureaucracy have stirred a hornet’s nest, and, as expected, the administrative state is fighting back. I expect similar pushback in Columbus if I’m elected governor. But that won’t stop me because we have the tools to restore accountability. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Ohio’s conservative leaders have made great strides in cutting burdensome regulations, including a mandate for every state agency to reduce regulations by 30% by mid-2025, but I know we can do more. Like Trump’s 10-for-1 deregulation policy, I will require Ohio agencies to repeal 10 rules for every one they propose. With more than 35,000 pages in the Ohio Administrative Code, we will eliminate outdated and burdensome rules that stifle growth. Red tape doesn’t just cost money — it costs time. Bureaucrats can stall permits for months, either through negligence or bias, choking off economic activity. That’s why I will implement strict timelines for permitting decisions, backed by real consequences: departments that fail to comply will see their funding reduced. I’ll also make it easier for Ohioans to stand up to state bureaucracy. Businesses should be able to challenge agency overreach in their home county, not be forced to drive to Columbus. And no one should be punished for acting in good faith — a simple mistake should not lead to financial ruin. Even worse, the regulatory machine often operates independently of the governor or the president. It has become an unelected \"fourth branch\" of government — one the Founders never envisioned, and the Constitution never authorized. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Many of these ideas should be adopted at the federal level, too. One standout example is the REINS Act, which would require Congress to approve any major new federal regulation before it takes effect. Ohio should follow the lead of neighbors like Indiana and Kentucky and pass a state-level version of the REINS Act. The regulatory state has become the greatest threat to life, liberty and property in modern America. But the good news is — we know what to do. And with the right leadership, we can start doing it now.

    "article_text": "President Donald Trump's Education Secretary Linda McMahon appeared unexpectedly at the House Democrats' press conference to deliver a brief message on bipartisanship when it comes to \"the children of America.\" (CBS) Randi Weingarten is \"spitting mad.\" The head of theAmerican Federation of Teachersis raging, not because American students just put in the worst performance on the national report card in decades, not because chronic absenteeism and behavioral problems in the wake of COVID-19 school closures are crippling teachers’ ability to bring those grades up, and not because record-breaking numbers of students are below basic proficiency. Nah, it’s because some government employees might lose their jobs. For people like Weingarten, bureaucrats are always the No. 1 priority. She’ll talk a good game in op-eds about her concern that Department of Education cuts meanstudents with the fewest resourcesand greatest needs will pay the highest price, (which is perhaps something she should have thought about when AFT was suing Gov. Ron DeSantis to keep school closed in 2020, but I digress). If you check AFT’s current lawsuit, you’ll find thefirst line is about federal workers,not students or teachers. TEACHER REIGNITES DEBATE OVER PARENTAL RIGHTS AFTER VIOLATING FLORIDA LAW Many parents learned this lesson during the pandemic. For the first time,they saw that union leadersweren’t just working for their members, but actively against people like them, who simply wanted their kids in the schools they paid for. Teachers unions were more concerned about lost union jobs at the Department of Education than declining test scores in school.(iStock) Teachers’ unionsare just one kind of many public employee unions that are literally negotiating against you. When a private union uses collective bargaining, they’re negotiating with a private company that creates a product and profits, from which they argue they should take a bigger share to pay for better benefits. When public employee unions negotiate, they’re doing it with the government, which creates nothing. All they can do is take your taxpayer money and use it to give public employees benefits and job security many regular workers will never see. President Donald Trump just signed an executive order banning the kind of collective bargaining private unions do for most public employee unions. In doing so, he’s aligned with none other than Democratic Party hero and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who famously wrote to a public employee union president in 1937 expressing the danger of such practices used against the employer when \"the employer is the whole people.\" The Trump administration has also ordered public unions to report how much time they spend on union activities on the job, just as it did in his first administration. President Joe Biden shut down that data collection during his tenure, but the Washington Examiner \"managed to get data from 2019… and according to a report by OPM, government union employees spent a total of 2,606,390 hours that year performing union tasks on government time at a cost of $163,327,235.\" As DOGE and a Republican administration audit more agencies, they’ll find more. That’s right, these unions use the majority of the money they bring in (your money!) to pay for political activism, funding candidates and causes to the tune of hundreds of millions and even billions, and they do it on the clock. Some 90+% of that money goes to the Democratic Party, no matter what rank-and-file union members or taxpayers want. Just recently, Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst uncovered $3.3 million in taxpayer money, and 87,000 hours spent at one agency alone over just two years that went to thousands of hours of union-related activities instead of the American people. Elsewhere, the IRS union isnegotiating for its membersto show up only once a week in person and retain a bunch of generous bonuses. An unwelcome April surprise, just like your tax bill! Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, is quick to defend union jobs.(Reuters/Elizabeth Frantz) For generations, this type of bargaining — or worse, public labor union strikes — have been \"intolerable,\" as Roosevelt put it, to important leaders of both parties. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION When 13,000 air traffic controllers went on strike in August 1981, newly elected President Ronald Reagan fired more than 10,000 of them and decertified their union, on the grounds that striking as a public employee union was illegal. The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization demanded a 32-hour work week and a $10,000 raise, but their striking members ended up being banned from federal service and striking a blow against public employee unions instead. In the ensuing years, the number of strikes and work stoppages in the country went down significantly. Just recently, Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst uncovered $3.3 million in taxpayer money, and 87,000 hours spent at one agency alone over just two years that went to thousands of hours of union-related activities instead of the American people. Today, public employee unions are using your money to launch a raft of lawsuits against the administration, arguing — you guessed it — they can’t get fired. Even probationary employees must stay, apparently, the dictionary definition of \"probationary\" no match for the entitlement of government union leaders. Must be nice! CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Reagan’s move \"unsettled those who cynically believed no President would ever uphold that law,\" Alan Greenspan later said, reflecting on the legacy of that fight, and it tamed some of the most aggressive tendencies of organized labor for years to come. Today’s public employee union leaders cynically believe their priorities should override the priorities of their bosses, the American people. But polling shows the bipartisan agreement on this remains. Seventy percent of Americans want public employee unions out of politics, and the record of this administration shows it won’t shy away from taming them.

That tool, originally called Interview Coder, is now part of their San Francisco-based startupCluely. It offers its users the chance to “cheat” on things like exams, sales calls, and job interviews thanks to a hidden in-browser window that can’t be viewed by the interviewer or test giver. Cluely has publisheda manifestocomparing itself to inventions like the calculator and spellcheck, which were originally derided as “cheating.” Cluely also published a slickly produced, but polarizing, launch video of Lee using a hidden AI assistant to (unsuccessfully) lie to a woman about his age, and even his knowledge of art, on a date at a fancy restaurant: Cluely is out. cheat on everything.pic.twitter.com/EsRXQaCfUI While somepraisedthe video for grabbing people’s attention, others derided it as reminiscent of the dystopian sci-fi television show “Black Mirror”: Imagine making a black mirror short as a product adhttps://t.co/2GKXQj8e1v Lee, who is Cluely’s CEO, told TechCrunch the AI cheating tool surpassed $3 million in ARR earlier this month. The startup’s other co-founder is another 21-year-old former Columbia student, Neel Shanmugam, who is Cluely’s COO. Shanmugam was also embroiled in disciplinary proceedings at Columbia over the AI tool. Both co-founders have dropped out of Columbia, the university’s student newspaperreportedlast week. Columbia declined to comment, citing student privacy laws. Cluely began as a tool for developers to cheat on knowledge of LeetCode, a platform for coding questions that some in software engineering circles — including Cluely’s founders, of course — consider outdated and a waste of time. Lee says he was able to snag an internship with Amazon using the AI cheating tool. Amazon declined to comment on Lee’s particular case to TechCrunch, but said its job candidates must acknowledge they won’t use unauthorized tools during the interview process. Cluely isn’t the only controversial AI startup launched this month. Earlier, a famed AI researcher announced his own startup with thestated mission of replacing all human workers everywhere, causing a brouhaha of its own on X.

On Monday, Flipkart said the move “represents a natural evolution, aligning our holding structure with our core operations, the vast potential of the Indian economy.” The e-commerce giant, which started its operations in 2007 in Bengaluru, moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2011 to attract more foreign investments, benefit from tax advantages, and better navigate bureaucratic hurdles and political challenges in India. “As a company born and nurtured in India, this transition will further enhance our focus and agility in serving our customers, sellers, partners, and communities to continue contributing to the nation’s growing digital economy and entrepreneurship,” a Flipkart spokesperson said in a statement. The relocation is subject to requisite approvals, the startup said, without disclosing a specific timeline. However, Flipkart is expected to file for an IPO in the country sometime next year. In 2022, Walmart-backed PhonePe, which split from Flipkart in late 2022,moved its headquartersto India from Singapore. Several other startups, includingZeptoandGroww, have also relocated their headquarters to India in the last few months as they sought public listings on the Indian stock exchanges. However, India’s current public market environment isnot as appealing as it had been up until late last year, as the market is going through some corrections and is impacted by macro conditions. IPOs made up around $19 billion of the record $70 billion equity deal volume reached in India last year, with 11 IPOs priced at above $500 million, per areportby Goldman Sachs. Nonetheless, investors are optimistic about the growth potential in the Indian market, as several companies are waiting to go public this year and next. “The supportive valuation environment has spurred issuer activity. A lot of the unicorns who were thinking of going public in the U.S. switched to India because they felt India supported a better valuation,” said Sudarshan Ramakrishnan, co-head of India investment banking at Goldman Sachs. The latest move by Flipkart also comes almost a year afterraising $350 million from Googleas part of a nearly $1 billion funding round, which it kicked off in 2023. The startup was valued at $36 billion in the last investment.

    "title": "Mark Zuckerberg once suggested spinning out Instagram as a solution to its ‘cannibalization’ of Facebook",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us In an internal email surfaced as part of theMeta antitrust trial,Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg fretted about the potential thatthe company’s Instagram acquisitionmay cannibalize Facebook. Were that to happen, it could lead to the “network collapse of the more engaging and profitable product,” a worried Zuckerberg told other Meta executives in a confidential message. Zuckerberg proposed multiple ways to prevent this cannibalization from occurring, including building more bridges between Meta’s apps to make them function as a single network (suggesting that Instagram was contributing toFacebook’s loss of cultural relevance). He also openly wondered if Facebook would be better served by spinning out Instagram as a separate business. In its trial against Meta, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is attempting to prove that the company is operating a social networking monopoly and that its acquisition of competing apps like Instagram and WhatsApp allowed it to maintain its dominant position in the market. As evidence, the prosecution is surfacing emails and other messages that indicate that Zuckerberg understood the threat Instagram posed to Facebook, even after it became a part of Meta’s larger family of apps. In an email dated May 2018, Zuckerberg explained to other Facebook executives — including Meta Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, now former COO Sheryl Sandberg, former CTO Mike Schroepfer, former Chief Growth Officer (now COO) Javier Olivan, and former CFO David Wehner — that he was concerned the company’s approach to its family of apps was not correct. Specifically, Zuckerberg was worried that Instagram’s growth could hurt Facebook itself, saying that internal data shows that when users joined Instagram, their Facebook engagement “declines significantly.” “We are starting to get more data that suggests this hollowing out of Facebook usage compounds as a larger percent of the population gets on Instagram,” Zuckerberg wrote in a section of the email titled “cannibalization and network collapse.” The more the company pushed Instagram’s growth, the greater the threat Instagram posed to Facebook, Zuckerberg appeared to conclude. “This raises the issue that our models for the future may be wrong,” Zuckerberg continued. “We currently expect both Facebook and Instagram to be able to grow, but it seems likely to be the case that if we promote Instagram to be around the same size as Facebook, that will have significant negative effects on Facebook that we are not currently modeling,” he wrote. “That is, the Facebook network can likely sustain decreased engagement among some of its members, but if engagement among its entire population is hollowed out, that may lead to significantly worse outcomes than we currently expect,” Zuckerberg said. He also said that Instagram’s growth was mainly being driven by distribution from the Facebook app and its use of the Facebook friend graph. “What this suggests is that while we hope to grow two products, there’s a real chance we may be causing network collapse of the more engaging and more profitable product to replace it with one that is less engaging and less profitable,” Zuckerberg said. As a result, he said that Facebook was reducing its promotions to Instagram and that Instagram should introduce new integrations that would tip the balance back toward Facebook instead. He explained that he wanted bridges to be built between the two networks so the apps “increasingly function as a single network in more respects.” As one example, Zuckerberg pointed out that it should be easier for video creators with large audiences to engage across both apps more easily. Plus, he wanted to combine the voice and video calling networks across WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram to become a single network. (Meta eventuallyintroducedcross-platform messaging in 2020, beforerolling it back years later.) Notably, Zuckerberg also called out the difficulties of building new products and services within Instagram and WhatsApp because of “their founder leadership.” He lamented that management couldn’t openly discuss its concerns about Instagram in particular, as it might demoralize the team and prevent the company from retaining Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. He also pushed for the company to rethink its branding of products, so that Facebook’s brand remained front and center. “When you open those apps, it would say ‘Instagram by Facebook’ and ‘WhatsApp by Facebook,’” Zuckerberg proposed in his email. “We may even need to put Facebook branding in the chrome of those apps where the app names and logos are today to cement this relationship in people’s minds.” Zuckerberg pushed for Meta to rethink its branding so that Facebook remained front and center. In 2021, Facebook insteadrebranded as Meta, whose logo now appears across all the company’s apps. If the FTC wins its case, Meta may have to spin out Instagram and WhatsApp as separate businesses. Ironically, that’s something Zuckerberg himself suggested in his 2018 email as an alternative strategy — and possibly the “only structure” to accomplish the company’s goals. Spinning out Instagram could preserve Facebook’s growth, focus Meta’s teams, and allow the company to retain Systrom, wrote Zuckerberg. (Instagram’s founders left later that same year, in September 2018.) Ultimately, Meta chose not to spin out its acquisitions. But Zuckerberg had warned the other execs in the email that there’s a “non-trivial chance” that Meta could be forced to spin out Instagram and WhatsApp in the next 5 to 10 years, making all its work building a family of apps “something we don’t get to keep.” If the FTC succeeds in court, Zuckerberg will be proven right. Meta downplayed the magnitude of these emails in a statement shared with TechCrunch. “Out-of-context and years-old documents about acquisitions that were reviewed by the FTC more than a decade ago will not obscure the realities of the competition we face or overcome the FTC’s weak case,” a Meta spokesperson said.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit Monday against Uber, alleging the ride-hail and delivery giant charged customers for its Uber One subscription service without their consent. The lawsuit also claims Uber failed to deliver the savings promised in its subscription service and made it unreasonably difficult for users to cancel despite its “cancel anytime” promises. Uber has denied any wrongdoing and accused the FTC of rushing the investigation process and basing its claims on “unvetted allegations.” The lawsuit comes after the FTC has pushed companies with subscription services to make them easier to cancel under its previous director, Lina Khan. In October 2024, the agency finalized its “click to cancel” rule that requires companies to make canceling a subscription as easy as signing up for one. Despite facingsome challengesby industry groups, the rule is expected to go into effect May 14. “Americans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,” FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said in a statement. “The Trump-Vance FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people.” The FTC’s complaint, which follows aninvestigationthat began last year, alleges that Uber customers are wrongly promised savings of $25 a month. “Even if that were true, Uber does not account for the cost of the subscription (up to $9.99/month) when calculating those savings,” reads astatementfrom the FTC. “The company also obscures material information about the subscription (for example, by using small, greyed out text which consumers can easily miss).” The complaint accuses Uber of automatically charging consumers who signed up for a free trial before their billing date. It also alleges that Uber makes it “extremely difficult” for customers to cancel, wherein users can be forced to navigate “as many as 23 screens and take as many as 32 actions to cancel.” Those actions come in the form of explaining why they want to cancel, dealing with Uber urging them to pause their membership, and if that fails, presenting offers to stay. “Some users are told they have to contact customer support to cancel but are given no way to contact them; others claim that Uber charged them for another billing cycle after they requested cancellation and were waiting to hear back from customer support,” reads the FTC’s statement. Uber clarified that previously, customers who wanted to cancel within 48 hours of their sign up date had to contact customer support to cancel. The company says that is no longer the case. TechCrunch has reached out to learn when Uber updated its policy to allow those customers to cancel within the app. The plaintiffs are pushing the court to prohibit Uber from continuing its alleged deceptive practices and to force the company to pay monetary relief. “We are disappointed that the FTC chose to move forward with this action, but are confident that the courts will agree with what we already know: Uber One’s sign-up and cancellation processes are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement. “Uber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can now be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less.” Tim Muris, a former FTC chair who represented Uber during the case’s investigation period, accused the FTC of failing to do a full investigation and basing its complaint on “misunderstandings of both the facts and the law.” Uber’s current outside counsel, Christine Wilson, said, “The unconventional nature of the rushed investigative process that preceded this enforcement action was compounded by the addition of new and unvetted allegations at the last minute. It is disappointing to see the FTC stray from the rigor and fairness that has long defined the agency at its best.” Uber One’s member base reached 30 million across 34 countries in 2024, and the company says it is growing roughly 60% year-over-year. A year ago, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi estimated that Uber One’s membership fees would be “in excess of $1 billion” in 2024.

It’s a marketing tactic that teases the secretive startup’s strategy to sell a “Transformer”-like vehicle, people familiar with the company’s internal discussions told TechCrunch. This unconventional real-world tease comes days before Slate’s April 24 launch event at Long Beach Airport, according to an invite viewed by TechCrunch. The Michigan-based startup, founded in 2022, has operated in relative secrecy until TechCrunchpublished a report revealing Bezos’ financial involvement, as well as its plan to price its EV at around $25,000 while encouraging buyers to customize the vehicle to their liking. That base model is referred to as the “Blank Slate” version, according to atrademark applicationand another person familiar with the company’s plans. Slate has also filed for atrademarkfor the phrase: “We Built It. You Make It.” The Autopian’s David Tracytraveledto Venice, California over the weekend where Slate parked a concept version of the truck made to look like a two-door SUV used by a fake business. Similarly, Reddit users posted pictures over the weekend ofyet anotherversion of the truckmade to look like a hatchback that almost resembles Rivian’sforthcoming R3. The vehicle Tracy saw up close this past weekend looks just like the two-door pickup truck spotted by a Reddit userearlier this monthin Long Beach, but with a hard cover over the bed that gives it more of an SUV shape. The vehicle is covered in a wrap for a fake business called “Rockabye Rides,” which includes a URL that leads to a website that iscounting downto Slate’s event later this week. That makes three different silhouettes we’ve seen of Slate’s truck so far — and that adaptability is something the company has privately touted as it locked down well over $100 million in funding, TechCrunch has learned. Slate’s leadership focused heavily on the “Transformer” metaphor as it wooed investors to fill out its Series B funding round last year, according to a person familiar with the pitches. The company carefully choreographed the meetings around the idea, according to another person familiar with how they went. This involved showing prospective investors a generic version of the truck, and then leading them to another room while a team quickly customized the vehicle. Then the prospective investors would be brought back to the first room only to find the truck looking completely different. Those efforts appear to have been convincing. Guggenheim Partners CEO (and controlling owner of the LA Dodgers) Mark Walter seemingly invested in the round and joined Slate’s board, TechCrunch hasreported. A spokesperson for the company didn’t respond to a request for comment. These new photos give a pretty clear view of the exterior of Slate’s truck, and the potential level of customization.

    "title": "Tariff turmoil may have killed the tech M&A market’s comeback",

Deals can get done even in down markets. But can M&A thrive in an uncertain market? That’s a harder question. The venture market soured in 2022 as fundraising and exits largely dried up. Since then, venture investors have been waiting in the wings for exits, both M&A and IPOs, to return. While the past few years didn’t deliver, heading into 2025, there was reason to be hopeful. Late-stage startup valuations had started to recover, and a handful of strong deals gave the impression that a rebound might be underway. On top of that, the Trump administration painted itself as far more M&A-friendly than Joe Biden’s, which had previously blocked several high-profile deals on antitrust grounds. Deals did start flowing at the beginning of 2025. According to PitchBook data, there were 205 U.S. startup acquisitions in the first quarter alone, and many of them were notable. In March, CoreWeave agreed to pay$1.7 billion for Weights & Biases. The following week, ServiceNow announced its plans to acquire Moveworksfor $2.9 billion. And later that month, Google announced it was buyingcybersecurity startup Wizfor $32 billion. Other first-quarter acquisitions included the sale of proptechDivvy Homesto the investment firm Brookfield for $1 billion and the sale ofNext Insuranceto Munich Re for $2.6 billion. But then everything started to change in April. On April 2 — dubbed “Liberation Day” — Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs against nearly every major trading partner.Tech companies saw their stock plummetand Q1’s progress started to look like a blip. A week later, Trump announced a 90-day pause on these tariffs, but the market now sits in a state of limbo. “Heading into 2025 as you may recall, people were almost giddy, thinking things are really going to pick up in 2025,” Stellar Tucker, a managing director at Truist Securities, told TechCrunch. “I don’t think much of that has really materialized. The outlook right now is pretty tepid for 2025, which is unfortunate, because I think everyone went into 2025 thinking it was going to be a much better year than the past few that we’ve been suffering through.” There are a few reasons why a volatile or uncertain public market can stall M&A activity. For one, many of the most active acquirers — large public tech companies — are directly affected by the tariff uncertainty. Their stock prices have taken hits, and some of their core products or supply chains could face tariff impacts. “The large public companies, they’re going to have a really tough time with depressed valuations in their stock,” said Kyle Stanford, the director of U.S. venture capital research at PitchBook, in an interview with TechCrunch. “Even if they have cash, they don’t want to put it to work in an uncertain market and kind of spook investors,” Stanford said. Added Stanford, stock buybacks are “probably something that they look at instead of company purchases.” Another hurdle is price. For the past few years, uncertainty around valuations has lingered, with many late-stage startups no longer worth their frothy 2021 valuations. But what they are actually worth isn’t concrete either. “There’s a lot of back-and-forth leading to significant uncertainty,” said Ronan Kennedy, who leads the capital advisory team for the investment firm B Capital. “Businesses don’t want to make a decision when waiting a few days could have led to a different decision” or valuation. Despite the slowdown, some deals will get done. Thomas Earnest, a partner at the law firm Mintz who focuses on tech fundraising and M&A, told TechCrunch that any company that has opportunistically put feelers out to sell this year is likely putting a pause on that effort. It’s a sharp contrast from what Earnest told TechCrunch just a few weeks back when he predicted an uptick in M&A. “The world was a much different place in January than it was in March, and now we’re in a totally different place than we were three weeks ago,” Earnest said. “You’re not gonna go buy a house if you [fear] that in a week’s time it’s gonna be worth 20 or 30% [less] than what you paid for it, and I think that really could ring true in the M&A market.” That said, not all M&A is driven by opportunity. Earnest said startups that are unable to raise their next round of funding will still need to pursue acquisitions, likely at lower valuations. “They’ve probably been trying to hold out for the venture market to come back, and if it doesn’t, then those companies are gonna need to get comfortable with either down rounds or acquisitions at discounts,” Earnest said. “I think that you’ll see deal volume there.” Well-capitalized AI companies that are private and pumped up with cash are likely to snap up smaller companies, too, Earnest added. Just one case in point: OpenAI, which just raised a$40 billion funding roundat the end of March, is rumored to be acquiring AI coding startupWindsurf for $3 billion. As the second quarter unfolds, PitchBook’s Stanford fears that the events of the first few weeks of April could have already sidelined M&A activity for the rest of the year. He added that if these tariffs resume in early July — after the 90-day pause — or new trades deals are struck in the meantime, it may not matter much. That stability likely wouldn’t come until the summer, a historically slow period for activity. Then comes fall, the fourth quarter, and the end-of-year holiday slowdown. That leaves a tiny window for strong M&A deals to get done. “I think the prospect of a stable 2025 seems pretty low at this point just because of the changes,” Stanford said. “We all know how much the news has changed in the past two weeks, what and how small or steep, who’s getting exceptions or what’s not getting exception. And [it] really creates a lot of uncertainty.” Topics Senior Reporter, Venture Reporter, Venture Columbia student suspended over interview cheating tool raises $5.3M to ‘cheat on everything’ An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked Tesla reportedly delays launch of new low-cost model by months Palantir exec defends company’s immigration surveillance work Your politeness could be costly for OpenAI Uncovered emails showed how Meta struggled to keep Facebook culturally relevant Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere © 2025 Yahoo.",

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Coal-fired power plants have done their fair share of damage over the past century. Fromclimate changetoacid rain,black lungtoheart disease, they’ve generally been on the debit side of the ledger. But lurking in the literal ashes is something of a minor climate savior. “Ash can be used to replace up to 30% of cement,” Krish Mehta, co-founder and CEO ofPHNX Materials, told TechCrunch. By displacing cement in concrete, fly ash fromcoal plantscan eliminate a significant chunk of the material’s carbon footprint. PHNX Materials has devised a way to strip fly ash of sulfur and carbon, impurities that concrete companies would rather avoid. By drawing out those compounds, PHNX preps the fly ash so that it’s ready for concrete companies while also creating a new source of sulfur and aluminum, another compound found in fly ash. The startup recently raised a $2.5 million seed round, TechCrunch has exclusively learned. The round was led by Divergent Capital, KdT Ventures, and Overture, with participation from Jane Woodward. Ash has been used for millennia in concrete. Ancient Romans usedvolcanic ash, and over the past century or so, state transportation departments have turned to fly ash from coal plants. Caltrans, for example, requires a minimum 25% fly ash in concrete used for its projects. Fly ash’s secret is that it helps to stabilize a concrete mix, said Jorge Osio-Norgaard, PHNX Materials co-founder and CTO. In the absence of ash, a certain chemical reaction can turn the aggregate — the small rocks in concrete — into a gel that can expand, cracking the concrete. “When you spend a billion dollars on a highway or on a bridge, you want it to last the next 100 years,” Osio-Norgaard said. “Fly ash helps achieve that goal.” The closure of coal-fired power plants has slashed the amount of ash available to concrete companies. Coal used to provide 51% of all electricity in the U.S.; today, it generates 15%. Those closures have created a new industry in coal ash harvesting. Companies scour ash pits for quality fly ash, dig it up, do some light processing, and sell it to concrete companies. But not all the ash is up to spec, Mehta said, and that’s created a fly ash shortage that has caused prices to spike. As a result, concrete companies have been dialing back the amount of fly ash in their mixes to around 8%, he said. They could be using up to 30%, but instead are making up the difference with additional cement, which costs nearly twice as much as fly ash per ton. That trade not only risks the durability of the concrete, but it also increases its carbon footprint. Cement releases CO2from the chemical reaction that forms it and the fossil fuels that are used to provide heat to drive the reaction. One ton of cement produced in the U.S. releases about 0.8 tons of carbon dioxide,accordingto the EPA. “We felt that unlocking a new supply of ash was the most scalable and quickest way to decarbonize the sector,” Mehta said. PHNX’s process takes fly ash directly from landfills and extracts sulfur and aluminum. The company is also looking at ways to extract rare earth elements. It will then sell the ash to concrete makers and sulfur, aluminum, and other compounds to relevant industries. Sulfur, for example, can be used in fertilizer. By addressing — and potentially profiting from — the impurities that lace the majority of the 843 fly ash landfills in the U.S., PHNX thinks it can offer the concrete industry a lower-carbon option. “We felt that unlocking a new supply of ash was the most scalable and quickest way to decarbonize the sector,” Mehta said.

Like Twitter’s original blue check (RIP), Bluesky’s blue check will verify that notable accounts are legitimate, making it easy for users to trust that an account’s posts are real. In its earliest phase, Bluesky will work with a select few “Trusted Verifiers,” which are independent organizations that can verify accounts as members of their team. For example, a company could verify members of its public relations team with blue checks, making it easier for users to see that these people can be trusted as sources of company news. Bluesky says that its moderation team will verify each new verification to validate authenticity. Bluesky already had a form of verification, letting any user set a domain they own as their username. For example, you’d know thatTechCrunch’s accountis real because it is verified withthe TechCrunch domain name, which an impersonator would not be able to access. In the case of public figures like celebrities, journalists, and politicians, this additional layer of verification can help the platform cut down on disinformation from impersonators. According to Bluesky, 270,000 accounts have linked their Bluesky username to a website. “Domain handles continue to be an important part of verification on Bluesky,” the Bluesky team wrote in a blog post. “At the same time, we’ve heard from users that a larger visual signal would be useful in knowing which accounts are authentic.” At launch, Bluesky is not accepting applications for verification, but it said it plans to launch a request form in the future.

Speaking to TechCrunch, the student, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, said they were notified via their college’s international student center that they’d been identified in a criminal records check. The student said that they’d been studying in the U.S. for nearly a decade starting as an undergraduate, and that they have no criminal record. “The most likely cause may be an interaction with the police many years ago, even before I entered graduate school,” the student said. “I was conducting research in the AI field and had planned to continue my research after graduation.” Over the past few months,more than a thousand international students in the U.S.have had their visa statuses challenged by the State Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement as part of an aggressive crackdown orchestrated by the Trump administration. In many cases, colleges haven’t been directly notified by the relevant federal agencies, leaving students with little notice — or recourse. Yisong Yue, a machine learning professor at Caltech, told TechCrunch the U.S. government’s hardline stance on student visas is “harming the talent pipeline.” “The cumulative effect is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers,” Yue said. “Because research is highly specialized, when a doctoral student is pulled from a project, it can set back the project by months or years. Beyond the specific students and projects affected, many students on visas are worried.” Few institutions have been spared by the crackdown.According to reports, students attending Ivy League universities, large public colleges, and small liberal arts schools have had their visas suspended. While the governmenthas accused someof these students of supporting Palestinian militant groups or engaging in “antisemitic” activities, others have been targeted forminor legal infractions, like speeding tickets or other traffic violations. Some of the revocations appear to be administrative mistakes.Reportedly, one student, Suguru Onda, a computer science doctoral candidate at Brigham Young University, had their revoked student visa reinstated without explanation shortly after their immigration attorney filed suit. The attorney, Adam Crayk,saidthe government is using AI to screen visa holders without human verification, leading to errors. Last week, a judge in Georgiaissued a temporary restraining orderin the case of around 100 international students whose visas were revoked, and directed the government to reinstate the students’ legal status. The ruling only applies to a fraction of students at risk of deportation, however, and could be challenged down the line. Yue noted that international students contributed to many recent technical breakthroughs in AI. Ashish Vaswani, who moved to the U.S. to study computer science in the early 2000s, is one of the co-creators of the transformer, the seminal AI model architecture that underpins chatbots like ChatGPT. One of the co-founders of OpenAI, Wojciech Zaremba, earned his doctorate in AI from NYU on a student visa. Arecent analysisby the nonprofit educational association NAFSA found that international students at U.S. colleges and universities contributed $43.8 billion to the domestic economy during the 2023-2024 academic year and supported more than 378,000 jobs. Yue says that he’s had “multiple conversations” with senior AI researchers who are worried about staying in the United States. “This includes professors at top universities and researchers at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and so on,” he added. “The cumulative effect of the government’s actions is making the U.S. a significantly less appealing destination for many talented researchers.” Topics AI Editor Columbia student suspended over interview cheating tool raises $5.3M to ‘cheat on everything’ An AI doctoral candidate in California says they had their student visa revoked Tesla reportedly delays launch of new low-cost model by months Palantir exec defends company’s immigration surveillance work Your politeness could be costly for OpenAI Uncovered emails showed how Meta struggled to keep Facebook culturally relevant Famed AI researcher launches controversial startup to replace all human workers everywhere © 2025 Yahoo.",

    "title": "Instagram is using AI to find teens lying about their age and restricting their accounts",
    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta is using AI technology to search for kids who are lying about their age on Instagram in order to bypass safeguards, the companyannouncedon Monday. When Meta finds an account that it suspects belongs to a teen, the platform will enroll them into a restricted Teen Account, even if the account lists an adult birthday. Teen Accounts, whichlaunched on Instagram last year, enroll young users into an app experience with built-in protections. The safeguards are applied to teens automatically, and limit who can contact a teen on the app and restrict the type of content the account holder can view. Teens under the age of 16 need their parents’ permission to change any of these settings. Instagram has been using AI to determine age for quite some time, but now the social network confirms it’s using the technology to ensure that teens are accessing Instagram via a Teen Account rather than an adult one. The company told TechCrunch last year that ithad planned to do this, and noted that some of the ways it would find accounts that belong to teens who entered a fake adult birthday is by detecting happy birthday posts and receiving reports from other users. Instagram says that it’s taking steps to ensure that its technology is accurate and that it’s correctly placing teens into Teen Accounts. However, in case the company does make a mistake, it’s giving people the option to change their settings. “The digital world continues to evolve and we have to evolve with it,” the company wrote in its blog post. “That’s why it’s important that we work together with parents to make sure as many teens as possible have the protective settings that come with Teen Accounts.” Instagram also announced that it’s going to begin sending notifications to parents that include information about how they can discuss the importance of providing the correct age online with their teens. The platform notes that one of the most important ways parents can make sure their teens are in protected accounts is to check if their account lists their correct birthday. Today’s announcement comes two weeks after Metaintroduced Teen Accountsto Facebook and Messenger. Meta says it has enrolled at least 54 million teens into Teen Accounts globally so far, and that 97% of teens ages 13-15 have remained in these protected accounts.

OpenAI also faced its share of internal drama, including the notable exits of high-level execs like co-founder andlongtime chief scientist Ilya SutskeverandCTO Mira Murati.OpenAI has also been hit with lawsuits fromAlden Global Capital-owned newspapersalleging copyright infringement, as well asan injunction from Elon Muskto halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit. In 2025, OpenAI is battling the perception that it’s ceding ground in the AI race toChinese rivals like DeepSeek. The company has been trying to shore up itsrelationship with Washingtonas it simultaneouslypursues an ambitious data center project,and as itreportedly lays the groundworkfor one of the largest funding rounds in history. Below, you’ll find a timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year. If you have any other questions, check outour ChatGPT FAQ here. To see a list of 2024 updates,go here. OpenAI has launcheda new API feature called Flex processingthat allows users to use AI models at a lower cost but with slower response times and occasional resource unavailability. Flex processing is available in beta on the o3 and o4-mini reasoning models for non-production tasks like model evaluations, data enrichment, and asynchronous workloads. OpenAI has rolled out a new system to monitor itsAI reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, for biological and chemical threats. The system is designed to prevent models from giving advice that could potentially lead to harmful attacks, as stated inOpenAI’s safety report. OpenAIhas released two new reasoning models, o3 and o4 mini, just two days after launching GPT-4.1. The company claims o3 is the most advanced reasoning model it has developed, while o4-mini is said to provide a balance of price, speed, and performance. The new models stand out from previous reasoning models because they can use ChatGPT features like web browsing, coding, and image processing and generation. Butthey hallucinatemore than several of OpenAI’s previous models. Open AI introduced a new section called “library” to make it easier for users to create images on mobile and web platforms, perthe company’s X post. All of your image creations, all in one place.Introducing the new library for your ChatGPT image creations—rolling out now to all Free, Plus, and Pro users on mobile andhttps://t.co/nYW5KO1aIg.pic.twitter.com/ADWuf5fPbj OpenAI said on Tuesdaythat it might revise its safety standards if “another frontier AI developer releases a high-risk system without comparable safeguards.” The move shows how commercial AI developers face more pressure to rapidly implement models due to the increased competition. OpenAIis currently in the early stages of developingits own social media platform to compete with Elon Musk’s X and Mark Zuckerberg’s Instagram and Threads,according to The Verge. It is unclear whether OpenAI intends to launch the social network as a standalone application or incorporate it into ChatGPT. OpenAIwill discontinue its largest AI model, GPT-4.5, from its API even though it was just launched in late February. GPT-4.5 will be available in a research preview for paying customers. Developers can use GPT-4.5 through OpenAI’s API until July 14; then, they will need to switch to GPT-4.1, which was released on April 14. OpenAIhas launched three members of the GPT-4.1 model— GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and GPT-4.1 nano — with a specific focus on coding capabilities. It’s accessible via the OpenAI API but not ChatGPT. In the competition to develop advanced programming models, GPT-4.1 will rival AI models such asGoogle’s Gemini 2.5 Pro,Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet, andDeepSeek’s upgraded V3. OpenAIplans to sunset GPT-4, an AI model introduced more than two years ago, and replace it with GPT-4o, the current default model,per changelog. It will take effect on April 30. GPT-4 will remain available via OpenAI’s API. OpenAI may launch several new AI models, including GPT-4.1, soon, The Vergereported, citing anonymous sources. GPT-4.1 would be an update of OpenAI’s GPT-4o, which was released last year. On the list of upcoming models are GPT-4.1 and smaller versions like GPT-4.1 mini and nano, per the report. OpenAIstarted updating ChatGPTto enable the chatbot to remember previous conversations with a user and customize its responses based on that context. This feature is rolling out to ChatGPT Pro and Plus users first, excluding those in the U.K., EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland. It looks like OpenAI is working on a watermarking feature for images generated using GPT-4o. AI researcher Tibor Blahospotteda new “ImageGen” watermark feature in the new beta of ChatGPT’s Android app. Blaho also found mentions of other tools: “Structured Thoughts,” “Reasoning Recap,” “CoT Search Tool,” and “l1239dk1.” OpenAI is offering its $20-per-monthChatGPT Plussubscription tier for free to all college studentsin the U.S. and Canada through the end of May. The offer will let millions of students use OpenAI’s premium service, which offers access to the company’s GPT-4o model, image generation, voice interaction, and research tools that are not available in the free version. More than 130 million users have created over 700 million images since ChatGPT gotthe upgraded image generatoron March 25, according toCOO of OpenAI Brad Lightcap. The image generator was made availableto all ChatGPT userson March 31, and went viral for being able to create Ghibli-style photos. The Arc Prize Foundation, which develops the AI benchmark tool ARC-AGI, has updated the estimated computing costs for OpenAI’s o3 “reasoning” model managed by ARC-AGI. The organization originally estimated that the best-performing configuration of o3 it tested, o3 high, would cost approximately $3,000 to address a single problem. The Foundation now thinks the cost could be much higher,possibly around $30,000 per task. In aseriesof postson X, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company’s new image-generation tool’s popularity may cause product releases to be delayed. “We are getting things under control, but you should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges,” he wrote. OpeanAIintends to release its “first” open language modelsinceGPT-2“in the coming months.” The company plans to host developer events to gather feedback and eventually showcase prototypes of the model. The first developer event is to be held in San Francisco, with sessions to follow in Europe and Asia. OpenAImade a notable change to its content moderation policiesafter the success of its new image generator in ChatGPT, which went viral for being able to createStudio Ghibli-style images. The company has updated its policies to allow ChatGPT to generate images of public figures, hateful symbols, and racial features when requested. OpenAI had previously declined such prompts due to the potential controversy or harm they may cause. However, the company has now “evolved” its approach, as statedin a blog postpublished by Joanne Jang, the lead for OpenAI’s model behavior. OpenAIwants to incorporate Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP)into all of its products, including the ChatGPT desktop app. MCP, an open-source standard, helps AI models generate more accurate and suitable responses to specific queries, and lets developers create bidirectional links between data sources and AI applications like chatbots. The protocol is currently available in the Agents SDK, and support for the ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API will be coming soon, OpenAI CEOSam Altman said. The latest update of the image generator on OpenAI’s ChatGPThas triggered a flood of AI-generated memes in the style of Studio Ghibli, the Japanese animation studio behind blockbuster films like “My Neighbor Totoro” and “Spirited Away.” The burgeoning mass of Ghibli-esque images havesparked concerns aboutwhether OpenAI has violated copyright laws, especially since the company is already facing legal action for using source material without authorization. OpenAI expects its revenue to triple to $12.7 billion in 2025, fueled by the performance of its paid AI software, Bloombergreported, citing an anonymous source. While the startup doesn’t expect to reach positive cash flow until 2029, it expects revenue to increase significantly in 2026 to surpass $29.4 billion, the report said. OpenAI onTuesdayrolled out a major upgrade to ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities: ChatGPT can now usethe GPT-4omodel to generate and edit images and photos directly. The feature went live earlier this week in ChatGPT and Sora, OpenAI’s AI video-generation tool, for subscribers of the company’s Pro plan, priced at $200 a month, and will be available soon to ChatGPT Plus subscribers and developers using the company’s API service. The company’s CEOSam Altman said on Wednesday,however, that the release of the image generation feature to free users would be delayed due to higher demand than the company expected. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI’s chief operating officer, will lead the company’s global expansion and manage corporate partnershipsas CEO Sam Altman shifts his focus to research and products, accordingto a blog postfrom OpenAI. Lightcap, who previously worked with Altman at Y Combinator, joined the Microsoft-backed startup in 2018. OpenAI also said Mark Chen would step into the expanded role of chief research officer, and Julia Villagra will take on the role of chief people officer. OpenAIhas updated its AI voice assistant with improved chatting capabilities, according to a video posted on Monday (March 24) to the company’sofficial media channels. The update enables real-time conversations, and the AI assistant is said to be more personable and interrupts users less often. Users on ChatGPT’s free tier can now access the new version of Advanced Voice Mode, while paying users will receive answers that are “more direct, engaging, concise, specific, and creative,”a spokesperson from OpenAI told TechCrunch. OpenAI and Meta have separately engaged in discussions with Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries regarding potential collaborations to enhance their AI services in the country,per a report by The Information. One key topic being discussed is Reliance Jio distributing OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Reliance has proposed selling OpenAI’s models to businesses in India through an application programming interface (API) so they can incorporate AI into their operations. Meta also plans to bolster its presence in India by constructing a large 3GW data center in Jamnagar, Gujarat. OpenAI, Meta, and Reliance have not yet officially announced these plans. Noyb, a privacy rights advocacy group, is supporting an individual in Norwaywho was shocked to discover that ChatGPTwas providing false information about him, stating that he had been found guilty of killing two of his children and trying to harm the third. “The GDPR is clear. Personal data has to be accurate,” said Joakim Söderberg, data protection lawyer at Noyb, in a statement. “If it’s not, users have the right to have it changed to reflect the truth. Showing ChatGPT users a tiny disclaimer that the chatbot can make mistakes clearly isn’t enough. You can’t just spread false information and in the end add a small disclaimer saying that everything you said may just not be true.” OpenAIhas added new transcription and voice-generating AI models to its APIs: a text-to-speech model, “gpt-4o-mini-tts,” that delivers more nuanced and realistic sounding speech, as well as two speech-to-text models called “gpt-4o-transcribe” and “gpt-4o-mini-transcribe”. The company claims they are improved versions of what was already there and that they hallucinate less. OpenAIhas introduced o1-proin its developer API. OpenAI says its o1-pro uses more computing than itso1 “reasoning” AI modelto deliver “consistently better responses.” It’s only accessible to select developers who have spent at least $5 on OpenAI API services. OpenAI charges $150 for every million tokens (about 750,000 words) input into the model and $600 for every million tokens the model produces. It costs twice as much asOpenAI’s GPT-4.5for input and 10 times the price of regular o1. Noam Brown, who heads AI reasoning research at OpenAI,thinks that certain types of AI models for “reasoning” could have been developed 20 years agoif researchers had understood the correct approach and algorithms. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said, in apost on X, that the company hastrained a “new model” that’s “really good” at creative writing. He posted a lengthy sample from the model given the prompt “Please write a metafictional literary short story about AI and grief.” OpenAI has not extensively explored the use of AI for writing fiction. The company has mostly concentrated on challenges in rigid, predictable areas such as math and programming.And it turns out that itmight not be that greatat creative writing at all. we trained a new model that is good at creative writing (not sure yet how/when it will get released). this is the first time i have been really struck by something written by AI; it got the vibe of metafiction so right.PROMPT:Please write a metafictional literary short story… OpenAIrolled out new toolsdesignedto help developers and businesses build AI agents— automated systems that can independently accomplish tasks — using the company’s own AI models and frameworks. The tools are part of OpenAI’s new Responses API, which enables enterprises to develop customized AI agents that can perform web searches, scan through company files, and navigate websites, similar toOpenAI’s Operator product. The Responses API effectively replacesOpenAI’s Assistants API, which the company plans to discontinue in the first half of 2026. OpenAIintends to release several “agent” productstailored for different applications, including sorting and ranking sales leads and software engineering, according toa report from The Information. One, a “high-income knowledge worker” agent, will reportedly be priced at $2,000 a month. Another, a software developer agent, is said to cost $10,000 a month. The most expensive rumored agents, which are said to be aimed at supporting “PhD-level research,” are expected to cost $20,000 per month. The jaw-dropping figure is indicative of how much cash OpenAI needs right now: The company lost roughly $5 billion last year after paying for costs related to running its services and other expenses. It’s unclear when these agentic tools might launch or which customers will be eligible to buy them. The latest version of the macOS ChatGPT appallows users to edit code directly in supported developer tools, including Xcode, VS Code, and JetBrains. ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team subscribers can use the feature now, and the company plans to roll it out to more users like Enterprise, Edu, and free users. According toa new reportfrom VC firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), OpenAI’s AI chatbot, ChatGPT,experienced solid growth in the second half of 2024.It took ChatGPT nine months to increase its weekly active users from100 million in November 2023to 200 million in August 2024, but it only took less than six months to double that number once more, according to the report. ChatGPT’s weekly active users increased to300 million by December 2024and400 million by February 2025. ChatGPT has experienced significant growth recently due to the launch of new models and features, such as GPT-4o, with multimodal capabilities. ChatGPT usage spiked from April to May 2024, shortly after that model’s launch. OpenAI has effectively canceled the release of o3 in favor of what CEO Sam Altman is calling a “simplified” product offering. In apost on X, Altman said that, in the coming months, OpenAI will release a model called GPT-5 that “integrates a lot of [OpenAI’s] technology,” including o3, in ChatGPT and its API. As a result of that roadmap decision, OpenAI no longer plans to release o3 as a standalone model. Acommonly cited statis that ChatGPT requires around 3 watt-hours of power to answer a single question. Using OpenAI’s latest default model for ChatGPT, GPT-4o, as a reference, nonprofitAI research institute Epoch AIfound the average ChatGPT queryconsumes around 0.3 watt-hours.However, the analysis doesn’t consider the additional energy costs incurred by ChatGPT with features like image generation or input processing. In response to pressure from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI is changing the way its o3-mini model communicatesits step-by-step “thought” process.ChatGPT users will see an updated “chain of thought” that shows more of the model’s “reasoning” steps and how it arrived at answers to questions. OpenAI is now allowing anyone to use ChatGPT web searchwithout having to log in.While OpenAIhad previously allowedusers to ask ChatGPT questions without signing in, responses were restricted to the chatbot’s last training update. This only applies through ChatGPT.com, however. To use ChatGPT in any form through the native mobile app, you will still need to be logged in. OpenAI announced a new AI “agent”called deep researchthat’s designed to help people conduct in-depth, complex research using ChatGPT. OpenAI says the “agent” is intended for instances where you don’t just want a quick answer or summary, but instead need to assiduously consider information from multiple websites and other sources. OpenAI used the subreddit r/ChangeMyView tomeasure the persuasive abilitiesof its AI reasoning models. OpenAI says it collects userposts from the subredditand asks its AI models to write replies, in a closed environment, that would change the Reddit user’s mind on a subject. The company then shows the responses to testers, who assess how persuasive the argument is, and finally OpenAI compares the AI models’ responses to human replies for that same post. OpenAI launched a newAI “reasoning” model, o3-mini,the newest in the company’s o family of models. OpenAI firstpreviewed the model in Decemberalongside a more capable system called o3. OpenAI is pitching its new model as both “powerful” and “affordable.” A new report from app analytics firm Appfigures found thatover half of ChatGPT’s mobile usersare under age 25, with users between ages 50 and 64 making up the second largest age demographic. The gender gap among ChatGPT users is even more significant. Appfigures estimates that across age groups, men make up 84.5% of all users. OpenAI launched ChatGPT Govdesigned to provide U.S. government agenciesan additional way to access the tech. ChatGPT Gov includes many of the capabilities found in OpenAI’s corporate-focused tier, ChatGPT Enterprise. OpenAI says that ChatGPT Gov enables agencies to more easily manage their own security, privacy, and compliance, and could expedite internal authorization of OpenAI’s tools for the handling of non-public sensitive data. Younger Gen Zers are embracing ChatGPT, for schoolwork,according to a new survey by the Pew Research Center.In a follow-up to its 2023 poll on ChatGPT usage among young people, Pew asked ~1,400 U.S.-based teens ages 13 to 17 whether they’ve used ChatGPT for homework or other school-related assignments. Twenty-six percent said that they had, double the number two years ago. Just over half of teens responding to the poll said they think it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT for researching new subjects. But considering the ways ChatGPT can fall short, the results are possibly cause for alarm. OpenAI says that it might store chats and associated screenshots from customers who use Operator,the company’s AI “agent” tool,for up to 90 days — even after a user manually deletes them. While OpenAI has a similar deleted data retention policy for ChatGPT, the retention period for ChatGPT is only 30 days,which is 60 days shorter than Operator’s. OpenAI is launching a research preview of Operator, a general-purpose AI agent that cantake control of a web browser and independently perform certain actions.Operator promises to automate tasks such as booking travel accommodations, making restaurant reservations, and shopping online. Operator,OpenAI’s agent tool,could be released sooner rather than later. Changes to ChatGPT’s code base suggest thatOperator will be available as an early research previewto users on the $200 Pro subscription plan. The changes aren’t yet publicly visible, buta user on X who goes by Choispotted these updates in ChatGPT’s client-side code. TechCrunch separately identified the same references to Operator on OpenAI’s website. OpenAI has begun testing a feature that lets new ChatGPT userssign up with only a phone number— no email required. The feature is currently in beta in the U.S. and India. However, users who create an account using their number can’t upgrade to one of OpenAI’s paid plans without verifying their account via an email. Multi-factor authentication also isn’t supported without a valid email. ChatGPT’s new beta feature, called tasks,allows users to set simple reminders. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to remind you when your passport expires in six months, and the AI assistant will follow up with a push notification on whatever platform you have tasks enabled. The feature will start rolling out to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users around the globe this week. OpenAI is introducing a new way for users tocustomize their interactions with ChatGPT.Some users found they can specify a preferred name or nickname and “traits” they’d like the chatbot to have. OpenAI suggests traits like “Chatty,” “Encouraging,” and “Gen Z.” However,some users reportedthat the new options have disappeared, so it’s possible they went live prematurely. ChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startupOpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. November 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use. Both the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model isGPT-4o. There is a free version ofChatGPTthat only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version,ChatGPT Plus. Anyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies andsearch enginesare utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns. Multiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others maylimit the use of the AI-powered tool. Most recently,Microsoft announcedat its 2023 Build conference that it is integrating its ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startupLooking Glass utilizes ChatGPTto produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT.  And nonprofit organizationSolana officially integrated the chatbotinto its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space. GPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer. A chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions. ChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt. Yes. Due to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel. We will see howhandling troubling statements produced by ChatGPTwill play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry. Yes,there is a free ChatGPT mobile appfor iOS and Android users. It’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words. Yes, it wasreleasedMarch 1, 2023. Everyday examples include programming, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc. Advanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc. It depends on the nature of the program. While ChatGPT can write workable Python code, it can’t necessarily program an entire app’s worth of code. That’s because ChatGPT lacks context awareness — in other words, the generated code isn’t always appropriate for the specific context in which it’s being used. Yes. OpenAI allows users to save chats in the ChatGPT interface, stored in the sidebar of the screen. There are no built-in sharing features yet. Yes. There aremultiple AI-powered chatbotcompetitors such asTogether, Google’sGeminiand Anthropic’sClaude, and developers arecreating open sourcealternatives. OpenAI has said that individuals in “certain jurisdictions” (such as the EU) can object to the processing of their personal information by its AI models by filling outthis form. This includes the ability to make requests for deletion of AI-generated references about you. Although OpenAI notes it may not grant every request since it must balance privacy requests against freedom of expression “in accordance with applicable laws”. The web form for making a deletion of data about you request is entitled “OpenAI Personal Data Removal Request”. In its privacy policy, the ChatGPT maker makes a passing acknowledgement of the objection requirements attached to relying on “legitimate interest” (LI), pointing users towards more information about requesting an opt out — when it writes: “Seeherefor instructions on how you can opt out of our use of your information to train our models.” Recently, Discord announced that it had integrated OpenAI’s technology into its bot named Clyde wheretwo users tricked Clyde into providing them with instructions for making the illegal drug methamphetamine(meth) and the incendiary mixture napalm. An Australian mayor has publicly announcedhe may sue OpenAI for defamationdue to ChatGPT’s false claims that he had served time in prison for bribery.

The private equity company that owns CNET, Red Ventures, wasaccusedof using ChatGPT for SEO farming, even if the information was incorrect. Several major school systems and colleges,including New York City Public Schools, have banned ChatGPT from their networks and devices. They claim that the AI impedes the learning process by promoting plagiarism and misinformation, a claim thatnot every educator agrees with. There have also been cases of ChatGPTaccusing individuals of false crimes. Several marketplaces host and provide ChatGPT prompts, either for free or for a nominal fee. One isPromptBase.

    "title": "Who is Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the acting head of the Vatican?",
    "article_text": "When the world learned of Pope Francis' death on Monday morning, an Irish-American cardinal, little known in the wider world, was the one to break the news. After announcing that the pope had \"returned to the home of the Father\", Irish-American Cardinal Kevin Farrell took on one of his biggest roles yet: the \"camerlengo\", or the person who runs the Vatican after the death or resignation of a pope. Pope Francis nominated the cardinal for the role in 2019. The cardinal will remain in the position during the \"Apostolica Sedes Vacans\", the period between the death or resignation of a pope until the election of the next pontiff. He also will play an important role in the centuries-old ceremonies to mourn Pope Francis. Born in 1947 in Dublin, Farrell attended the University of Salamanca in Spain and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, according to the Vatican. He held roles in churches around the world, serving as a chaplain at the University of Monterrey in Mexico as well as at a parish in Bethesda, Maryland. All told, the 77-year-old spent more than 30 years working for churches in the US. Farrell was appointed Bishop of Dallas in 2007 until Pope Francis asked him in 2016 to serve as the leader of the Vatican's new department responsible for the pastoral care of families, raising him to the rank of cardinal. Years after naming him as camerlengo, in 2023, Francis chose Farrell as president of the Supreme Court of Vatican City State. He was also named president of the Commission for Confidential Matters. As camerlengo, Cardinal Farrell will be tasked with making arrangements for the conclave, the process through which the next pontiff is selected. Technically, a camerlengo can become pope, as has happened twice in history: Gioacchino Pecci (Pope Leo XIII) in 1878 and Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII) in 1939. The cardinal also will preside over the certification of Francis's death, laying his body into the coffin. After that, the cardinal is expected to lead a procession moving the pope's body from the chapel of the Domus Santa Marta to St Peter's Basilica. The ceremony could take place as soon as Wednesday morning, according to the Vatican.",

    "title": "Final days of Pope who joined Vatican crowds at Easter despite doctors' advice",
    "article_text": "At midday on Monday, church bells across Italy began to toll. Pope Francis was dead. Not even 24 hours had passed since he had made a surprise appearance on the balcony overlooking St Peter's Square, blessing the 35,000 people gathered to celebrate Easter at the Vatican. The Pope was breathing on his own, without oxygen tubes, despite being told by his doctors to spend two months convalescing after 38 days in hospital with double pneumonia. Over the past two weeks Francis had done what he had always done, received visitors and met people from every walk of life. When he appeared on Easter Sunday, the crowd below erupted in cheers as he appeared; then it fell silent. \"Dear brothers and sisters, I wish you a happy Easter,\" he said, his voice heavy with effort. They were to be his final words in public. Follow latest updates here \"I think people could feel something - as if they could tell it was the last time they'd see him,\" said Mauro, a Rome resident who was in St Peter's Square for Easter Mass and had now returned to pay his respects. \"Usually everyone shouts 'Long live the Pope!'… this time it was much quieter than usual, there was maybe more respect for his suffering.\" \"He blessed us but his voice was a husk,\" a man called Alberto told the BBC. \"I think he was giving us his last goodbye.\" Doctors who treated Francis at Rome's Gemelli hospital had prescribed a regimen of complete rest – but it was never likely that a typically active Pope who spent much of his papacy meeting people would keep to that. Francis had already made it clear he wanted to be back in the Vatican in time for Easter, as soon as the specialists treating him explained that his health issues would not be resolved quickly. For Christians, Easter is even more important than Christmas as it symbolises a core tenet of their faith - the resurrection of Christ, three days after his nailing to the cross. Before he was discharged on 23 March, Francis waved to crowds from the hospital too, and then headed back to his quarters in the Casa Santa Marta guest house he had made his home. His medical team said all he needed was oxygen, and convalescing there was better than hospital with all its infections. Easter was just three weeks away and, as it approached, the Pope's schedule became increasingly busy. He met King Charles and Queen Camilla at the Casa San Marta and then appeared on the Vatican balcony for Palm Sunday four days later on 13 April, mingling with a crowd of 20,000 people in St Peter's Square, against doctors' advice. But for the Pope, Easter was most important time of all. Last Thursday, as he had done many times previously and as he used to do in his native Argentina before becoming Pope, he made a visit to the Regina Coeli jail in Rome where he spent half an hour meeting prisoners and he was greeted by applause from staff and guards as he arrived in a wheelchair. In previous years he had washed inmates' feet, mirroring what Jesus is said to have done with his disciples the night before his death. \"This year I'm unable to do that, but I can and want to still be near you,\" he said in a feeble voice to the dozens of prisoners who had come to see him, and who cheered him on as he toured the jail. \"We are so lucky. Those on the outside don't get to see him and we do,\" one man told Italian media. As he was leaving the prison, Francis was asked by a journalist how he would experience Easter this year. \"Whichever way I can,\" he replied. And, on Sunday, he kept his promise. He held a short meeting with US Vice-President JD Vance before appearing before the crowds in St Peter's Square as the crowd below erupted in cheers. He made his final blessing - the Urbi et Orbi address in Latin, meaning \"to the city and to the world\". Then, Archbishop Diego Ravelli read out a speech written by the Pope as Francis sat silently beside him. Then, to everyone's surprise, he descended down to St Peter's Square, where he was driven around in an open-top popemobile – the distinctive little white Mercedes-Benz used by popes to meet crowds. A camera followed him around as he raised his arm to bless the faithful lining the sunny square, and a few babies were brought up closer to him. It was the last time the world saw him alive. Watching Francis's blessing on Sunday, Alberto from Rome felt he would not last much longer, although the Pope's death still came as a shock. \"I didn't feel happy seeing him, I could tell he was in pain,\" he said. \"But it was an honour to see him one last time.\" Francis died early on Monday in his beloved Casa Santa Marta – a residenceof 100-odd simple rooms,  run by nuns and open to pilgrims and visitors. A little over two hours later, the cardinal chamberlain, or camerlengo, stood in the Casa Santa Marta and made the news public. The Vatican said on Monday evening he had died of a stroke and irreversible heart failure. The Pope's rooms were a far cry from the opulence of the Vatican quarters typically destined to pontiffs, which Francis had turned down at the start of his papacy saying he felt the need to \"live among people\". \"If I lived by myself, maybe even a bit in isolation, it would be of no use to me,\" he said back then. In the coming days, cardinals from across the world will be staying at Casa Santa Marta as they gather in Rome for the conclave that will choose Francis' successor. Outside, in the bright sunshine in St Peter's Square, people mingled with priests and friars under the imposing basilica. A group of nuns clad in grey and white glared at a man who, headphones in, was dancing around the square. \"No respect,\" they tutted. The same large screens that broadcast the Pope's blessing for Easter now displayed a photo of Francis smiling and a notice that a special rosary was being held for him 12 hours after his death. It would allow Catholics near and far to pray for their Pope – and thank him for celebrating one last Easter with them.

    "title": "Francis was a vocal critic of the powerful, his influence felt far beyond faith",
    "article_text": "Over 12 profoundly consequential years for the Catholic Church, Pope Francis steered it into uncharted territory and did so in ways that will resonate long into the future. The pontiff worked to soften the face of the Catholic Church for many, loosened the Vatican's grip on power and intervened in some of the major social questions of our time. Within Catholicism, he certainly had his critics; some traditionalists in particular were often enraged by actions they felt were a radical departure from Church teaching. Despite him being a vocal pacifist and critic of actions by major nations that he perceived as harmful, there were also those who felt he should have been more progressive. But from the moment he was elected in 2013, Pope Francis came with an informality and a smile that put the people he met at their ease. It was symbolic of a principle that guided his belief that the Church should reach people in their daily lives, wherever in the world they happened to be. \"At the beginning of my papacy I had the feeling that it would be brief: no more than three or four years, I thought,\" Pope Francis said in his autobiography Hope, released in January 2025, a book that gives us insight into the Pope's own reflections on his legacy. One of his first acts as pope was togive up the papal apartment on the third floor of the Apostolic Palace, instead choosing to live in the same guesthouse in which he had stayed as a cardinal. Some saw this as a sign he was giving up the ostentatious trappings of papacy, and of the humility he would certainly become known for - he had, after all, taken the name of a saint who championed the cause of the poor. But the main reason for surrendering the papal apartment, as he later explained it, pointed to another of his characteristics: that he loved being around people. To him, the apartment felt detached and a difficult place in which to welcome guests. At the guesthouse he was surrounded by clergy and rarely alone for long. On foreign trips to more than 60 countries, in his audiences at the Vatican and during countless events, it was very clear that being close to people, and particularly the young, was his lifeblood. Within Catholicism, he signalled a radicalchange in tone on some social issues. \"Everyone in the Church is invited, including people who are divorced, including people who are homosexual, including people who are transgender,\" he wrote in his autobiography. Given that the Church did not recognise divorce in its canon law and that previous popes had talked of homosexuality as a disorder not \"a human fact\", as Pope Francis did, this was a departure that again concerned traditionalists. But the Pope appeared to want the Church to explore and understand people's every day struggles in a fresh light. He acknowledged his own journey in seeing things differently to the way he had done in the past. Progressives welcomed the Pope's compassion for what he called \"imperfect Catholics\", but there was also a recognition more broadly that words of acceptance from a pontiff could have an effect on those outside the Church too. \"The first time that agroup of transgender peoplecame to the Vatican, they left in tears, moved because I had taken their hands, had kissed them... as if I had done something exceptional for them! But they are daughters of God,\" he wrote in Hope. Pope Francis roundly condemned countries that consider homosexuality a crime, and he talked of divorce sometimes being \"morally necessary\", citing cases of domestic abuse. However, there are those who suggest thePope could have gone furtherto encourage change in Church teaching. Homosexual \"acts\" remain a sin in Catholicism, marriage can still only be between a man and a woman, divorce is still not officially recognised and the Pope himself remained very firmly against gender reassignment and surrogacy. Throughout his papacy, and long before that, Pope Francis also always remained firm in his own belief that women should not be priests. He did however describe the Church as \"female\" and encouraged parishes around the world to find more leadership roles for women in ways that were consistent with the Catholic teaching that does not currently allow women to be ordained. In 2021 Sister Raffaella Petrini was appointed secretary general of the papal state and under Pope Francis the Vatican did start an ongoing process of exploring whether women could take up the role of deacon, assisting in worship services. Nevertheless, some reformists were left disappointed that more progress was not made regarding equality for women, in a faith where the majority of churchgoers are women. During the latter part of his papacy, the Pope launched an ambitious three-year consultation process aimed at gauging the opinion of as many of the world's more-than-a-billion Catholics as possible. There were tens of thousands of listening sessions across the globe, meant to tease out the issues that Catholics most cared about. It transpired that roles for women and ways in which the Church could becomemore inclusive to LGBT+ Catholics were high on the list. While the process itself did not lead to decisive action on either front, it did speak volumes about Pope Francis' desire that his pontificate was rooted not in Rome and in clerics but in the lives of believers around the world. Throughout his papacy, there was a particular focus on reaching out to those on the economic and political margins, his words and actions encouraging his priests to be closer to the disadvantaged. The issue of dignity for migrants was hugely important to himthroughout his papacy, but so too was building bridges with other Christian denominations, other religions and those of no faith. On occasions, to some Catholic traditionalists, the Pope's outreach appeared inappropriate for someone of his position, like his visit to a centre for asylum seekers outside Rome in spring 2016 when he washed and kissed the feet of refugees that included Muslims, Hindus and Coptic Christians. As well as becoming a passionate voice for migrants - once going to lay a wreath on the waters where many had died on their perilous journeys - he also linked the impact of climate change to poverty. In speeches, including one to US Congress, and in one of his most important pieces of work, the decree Laudato Si, Pope Francis talked of environmental damage amounting to rich countries inflicting harm on poor ones. Vehemently anti-war, the Pope frequently talked of conflict itself equating to failure. He called the war in Gaza \"terrorism\" and from early on he implored that there be a ceasefire. He met the families of the Israelis abducted by Hamas on 7 October 2023, but also spoke passionately about the plight of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, particularly children, and made daily calls to the Holy Family Church in Gaza City. But sometimes a longing to build bridges was seen by some observers as getting in the way of Pope Francis taking a firm stance against wrongdoing. In the eyes of many, he failed to unequivocally call out Russian aggression in Ukraineor tackleChina's surveillance and persecution of its Catholics. From the very start of his papacy, he also faced huge tasks confronting misconduct much closer to home. The scourge of corruption had long dogged the upper echelons of the Catholic Church. Early on, Pope Francis closed thousands of unauthorised Vatican bank accounts, and in the latter half of his time he introduced new rules on financial transparency. It was in the way he dealt with the horrors of child sexual abuse by those associated with the Catholic Church that made it clear he knew it was something he would be judged by. \"From the very start of my papacy, I felt I was being called to take responsibility for all the evil committed by certain priests,\" he wrote in Hope. As an illustration of the scale of the problem that remains, in 2020 the Catholic Church released lists of living members of clergy in the US alone found to have been accused of sexual abuses - these included clergy linked to child pornography and rape. There were around 2,000. \"With shame and repentance, the Church must seek pardon for the terrible damage that those clergy have caused with their sexual abuse of children, a crime that causes deep wounds of pain,\" he recently wrote. Among other initiatives, Pope Francis introduced rules that meant members of the Church had a responsibility to report on abuse if they had knowledge of it, otherwise they risked being removed from their positions. Though he made errors of judgement, on occasions publicly supporting clergy even though they were alleged to have failed to deal with abuse, Pope Francis was quick to apologise for his own mistakes and for the deep failings of the Church. Both at the Vatican and abroad he would frequently meet with Church abuse victims. Saying \"sorry\" for abuse was the prime focus of some foreign trips. A huge part of Pope Francis' legacy is the way in which he changed the face of the upper echelons of the Catholic Church through his selection of new cardinals. In fact, about 80% of the cardinals that will select the next pope were appointed by Pope Francis. What is striking about those selections is their diversity, with many coming from South America, Africa and Asia. It was part of Pope Francis' mission to consolidate a change in the centre of gravity of Catholicism away from Europe, where it was in decline, towards the places it was thriving, and to reflect that in Church leadership. The posthumous outpouring of tributes to himfrom across the globeis perhaps one sign that shift is working.

    "title": "Africa remembers Pope who spoke for the continent",
    "article_text": "Millions of African Catholics, as well as the continent's leaders, are mourning a man who they felt spoke for Africa. Home to nearly a fifth of the Church's followers, or 272 million people, Africa is becoming increasingly important in the Catholic world, and observers say Pope Francis did a lot to raise the profile of the continent within the institution. Heads of state reflected the sentiments of many describing how the late Pope spoke out for the marginalised. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu called him a \"tireless champion of the poor\" and his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa highlighted his \"world view of inclusion [and] equality\". The Vatican says that over the past year, seven million Africans have converted to Catholicism, making the continent one of the fastest-growing regions for the Church. \"This Pope has made a lot of efforts to make our faith inclusive... I remember him with joy,\" Ghanaian Catholic Aba Amissah Quainoo told the BBC in the capital, Accra. \"He was really loved by all because of his stance on the poor and the marginalised,\" Rev George Obeng Appah added. At the Holy Family Basilica in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, Rosemary Muthui said worshippers there will remember the Pope as a man who brought change to the Church, especially in promoting equality. \"His love for the African Church was great, and we will miss him,\" she told the BBC. She said she met him when he went to Kenya a decade ago on the first of his five visits to the continent which took in 10 African countries in all. His last in 2023 was to South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, Kitsita Ndongo Rachel did not hesitate when she broke protocol to personally meet the Pope. \"My heart was beating, I was less than 100 metres away. I slipped between the security agents; knelt down and asked the Pope for his blessing,\" the journalist remembers. \"He blessed me, and he blessed my rosary.\" She says her actions were influenced by the Pope's teachings which spoke to her about what can be done in her conflict-ridden country. \"When we listen to him, we feel that he wanted or he wants justice for the Democratic Republic of Congo, he knows that millions of people have died.\" Nigeria and Kenya have among the highest weekly church attendance rates globally, while DR Congo, Cameroon, Uganda and Angola also have strong Catholic communities. \"One of the biggest things Pope Francis did for Africa was to bring global attention to the continent's importance in the Catholic Church,\" said Charles Collins, managing editor of Crux, a leading Catholic news website covering Vatican affairs and Catholicism. \"He has not only spoken about Africa's struggles but has physically gone to marginalised areas, showing solidarity with victims of war, displacement and injustice,\" said Father Stan Chu Ilo, president of the Pan-African Catholic Theological Network. During his 2015 trip to the Central African Republic, the Pope pressed home a message of peace amid conflict there. In 2019, in a highly symbolic moment at the Vatican, the Pope knelt down and kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders. His trip to the country four years later was a special peace mission that included then Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby. And in a letter sent in the last week of March, Pope Francis urged President Salva Kiir and First Vice-President Riek Machar \"to prioritise peace, reconciliation and development for the benefits of their people - South Sudanese\". But the need to make that plea speaks to the limits of the Pope's power, as there are now fears the country could be on the brink of another civil war. Despite the remarkable growth of the Church on the continent and the creation of new African cardinals, Africa remains underrepresented in high-ranking Vatican positions. \"The Catholic Church's future is African, but it hasn't yet translated into real influence at the Vatican. That shift is still to come,\" Mr Collins said. Now attention starts to turn to who will succeed him and whether an African could take the helm for the first time in 1,500 years. \"An African Pope is not a question of 'if' but 'when' - because the Catholic Church in Africa is now a theological, spiritual, and demographic powerhouse,\" Father Ilo said.

The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage. Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\" The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\". However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\". A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan -was announced in January. Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\" However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down. \"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained. But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches. \"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said. \"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\" Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation. Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy. The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by. Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC. \"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense. \"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\" He continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\" The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\". The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\". Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters. While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport. Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\". \"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\" He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\" Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\". The BBCupdated its social media guidance in 2023following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets. The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\". Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\" Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures,signed an open later urging the BBCto reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer. The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official. Lineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\" He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\". \"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said. After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation. The BBC said it had identified serious flawsin the making of the documentary.The BBC board saidthe mistakes were \"significant and damaging\". In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports. Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms. \"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said. \"There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere. \"I think football needs a long, hard look at itself about that, I really do.\" On top of his presenting roles, Lineker is also the co-founder of Goalhanger Podcasts, which make the successful The Rest is History series and its spin-offs about Politics, Football, Entertainment and Money. The 64-year-old indicated to Rajan his next career move \"won't be more telly\", adding: \"I think I'll step back from that now. \"I think I'll probably focus more on the podcast world, because it's such a fun business and it's just been so incredible.\" Amol Rajan Interviews: Gary Linekeris on BBC iPlayer from 06:00and will air on BBC Two at 19:00 BST on Tuesday. BBC said it is working on plans to have other BBc stations available to those outside the UK and will not close BBC Sounds until then.

    "title": "Ukraine reports many Russian drone attacks after truce ends",
    "article_text": "Ukraine's military has reported Russian drone attacks on several regions overnight, just hours after the end of a 30-hour \"Easter truce\" declared by Moscow. Air raid alerts were issued by Ukraine's air force for the Kyiv region, as well as Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia. In the southern city of Mykolaiv, Mayor Oleksandr Senkevych said \"explosions were heard\". It was not immediately clear whether there were any casualties. Russia's defence ministry confirmed it has resumed fighting, adding that its military had \"strictly observed the ceasefire and remained at the previously occupied lines and positions\". The truce declared by President Vladimir Putin expired at midnight on Sunday Moscow time (21:00 GMT). Both sides accused each other of violating the ceasefire thousands of times. Early on Monday residents in several Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv, were urged by local authorities to go immediately to nearby shelters due to the threat of drone strikes. In the Kyiv region, local officials said air defence forces were \"working on targets\". Ukraine's air force also reported a \"rocket danger\" for central regions, and said Russian aircraft were \"active in the north-eastern and eastern directions\". In an update on Telegram, the air force said Russia launched 96 drones overnight, as well as striking the southern region of Mykolaiv two missiles and Kherson with a third missile. In Mykolaiv, regional head Vitaliy Kim said shortly afterwards that the city had been attacked by missiles. \"There were no casualties or damage,\" he added. Several hours before the truce expired, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Putin had not given an order to extend it, Russia's state-run news agency Tass reported. The BBC has not independently verified the claims by Ukraine and Russia. US President Donald Trump - who has been pushing for an end to the war - said late on Sunday that \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\". He gave no further details. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, and currently controls about 20% Ukraine's territory, including the southern Crimea peninsula annexed by Moscow in 2014. It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people - the vast majority of them soldiers - have been killed or injured on all sides since 2022. Last month, Moscow came up with a long list of conditions in response to a full and unconditional ceasefire that had been agreed by the US and Ukraine. On Saturday, President Putin said there would be an end to all hostilities from 18:00 Moscow time (15:00 GMT) on Saturday until midnight on Sunday. Kyiv said it would also adhere. \"For this period, I order all military actions to cease,\" Putin said in his announcement. \"We assume that the Ukrainian side will follow our example. At the same time, our troops must be ready to repel possible violations of the truce and provocations from the enemy, any of its aggressive actions.\" However, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said late on Sunday there had been a total of 1,882 cases of Russian shelling, 812 of which involved heavy weaponry, according to a report from Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Oleksandr Syrskyi. The president said the heaviest shelling and assaults were in eastern Ukraine near the besieged city of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub in the Donetsk region. \"The nature of Ukrainian actions will continue to be mirrored: we will respond to silence with silence, our strikes will be to protect against Russian strikes,\" Zelensky said. Earlier on Sunday, he said \"there were no air raid alerts today\", referring to Russia's daily drone and missile strikes against Ukraine. He proposed \"to cease any strikes using long-range drones and missiles on civilian infrastructure for a period of at least 30 days, with the possibility of extension\". Zelensky also said Putin's declaration of a truce amounted to a \"PR\" exercise and his words were \"empty\". He accused the Kremlin of trying to create \"a general impression of a ceasefire\". \"This Easter has clearly demonstrated that the only source of this war, and the reason it drags on, is Russia,\" the president said. The Russian defence ministry insisted its troops had \"strictly observed the ceasefire\". Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accused Ukraine of using US-supplied Himars missiles during the ceasefire. The surprise ceasefire announcement came shortly afterTrump threatened to \"take a pass\" on brokering further Russia-Ukraine peace talks. However, a state department spokesperson said on Sunday Washington remained \"committed to achieving a full and comprehensive ceasefire\". \"It is long past time to stop the death and destruction and end this war,\" the spokesperson added. Russia hoped to overthrow Ukraine's pro-Western government in days, but it failed. The 30-hour \"Easter truce\" and the reported violations underscore the difficulty in securing even a brief pause in fighting. Kyiv reports many cases of Russian shelling, while Moscow speaks of Ukrainian drone attacks during a truce that has now expired. The missions are part of the UK's contribution to Nato's enhanced air policing around eastern Poland. Oscar Jenkins has been charged under Russian law, the prosecutor in the occupied Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine said.",

    "title": "New Israel-Gaza ceasefire plan proposed, Hamas source tells BBC",
    "article_text": "A senior Palestinian official familiar with Israel-Hamas ceasefire negotiations has told the BBC that Qatari and Egyptian mediators have proposed a new formula to end the war in Gaza. According to the official, it envisages a truce lasting between five and seven years, the release of all Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a formal end to the war, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. A senior Hamas delegation was due to arrive in Cairo for consultations. The last ceasefire collapsed a month ago when Israel resumed bombing Gaza, with both sides blaming each other for the failure to keep it going. Israel has not commented on the mediators' plan. Hamas will be represented at discussions in Cairo by the head of its political council, Mohammed Darwish, and its lead negotiator Khalil al-Hayya. It comes days after the movement rejected Israel's latest proposal, which included a demand for Hamas to disarm in return for a six-week truce. On Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not end the war before Hamas was destroyed and all the hostages returned. Hamas has demanded Israel commit to ending the war before the hostages are freed. The Palestinian official familiar with the talks told the BBC that Hamas has signalled its readiness to hand over governance of Gaza to any Palestinian entity agreed upon \"at the national and regional level\". The official said this could be the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority (PA) or a newly formed administrative body. Netanyahu has ruled out any role for the PA in the future governance of Gaza, which has been ruled by Hamas since 2007. While it is still too early to assess the likelihood of success, the source described the current mediation effort as serious and said Hamas had shown \"unprecedented flexibility\". Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - and taking 251 back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military offensive in response, which has killed 51,240 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Elsewhere, the Palestinian Embassy in Cairo has instructed its staff - who had been co-ordinating medical evacuations from Gaza to Egyptian hospitals and facilitating the entry of humanitarian aid - to relocate with their families to the Egyptian city of Arish, near the Gaza border. An Israeli military report said \"professional failures\" led to the killing of the 15 rescue workers. Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed when the Israeli military opened fire on a convoy of vehicles in Gaza last month.

    "article_text": "Harvard University filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration to stop billions of dollars in proposed cuts. The suit filed Monday is part of a feud that escalated last week when the elite institution rejected a list of demands that the Trump administration said was designed to curb diversity initiatives and fight anti-semitism at the school. President Donald Trump froze $2.2bn (£1.7bn) of federal funding and alsothreatenedthe university's tax-exempt status. \"The consequences of the government's overreach will be severe and long-lasting,\" Harvard's president Alan M. Garber said in a letter to the university on Monday. The White House responded later Monday night in a statement. \"The gravy train of federal assistance to institutions like Harvard, which enrich their grossly overpaid bureaucrats with tax dollars from struggling American families is coming to an end. Taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions required to access that privilege\", said White House spokesman Harrison Fields. Mr Garber said the funding freeze affected critical research including studies on pediatric cancer, Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. \"In recent weeks, the federal Government has launched a broad attack on the critical funding partnerships that make this invaluable research possible,\" the school's lawsuit said. \"This case involves the Government's efforts to use the withholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard.\" Aside from funding, the Trump administration days ago also threatened Harvard's ability to enroll international students. Mr Garber, who is Jewish, acknowledged Harvard's campus has had issues with anti-semitism but said he had established task forces to work with the problem. He said the university would release the report of two task forces that looked into anti-semitism and anti-Muslim bias. The prominent US university, located in Massachusetts, is not the only institution faced with withholding of federal dollars, which play an outsized role in funding new scientific breakthroughs. The administration has targeted other private Ivy League institutions including suspending $1bn at Cornell University and $510 million at Brown University. Others such as Columbia University, the epicentre of pro-Palestinian campus protests last year, haveagreed to some demandsafter $400 million of federal funds was threatened. The demands to Harvard included agreeing to government-approved external audits of the university's curriculum as well as hiring and admission data. In response, Harvard released a blistering letter rejecting them. \"The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\" Harvard's lawyers told the administration on April 14. \"Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government. Accordingly, Harvard will not accept the government's terms as an agreement in principle.\" Former US President Barack Obama, a Harvard alum, said hesupportedthe university.",

    "title": "Palestinian Red Crescent says Israeli report into Gaza medics' killings 'full of lies'",
    "article_text": "The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has described an Israeli military report into a deadly attack on its paramedics as \"full of lies\". The Israeli military said in its report that \"professional failures\" led to the killing of the 15 workers in Gaza. It dismissed the deputy commander of the unit involved. A spokeswoman for the PRCS said the report was \"invalid\" as it \"justifies and shifts the responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different\". Fourteen emergency workers and a UN worker were killed on 23 March after a convoy of PRCS ambulances, a UN car and a fire truck came under fire by the Israeli military. The UN's humanitarian chief in Gaza suggested the investigation did not go far enough. \"A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,\" said Jonathan Whittall. \"Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all, eroding.\" The Red Crescent and several other international organisations have previously called for an independent investigation into the incident. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) investigation was carried out by its Fact-Finding Mechanism, which it describes as impartial. The IDF report said the incident took place in what it called a \"hostile and dangerous combat zone\", and that the commander on the ground perceived an immediate and tangible threat after vehicles approached rapidly. It blamed \"poor night visibility\", which the IDF said meant the commander did not identify the vehicles as ambulances. But it later said that account was \"mistaken\" after a video found on the mobile phone of a medic who was killed showed the vehicles with their lights on and their emergency signals flashing. The footage shows the vehicles pulling up on the road when shooting begins just before dawn. The video continues for more than five minutes, with the paramedic saying his last prayers before the voices of Israeli soldiers are heard approaching the vehicles. It also shows the vehicles were clearly marked and the paramedics wearing reflective hi-vis uniform. The bodies of the 15 dead workers were buried in sand. The report said this was done \"to prevent further harm\" and that the decision to do so \"was reasonable under the circumstances\". They were not recovered until a week after the incident because international agencies, including the UN, could not organise safe passage to the area or locate the spot. Journalists invited to an Israeli military briefing on Sunday were shown aerial footage, shot in the early hours of 23 March, which showed the series of three attacks. It also showed that several other vehicles, including an ambulance, passed by in the hour or so between the first and second Israeli attack, without being shot at. Israeli officials said this proved that troops in Gaza did not open fire on medical vehicles unless they felt threatened. The IDF also confirmed it was holding a PRCS medic it had detained following the incident. They did not confirm his name, but the International Committee of the Red Cross has previously named him as Assad al-Nassasra. Israel launched its campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 51,201 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Witnesses in al-Mawasi told the BBC that people were burned alive as tents were engulfed in flames. The group says it wants a deal that would free all hostages in return for an end to the war. The president of the Board of Deputies says he disagrees with the letter criticising the war in Gaza. Thirty-six members of the largest body representing Jews in the UK warn \"Israel's soul is being ripped out\". Israel Katz said Israel would continue its six-week blockade of all supplies, despite the UN warning of \"devastating\" consequences.",

    "title": "Trump backs defence secretary after reports of second Signal chat leak",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump has backed US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports that military attack details were shared in a group chat that included Hegseth's wife, brother, and personal lawyer. The controversy comes a month after a journalist was added to a Signal group chat in which US cabinet officials, including Hegseth, discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen. In the second Signal chat, Hegseth shared information about air strikes against Yemen, the BBC's US news partner CBS confirmed, citing sources familiar with the messages. \"Pete's doing a great job,\" Trump told reporters on Monday. \"Everybody's happy with him.\" White House officials have played down reports of military plans being shared in a second Signal group chat, but have not denied it. Trump told reporters he has \"great confidence\" in his defence secretary. \"Are you bringing up Signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago. It's the same old stuff from the media,\" he said. \"Try finding something new,\" he said. Trump said the source of the story \"sounds like disgruntled employees\", an idea  also floated by Hegseth earlier on Monday when he claimed the news media was \"full of hoaxsters\" who \"try to slash and burn people\". Hegseth did not directly respond to reports of a second Signal chat, which were initially covered by the New York Times. In a statement to the newspaper, the White House said no classified information was shared. The messages in the second chat, sent on 15 March, included flight schedules for American F/A-18 Hornets carrying out strikes on Houthi targets. Hegseth's wife, Jennifer Rauchet, is a former Fox News producer and holds no official position within the Pentagon. Hegseth has previously been criticised for reportedly including his wife in meetings with foreign leaders. His brother, Phil, and personal lawyer, Tim Parlatore, both hold positions at the Department of Defense. But it is not clear why any of the three would require advanced warnings of sensitive US strike plans. Unlike the first Signal group, the second one - called \"Defense | Team Huddle\" - was created by Hegseth, according to the New York Times. But it too appeared to share details of military operations against Yemen. The existence of the earlier Signal group was revealed by Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of the Atlantic magazine, who was accidentally included in it by Mike Waltz, Trump's national security adviser. Although the White House has also denied that classified information was discussed in the first group, Hegseth's critics - including former US defence officials -  have said such discussions could jeopardise US military personnel. Signal uses end-to-end encryption, meaning only a message's sender and recipients can view its contents. Despite this high level of security, experts say there are still ways for the information to be viewed or shared with the wrong people, which is why classified communications normally take place in secure, government-controlled locations rather than on private devices. The second Signal chat surfaced as controversy swirls around the head of the Pentagon, who this year is controlling a budget of $892bn (£670bn). Hegseth last week fired three top officials for an \"unauthorised disclosure\" - an accusation the officials said was \"baseless\". In a testy exchange outside the White House ahead of an annual Easter event, Hegseth appeared to attribute the latest story to the officials he fired. \"What a big surprise that a few leakers get fired and suddenly a bunch of hit pieces come out,\" he said. Hegseth criticised the media and denounced the reports. He also said he has spoken to the president and that they were \"on the same page all the way\". In an op-ed for Politico magazine published on Sunday, John Ullyot, the top Pentagon spokesperson who resigned last week, wrote that the department was in \"total chaos\". He added: \"The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president - who deserves better from his senior leadership.\" Ullyot said it was not true that the three fired officials were leaking information and wrote: \"Unfortunately, Hegseth's team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door.\" However, in a statement on X, Sean Parnell, current chief spokesman for the Pentagon, said the \"Trump-hating media\" was  \"destroying anyone committed to President Trump's agenda\". He echoed the White House by saying that \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat\". Washington says its strikes in Yemen are punishment for Houthi attacks on cargo vessels transiting through the Red Sea, a critical waterway for international trade. Since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted dozens of merchant vessels with missiles, drones and small boat attacks in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, saying they are acting in support of the Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza . They have sunk two vessels, seized a third, and killed four crew members. US air strikes on an oil terminal in north-western Yemen this week killed at least 74 people and wounded 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The FTC accused Uber of charging people for its Uber One subscription service without getting their consent. Pope Francis visited the US, Mexico and Canada on different occasions before his death at the age of 88. Her conviction brings an end to the years-long legal saga against her and her husband, former Senator Robert Menendez. The pontiff made several visits to North America, including to Washington DC in 2015 when he visited the White House and the US Capitol. The Insurrection Act of 1807 allows the president to deploy the military to enforce laws on US soil, including arresting migrants.",

    "title": "Vance in Delhi to meet Modi amid tariff tensions",
    "article_text": "US Vice-President JD Vance has arrived in the Indian capital, Delhi, where he is due to hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid global trade tensions sparked by Washington's tariff policies. The talks are likely to focus on fast tracking a much-awaited bilateral trade deal between the two countries. Vance  is also expected to go on a sightseeing tour of Agra and Jaipur with his family. His visit comes as countries across the world rush to negotiate trade deals before US President Donald Trump's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs ends on 9 July. \"The two sides will also exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest,\" India's foreign ministry said ahead of Vance's visit. The vice-president is accompanied by his children and wife Usha Vance whose parents migrated to the US from the southern state of Andhra Pradesh. After his arrival in Delhi on Monday morning, Vance visited the Akshardham temple complex in the city. He is due to meet the Indian prime minister for formal talks later in the day and Modi is to host Vance for dinner in the evening. The visit comes amid escalating trade tensions between Washington and several countries after Trump announced steep reciprocal tariffs on them. Trump, who has repeatedly called Delhi a tariff abuser, had announced a tariff of 27% on India before he temporarily paused it on 9 April. India has already slashed tariffs on some US goods, with further cuts expected as the balance of trade is still stacked heavily in favour of Delhi, which enjoys a $45bn trade surplus. India's average tariffs of around 12% are also significantly higher than the US's 2%. Until recently, the US was India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $190bn (£144bn). Prime Minister Modi was among the first leaders to meet Trump after his inauguration. Modi hailed a \"mega partnership\" with the United States following his meeting with the president. Trump and Modi set an ambitious target to more than double bilateral trade to $500bn, as the two leaders announced a deal for India to import more from America, including oil and gas. Weeks later, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard visited India, followed by a US delegation led by Assistant Trade Representative for South and Central Asia Brendan Lynch. Vance's India tour is also seen as significant as Trump is likely to visit the country later this year for the Quad summit, which will also host leaders of Australia and Japan. Speaking about Vance's engagements in India, Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal last week said Delhi was \"very positive that the visit will give a further boost to our bilateral ties\". Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,XandFacebook The president amps up attack against US central bank boss calling him \"a major loser\" for not lowering interest rates.

    "article_text": "P&O Cruises has apologised to almost 1,900 passengers for cancelling one of its cruises because a ship's refit was not complete. Aurora was due to depart Southampton on Monday afternoon on a three-day trip to Zeebrugge, Belgium, but passengers received an email on Sunday saying it could not sail. Stacey Pinhorne, who was due to sail, told the BBC she was \"very disappointed\", and that the company should have given more notice. P&O Cruises said its customers would receive a full refund. Up to 1,874 passengers are affected by the cancellation but they found themselves unable to speak to staff at the cruise line as its customer services offices were closed on Easter Sunday. Ms Pinhorne and her friend, Kim, booked a week off work to celebrate their 50th birthdays on the trip. She said it was \"quite a shock\" to receive the email from the company 24 hours before they were due to board. \"At the start of it I thought: 'Is it a joke? Is it a spam email? How do I know if this is actually true?' \"Even the day before I was getting an email saying: 'One day till your holiday, make sure you've checked in'… so there was no warning that there could be any issue. \"We weren't even told there was a refit happening.\" She added that she \"wouldn't be rushing to book with them again\". A P&O Cruises spokesperson apologised for the cruise's cancellation, putting it down to the refit delay. They added: \"We appreciate how disappointing this is for our guests who were booked to travel. \"All guests will receive a full refund and a future cruise credit of 20% of monies paid.\" Aurora is currently in Rotterdam in the Netherlands as its refit continues.

    "title": "Canada's top candidates talk up fossil fuels as climate slips down agenda",
    "article_text": "As the threat posed by US President Donald Trump tops Canada's federal election agenda, the issue of the country's contribution to global warming has been largely overshadowed. The two main contenders are pushing plans for new energy infrastructure as the country seeks to pivot away from its reliance on the US. Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax. It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns. In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year. That sense of unity is now long gone. Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change. As well as being a governor of the Bank of England, he was a UN Special Envoy on climate action and finance and was co-chair of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, one of the big outcomes of COP26. However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy. The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products. It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\". Some observers believe that cancelling the tax was a smart political move, others feel it was a mistake. \"By making one of your first moves the removal of the carbon price, you're accepting this narrative that climate change policy costs us too much money and isn't good for us, when, in fact, that is not the case,\" said Catherine Abreu, who is director of the International Climate Politics Hub and a member of Canada's Net Zero Advisory Body. \"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\" Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\". He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture. There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric. Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore. The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals. \"We have had a parade of geopolitical allies turning up on our doorstep saying, we want your rocks, we want Canada to be the geopolitically secure primary resource commodity provider, in place of Russia,\" said Mark Winfield, a professor in the faculty of environmental and urban change at Toronto's York University. \"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\" Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM. He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues. Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry. While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas. According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny. He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\". Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president. That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry. Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy. \"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates. \"The pipelines are a national security problem for us.\" That concern over US dependence has revived interest in pipelines that would move oil and gas from the western provinces, where they are mainly produced, to the east, where they could be exported to new overseas markets. A previous attempt called the Energy East pipeline was shelved in 2017 due to a number of factors, including fierce opposition from some regions of the country and regulatory hurdles. In this campaign, both the Liberals and Conservatives have promised to fast track \"energy corridors\",  though Carneyhas flip-flopped on his support for pipelines,knowing they are deeply unpopular with environmentalists. He is trying to walk a fine line between defending Canada as a nation under threat from Trump, and taking action on a warming climate. The Insurance Bureau of Canada reported that in 2024, there were C$8.5bn ($6.1bn;  £4.6bn) in weather-related insured losses, triple the figure for 2023. And while the two election frontrunners are advocating a major role for fossil fuels in Canada's economy, this approach will clash head on with the country's climate commitments. Yves-François Blanchet, leader of the Bloc Québécois, a federal party based in Quebec, has accused the pair of being in a \"denial situation about climate change\". \"I'm sorry to crash your party guys, but you are telling fairy tales\" about clean oil and gas, he said in last week's debates. Canada has promised on the international stage to curb carbon emissions by 40-45% by 2030 based on the levels in 2005. As of 2023, carbon output was only down 8.5%. Whoever wins the election will have a real challenge to square that circle. Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.

    "title": "Attempts to reach ceasefire in Ukraine littered with years of failure",
    "article_text": "Russia's ceasefire in Ukraine lasted only 30 hours, and even then it appears to have been very limited in scope, with accusations of violations on both sides. Kyiv said there had been no \"air raids alerts\" on Sunday during Vladimir Putin's \"Easter truce\" and President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested this could be the \"easiest\" format to extend for 30 days and possibly more. The US had tried to organise a 30-day ceasefire but that never took hold, and this latest chapter underscores the difficulty in achieving even a brief pause in fighting, Russia insisted on a number of conditions, including a halt to Ukraine re-arming and recruiting new fighters as well as \"underlying causes of the conflict\". One major factor hampering the talks' progress is the long history of broken ceasefire deals, resulting in deep mistrust between the two neighbours. During his tempestuous meeting with Donald Trump in February, Zelensky accused Russia of violating 25 ceasefire agreements since 2014, and argued that no such deal would hold without security guarantees. In turn, Russia accuses the Ukrainian president of being \"incapable\" of implementing any such agreements. Independent experts say Russia bears the brunt of the blame for broken truces, even though Ukraine bears some responsibility, too. Statements by current and former Russian officials also indicate that Moscow would be prepared to cease hostilities, only if its original objectives are achieved - namely a demilitarised, neutral and non-nuclear Ukraine. By invading Ukraine in 2014, Russia violated the Agreement on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership between the two countries signed in 1997. Article 2 said the sides \"respect each other's territorial integrity and confirm the inviolability of existing borders between them\". The war has been rife with accusations of treachery from the very beginning. Gen Viktor Muzhenko, the chief of Ukraine's General Staff at the time, accuses Russia of going back on agreements allowing Ukrainian troops to pull out from the eastern town of Ilovaysk in August 2014. As a result, withdrawing convoys came under fire, and at least 366 Ukrainian fighters were killed. The first major ceasefire agreement,signed on 5 September 2014 in Minsk, was broken within hours of being signed, with Ukrainian sources reporting attacks by Russian proxy forces on Donetsk airport. Attacks on other Ukrainian towns in the region, such as Debaltseve, continued, too. This prompted thesecond attempted truce, known as Minsk-2, but it was even shorter. Within minutes of it going into effect on 15 February 2015, observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported mortar and artillery fire in Donetsk. They were deployed to the war zone at Ukraine's request to monitor the security situation including any ceasefire violations, but they did not explicitly say who committed them. What followed was a string of other failed ceasefire attempts. Again, some were broken within minutes of coming into force. They included Easter truces in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the \"school ceasefires\" of 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 which were meant to allow schoolchildren near the frontline to go back to school in September, Christmas and New Year ceasefires in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the \"bread ceasefires\" of 2017, 2018 and 2019 to allow the harvesting of grain, and others. A \"comprehensive ceasefire\" that went into effect on 27 July 2020 only lasted 20 minutes, according to Kyiv. Still, it had an effect on the fighting, halving the number of fatalities among Ukrainian soldiers in the following year. Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, argues that Russia has never entered ceasefire talks in good faith. \"Russia has never been sincere about removing or ending the risk of the use of force in seeking its objectives,\" he says. Because of various ceasefire agreements between Ukraine and Russia, \"the level of fighting has ebbed and flowed, and Ukraine bears some responsibility for part of that\", he tells the BBC. \"But the underlying challenge has been that there has always been a Russian or Russian-backed military threat, and that informs things.\" John Herbst, a former US ambassador to Kyiv who now works for the Washington-based think-tank Atlantic Council, argues that Russia, not Ukraine was the \"serial violator\" of the Minsk ceasefire accords, the first and still one of the most comprehensive attempts to broker a truce in Ukraine. Verifying claims of ceasefire violations is not easy because almost all independent journalists are banned from Russian-controlled parts of Ukraine. BBC journalist Olga Ivshina, who was on the ground in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region reporting about the earlier stages of the war, says there were reports of Ukraine retaking villages in 2016-19, a successful Ukrainian offensive outside Mariupol, and Ukrainian tanks were spotted too close to the frontline, where they should not have been under the ceasefire deals. \"All of these were proclaimed as violations by Moscow. But of course they forgot to mention that their capture of Debaltseve in 2015 was the biggest violation of all,\" Ivshina says. Despite the Minsk accords, Russian-controlled forces launched an offensive against the town of Debaltseve, claiming that it was not covered by the ceasefire deal. Zelensky has described the Minsk accords as a \"trap\" for Ukraine which allowed Russia to prepare for the full-scale invasion. Putin says neither Ukraine nor its Western backers had intended to implement the Minsk deals. Their fate was sealed when Russia declared the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk \"people's republics\" - separatist entities it had helped to set up - as independent states. Putin's \"Easter truce\" was never more than a lull, but President Trump said \"hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week\". So far there has been no indication that the Kremlin will accept the US call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, agreed to by Ukraine. Trump has already warned that if either party makes ceasefire talks difficult, \"we're just gonna take a pass\" and walk away. Russia's demand for \"the underlying causes of the conflict\" to be resolved suggest it has not moved from its original objective of undermining Ukraine's sovereignty - through negotiations as well as military means. Vladislav Surkov, a former close adviser to Vladimir Putin who was known as the \"grey cardinal\" of Russian politics, celebrates the Minsk accords last year as a way of \"legitimising\" Ukraine's initial partition. The very idea of peace, he said, wass \"nothing but a continuation of war by other means\". Russia hoped to overthrow Ukraine's pro-Western government in days, but it failed. Air raid alerts are issued for Kyiv and other regions as blasts are reported in Mykolaiv, a southern city. Kyiv reports many cases of Russian shelling, while Moscow speaks of Ukrainian drone attacks during a truce that has now expired. The missions are part of the UK's contribution to Nato's enhanced air policing around eastern Poland. Oscar Jenkins has been charged under Russian law, the prosecutor in the occupied Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine said.",

    "title": "Britain's nursery problem: Parents still face 'childcare deserts'",
    "article_text": "Listen to Vanessa read this article \"We have the one of the most expensive systems in the world… today I want to reform our childcare system\". These words, spoken by the then-chancellor Jeremy Hunt in the 2023 Spring Budget, were a beacon of hope for thousands of parents paying an average of almost £15,000 a year to nurseries and childminders. The promise was to \"transform the lives of thousands of women\" and \"build a childcare system comparable to the best\". Two years on, the rollout of what's commonly known as the \"free hours\" scheme in England is almost complete. From September, eligible working parents will be able to access 30 hours of childcare per week during term-time (for 38 weeks), paid for by the government, for their children from the age of nine months to four. Only it hasn't been the panacea that many had hoped, and there are a number of hurdles still to overcome. Parents say nursery places are increasingly difficult to find. And experts are concerned that a gap is widening between those who are eligible for the funded hours, and those who are missing out on the childcare revolution. So why has this challenge been too great for successive governments to solve? Over the last five years, access to childcare in England has declined. At the same time demand is increasing. The government estimates that by September, an additional 70,000 extra places and 35,000 staff will be needed to cope with the influx of families wanting spaces and more hours. A report by the regulator and inspector of early years,Ofsted, found that deprived areas that have lower than average incomes are disproportionately affected by persistently low access to childcare. Doncaster is a \"childcare desert\", defined as an area where parents have faced low childcare accessibility over time. There are 17 childcare places there for every 100 children. For Jordan Parker from Doncaster, the funded hours have been an \"absolute godsend\". Her two-year-old daughter Riley goes to nursery one day a week. Finding a place however has been increasing tricky. \"I have to set off at 5am for work and her Dad steps in for some mornings but he's a farmer so he works long hours, seven days a week, so I don't think we'd manage without family help.\" Olena Mykhaylyk says she put her daughter on the nursery list the moment she found out she was pregnant. \"It's crazy you have to be thinking that far ahead,\" she says. \"It's great the government offers these hours but if you can't use them, they become negligible.\" Childcare places increased by 44,400 between 2023 and 2024, but from September, many families will look to increase nursery hours as the number they are eligible for doubles. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has conceded that parents in some areas may not be able to get their first choice childcare place in September. \"It is no secret that childcare in England has often been expensive and hard to find,\" Phillipson has previously said. \"This issue is historic, and in some places it is far worse than in others.\" One of Labour's lead pledges last year was to create 100,000 additional childcare places and more than 3,000 new nurseries in schools. Analysis by think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), says it will increase the share of school-based provision from around 22% to 27% of the market, which is \"not nothing\", says the IFS's associate director Christine Farquharson. But she adds that is \"not going to be transformational\". It will also apply more to older children because it is easier for school-based settings to cater for three-year-olds, she adds. The Department for Education (DfE) said 1,200 schools had approached them about opening one. But that is still short of the number needed. Some 300 nursery schools were approved for funding in this first round, which the government says will create 6,000 new places in total. Of these, 4,000 will open in September. Avnee Morjaria, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), who worked for the DfE when the expansion programme was being developed, says the school-based nursery programme is a \"glimmer of hope\". \"If they are delivered and delivered well, I think that has got a lot of potential. It just makes sense in terms of communities and schools and nurseries being the hub of their communities to have that kind of policy.\" But for now, the system is still heavily reliant on private nurseries. There are more than 20,000 private and voluntary nurseries in the UK, which provide most early years places, but many are unhappy with the current situation and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work. Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), says most providers are facing \"huge increases\" in their operating costs from April, including statutory wage increases, changes to national insurance contributions and rising utility bills. The government says it is increasing its funding for all pre-school children to reflect the wage increases and is providing an additional £75 million grant for nurseries to expand. But some nurseries say the money they receive for three-and-four-year olds is not enough and they can no longer subside it with the money parents pay for younger children - as from September the state will be paying for 80% of childcare in England. The DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary. This is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku. \"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\". Some nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether. But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\". In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England. Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector. The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours. To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than £9,518 but less than £100,000 per year. David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England. \"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it… it seems to be a huge oversight. \"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying £20,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\" The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education. Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around £5,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two. This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers. Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households. \"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families. \"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\" The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.) The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\". The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months. \"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\" In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children. The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university. Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says. \"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\" She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare. The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said. The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around £8bn. But the system is under strain. What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts. Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education. It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September. However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims – around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems. \"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\" Top picture credit: Getty Images BBC InDepthis the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

    "title": "No ball? No problem. How Forest are breaking the possession obsession",
    "article_text": "\"If God had wanted us to play football in the clouds, he'd have put grass up there.\" The legendary Brian Clough always had an interesting way of looking at things, and his view of long-ball football was no different. He might well have been appreciative of passing the ball to feet, but the former Nottingham Forest boss would no doubt be enjoying the novel approach the Reds are taking to secure a return to European football this season. On Monday they secureda hugely impressive 2-1 win at Tottenham, doing so having seen just 30% of the ball. That has been the theme for almost all of their games this season, as they sit bottom of the Premier League when it comes to average possession statistics. But the side that was battling against relegation last term currently sits third in the table and is firmly in the hunt for finishing in the Champions League places. \"We have a clear way to play and when we found ourselves in our identity,\" Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo told BBC Match of the Day. \"We had goals [against Tottenham] but also they created chances in the second half and we had to hold on to what we had. \"We've been able this season to compete well and fight for every ball.\" This video can not be played Forest had clear intention to bounce back - Santo Should Nottingham Forest finish in the top four with their current average possession statistics, they will become the first team to do so with such a low figure. Leicester City memorably won the Premier League against the odds in 2015-16 and did so with average possession statistics of 42.4% But Everton, with 48.5% in 2004-05, are the only other side to finish in the top four with less than 50% possession on average. So far this season Forest have seen just 39.3% possession per game. It may be at odds with the style of teams around them - and even across the English game more broadly - but Forest's football is firmly on course to ensure their fans will be able to enjoy a European adventure next season. Possession, of course, isn't everything. Southampton have been relegated from the Premier League and are still in danger of equalling the lowest-ever points total in the top-flight, yet they have gone down with better possession statistics than almost half the rest of the league. All of this isn't to say Forest's football is unattractive. They are instead masters of winning the ball high up the pitch and then quickly turning that into attacking opportunities through their impressive ball carriers, such as Anthony Elanga and Callum Hudson-Odoi. \"That's one of their main characteristics,\" said Nuno. \"They have the talent to give us these steps forward up the pitch.\" They are also clinical with the chances they get, as shown against Tottenham as they scored two goals from their three efforts on target. And once they get ahead they rarely let teams back in. They have scored first more than any other team in the Premier League (24 times) and haven't failed to win from a 2-0 lead since October 2023. Matz Sels has kept more clean sheets in the Premier League than any other goalkeeper, with 13 \"You cannot ignore when you are in front the priority is to contain and block the game,\" said Nuno. \"We help each other in every situation, give balance, help each other, clear things off the line.\" They are also ahead of 12 other Premier League teams in many of the key defensive metrics, making the most clearances and headed clearances, while they rank highly for most interceptions (eight), tackles (seven) and saves (seven). Only champions-elect Liverpool and second-placed Arsenal can boast a better defence than Forest's, which has conceded just 39 goals in 33 games, while in Matz Sels they have the goalkeeper who is leading the way in the fight for the Golden Glove this season. The Belgian has kept 13 clean sheets so far this season in the Premier League and was only denied a 14th by Richarlison's late header, after stopping the striker with a brilliant save a few minutes earlier. \"You might be critical of other teams for sinking deep, but Forest actually want to do that and say 'we'll back ourselves',\" former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher said on Sky Sports. \"I don't think you should be praising Tottenham too much for having so many shots or being on the ball, Nottingham Forest allow you to do that.\" Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser",

    "title": "We bored our way to the Premier League - Brownhill",
    "article_text": "Burnley have secured promotion back to the Premier League at the first time of asking the past three times they've been relegated Incredible. Boring. Record-breakers. Special. Those are all the words that have been used to describe Burnley on their way to winning promotion to the Premier League this season. Captain Josh Brownhill himself even joked that Burnley have \"bored our way to the Premier League\" after the2-1 win over Sheffield Unitedon Monday evening confirmed their return to the top flight. Brownhill was referencing the fact the Clarets are set to become the best defence in Championship history having conceded just 15 goals this season, smashing the record of 30 goals allowed by Watford in 2020-21 and Preston in 2005-06. They have also kept 29 clean sheets, beating Wigan Athletic's EFL record of 27 in League One in 2017-18. With 12 goalless draws and 15 of their 26 wins by a one-goal margin, Scott Parker's side has been largely built on remarkable defensive stability and consistency. But that takes nothing away from the fact Burnley are on course to reach 100 points and match Reading's record 33-game unbeaten run in the second tier set in 2005-06, should they win their final two games against QPR and Millwall. Top goalscorer Brownhill led by example at Turf Moor against the Blades - as he has done for much of this season - with two goals to help his side to the victory that sealed Burnley's place in the Premier League for the 2025-26 campaign. Burnley have only conceded 15 goals in the Championship - 14 fewer than Leeds (29) who have the second strongest defence \"I'm speechless. All that hard work this season,\" the 29-year-old told Sky Sports. \"We've been written off so many times, people calling us boring. We've bored our way to the Premier League. \"It takes a whole team - it's not just a back four, a goalkeeper, it takes everybody. \"I don't think a lot of the lads will sleep. I'm so buzzing for the lads that haven't played Premier League football.\" Head coach Parker said the \"ambition and target at the start of the season was to get back to the Premier League\". \"We've managed to do that so I'm hugely proud of the squad,\" he told BBC Radio Lancashire. \"It's come down to real, pure commitment from every one of the players, their dedication and the sacrifice that they've made, that leads us to this point. \"I explained to the lads there is emotion from me because I see the commitment that everyone has brought. \"We live in a world where you win or you lose and you get judged and at the end of the season you're either promoted or not and that's how quickly people will judge it. \"I'm just delighted that all that work, all that effort, all that sacrifice has been worth it and people can see it. The facts are if you don't get promoted people can see it.\" This video can not be played Burnley boss Scott Parker 'hugely proud' of promotion Parker was appointed Burnley boss in the summer following 15 months out of management, having been sacked by Belgian side Club Brugge in March 2022 after just 12 games in charge. The 44-year-old said his third promotion as a manager means \"everything\" and said the journey Burnley have been on is \"nothing short of incredible\". \"This one feels special,\" he told Sky Sports, having previously won a place in the top flight with Fulham and Bournemouth. \"I've had some bumps in the road as a manager, not to make this about me. I decided to take a year out and came back to this, I knew it would be a challenge. \"The spotlight often shines on the players and myself but the sacrifices that families make - they fully deserve it.\" There are only two games of the season remaining but with both Leeds and Burnley tied on 94 points, Parker says they are still aiming to win the title. \"We are going to go for it,\" Parker said. \"That's the aim and that's exactly what we are going to do.\" Burnley chairman Alan Pace described Parker as a \"living legend\" who has \"outperformed anything he could have possibly said\" before he was hired. Scott Parker has won promotion to the Premier League for the third time as a manager \"He's shown multiple times that he knows how to handle this league and how to bring a group of men together and accomplish great things,\" Pace told Sky Sports. \"Even when there was negativity at the start of the season from others, it never stopped him. \"He's amazing and we are so, so grateful, thankful and blessed to have him here.\" Midfielder Josh Cullen said promotion feels \"absolutely amazing\" and added: \"This is a day I'll never forget.\" Latest Burnley news, analysis and fan views Get Burnley news sent straight to your phone",

    "article_text": "John Higgins has won 33 ranking events Halo World Championship Venue:Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:19 April to 5 May Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and app; live text coverage of selected matches; updates on BBC Radio 5 Live Emotionally \"drained\" four-time champion John Higgins beat Joe O'Connor 10-7 in a tense affair as he reached the second round of the World Snooker Championship at the Crucible Theatre. Higgins who turns 50 in May, overturned a 5-4 deficit from Monday morning to lead 7-6 at the mid-session interval while remarkably compiling just one break above 50, a superb century in the 12th frame. But he struggled the shake off the Englishman until O'Connor failed to capitalise on several chances to win a dramatic 15th frame, that Higgins took to go 8-7 up. The Scot crafted a wonderful 114 break to move further ahead and another half century helped him seal his victory. Higgins had been cast as one of the favourites to triumph in Sheffield after winning the World Open - where he defeated O'Connor in the final â and impressively beating Mark Selby in the final of the Tour Championship. However, his plans were thrown into doubt when his father-in-law became seriously ill on the eve of the tournament. And he was visibly emotional while speaking to BBC Sport at the end of his contest with O'Connor. \"I left my partner and I was in tears,\" Higgins said. \"That was the most emotional I have ever been today. Obviously my father-in-law wasn't great. \"I was sitting having dinner with my boy last night and I was thinking about sitting here with my dad 25 years ago. I was drained today. \"I had a couple of hours sleep and I came out tonight and felt a lot better and played a lot better. I am still so proud that I am still playing at a good level at this age.\" The 33-time ranking event winner will play China's Xiao Guodong in the second round.

The 39-year-old from Northern Ireland, who had trailed 3-0 before fighting back to lead 5-4 overnight, made breaks of 88 and 102 on his way to setting up a last-16 tie with qualifier Chris Wakelin. Allen, a former Masters and UK Championship winner, is bidding for a first world title to complete the full set of Triple Crown event victories. The world number eight told BBC Two: \"It was a bit of a shaky start yesterday and I thought Fan was very good at the start. I was really happy to be 5-4 in front overnight and I played some really good snooker today. \"I stole two frames in a row that I had no real right to win and it made the scoreline look a little flattering at the interval - 9-4 could have easily been 7-6 and then it would have been game on. \"I didn't close it out as clinically as I would have liked but I finished off nicely.\" Allen is joined in round two by Zhao Xintong, who wrapped up a comfortable 10-4 victory over 2024 runner-up Jak Jones. Jones' exit means both of last year's finalists have exited the 2025 event in the first round, following defending champion Kyren Wilson's defeat by Lei Peifan on Saturday. Zhao will meet fellow Chinese player Lei for a place in the quarter-finals. In Monday afternoon's other first-round contest, three-time UK champion Ding Junhui opened up a 6-3 advantage against world number 73 Zak Surety. Debutant Surety struggled to settled early on and was 4-0 down before he found any rhythm at all. However, the Englishman regrouped after the mid-session pause and made a century break as he took three of the remaining five frames to limit the damage prior to Tuesday afternoon's concluding session. Si Jiahui took control of the battle between two former Crucible semi-finalists, with breaks of 97 and 73 helping him move 6-3 up on David Gilbert. Zhao Xintong won the 2021 UK Championship Zhao's first-round display was one of the most impressive of any player during the tournament so far. The 28-year-old led 7-2 overnight and, after Jones took the first two frames of the morning, Zhao won the next three with breaks of 70, 55 and 87 to defeat the 16th seed from Wales. Zhao is competing as an amateur in his first World Championship appearance since 2022, having completed a 20-month suspension earlier this season. The former UK Championship winner wasone of 10 players bannedin 2023 following an investigation into match-fixing. He did not directly throw a match, but accepted charges of being a party to another player fixing two matches, and betting on matches himself. But he will return to the professional ranks next season and both Jones and former world champion Neil Robertson saying they expect him to contend in Sheffield. \"I'm so happy he said that and I will try my best,\" said Zhao when told of Robertson's comments. \"Hopefully in the future, we will have a Chinese world champion here and we are trying to do that.\" Jones, 31, added: \"Zhao looked really sharp, the qualifiers have done him good, and I've had two best-of-sevens in the past 10 weeks or so. \"I kind of felt that out there, I didn't feel sharp at all.

    "title": "Leeds United promoted back to Premier League",
    "article_text": "Leeds players and staff stayed at Elland Road after their match and celebrated together after promotion was confirmed thanks to Burnley's win over Sheffield United Leeds United have been promoted back to the Premier League after two years in the Championship. The Whites secured promotion with two games to spare after Sheffield Unitedlost at second-placed Burnley,a result which meant the Clarets also confirmed their return to the top flight. Daniel Farke's men hadcrushed Stoke City 6-0in their own game earlier on Monday to leave promotion a mere formality. They will win the title with victories over Bristol City and Plymouth Argyle in their final two matches, barring a mathematical miracle goal difference swing from Burnley. Leeds finished third with 90 points in 2023-24 before losing to Southampton in the play-off final. The summer saw highly-rated academy product Archie Gray sold to Tottenham, while Championship player of the season Crysencio Summerville left for West Ham. Those exits had seemed likely but the sale of talented forward Georginio Rutter to Brighton after the season had started was unexpected and unwelcome. Still, the Whites boasted a strong squad for the level and the permanent additions of Spurs defender Joe Rodon after his loan last season, ex-Sheffield United full-back Jayden Bogle and Japan international midfielder Ao Tanaka, plus the loan signings of Joe Rothwell and Manor Solomon from Bournemouth and Tottenham respectively, all brought quality. On the pitch the campaign started with no wins from their first three games in all competitions but they kickstarted things with a 2-0 victory at Sheffield Wednesday and scarcely looked back. Despite a narrow home defeat by fellow promotion hopefuls Burnley on 14 September, to date their only loss at Elland Road this season, by the third international break of the season in November, Leeds had risen up to second. After ending that month with a 1-0 home defeat at Blackburn they then went on a three-month unbeaten run in the league that included a 7-0 demolition of Cardiff and dramatic comebacks to beat top-four rivals Sunderland and Sheffield United on successive Mondays in February. The victory over the Blades left them five points clear at the top and, with a seemingly favourable run of fixtures until the end of the campaign, promotion looked inevitable. However, March brought just one win from five and the 2-2 draw with Swansea saw Farke drop goalkeeper Illan Meslier for Karl Darlow after the Frenchman, who had also made costly errors in draws at Sunderland and Hull City, gifted the Welsh side their first equaliser. The German boss was then criticised by some after saying the point from the 1-1 draw at lowly Luton in the next game was a good result but it proved to be the case as the Blades totally lost their way with three successive defeats and the Whites went from third back to first and five points clear of Chris Wilder's men in third with three games to play. Six moments that mattered as Leeds won promotion Leeds players celebrated with the fans after Monday's 6-0 win over Stoke had left them on the cusp of promotion Monday's demolition of struggling Stoke meant that, thanks to a vastly superior goal difference, a point from their final two matches would have been enough to go up but even that was not needed thanks to Burnley's win. Farke, who had chosen not to make any further signings in the January transfer window, is now closing in on a third title at this level after winning two with Norwich. A huge summer awaits as Leeds look to buck the worrying trend that appears set to see all of the past six teams promoted to the Premier League go straight back down. Plans to avoid that fate will now truly begin in earnest on Tuesday but for now Farke and the Leeds fans, robbed of being able to properly celebrate their last promotion to the top flight in 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic, can enjoy a job well done.

    "title": "Raducanu happy with 'informal' coaching set-up",
    "article_text": "Emma Raducanu returned to the world's top 50 after reaching the Miami quarter-finals last month Emma Raducanu has paused the search for a new full-time coach, saying she is happy to \"keep things informal\" as her part-time partnership with Mark Petchey continues. Raducanu brought Petchey - a well-known figure in British tennis circles and a former coach of Andy Murray - into her coaching team on a casual basis at last month's Miami Open. Petchey was in the coaching box as the 22-year-old Briton reached the quarter-finals and produced her best tennis of the season. After Miami, Raducanu wanted Petcheyto lead the teamon a more regular basis, but committing time around his television broadcasting work has been a stumbling block. Raducanu, who is returning to competitive action this week at the Madrid Open after a month off, said Petchey will be \"fitting\" her around his other commitments at the WTA 1000 clay-court event. \"I'm happy with the set-up going forward right now - it's been working well,\" said the world number 49. \"I like him a lot and I've known him since before the US Open [victory in 2021] and it's nice to have familiar faces around.\" How 'free spirit' Raducanu is thriving without coach The curious case of Swiatek's hex against Ostapenko - Second Serve Raducanu has not had a full-time coach since January, when Nick Cavaday stood down for health reasons, and ended a two-week trial with Vladimir Platenik on the eve of the Miami Open. She had previously worked with a wide range of coaches including Nigel Sears, Andrew Richardson - who was in charge during her run to the US Open title - Torben Beltz, Dmitry Tursunov and Sebastian Sachs. On Petchey, Raducanu added: \"We're keeping things informal for now and it's been working. He's someone I've known for a long time and I do feel like I can trust him. \"For now there is no real thing set in stone but we're taking it week to week and he's helping me as much as he can alongside his current commitments.\" Post-Miami, Raducanu decided it would be more beneficialto skip Great Britain's Billie Jean King Cup tieand do a short training block in the United States instead. The 2021 US Open champion spent the time in Los Angeles, where she worked with Petchey for 10 days before heading back to Europe. Raducanu, who has known Petchey since she was a teenager, says she is enjoying the \"thought-provoking\" nature of their conversations. Creating a relaxed atmosphere around her - which she said helped her \"express\" herself in Miami and be more \"authentic\" - is another hallmark of the partnership. Raducanu has also found greater equilibrium off the court. In LA, she enjoyed hiking trips in the mountains, while going to a post-training yoga class in Madrid is another example of her trying to strike a work-life balance. \"I'm happy with [the training block] and how I'm feeling on the court right now. I think I did some great work on my game and I'm looking forward to testing it on a match court,\" said British number two Raducanu. Mark Petchey linked up with Raducanu in Miami, joining her long-time confidante Jane O'Donoghue in the support team \"We created our own little bubble and it was nice to be working on my game out there but at the same time having fun and enjoying it. \"He's helped me in a lot of areas of my game and also off the court finding things to stimulate me mentally and constantly challenging me - which I like.\" Raducanu will return to the WTA Tour when she faces Suzan Lamens of the Netherlands in the Madrid first round later this week. It will be her first match sincelosing to American world number three Jessica Pegulain the Miami quarter-finals on 27 March. \"I had a long start to the year with many weeks in a row and I think my body and brain needed to have a little recharge,\" Raducanu said. \"With the transition to a different surface on clay, I feel I'm not at the point that I can switch surfaces in back-to-back weeks.\" Live scores, results and order of play Get tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "title": "West Brom sack head coach Mowbray",
    "article_text": "Tony Mowbray won the Championship with West Bromwich Albion in 2008 and led Blackburn Rovers to promotion from League One a decade later West Bromwich Albion have sacked head coach Tony Mowbray after just three months of his second spell in charge. The 61-year-old was dismissed after Monday's3-1 home defeatby relegation-threatened Derby County - a loss that all but ends the Baggies' hopes of making the Championship play-offs. The former Blackburn Rovers and Middlesbrough boss was reappointed as Albion head coach in January, almost 16 years after he left The Hawthorns for Celtic in June 2009. He replaced Carlos Corberan wholeft the clubto take over at Spanish top-flight side Valencia with the Baggies then sitting seventh in the table. But Mowbray has led the club to just five wins in his 18 games in charge and they are six points off the play-off spots in 10th place with two games to play. While the club can mathematically still make the top six, it would take a unlikely set of results for them to have a chance. Mowbray's assistant Mark Venus has also left, with former Albion midfielder James Morrison placed in interim charge, to be assisted by Damia Abella and Boaz Myhill. \"The club would like to place on record its thanks to Tony and Mark for their efforts â but has made the decision to part company following a series of poor results,\" a short Albion statement said. \"Tony and Mark will forever be welcome at The Hawthorns and their contributions to the club winning the 2007-08 Championship title will never be forgotten.\" Mowbray, who led the Baggies to the Premier League 17 years ago, had returned to management for the first time since a health scare in February 2024. That led to him stepping away from his role in charge of Birmingham City to undergo treatment for what was later revealed to be bowel cancer. He was unable to recreate the success he had in his first spell as Albion boss, when he steered West Brom to the Championship play-off final in his first season in charge although they were beaten by Derby County at Wembley. But a year later they won the title, having also reached the FA Cup semi-final where they lost to eventual winners Portsmouth. Relegation followed after one season in the top flight, after which Mowbray left in 2009 for Celtic Park. He had five more managerial stints, with his hometown club Middlesbrough, Coventry City, Blackburn, Sunderland and Birmingham before returning to The Hawthorns. Mowbray's departure leaves the Baggies searching for their seventh permanent manager in less than six years. His predecessor Corberan's 26-month stint as boss was a rare example of the club keeping faith with a head coach. Slaven Bilic, who was in charge from June 2019 to December 2020, was the only other manager in that time to get at least a full season at the helm, during which he led the club to promotion back to the Premier League. After he was sacked, Sam Allardyce took control but was unable to keep Albion in the top flight as they finished in 19th place and he left that summer. Valerien Ismael took over but was gone by the following February to be replaced by Steve Bruce as the club ended their first season back in the Championship in 10th place. Bruce lasted until October that year when Corberan came in and led the club to ninth place in his first season in charge. A fifth-placed finish followed last season, where the Baggies were beaten by Southampton in the play-off semi finals. West Brom's 3-1 defeat to John Eustace's Derby was their fifth in their last six games under Tony Mowbray Steve Hermon, BBC WM West Brom commentator There's an air of sadness to Albion's decision to end Tony Mowbray's second spell in charge after less than 100 days. Particularly due to the huge respect he built in his memorable first reign, but the swift sacking barely hours after a 3-1 defeat to Derby is probably best for all parties. A data led search for Carlos Corberan's successor afterhis abrupt departure on Christmas Eveled sporting director Andrew Nestor to the 61-year-old, who'd received the all clear from a bowel cancer diagnosis just days earlier. His return to football management in January was a feel-good story but unfortunately it won't have the fairytale ending of another promotion to the Premier League with the Baggies. He inherited a squad that had been drilled by the meticulous Spaniard and took the handbrake off. Unfortunately, the players couldn't be trusted at the wheel and the play-off push went off the rails. Mowbray's chopping and changing of line-ups suggested he was trying to figure out who he could trust to play his way but while he was doing that, results failed to come and two dismal displays over the Easter weekend have cost him his job. The players certainly shouldn't be absolved from blame for the underwhelming end to the season. It looks like they needed Corberan's discipline, rather than Mowbray's friendly arm around the shoulder. Time is on Albion's side with the season coming to a close but there's pressure on owners Bilkul to get this next appointment right to re-establish the club as one that can fight for promotion next season.

    "title": "England trio among Wisden cricketers of the year",
    "article_text": "The Wisden awards have been chosen based on performances in the 2024 English summer England trio Gus Atkinson, Jamie Smith and Sophie Ecclestone have been named among Wisden's five Cricketers of the Year. The players are chosen by the Wisden editor, a tradition that dates back to 1889. The awards are based on performances in the previous English summer and no player can win the award more than once in their career. Hampshire spinner Liam Dawson and Surrey fast bowler Dan Worrall complete the line-up, which has been announced as this year's Wisden almanack is published on Thursday. India duo Jasprit Bumrah and Smriti Mandhana are crowned the leading cricketers in the world, while West Indies' Nicholas Pooran is the world's leading T20 player. Atkinson took 12 wickets against West Indies on his Test debut in July, which sparked a remarkable tally of 52 scalps in the year. He then scored a Test century - also his maiden first-class century - batting at number eight against Sri Lanka at Lord's the following month. Smith also made his Test debut in the summer as England's new wicketkeeper and made his first century against Sri Lanka at Old Trafford. The 24-year-old finished the three-match series with 280 runs at an average of 46.6, second only to Joe Root. His solid wicketkeeping also solved England's selection dilemma as he edged out Jonny Bairstow and Surrey team-mate Ben Foakes. Ecclestone has been an outlier in a difficult year for England's women, as she becomes the first English woman to be named in the quintet since batter Tammy Beaumont in 2019. England were unbeaten during their home summer against Pakistan and New Zealand, before the disappointing group-stage exit in the autumn's T20 World Cup and a disastrous Ashes defeat which saw head coach Jon Lewis and captain Heather Knight removed from their positions. Left-arm spinner Ecclestone, 25, is the world's number one ranked bowler in both white-ball formats, and surpassed Katherine Sciver-Brunt as England Women's leading T20 wicket-taker during the series against Pakistan. England's Nat Sciver-Brunt and Australia captain Pat Cummins were theleading cricketers in the world for 2024.

    "title": "Wild chimpanzees filmed by scientists bonding over alcoholic fruit",
    "article_text": "Humans have gathered to feast and enjoy a tipple togetherfor thousands of years, but research suggests chimpanzees may also bond over a boozy treat. Wild chimpanzees in westAfricahave been observed sharing fruit containing alcohol – not in quantities to get roaring drunk but, possibly, enough for a fuzzy beer buzz feeling. The researchers, led by scientists from theUniversity of Exeterin the UK, caught chimpanzees on film sharing fermented African breadfruit inGuinea-Bissau’s Cantanhez national park. “For humans, we know that drinking alcohol leads to a release of dopamine and endorphins, and resulting feelings of happiness and relaxation,” said Anna Bowland, from theCentre for Ecology and Conservationat Exeter’s Penryn campus in Cornwall. “We also know that sharing alcohol,including through traditions such as feasting, helps to form and strengthen social bonds. “Now we know that wild chimpanzees are eating and sharing ethanolic fruits, the question is: could they be getting similar benefits?” Using motion-activated cameras, the researchers filmed chimpanzees sharing the large, dense and fibrous fermented fruit on 10 occasions. The fruit shared was tested for alcohol content. The highest level found was the equivalent of 0.61% alcohol by volume (ABV). “Chimps don’t share food all the time, so this behaviour with fermented fruit might be important,” said Kimberley Hockings, also from the University of Exeter. Though the alcohol level is relatively low, the chimpanzees ate a lot of fruit every day so might ingest a fair quantity of alcohol, she said. “They can feed on kilograms of the stuff every day. It’s probably analogous to us sipping on a light beer.” Hockings and her colleagues published a paper in 2015 describing how chimpanzees in west Africastole and consumed palm sap alcohol created by humans. Some of them appeared to become troublesome, causing mischief such as not letting others build their night nests. The researchers behind the latest study, however, said chimpanzees were unlikely to get “drunk” on the breadfruit because it would not improve their survival chances. The sharing seemed to take place between all ages and sexes. Two adult females, nicknamed Chip and Até, were seen ignoring a larger hunk of breadfruit in favour of a smaller but fermented piece. Two adult males, Mandjambé and Gary, were observed approaching ripe breadfruit with aggressive stances. Mandjambé claimed a piece and began to feed, while another adult male, Bobby, kept Gary at bay. They all had a taste of the ripe breadfruit in the vicinity in the end. The paper, which appears in the journalCurrent Biologywith the title “Wild chimpanzees share fermented fruits”, asks the question: “Do the origins of feasting behaviour derive from a shared common ancestor?” Hockings said: “We need to find out more about whether the chimpanzees deliberately seek out ethanolic fruits and how they metabolise it, but this behaviour could be the early evolutionary stages of feasting. If so, it suggests the human tradition of feasting may have its origins deep in our evolutionary history.” She said the number of observations was small but they could lead to “an explosion” of research into the topic.",

    "article_text": "Haiti, where rampant gang violence has surged in recent weeks, is approaching a “point of no return” leading to “total chaos”, theUNspecial representative to the troubled Caribbean nation has warned. “As gang violence continues to spread to new areas of the country, Haitians experience growing levels of vulnerability and increasing skepticism about the ability of the state to respond to their needs,” María Isabel Salvador told the UN securitycouncil. “Haiti could face total chaos,” she said, adding that international aid was desperately needed to avoid that fate. “I urge you to remain engaged and answer the urgent needs of the country and its people.” Salvador cited cholera outbreaks andgender-based violencealongside a deteriorating security situation, particularly in the capital,Port-au-Prince, with authorities struggling to cope. The poorest country in the western hemisphere, Haiti faces severe political instability, while swaths of the country are under the control of rival armed gangs who carry out widespread murders, rapes and kidnappings. The armed groups have been battling for control ofPort-au-Princeand clashes have intensified as the rival gangs attempt to establish new territories. A Kenyan-led force authorized by theUnited Nationshas failed to push back the gangs. The mission has around 1,000 police officers from six countries but was intended to have 2,500. In a report seen by AFP, the UN secretary general, António Guterres, warned that further international support was “required immediately to allow the national police to prevent the capital slipping closer to the brink”. Haiti’s ambassador to the UN, Ericq Pierre, said his country was “slowly dying”. “The Republic of Haiti is slowly dying under the combined action of armed gangs, drug traffickers and arms dealers,” he said, calling on his partners to “help rid the country of the gangs that are terrorizing the population”. The report detailed the upsurge in violence, with the UN recording 2,660 homicides in the three months from December 2024 – a 41.3% increase over the previous quarter. Anti-gang operations resulted in 702 people killed in that time, of which 21% were estimated to be innocent civilians, the report said. Gender-based violence also recorded an alarming increase, with 347 incidents reported in the five months to February 2025, according to UN data. Collective rape was the most common violation, accounting for 61% of cases.",

    "title": "Venezuela accuses El Salvador of human trafficking as prisoners caught in row between authoritarians",
    "article_text": "Venezuela’s chief prosecutor has accusedEl Salvador’s president of being a “tyrannical” human trafficker after Nayib Bukeleoffered to exchangethe 252 Venezuelan migrants deported to his country’s prisons byDonald Trumpfor the same number of political prisoners in Venezuela. Bukele made the offer on Sunday night in a message addressed directly to his authoritarian counterpartNicolás Maduro. “I want to propose a humanitarian agreement that includes the repatriation of 100% of the 252 Venezuelans who were deported, in exchange for the release and delivery of an identical number … of the thousands of political prisoners that you hold,” El Salvador’s leader posted. Hours later the proposal was rebuffed by one of Maduro’s top allies, the attorney general Tarek William Saab. In a televised address, Saab claimed the Salvadorian’s “cynical” offer exposed him as a narcissistic “neo-Nazi” who had “kidnapped” more than 250 Venezuelan migrants sent to a maximum-security jail inEl Salvadorby the Trump administration since mid-March. “Bukele is a serial human rights violator,” Saab said, pointing to the politician’s “horrifying” three-year anti-gang crackdown, which has seen at least 85,000 Salvadoriansthrown in jail, largely without due process. Human rights activists say more than 360 prisoners have died. Some members of Venezuela’s opposition – reeling from its failure to dislodge Maduro, despite seemingly beating him in last July’s presidential election – welcomed Bukele’s offer. Leopoldo López, an exiled opposition leader who lives in Spain, said the idea had his “full support”. The opposition’s most important leader,María Corina Machado, made no immediate comment. However, many political and human rights activists have voiced perplexity and shock that the Venezuelan migrants being held in El Salvador – having been denied due process in the US and deported to an authoritarian foreign land – had become embroiled in the political tussle between strongman populists such as Trump, Bukele and Maduro. “The idea that there would be a [prisoner] trade should be loathsome to anyone who actually cares about human rights,” said Christopher Sabatini, a senior fellow for Latin America at Chatham House. Geoff Ramsey, a Venezuela expert from the Atlantic Council’s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, suspected the plight of the Venezuelans being held in El Salvador and Bukele’s prisoner swap “PR stunt” had potential benefits for both Bukele and Maduro. “Maduro’s quite happy to feud with Bukele and point to human rights abuses in El Salvador as a way of distracting from the brutal repression and violence of his own regime,” Ramsey said. According to the human rights group Foro Penal, Maduro’s jails currently house about 900 political prisoners. Thousands were imprisoned after last year’s election when Maduro, who has ruled since 2013, ordered acrackdownto stop his apparent victor, Edmundo González, from taking power. From Bukele’s perspective, offer was “a smart way of shifting the conversation away from concerns around the deportees being held in El Salvador back to the existence of political prisoners in Venezuela”, Ramsay said. For the migrants caught up in the geopolitical jailings, the consequences are calamitous. Many have not been convicted of any crime and it is unclear how long they will be held. In an interview last week, the wife of one Venezuelan prisoner, a singer called Arturo Suárez Trejo, lamented how the Venezuelan detainees seemed to have become part of a high-stakes game of chess. “And they are the pawns,” said Nathali Sánchez, rejecting claims that the father of her child was involved in crime. “It’s evil,” she added. The Trump administration’s targeting of Venezuelan migrants – who it has accused, largely without evidence, of being gang members and terrorists – has put Venezuela’s opposition in a difficult spot. Seemingly fearful of alienating Trump’s administration, its key leaders – including including Machado – have said little about the migration crackdown or the deportation of Venezuelan citizens to El Salvador. “[The opposition has] largely held its tongue on issues of the treatment of fellow citizens because of its larger goal of gaining the White House’s support for its preferred strategy [to defeat Maduro] and that also is reprehensible,” Sabatini said. Among the friends and families of the incarcerated migrants – many of them opposition supporters who fled Venezuela to escape Maduro’s regime – the opposition’s failure to defend them is causing anger and frustration. “The reality is that the Venezuelan opposition needs to have a good relationship with the White House, and they understand that they can’t be perceived as criticizing Trump,” said Ramsey. “But on the other hand, the general public in Venezuela is outraged at the situation faced by those who’ve been deported and sent to this maximum security jail in El Salvador. So it really puts the opposition in between a rock and a hard place.”",

    "title": "US citizen wrongfully arrested by border patrol in Arizona held for nearly 10 days",
    "article_text": "Immigrationofficials detained a US citizen for nearly 10 days inArizona, according to court records and press reports. As the NPR affiliate Arizona Public Media,first reported, 19-year-old Jose Hermosillo, a New Mexico resident visiting Arizona, was detained by border patrol agents in Nogales, a city along the Mexico border about an hour south of Tucson. According to a border patrolcriminal complaint, on 8 April, a border patrol official found Hermosillo “without the proper immigration documents” and claimed that the young American had admitted entering the US illegally from Mexico. Two days later, the federal court document notes that Hermosillo continued to claim he was a US citizen. On 17 April, a federal judgedismissedhis case. Hermosillo’s wrongful arrest and prolonged detention comes amid escalating attacks by the Trump administration on immigrants in the US. SinceDonald Trumptook office, theadministrationhas emboldened immigration officers to arrest and deport undocumented people, including foreign students whose visas have been revoked, leading to a series of errors. “Under the Trump administration’s theory of the law, the government could have banished this U.S. citizen to a Salvadoran prison then refused to do anything to bring him back,” Mark Joseph Stern, a legal analyst for Slate,wroteon Bluesky. “This is why the Constitution guarantees due process to all. Could it be more obvious?” During his campaign for the presidency, the US president promised to carry out “mass deportations”. In the three months since he took office, several foreign tourists have been wrongfully detained, federal agents from other agencies have been deputized to engage in immigration enforcement and Trump has invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, declaring that Venezuelan gang members are leading a foreign invasion of the United States to give himself the power to expel immigrants to a notorious Salvadorian prison. According to AZPM’s report, Hermosillo was visiting the Tucson area from Albuquerque, got lost without identification and was arrested by border patrol officials near its headquarters in Nogales. Hermosillo’s girlfriend’s family made numerous calls looking for him before they discovered he was being held atthe Florence correctional center, a privately run Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility. After his arrest, the court docket shows, he was temporarily detained in the custody of the US marshals. After the family tracked him down, they provided officials with his birth certificate and social security card. “He did say he was a US citizen, but they didn’t believe him,” Hermosillo’s girlfriend’s aunt told AZPM. “I think they would have kept him. I think they would have, if they would have not got that information yesterday in the court, and gave that to Ice and the border patrol. He probably would have been deported already toMexico.” Ice, Customs and Border Protection and Hermosillo’s attorney did not respond to requests for comment. But a senior official with the Department of Homeland Security rejected the allegations. “The narrative being pushed about Jose Hermosillo is false,” the official said via email. “On April 8, Hermosillo approached Border Patrol in Tucson and stated he had entered the U.S. illegally through Nogales. He said he wanted to turn himself in and completed a sworn statement identifying as a Mexican citizen who had entered unlawfully. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion “He was processed and appeared in court on April 10. Afterward, he was held by the U.S. Marshals in Florence, AZ. A few days later, his family presented documents showing U.S. citizenship. The charges were dismissed, and he was released to his family. “This arrest was the direct result of Hermosillo’s own actions and statements.” Federal magistrate judge Maria S Aguilera dismissed the case on 17 April. Hermosillo was released later that evening. Since Trump returned to office, there have been a rising number of US citizens detained by immigration officials around the country. But immigration officials’ detention of citizens is not new, and it has taken place across presidential administrations. In 2021, the Government Accountability Officefoundthat from 2015 through 2020, Ice arrested 674 US citizens and deported 70 of them. And from 2007 through 2015, 818 US citizens were held in immigration detention,according to a 2016 analysisfrom NPR. In recent months, the Trump administration has revoked the visas of hundreds of foreign students, many for taking part in Gaza solidarity protests the administration call antisemitic . Among those swept up in that crackdown is Aditya Wahyu Harsono,an Indonesian student in Minnesota, who is married to a US citizen, arrested at his hospital workplace this month after his visa was secretly revoked.",

    "title": "House Democrats land in El Salvador to push for return of Kilmar Ábrego García",
    "article_text": "A delegation of four HouseDemocratshas arrived inEl Salvadorto push for the release of Kilmar Ábrego García, part of a mission to challenge theTrump administration’s refusal to comply with a supreme court order to facilitate the return of the immigrant to the United States. Representatives Yassamin Ansari of Arizona, Maxine Dexter of Oregon, Maxwell Frost of Florida and Robert Garcia of California touched down in Central America on Sunday, following a visit by theMaryland senator Chris Van Hollenlast week. The lawmakers are seeking to meet with Ábrego García, who had lived in the US for more than a decade before being swept up in a 15 March operation. “Even with all of the illegal actions we’ve seen over the last couple of months, I think this is the one that terrifies me the most when it comes to the future of our democracy,” Ansari told the Associated Press in an interview. According to a congressional aide familiar with the arrangements, the delegation will meet with officials at the US embassy on Tuesday morning to advocate for Ábrego García’s release and ask about other individuals transferred from the US who are currently detained inEl Salvador. The lawmakers will also receive classified briefings during their visit. The case has become a flashpoint in the ongoing tensions between theTrump administrationand the supreme court, which ruled that the government had a duty to help return Ábrego García. Justice department lawyers have argued that they lack the power to secure his release from foreign custody. Garcia, the representative fromCalifornia, said that Ábrego García deserved due process. “They’re trying to demonize him, and we’re not here to defend him. He deserves due process, and everyone deserves due process,” Garcia told the AP. “What he did or may have done, that has to be decided by a judge.” Ábrego García, who had protected legal status that should have prevented his deportation, was sent to El Salvador on a plane carrying alleged immigrant gang members. He is currently being held in a prison in El Salvador after being moved from the country’s Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot), which has drawn praise from Republican lawmakers but criticism from human rights advocates for inhumane conditions. The Trump administration admitted in court filings that “an administrative error” led to Ábrego García’s deportation to El Salvador – despite a 2019 immigration judge’s order protecting him – but the same officials say they will not return him to his American wife and disabled child in Maryland. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt has defended the deportation, claiming Ábrego García was involved in human trafficking and terrorism, and said that if he were to return to the US, “he would immediately be deported again”. But the controversy has even drawn criticism from some Republicans, with Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana acknowledging on NBC’s Meet the Press that “the administration won’t admit it. But this was a screw-up.” As minority party members in both chambers of Congress,Democratshave limited leverage over the administration but are still determined on maintaining public pressure. Ansari indicated that more Democratic lawmakers plan to visit El Salvador in the coming weeks, saying: “This is about the future of our democracy and the future of due process as American citizens.” Ábrego GarcÍa’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, said in a statement on Monday that the lawmakers’ visit “sends a powerful message”. “We’re deeply grateful to the members of Congress and advocates for justice now on the ground in El Salvador, building on the leadership of Senator Van Hollen,” she said in the statement, according to NBC News. During a news conference from El Salvador on Monday afternoon, Frost told reporters that “due process applies to all people in our country”. “We demand the release of Ábrego García,” Frost said. “We’re also worried about our own constituents.” Frost added that the representatives had requested to see Ábrego García on Monday but that the request was denied by the Salvadorian government as it was not an official trip. Ansari added that the delegation met with the US embassy in El Salvador on Monday morning, and that they didn’t hear anything that gave her reason “to believe that the Trump administration is doing anything to facilitate his safe return home”. “And that is simply unacceptable,” she said, noting that they had just sent a letter to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, “demanding daily proof of life” from Ábrego García, that he has access to counsel, and that the administration return him to the US. Ansari said that this “isn’t just about Kilmar, it is the fact that our government is relentlessly going after any immigrants trying to come to the US, or in in US, without any regard for due process”. “They have not been convicted of a crime, they should not be imprisoned here,” she said. This article was amended on 21 April 2025 to say that Kilmar Ábrego García is now being held in a Salvadorian prison and no longer in Cecot.",

    "title": "Hurricane-hit Grenadians see climate change and reparations as one struggle",
    "article_text": "When category 4 Hurricane Berylhit the Caribbean last June, the three-island nation ofGrenadabore the brunt of its wrath. At the time, the country’s prime minister, Dickon Mitchell, described the destruction as “almost Armageddon-like”. On the small island ofCarriacou, it was estimated by officials that more than 90% of the buildings were damaged or destroyed. Agriculture and infrastructure for electricity and communication were almost completely wiped out. Nearly a year on, there are some signs of recovery and rebuilding, but hollowed-out buildings, roofless houses and charred, dying mangroves tell the story of a community that is still coming to grips with the devastation. Some people are still living in tents. Artists Michael Alexander and Yolanda VendenDunden pitched theirs on the foundations of one of the many houses demolished by the hurricane. VendenDunden had just moved to the island from the Netherlands when authorities announced Beryl was coming. The artists say the hurricane was much worse than they expected. “The roof started to shake, and the walls caved in. Yolanda passed out,” said Alexander. They survived, but they lost their home and many of their possessions. Suddenly homeless, they decided to live in the tent, with a makeshift bathroom and kitchen beside it. “I built up back the kitchen and bathroom from the pieces of the house and blocked it off so the lady could get privacy. And we sleep in the tent,” said Alexander. The tent gives them some privacy, but it gives them no refuge from the oppressive heat. And local farmers say that heat is causing droughts which are worse every year. Gifford Andrew, a farmer on Carriacou, said the combination of hurricanes and water shortages makes farming extremely challenging. “I lost everything in Beryl. Now I’m trying to put the pieces back together, but I have to deal with the drought. Every single year it’s worse, and it means a lot more water is needed to water my plot. It’s really hard,” he said. The triple whammy of hurricanes, drought and coastal erosion makes the island one of the starkest examples ofclimate crisischallenges, said the Carriacou government official and environmentalist Davon Baker. “The impact of climate change has been pretty severe. In addition to hurricanes, we are losing a lot of beach space to rising sea levels, and we are having extreme and intense dry seasons, which affect our farming and ability to produce food,” he said. In the face of these serious and multiple climate crisis-related threats, Grenada’s prime minister has been advocating for more support from rich countries, which he said had built their wealth by polluting the planet. Grenada last year joined other vulnerable countries ina landmark case at the international court of justicewhich seeks to hold polluting countries accountable for their roles in the climate crisis. At the same time as that push for climate accountability, Caribbean leaders have been stepping up their pursuit of reparatory justice over the centuries-long transatlantic slave trade, which saw more than 12.5 million Africans kidnapped, forcibly transported to theAmericasand sold into slavery. They argue that enslavement and colonisation are still having detrimental impacts on their countries’ social and economic development. Now some in the reparations movement are arguing that the two efforts are part of the same struggle. Arley Gill, the head of theGrenadaReparations Commission, has pointed said there was an “inescapable” link between the pursuit of justice for enslavement and justice for climate change. Gill argues that the Industrial Revolution is linked to both slavery and the climate crisis and that the Caribbean’s underdevelopment – itself a legacy of colonialism and enslavement – hampers the region’s ability to deal with the effects of the climate crisis. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion “Our climate change challenges can be traced to the Industrial Revolution. And the Industrial Revolution in Europe was fueled by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery. Black people were enslaved in the Caribbean to export cotton and sugar. These raw materials – which were then refined in the factories in Europe and consumed in Europe and sold all over the world – came from the very crimes of humanity which we speak of and for which we claim reparative justice. So that there is an inevitable link between reparative justice and climate change.” He added: “More than that, the harm which was caused by the Atlantic slave trade and slavery created a vulnerable environment in the Caribbean. In other words, we lack the resources to address the effects of climate change – and the reason we lack the resources is partly or mostly due to underdevelopment, which was caused by the Atlantic slave trade.” For people in Carriacou who are suffering the ill effects of the climate crisis, the issue has become a matter of survival. Sitting in his office in Carriacou, Tevin Andrews, the minister for Carriacou and Petite Martinique, described how he lost a close friend to Beryl. The island, he said, was surviving on hopes and prayers. “Every single year from July to December, we have to, as we say it in the Caribbean,‘ban our belly’ and pray to our God, hoping that nothing strikes us. So we know, first-hand, the experience of climate change, the rising temperature, the rise in sea levels and the devastation that is caused by hurricanes,” he said. Criticising the slow pace of action on the climate crisis and reparations, Andrews said rich countries “built their wealth on our backs, from our hard work and left us high and dry with no infrastructure, with no educational infrastructure”. The lack of engagement and action by richer countries and former colonisers “sends a clear message that really and truly they don’t care about us”, he said. “Their actions have us where we are. And we are going to continue to suffer. We are going to continue to get strong hurricanes. We are going to continue to lose our shorelines. Our islands will disappear.”",

    "title": "Indigenous river campaigner from Peru wins prestigious Goldman prize",
    "article_text": "An Indigenous campaigner and women’s leader from the Peruvian Amazon has been awarded the prestigious Goldmanprize for environmental activists,after leading a successful legal campaign that led to the river where her people, the Kukama, live being granted legal personhood. Mari Luz Canaquiri Murayari, 57, from the village of Shapajila on the Marañon River, led the Huaynakana Kamatahuara Kana (HKK) women’s association, supported by lawyers from Peru’s Legal Defence Institute, in a campaign to protect the river. After three years, judges in Loreto, Peru’s largest Amazon region, ruled in March 2024 that the Marañon had the right to be free-flowing and free of contamination, respecting anIndigenous worldview that regards a river as a living entity. It was a landmark ruling inPeru. The court in Iquitos, Loreto’s capital city, found the Peruvian government had violated the river’s inherent rights, and ordered it to take immediate action to prevent future oil spills into the waterway. The court also ruled that the government must mandate the creation of a protection plan for the entire river basin and recognise the Kukama community as its stewards. The government appealed against the decision, but the court upheld the ruling in October 2024. “She is the ‘mother of rivers’, the Marañon is born in the Andes and flows downstream to become the Amazon River,” Canaquiri said. The Kukama believe the river is sacred and that their ancestors’ spirits reside in its bed. for four decades, however, the Kukama have endured scores of oil spills which destroy fish stocks, damage the ecosystem and contaminate the water with heavy metals. The Peruvian state oil company Petroperú began building the theNorthern Peruvian pipelinein 1970s, and the region around the Marañon River has accounted for 40% of the county’s oil production since 2014 – with devastating effects. There have been more than 60 oil spills along the river since 1997, some of them catastrophic. “My grandparents taught me that there is a giant boa that lives in the river,Puragua, the ‘mother of the river’,”said Canaquiri. The spirit represents the health of the river and its personhood, according to the Kukama’s cosmovision. In practical terms, the Kukama depend on the river for transport, agriculture, water and fish, which is their main protein source. As a result of the the oil drilling, however, they have become highly vulnerable to water contamination. Local people have suffered from fevers, diarrhoea, skin rashes and miscarriages after oil spills, and elevated levels of lead, mercury, arsenic and cadmium were found in the blood of river community members in a2021 study. Canaquiri, a mother of four with six grandchildren, remembers a blissful childhood with abundant fish and animals before the oil drilling began. “There was plenty of food. We shared everything, worked on each other’s farms and celebrated the festivals together,” she said. Despite the ruling, the river is not out of danger and Canaquiri and the HKK are asking the Peruvian government to implement the court’s ruling. The fight continues. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Peru’s congress passed ananti-NGO lawlast month, which the country’s president, Dina Boluarte, approved last week. The law prevents civil society organisations from taking legal action or even giving legal counsel in cases against the state over human rights abuses. Canaquiri says the law could cripple their legal battle. “It is worrying because it means lawyers cannot take our cases to enforce our fundamental rights,” she said. “It is not just for us, it is also for the country and the world. Who can live without breathing? If it wasn’t for the Amazon, the forest, the rivers, we wouldn’t have clean air to breathe. How would we get food to eat every day, our fruits, our vegetables, our animals, our fish?” She says she and the HKK are motivated by the future of their children and grandchildren,: “The government needs to understand that it should not kill nature but protect it. Otherwise, what hope will our children, the next generation, have?",

    "title": "Boeing investors brace for fallout from Trump tariffs",
    "article_text": "Investors in Boeing are braced to learn the full impact of Donald Trump’s trade war, amid fears the US planemaker could be hit harder than first expected after jets intended for a Chinese airline were returned to the US. A Boeing 737 Max 8 plane intended for use by a Chinese airline returned to the US on Monday from Boeing’s China finishing centre, according to flight data cited by Reuters. It followed the arrival in the US on Sunday of another 737 Maxpainted in the livery of China’s Xiamen Airlinesat Boeing’s US production hub in Seattle. Boeing’s share price fell by nearly 3% on Monday, in line with a sell-off across Wall Street. US stock markets have been hit with much higher volatility this month as investors have tried to work out the effects of Trump’s tariffs. The aviation industry has been caught up in the trade war. Trump’s tariffs on goods from almost all countries have caused disruption across the world, but trade in goods between the US and China has been most affected, with levies of 145% on US imports and125% on goods going the other way. A new 737 Max has a market value of about $55m (£41.4m), according to IBA, an aviation consultancy. That makes a 125% tariff prohibitive without significantly changing the business model of the airline business. The return of the Boeing jets underlines the vulnerability to tariffs of the US’s biggest manufacturing exporter. It adds to Boeing’s problems just as it was trying to recover from a mid-air door panel blowout in January 2024 that prompted the company to replace its chief executive. Kelly Ortberg, whotook over Boeing after the safety crisis, will reveal the company’s first-quarter financial results on Wednesday. Analysts expect a significant improvement in sales compared with a year earlier, with revenues forecast to have risen 20% to $19.8bn, although they still expect losses of $466m for the quarter. However, the results are likely to be overshadowed by questions over the effect of tariffs on the business. Douglas Harned, an analyst at Bernstein, a research company, said he did not expect “definitive answers” on the tariff hit but was “concerned that risks are larger than expected” given airlines’ discomfort with paying tariffs, and possible delays to production to try to avoid levies. Harned said the pause on Chinese deliveries could hit cash generation in 2025, although he added that he expected the planes to be delivered eventually. Yet investors are having to contend with huge uncertainty over the White House’s intentions. Trump’s current policy is to raise tariffs on many countries after the end of a90-day “pause” on higher rates that excluded China, announced by the US president after market turmoil spread to the bond market. Richard Aboulafia, the managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy, said theTrump administrationhad showed a “profound and hard-earned level of ignorance” of how the aerospace industry works, and that long-term tariffs would be damaging for Boeing. Aboulafia said the short-term hit to Boeing’s cash should be relatively limited but added that the company should push back hard against Trump’s tariffs, particularly to avoid a “catastrophic trade war with the rest of the world”. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion For the Chinese market, “in the long term it starts to matter”, Aboulafia said. Chinese airlines are expected to account for as much as a fifth of new aircraft sales in one of the key markets for Boeing and its European rival Airbus. “You can’t just leave that to Airbus,” Aboulafia said. In a sign that the trade war could intensify beyond the US-China relationship, on Monday, Beijing warned it wouldtake “resolute and reciprocal” countermeasuresagainst other countries negotiating with the US if they made a deal at China’s expense. However, the rest of the world’s aviation industry may be less likely to be affected by countermeasures, given China’s reliance on US and European planes. Reuters reported that the 737 Max 8 landed in the US territory of Guam on Monday, after leaving Boeing’s Zhoushan completion centre near Shanghai, data from the flight-tracking website AirNav Radar showed. A spokesperson for Xiamen Airlines on Monday confirmed to Reuters that two planes marked for the carrier had gone to the US but declined to provide a reason. Boeing was approached for comment.",

    "title": "‘Propaganda’: Albanese mocks Russia’s ‘you have no cards’ warning to Australia",
    "article_text": "Russian warnings to Australia that “you have no cards” to stop Russian military activity in the Indo-Pacific have been mocked byAnthony Albanese, who has dismissed an incendiary letter from an ambassador as authoritarian “propaganda”. The unsubstantiated spectre of a proposed Russian military airbase on Indonesian territory has loomed over the past week of Australia’s federal election campaign, with the opposition accusing the government of obfuscating and dodging questions, and the government responding that the opposition had misrepresented the Indonesian government and actively fanned Russian propaganda. At the weekend the Russian ambassador to Indonesia, Sergei Tolchenov, had aletter publishedin Indonesia’s largest English-language newspaper, the Jakarta Post, warning that any proposal of a Russian base on Indonesian soil was none of Australia’s concern. “National interests cannot extend to the territory of neighbouring sovereign states that pursue active and independent policies,” Tolchenov wrote. “It is hard to imagine that any ordinary Australians should be concerned about what is happening 1300 kilometres from their territory, about matters that concern relations between other sovereign states and have nothing to do with Australia.” Tolchenov said Australia should be more concerned about the risk posed by its security ally, the US, particularly the stationing of US missiles and nuclear-powered submarines on its territory. He said Australia had no right nor influence to interfere with the “strictly bilateral” cooperation between Indonesia andRussia. He finished his letter “you have no cards” – pointedly quoting Donald Trump’s Oval Office upbraiding of Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter At a press conference on Monday morning, Albanese was again asked about reports – first published last week by the defence news websiteJanes– that Russia had filed an official request with Indonesia for permission for its military aircraftto be based out of an airbase on the island of Biak, in Indonesia’s easternmost Papua province. Biak is a little more than 1,300km from Darwin. The Australian government’s position has been that there is “no prospect” of a Russian military base being established on Indonesian soil, a position reaffirmed by the Indonesian government. “I’m anti-Russia,” Albanese said on Monday. “I’m not sure that everyone is on that page, but I think that Russia has very different values under an authoritarian leader. “I have no wish to help promote Russia’s propaganda messages and I would suggest that that is not in Australia’s national interest either.” Last week an Indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson, Rolliansyah Soemirat, said the government had not granted permission to any country to establish a military base on its territory. His statement did not mention if Russian had made a request. The domestic political debate in Australia has focused not on Indonesia’s repudiation of the prospect of the Russian aircraft being based in Indonesia but rather on whether Moscow made the request. The Australian government last week dismissed demands from the opposition for a security briefing on the reported Russian request, arguing that there was no critical or imminent decision that required consultation with the opposition under caretaker conventions. But the opposition leader,Peter Dutton, said government ministers had obfuscated, given inconsistent statements, and repeatedly refused to answer questions on the reported Russian request. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “I think the prime minister has ducked and weaved on this question,” Dutton said Monday. “The government’s language keeps changing. That seems strange. “We have asked for a briefing. It’s still not forthcoming from the government. What do they have to hide? I wish this prime minister could be open and honest with the Australian people.” In a significant campaign misstep last week, Dutton said it would be a “catastrophic failure of diplomatic relations” by the Labor government if it had not received notice of any Russian request before it was “publicly announced by the president of Indonesia”. He wasforced to later concedethat the Indonesian president had made no statement on the issue. Again on Monday, Albanese dismissed opposition demands for a briefing as unjustified, saying there was no prospect of a Russian base about which to brief. “I’m waiting for them [the opposition] to ask for a briefing on who faked the moon landing.” Indonesia’s new president,Prabowo Subianto, is far more internationally oriented than his predecessor, Joko Widodo, and, while he has repeatedly asserted Jakarta’s continued commitment to anon-aligned foreign policy, his actions have been seen as undermining that neutrality. Prabowo swiftly signed his nation on to the China- and Russia-led Brics developing nations group after his October inauguration, and has strengthened ties with Russia. He visited Russia’s President Vladimir Putin in Moscow last July – having won the election but before taking office – and will return in June this year as president. In November Indonesia and Russia conducted bilateral naval drills for the first time, undertaking exercises in Indonesian waters, in the Java Sea, near Surabaya. In the same month, Indonesia conducted military drills with Australia.",

    "title": "Vets exposing shocking animal welfare breaches at Australian export abattoirs face ‘enormous risk’",
    "article_text": "Lawyers and animal welfare advocates have urged the government to protect veterinarian whistleblowers who revealed shocking animal welfare breaches and oversight failures at Australia’s export abattoirs. The Australian government relies on a workforce of veterinarians placed inside export abattoirs to monitor animal welfare and food safety, largely to satisfy the requirements of major trading partners such as the US and EU. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter Guardian Australiarevealed on Saturdaythat whistleblower vets have repeatedly raised the alarm about profound problems with the system, including allegations that disturbing welfare breaches were going unreported to state regulators. In some cases, shocking incidents – including the mass death of 103 sheep from hypothermia during truck transport – were referred but not punished. Whistleblowers also alleged chronic understaffing was leaving abattoirs unmonitored for long stretches, and that recent restrictions on conducting ante-mortem inspections had made it impossible for them to properly monitor animal welfare. Leaked documents show repeated warnings about the system’s failings were made internally and externally – including through a formal complaint to the commonwealth ombudsman in 2019 by half the permanent government veterinarian workforce in New South Wales – and more recently through a detailed letter directly to then agriculture minister Murray Watt. The disclosures have prompted calls for the government to ensure the whistleblowers are protected from any future reprisal. The Human Rights Law Centre’s whistleblower project, a legal service assisting potential whistleblowers, said it had provided advice to a number of individuals wanting to “expose animal cruelty and related issues”. Its associate legal director Kieran Pender said the export abattoir revelations showed the importance of whistleblowers to “truth and transparency in Australia”. “When wrongdoing occurs behind closed doors, whistleblowers provide essential accountability,” he said. “Without whistleblowers exposing some of the most significant incidents of animal cruelty in the agriculture sector over the past few decades, considerable reforms and policy changes would not have been implemented.” He said speaking out about wrongdoing could carry “enormous risk” and that reforms were needed to improve protections and establish an independent body to guide and advise whistleblowers. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion “It’s critical that whistleblowers who speak up don’t face reprisal for shedding light on information that is so overwhelmingly in the public interest. Whistleblowers should be protected, not punished.” Animals Australia, an animal protection organisation, said it had been approached by whistleblowers who were fearful of repercussions for speaking out about welfare issues. “There must be stronger protections for whistleblowers,” Animals Australia’s legal counsel Shatha Hamade said. “Vets with professional and ethical integrity are being forced out of the system.” The agriculture department has rejected the allegations that its oversight of export abattoirs is compromised. A spokesperson rejected suggestions understaffing had left abattoirs unmonitored or that it had stopped vets from conducting up-close inspections of animals before slaughter. It declined to comment on individual complaints by whistleblowers. Labor hascommitted to increasing oversightof the sector if re-elected by expanding the remit of the inspector general for Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. It told the Australian Alliance for Animals that: “If re-elected, Labor will expand the role for the Inspector General to include export abattoirs to provide additional assurances to our trading partners, noting the responsibility of states in managing these sites.”",

    "title": "Netherlands a ‘cautionary tale’ for Coalition’s mortgage deduction scheme, expert warns",
    "article_text": "At the Coalition’s election campaign launch, weeks out from polling day,Peter Duttonannounced the centrepiece of his affordable housing plan – making mortgages tax deductible for some first home buyers. Unlike other housing measures announced during the campaign by the major parties, the deduction scheme had the potential to be an eye-catching policy that could sway voters towards theCoalitionon a central election issue. But those who have seen the deduction scheme in operation in comparable economies overseas, such as the Netherlands, say that while such measures can be popular with voters, it makes housing even more unaffordable. Cody Hochstenbach, an associate professor in urban geography at the University of Amsterdam, says the scheme has driven up home prices in the Netherlands, and weighs heavily on taxpayers, given it is a subsidy representing forgone revenue to the national budget. Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletter “I can’t really envisage why a country, except for short-term political reasons, would want to implement this because it’s such a terrible scheme and it’s difficult to get rid of it once it’s in place,” Hochstenbach says. “The Netherlands should serve as a cautionary tale: it’s not a good scheme.” The Coalition’s mortgage deduction scheme is designed to allow first home buyers to deduct aportion of the repaymentsfrom their taxable income if they buy a newly built home. It resembles the way investment properties operate, with owners allowed to deduct interest payments, but without capital gains tax. The Coalition expects it to apply to about 30,000 households annually, and has estimated it will cost about $1.25bn over the forward estimates, referring to the three-year cycle beyond the current budgeted 12 months. But industry estimates put the figurecloser to 60,000 households, creating a much bigger drag on the budget. “I recognise this tendency around the world of wanting to help first home buyers, and they typically come up with financial instruments to help,” Hochstenbach says. “That might help a select number of first home buyers but for the market overall it will push up prices, raise barriers of entry and doesn’t solve the problem given it only deepens mortgage debts.” The Coalition proposal is more targeted than some similar overseas schemes, given it is directed at first home buyers buying new homes, with deduction limits and salary restraints on who qualifies to use the scheme. Hochstenbach says while the restrictions would help Australia avoid some of the excess fallout experienced in countries such as the Netherlands, “you would expect the same mechanisms to apply, leading to house price increases”. Once implemented, there may be a strong political temptation to expand access to the scheme at a later date. Among the nations that have some form of home mortgage interest deduction, including Denmark, there is an accompanying debate on whether it should be reduced. While many of the schemes have been pared back over the years, they are almost always too politically unpalatable to remove altogether. Sign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025 Our Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion In the US, Republicans scaled back the program by capping the maximum value of new mortgage debt eligible for deduction in 2017. There has been talk the new Trump administration could get rid of the deduction altogether,saving $1tn over 10 years, although such a measure remains politically dangerous. Michael Fotheringham, the managing director at the AustralianHousingand Urban Research Institute, says Australians should take note of the US experience. “The most pertinent example is the US, where this has been used. What happens is people borrow more because they factor in the tax deduction,” Fotheringham says. “It is absolutely inflationary. It will push prices up.” In the week after the Coalition announcement took centre stage at thecampaign launch, election watchers noted it had already been relegated from show stopper to peripheral policy. Dutton only made apassing referenceto it at the second leaders’ debate, and it is regularly swept into a broad list of cost-of-living measures on the campaign trail. While economists have blastedthe housing policies of both major parties, the Coalition’s has received even more attention because it has less supply measures built into it than Labor’s. The University of Sydney media and politics senior lecturer Peter Chen says that as neither of the major parties have tackled the issue of housing affordability head on, they are unable to campaign effectively on their policies. “They have consistently nibbled around the edges of a major structural problem, and the concern is, everything you’re doing is simply inflationary,” Chen says. “The Coalition has ended up having a weak policy, and because housing is such [a topic of] conversation, it’s hard to kind of fake it.”",

    "title": "Mykola Bychok: the Melbourne bishop who will help choose the next pope",
    "article_text": "A 45-year-old Ukrainian-born Melbourne bishop who will be among the world’s top-ranking Catholic officials who will vote to select the next pope sayshe is filled with sadness over Pope Francis’s death. Mykola Bychok, Australia’s highest ranking Catholic official after Francis made him a cardinal late last year, is currently on his way to the Middle East for a pilgrimage but will travel on to Rome for the funeral and then the papal conclave. In a statement released on Monday night, Cardinal Bychok paid tribute to Francis as “a Pope for the marginalised and those on the periphery”. “He was a man of simple piety who strove to bring the church closer to people. His gave freely of his gifts and had a unique personal approach to all he met.” “Pope Francis was a Pope of peace. In a world devastated by war he called for peace and justice. I am grateful for the late Holy Father’s frequent appeals for a just peace in Ukraine and for the efforts of the Holy See that he oversaw, known and secret, that in some way helped bring relief to the imprisoned and suffering.” Bychok is the Catholic church’s youngest cardinal and the first Australian to be made cardinal since George Pell. He is also just the eighth cardinal from Australia. He will be one of about 135 cardinals from around the world eligible to take part in the conclave. “I also ask for your prayers for the Cardinal Electors that will be meeting in Conclave, that the Holy Spirit may enlighten our hearts and minds that we may choose a worthy candidate as the 267th Bishop of Rome and Successor of Saint Peter,” Bychok said. Bychok was born in the Ukrainian city of Ternopil, and entered a monastery after finishing high school, before becoming ordained as a priest in Lviv. He served as a priest in several countries including in Poland and the US, before moving toMelbournein January 2020 to serve as the Eparchy of Saints Peter and Paul of Melbourne, a Ukrainian Greek Catholic church. “He felt a calling to follow Christ at the age of 15, when he was in 9th grade,” a biography on his church’s website said. As a cardinal under the age of 80, Bychok will be one of the select few Catholic leaders who will gather in the Vatican in the coming weeks to vote in the papal conclave to choose the next pope. Pope Francis installed Bychok as a cardinal over other well-known Catholic leaders in Australia, such as the archbishop of Sydney, Anthony Fisher and his Melbourne counterpart, Peter Comensoli. At a ceremony at the Vatican in December when he was installed as a cardinal, Bychok said Francis spoke to him in Ukrainian when telling him “glory be to Jesus Christ”. “It was very a great moment for me, of support,” Bychok told the ABC. His installation as cardinal was celebrated by Catholics both in Australia and Ukraine. Bychok has spoken out about the plight of his native Ukraine since Russia’s 2022 invasion. “It is really a genocide of our people because Russia is in war mode, with army, with soldiers, and they are killing our people,” he told the ABC. In an Easter letter sent to congregants last week, Bychok urged Catholics who find themselves “in a world that often feels overwhelmed by uncertainty, suffering and division” to seek comfort from God. “We cannot celebrate [Easter] this year without turning our thoughts and prayers to our suffering homeland of Ukraine. The war continues to bring devastation, pain, and heartbreak,” he wrote. “Yet even here, in the shadow of the cross, we cling to the promise of the empty tomb. We live in hope that this unjust aggression will be brought to an end, and that a just and lasting peace will be established. As Pope Saint John Paul II once said, ‘Do not abandon yourselves to despair’.” He called for this Easter to bring “a new beginning”. “Let us rise with Christ in our hearts, ready to witness to the world that love is stronger than hate, that mercy is stronger than vengeance, and that life is stronger than death,” he said.",

    "title": "‘He was humble and close to the people’: Catholics pay respects to Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "Bill Nicoletti and his family, from Philadelphia, were among the thousands gathered in St Peter’s Square for Easter Sunday mass whenPope Francisarrived in his open-air popemobile. The vehicle cruised through the square, stopping occasionally for the pontiff to bless babies that were brought towards him, as the delighted crowd shouted “Viva il papa!” (Long live the pope!) At the end of the mass,Francis appeared from the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica to wish the crowd a happy Easter and give a blessing. He looked frail, and struggled to speak. His brief Easter message, which was read aloud on the balcony by an aide, reiterated his call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The next morning, Francis, 88, was dead. “I was so caught up in the moment that I didn’t think of his illness,” said Nicoletti, who returned to St Peter’s Square to pay his respects on Monday. “Then when my daughter called me this morning to say he had died, I was very surprised. To me it feels like it was a divine intervention – God wanted him to live until Easter, and then he left. It was a joyous day. I now feel sad but also moved to be here for his historic moment for the [Catholic] faith.” Francisdied on Mondaymorning. The pope’s remains will be transferred to St Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday, when the public will be able to pay tribute. As of Monday night, the date of his funeral had not been announced but papal funerals usually take place between four and six days after death. The canonisation ofthe Catholic church’s first millennial saint, Carlo Acutis, which had been scheduled for 27 April, has been suspended. Nicoletti, who also saw Franciswhen he visited Philadelphia in 2015, was among the thousands of pilgrims and tourists mourning the pope at St Peter’s Square. At around midday, the bells of the basilica rang out and the square fell almost silent. Father Jacopo Aprico was visiting Rome with a group of schoolchildren from Milan. They heard the news that the pope had died when they were on the train. “His death was expected because he had been so ill, but we were still surprised,” said Aprico. “He was only in this square yesterday. It is sad – you can never be prepared for someone’s death, regardless of how old or ill they might be.” Wilder Herrera was in Rome with his girlfriend, both from Colombia. He recalled seeing Francis, originally from Argentina, when he visited his hometown, close to Bogotá, in 2017. “We wanted to pay our respects,” said Herrera. “Francis was a great pope, someone who was very humble and close to the people.” Alice and her family were in Rome for the Easter weekend from Catania in Sicily. “It feels as if he wanted to wait for Easter Sunday to give his blessing and say goodbye,” she said. “Then he left us for heaven.” Francis, who almost died twice during his five-week hospitalisation, was discharged from Rome’s Gemelli hospital on 23 March and ordered by doctors to rest at home for at least two months. Although his official work duties were vastly scaled back, he madeseveral appearancesin recent weeks, the most daring being a visit to St Peter’s Basilica to thank the restorers finishing the restoration of the 17th century tomb of Pope Urban VIII. He alsoprivately metKing Charles and Queen Camilla during their recent state visit to Italy and on Maundy Thursday kept up the tradition of visiting inmates at Rome’s Regina Coeli prison. One of the last people to see him was the US vice-president, JD Vance, who was in the Italian capital for the Easter weekend andmet Francison Sunday morning, an encounter that was not previously scheduled. Francis hadalways pushed the limits throughout his 12-year papacy, so it was not surprising that he ventured out despite still being ill. He had embarked on more than 40 overseas trips during his time as pontiff, the longest and most arduous one being his four-country tour of Asia last September. His final overseas trip was to Corsica in December. Later that month he opened the Catholic Jubilee, a special year of forgiveness and reconciliation during which millions will travel to Rome. He maintained an intense schedule before being hospitalised in mid-February. Francis simplified rites for papal funerals last year and previously said he had already planned his tomb in the basilica Santa Maria Maggiore in the Esquilino neighbourhood in Rome, where he went to pray before and after trips overseas. Popes are usually buried with much fanfare in the grottoes beneath St Peter’s Basilica inVatican City. Amid intense mourning over the coming days and weeks, manoeuvring within theVaticanover who will succeed Francis will begin. A conclave must get under way within 20 days of the pope’s death. Mourners in St Peter’s Square are also contemplating his successor. “I hope the next pope will be a continuation of Francis’ papacy,” said Nicoletti.",

    "article_text": "Outraged skiers in northernSwedenclaim they should have been given a discount after finding more mud than snow on the slopes at a popular ski destination. Visitors complained of slush, water and damaged equipment because there was insufficient snow for skiing. The SkiStar resort in Sälen, which promotes itself as Sweden’s largest ski resort, is a popular domestic destination. It recently announced that it planned to increase its international appeal by launching direct flights from the UK. But many who visited last week said they should not have been charged full price because the conditions were unsuitable. “We’ve been here for a week now and we’ve been skiing for half a day, because there’s so much water and stuff,” Emelie Åkerstrand told the Swedish public broadcaster, SVT. Others complained their equipment had been destroyed by the conditions. Despite lifts and slopes being closed, visitors said they were still charged full price. “Where we went there was slush. We got stuck in puddles,” Filippa Fjällbäck told the Dagens Nyheter newspaper. Martin Isaacs added: “Despite the lack of skiable slopes, we had to pay full price. It feels wrong.” SkiStar said it had upheld its “snow guarantee”. “We have colleagues in the industry where some are offering lift passes and some have discounts. I can guess that it has to do with the snow guarantee and the ability to not achieve it and fulfil it, which we do with gusto,” said Anders Bjernulf, the destination manager at SkiStar Sälen. Global heating and increasingly unpredictable shorter winters have led to problems across Europe as ski resorts struggle to maintain the right conditions. In October, the French alpine ski resort Alpe du Grand Serre in Isèrewas forced to closebecause it could not afford to become a year-round destination to offset its shorter winter season. Others – including in Finland, Norway and Switzerland – are usingpurpose-built matsmade of extruded polystyrene, a material used for home insulation across the Nordics, to preserve snow. The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute reported the whole country was between 0.5 and 2C warmer this winter than the normal temperature between 1991 and 2020. The biggest difference was in the mountains of northern Lapland, where temperatures were about 4C higher than normal. Sofie Arnell, SkiStar’s chief legal officer, said: “Before purchasing a SkiPass, the customer takes note of our terms and conditions (including information about the snow guarantee and the possibility of rebooking or cancelling the SkiPass). This is also stated in the customer’s booking confirmation. “The customer always has the option to cancel the SkiPass with a full refund up until the first day of validity of the SkiPass. Open lifts and slopes are listed on our website and in our app. This information is updated several times a day.”",

    "article_text": "A group of pensioners nicknamed the “grandpa robbers” will go on trial in Paris next week, charged withstealing jewellery worth millions of euros from the US TV reality star Kim Kardashianwhen she attended Paris fashion week in 2016. In what was considered thebiggest robbery of an individual in France in 20 years, Kardashian was tied up and held hostage at gunpoint in her bedroom in central Paris by armed thieves dressed as police officers in the early hours of 3 October 2016. The thieves escaped with up to an estimated €10m in jewellery. At the time of the robbery, Kardashian was without security protection and sitting alone in her bedroom at an exclusive apartment building in centralParis, known as a “no address” site, where celebrities visiting Paris often rent sumptuous suites. Her bodyguard had instead accompanied her sister, the fellow reality TV star Kourtney Kardashian, to a Paris nightclub after the sisters had spent the day at major Paris fashion shows being photographed. Kardashian, 44, a billionaire celebrity influencer and business owner, later told the TV interviewer David Letterman she had feared she would be raped and murdered during the heist. She said of one of the burglars: “I saw him have a gun out for me, and I was like, OK, this is it. I kept on thinking about Kourtney, I kept on thinking she’s going to come home and I’m going to be dead in the room and she’s going to be traumatised for the rest of her life if she sees me … I thought that was my fate.” At that time, Kardashian routinely posted most of her daily movements and whereabouts on social media, where she also displayed her jewellery, including a large 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to her by her then husband, the rapperKanye West, which was estimated to be worth $4m. Those details on social media may have facilitated the thieves’ targeting of her. Kardashian later told a Forbes Power Women’s Summit the thieves had followed her movements on social media. “They knew my every move and what I had.” She said it had changed her approach to what she posted. Kardashian, who is now acriminal justice advocatein the US, will travel to give evidence at the Paris trial, which runs from 28 April to 23 May. A group of five armed men, all aged over 60, are alleged to have arrived by bicycle or on foot and impersonated police officers to enter the building just after 2am. After allegedly holding the concierge at gunpoint, they went to Kardashian’s apartment, where one man pulled a gun on her. Kardashian told police that the man spoke in “a very strong French accent” in English, telling her to hand over her diamond engagement ring. She was held at gunpoint, her arms and feet were tied and her mouth was taped. The men then fled the room in less than 10 minutes taking the ring and other jewels. Ten people will go on trial in Paris in connection with the heist, on charges including armed robbery, membership of a criminal gang, and kidnapping – which refers to Kardashian being held hostage at gunpoint. Eight deny any involvement. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion One of the accused, Yunice Abbas, now 71, has admitted his part in the heist saying he was part of the group who entered the building and he stood guard downstairs. He told TF1 TV inFranceon Sunday: “We were all grandads.” He said he had previously served 20 years in prison for robbery, had been out of prison for 10 years and was struggling to make ends meet. “I had a proposal for a big job, which would be my last … They told me there was a 20-carat diamond that wasn’t protected … That was tempting.” He said that, at the time, he had not known who they were robbing. “I was told it was the wife of a rapper. I didn’t ask questions.” He said: “I see her as a victim; we had nothing against her personally.” Aomar Ait Khedache, known as “Old Omar”, 68,has also admitted participating in the heist but denies the prosecution’s accusation that he was the ringleader. Of the 12 people originally charged over the robbery, only 10 will be present at the trial after one suspect died and another – Pierre Bouianere, 80 – was declared unable to participate in proceedings for health reasons. He will be tried separately. Most of the jewels were never recovered. At least one item was dropped by the thieves while escaping – a diamond-encrusted cross worth €30,000, which was found by a passerby as she went to work the next morning and handed to police.",

    "title": "Russia resumes fighting after ‘ceasefire’ Ukraine says Moscow breached nearly 3,000 times – as it happened",
    "article_text": "Russian military confirms ‘Easter truce’ is over and fighting has begun again as Ukrainian says Moscow launched 96 drones and three missiles overnight. This live blog is closed In a freshly issued statement, the Russian military has confirmed that its forces have resumed strikes onUkraineafter the surprise “Easter truce”. “With the end of the ceasefire, the armed forces of the Russian Federation continued to conduct the special military operation,” the Russian military said. The “special military operation” is what Russian officials call Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was launched by the Kremlin in February 2022. The Russian defence ministry claimed the country’s military “strictly observed the ceasefire and remained at the previously occupied lines and positions”. This stands in contrast from the ceasefire violations Ukraine has reported since the Easter truce was announced by Vladimir Putin on Saturday. Ukrainian forces reported nearly 3,000 violations of Russia’s ceasefire with the heaviest attacks and shelling seen along the Pokrovsk part of the frontline, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday. Ukraine’s military reported Russian drone attacks on several regions overnight, hours after the 30 hour “Easter ceasefire” declared byVladimir Putincame to an end. Ukraine’s air force said this morning that Russia launched 96 drones and three missiles in overnight attacks targetingUkraine, causing damage in theKharkiv,DnipropetrovskandCherkasyregions. Air raid alerts were reportedly activated inKyiv,Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy,MykolaivandZaporizhzhia. The Russian military subsequently confirmed that its forces had resumed strikes on Ukraine after the surprise “Easter truce”, which Putin called on Saturday for “humanitarian reasons”. “With the end of the ceasefire, the armed forces of the Russian federation continued to conduct the special military operation,” the Russian military said. The Russian defence ministry claimed the country’s military “strictly observed the ceasefire and remained at the previously occupied lines and positions”. Both Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of violating the ceasefire, with drone strikes and shelling. Ukrainian forces reported nearly 3,000 violations of Russia’s ceasefire with the heaviest attacks and shelling seen along thePokrovskpart of the frontline, Ukrainian presidentVolodymyr Zelenskyysaid on Monday. Russian attacks during the 30-hour Easter ceasefire over the weekend killed three people in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, a regional official said on Monday. The Kremlin said the Trump administration signalling that it is ruling out Nato membership for Ukraine gave Moscow a sense of “satisfaction”. Thanks for following along today. We are now closing this blog. You can read all our Ukraine coveragehere. Britain will significantly increase its ability to produce explosives so it no longer has to depend on the US and France for ammunition, the Times has reported. Here is some ofthe outlet’s story: Shipping containers will be erected at sites across the UK to produce RDX explosives, used in 155mm rounds for British Army guns and other weapons. BAE Systems, the UK defence company, is also looking to build three new sites to add “resilience” to the project, in case one site comes under attack… John Healey, the defence secretary, called the defence industry “the foundation of our ability to fight and win on the battlefield”. “Strengthening homegrown artillery production is an important step in learning the lessons from Ukraine, boosting our industrial resilience and making defence an engine for growth,” he said. My colleagueJennifer Rankinhas written an analysis piece about howViktor Orbán’shostile stance on Ukraine is straining Hungary’s relations with the EU. Here is an extractfrom her story: Hungary has repeatedly sought toblock EU sanctions against Russia, eventually backing down. It has vetoed the release of €6bn funds to reimburse other EU countries providing military aid to Ukraine and flatly refused to sign two EU declarations in support of its invaded neighbour. But now its attempts to stymie EU support for Ukraine could force a reckoning in its relations with the bloc at a moment when Orbán contends with his most serious political challenger in years. EU member states are considering more seriously than ever how to use their ultimate sanction against Hungary: the removal of voting rights under theEU treaty’s article 7. As we mentioned in the opening post of the blog, Ukraine’s military has reported Russian drone attacks on several regions overnight. Here is some more detail about the attacks, which came hours after the “Easter truce” - that was declared by Moscow over the weekend – ended. In theDnipropetrovskregion, Russian drones sparked a fire at an “outbuilding” and a “food enterprise,” regional administration head Serhii Lysak wrote on Telegram. No one was injured in the attack, he said. Meanwhile, an unspecified infrastructure object was damaged in theCherkasyregion overnight, regional head Ihor Taburets said. Blasts shook the Ukrainian port city ofMykolaiv, said its mayor, Oleksandr Senkevich. He did not say whether it was air defence systems in operation or bombs landing. Vladimir Putinhas signed a law ratifying a strategic partnership treaty with Iran, Russian state news agency RIA reported on Monday. Putin signed the 20-year strategic partnership pact with his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian, in January. TheKremlinspokespersonDmitry Peskovtold reporters on Monday thatRussiawould inform “all interested parties” about what he called Ukrainian violations of the ceasefire. Peskov said that Russia “remains open to searching for a peaceful settlement and is continuing to work with the American side,” adding that “we certainly hope that this work will produce results”. Ukrainian forces reported nearly 3,000 violations of Russia’s ceasefire with the heaviest attacks and shelling seen along the Pokrovsk part of the frontline. When Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion ofUkrainethree years ago, he demanded that Ukraine renounce joining Nato, sharply cut its army, and “protect” Russian language and culture to keep the country in Moscow’s orbit. Now, he also demands that Kyiv withdraw its forces from the four regions Moscow illegally annexed in September 2022 but never fully occupied —Donetsk,Luhansk,ZaporizhzhiaandKherson. Russian officials also have said that any peace deal should involve releasing Russian assets that were frozen in the west and lifting other US and EU sanctions. The Trump administration has proposed putting potential sanctions relief on the table. There are alsounconfirmed reportsthat the White House is considering recognising Russian control ofCrimeaas part of a broad US proposal to end the war in Ukraine. In February, the US defence secretaryPete Hegsethsaid thatNato membership for Ukraine was unrealistic and suggested Kyiv should abandon hopes of winning all its territory back from Russia and instead prepare for a negotiated peace settlement to be backed up by international troops. Hours later, US President Donald Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to begin negotiations on ending theUkrainewar. Trump has since threatened to abandon peace-making efforts in Ukraine as he has become frustrated with the lack of progress in negotiations, which are seen by many observers to be favouring Moscow over Kyiv. The Kremlin has said the Trump administration ruling out Nato membership forUkrainegave Moscow a sense of “satisfaction”. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made the comments in his regular media briefing with journalists. “We have heard from Washington at various levels that Ukraine’s membership in NATO is excluded,” he said. “Of course, this is something that causes our satisfaction and coincides with our position.” Peskov said that Ukrainian membership of the US-led alliance would “pose a threat to the national interests of the Russian Federation. And, in fact, this is one of the root causes of this conflict.” Ukraine has made membership of Nato a key strategic aim that it says would help protect the country in the event of future Russian aggression. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long questioned Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign country, has repeatedly opposed the idea of Ukraine joining the western alliance, which he sees as a security threat, expanding ever closer to its borders. As a reminder of developments over the weekend:Ukraineand Russia conducted a swap of more than 500 prisoners of war on Saturday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said on Telegram 277 Ukrainian service personnel had returned home fromRussiancaptivity. Russia’s defence ministry said 246 servicemen had been handed over by Kyiv. It said a further 31 injured prisoners of war had been handed over to Ukraine and 15 of its own injured servicemen had also been returned by Kyiv. Zelenskyy thanked the UAE for its mediation, saying a total of 4,552 Ukrainians – service personnel and civilians – had been returned since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. The Russian defence ministry said yesterday thatUkrainehad lost more than 75,000 soldiers and more than 400 tanks in total in Russia’sKurskregion. Military officials say they are continuing to repel Ukrainian soldiers in the region. We have not been able to independently verify either claim. Russia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that its forces had pushed Ukrainian troops from the village ofOleshnya, one of their last remaining footholds in the Kursk region. Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on X that Ukrainian forces “continued their activity on the territory of the Kursk region and are holding their positions”. The airborne assault forces of the armed forces of Ukraine said in a Facebook post that its soldiers have helped capture nine Russian servicemen in Russia’sKurskregion,where Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion last year. “Nine servicemen of the Russian army were taken by paratroopers and allied units in Kursk. The prisoners were provided with timely medical and psychological assistance,” the airborne assault forceswrote in the social media post, adding that the Russian soldiers had “surrendered to Ukrainian soldiers”. Luke Harding, a Guardian foreign correspondent,writes thatthe Easter ceasefire declaration came amid reports that the White House was ready to recognise Russian control ofCrimeaas part of a broad US proposal to end the war in Ukraine. Here is an extract from his piece: According tosources cited by Bloomberg, the US may be willing to give Putin a strategic victory and to accept Russian control over the peninsula. In 2014, Russian special forces seized Crimea, which Putin annexed after a sham referendum. US diplomatic recognition would violate the UN charter and the post-1945 consensus that countries cannot seize territory by force. Most states, including the UK, have refused to recognise Russia’s illegal takeover. The possible concession to Moscow from the White House is likely to provoke criticism from the US’s one-time European allies and a furious backlash in Ukraine. It comes asDonald Trump said on Friday the US may “move on” if no peace deal can be agreed… Talks over a settlement are due to continue this week in London. Leaks suggest the US is pushing for a Kremlin-friendly agreement that would see Russia keep occupied areas in the south and east of Ukraine, as well as Crimea. It is also considering lifting sanctions on Moscow and other “carrots”, the New York Post reported. By contrast, Trump has heaped pressure on Ukraine, in effect cutting off military assistance and demanding a share of the country’s lucrative mineral wealth. In a freshly issued statement, the Russian military has confirmed that its forces have resumed strikes onUkraineafter the surprise “Easter truce”. “With the end of the ceasefire, the armed forces of the Russian Federation continued to conduct the special military operation,” the Russian military said. The “special military operation” is what Russian officials call Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which was launched by the Kremlin in February 2022. The Russian defence ministry claimed the country’s military “strictly observed the ceasefire and remained at the previously occupied lines and positions”. This stands in contrast from the ceasefire violations Ukraine has reported since the Easter truce was announced by Vladimir Putin on Saturday. Ukrainian forces reported nearly 3,000 violations of Russia’s ceasefire with the heaviest attacks and shelling seen along the Pokrovsk part of the frontline, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Monday. In theKhersonregion, three people were killed and three injured in Russian attacks over the past day, its governor Oleksandr Prokudin reported in a post on Telegram. He said that Russian forces targeted residential areas and a store in the attacks. Among those killed in the Kherson region was a woman who was hit by a drone while walking down the street, according to Gyunduz Mamedov, a former deputy prosecutor general ofUkraine. We have not yet been able to independently verify these claims and reports. At least 3 people were killed in the Kherson region over the past day due to shelling & another 3 were injured. Among the dead is a woman struck by a drone while walking down the street. 4 more people were injured in the Donetsk region. Last night, Ukraine was attacked by 96…pic.twitter.com/lLm7n612Cl Welcome back to our live coverage of Russia’s war onUkraine. Ukraine’s military has reported Russian drone attacks on several regions overnight, hours after the 30 hour “Easter ceasefire” declared by Vladimir Putin came to an end. In a televised meeting with his commander-in-chief on Saturday, the Russian presidentsaidthe temporary ceasefire would last from 6pm Moscow time (4pm BST) on Saturday until midnight (10pm BST) on Sunday. Putin claimed he had ordered his forces to “stop all military activity” along the frontline during this window for “humanitarian reasons”. But both Kyiv and Moscow accused each other of violating the ceasefire, with drone strikes and shelling. Ukraine’s air force said today thatRussialaunched 96 drones and three missiles in overnight attacks targeting Ukraine, causing damage in the Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Cherkasy regions. Air defence units shot down 42 Russian drones, and another 47 drones were redirected by electronic warfare, the air force wrote in a post on Telegram. Air raid alerts have reportedly been activated in Kyiv, Kherson, Dnipropetrovsk, Cherkasy, Mykolaiv and Zaporizhzhia. There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damages from the attacks, regional Ukrainian officials said on social media. In some other developments: Volodymyr Zelenskyydismissed Vladimir Putin’s Easter ceasefire declarationas a fake “PR” exercise and said Russian troops hadcontinued their drone and artillery attacksacross many parts of the frontline on Sunday. He claimed Moscow had violated its own ceasefire thousands of times. Washington said it would welcome an extension of the truce, and Zelenskyy said Ukraine would pause strikes for 30 days. Putin, however, did not give orders to extend the 30 hour truce beyond Sunday. Donald Trumpused the situation to claim that a breakthrough was within a few days’ reach.“Hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week,” he posted on Sunday. “Both will then start to do big business with the United States of America, which is thriving, and make a fortune.” On Friday, Trump said he would end US peace efforts unless the two sides showed movement. Russia’sVoronezhregion that borders Ukraine was under air raid alerts for two hours overnight, the region’s governor said on Telegram. Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday that Ukrainian forces had shot at Russian positions 444 times and said it had counted more than 900 Ukrainian drone attacks, saying also that there were deaths and injuries among the civilian population.",

    "title": "Irish Freemasons apologise for hosting Conor McGregor interview at Dublin hall",
    "article_text": "The Freemasons of Ireland have apologised for hosting an interview betweenConor McGregorand the US commentator Tucker Carlson at the organisation’s premises in central Dublin. Philip Daley, the grand secretary of the IrishFreemasons, said the organisation regretted renting its hall for the event last week and would donate the fee to charity. Carlson, a former Fox News pundit, gave the former mixed martial arts champion who has become an outspoken critic of Irish and European immigration and asylum policies a platform to assail immigration and to promote his potential run for Ireland’s presidency in an election later this year. The 55-minute interview, recorded on 15 April, has been viewed more than 1.4m times on Carlson’s YouTube channel. It was the latest collaboration between rightwing US figures and McGregor, whom Donald Trumphosted at the White Houseon St Patrick’s Day. The Freemasons’ Hall, built in 1869, provided an elaborate, Victorian backdrop to the interview. In astatementat the weekend, Daley said the Freemasons routinely rented out the hall and took a booking from a US media company without initially knowing details of the event. “If the participants and content had been known the booking would not have been accepted. The Freemasons ofIrelandcategorically denies any association with the interviewer or interviewee and regrets that such an interview took place on our premises. We apologise to our members and confirm that steps have been taken to avoid a reoccurrence.” Daleytold RTÉthat the organisation learned details of the event about an hour before it took place. “When it came to my attention, I then debated with some of my colleagues. Would we cancel it or would we let it go ahead? And we decided in our wisdom that we just let it go,” he said. Daley said he allowed the interview to proceed after an assurance from Carlson’s company that all of the backgrounds would be blurred and that there would be no reference to the Freemasons’ Hall. Daley also said his organisation worried about a possible “backlash” if it cancelled the event. “In hindsight we’re not happy with that decision, I mean, look, we made a mistake, put my hands up, fully admit that.” Daley added: “I would not be a fan of Mr McGregor under any circumstances.” The fee, said to be between €1,000-€2,000, is to be donated to charity. In the interview, McGregor, said a corrupt governing elite was facilitating the “erasure” of Irish people and their identity.

    "title": "Berlin reports rise in attacks on refugees amid surge in far-right crime",
    "article_text": "Berlin has reported a marked increase in attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, amid a sharp rise in far-right crime and a hardening of German migration policy. Official figures provided at the request of two local Green party lawmakers showed there were 77 assaults on asylum seekers and refugees in 2024 and eight instances of deliberate damage to residences housing them. This compares with 32 targeted attacks on people and none on residences in 2023, one of the deputies, Ario Ebrahimpour Mirzaie, told the news agency dpa. As a result of the assaults, 34 people needed treatment in hospital, according to the official data. These included 16 women, 14 men, two girls and two males whose age was not reported. Thirty-seven suspects in the direct assaults on people were identified, 11 of whom were known to police. Authorities reported no concrete leads in the attacks on refugee shelters. Jian Omar, the other Green deputy who sought the publication of the statistics, called the report an “alarm bell”. “We demand a clear protection plan for refugees, a visible police presence at endangered residences, comprehensive prevention work and above all policies that clearly recognise rightwing violence and decisively fight it,” he said. Berlin has about 35,000 registered refugees in official reception centres and dormitories and a further 10,000 in emergency shelters, for example at the former Tegel and Tempelhof airports, where conditions have been often criticised as substandard and overcrowded. Officials from the state office for refugee affairs (LAF) told local media that all of its residences had plans in place to prevent violence, including round-the-clock security personnel at most facilities. Earlier this month, LAF reported a steep drop in the number of new arrivals in Berlin to 1,761 people in January and February, down more than 35% on the same period in 2024amid a decline across the European Union. Most arrivals in the German capital came from Vietnam, Moldova, Afghanistan, Turkey and Syria. Ukrainians, who are exempt from German asylum application requirements, also arrived in smaller numbers during the first two months of 2025, at 1,722. In January and February 2024, 2,611 Ukrainian citizens fleeing the Russian invasion sought refuge in Berlin. The figures mirror anational trend reported by the interior ministryin February revealing 218 “politically motivated” assaults on refugee shelters last year based on preliminary data, compared with 167 cases in 2023. Federal statistics on crimes against individual asylum seekers, however, showed a decline last year to 1,905, down from 2,488 in 2023 – the highest number since the 2016 refugee influx under the then chancellor,Angela Merkel. Clara Bünger, an MP for the far-left Linke party, which filed the request for the data, said the government needed to treat the problem urgently. Sign up toThis is Europe The most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environment after newsletter promotion “The number of insults, threats and attacks against refugees has been worryingly high for years and it is outrageous that these conditions are accepted with a shrug by many politicians and members of the public,” she said, blaming anti-migrant rhetoric among both far-right and mainstream parties. Bünger said those affected had come toGermanyseeking protection. “But what they find is racist hostility and violence. We must never simply get used to that.” In the town of Stahnsdorf, south-west of Berlin, in March, seven rightwing extremists allegedly tried to violently gain entry to a refugee shelter. When they were confronted by a security guard, they reportedly beat him, leaving him unconscious. Witnesses said that before the assault they heard a group outside the building chanting far-right slogans. German authorities recorded a jump in rightwing extremist crimes last year of more than 17%, with 33,963 reported offences until the end of November 2024 including 1,136 violent attacks. Annual figures will be released next month. The anti-immigration hard-rightAlternative für Deutschlandparty made strong gains in the February snap election to win more than 20% of the vote. It is now the strongest opposition force in parliament, fuelled bygrowing voter anxiety over immigration, particularly following aseries of violent attacksblamed on asylum seekers. The Conservative leader,Friedrich Merz, who is due to be sworn in as chancellor on 6 May, campaigned on dramatically tightening border policy and bringing irregular immigration to a halt, afterstricter measures already undertaken by the centre-left-led predecessor government. Acoalition deal with the centre-left Social Democratsreached this month watered down many of Merz’s stated aims, but laid out a range of tougher proposals including suspending family reunification for many refugees, coordinating with neighbour countries to stop asylum seekers at the frontier, and implementing plans for deportations to previously excluded countries such as Syria and Afghanistan.",

    "article_text": "Donald Trumpoffered public support for defense secretaryPete Hegsetha day after itemergedthat Hegseth had shared information about US strikes in Yemen last month in a secondSignal group chatthat included family, his personal lawyer and several top Pentagon aides. “He’s doing a great job. Ask the Houthis how he’s doing,” Trump said dismissively, referring to the rebel group inYementargeted by those missile strikes, on the sidelines of the White House Easter egg roll event on Monday. Hegseth was revealed to have shared, in a series of messages, plans about US strikes against the Houthis on 15 March before they happened in the Signal group chat that included his wife, his brother and a number of his top military aides. The details that Hegseth sent in were essentially the same information that heshared in a separate Signal group chatearlier this year that mistakenlyincluded the editor of the Atlanticin addition to JD Vance and other top Trump officials, a person directly familiar with the messages said. But pressure on Hegseth has so far come from people outside of the White House. Trump called the defense secretary on Sunday after the story broke and aides concluded that it had been leaked to the news media by a former Hegseth aide who was in the group chat but abruptly fired last week. Trump has resisted firing top officials in his second term, not wanting to be seen as caving to a media swarm even if he has been unhappy with the negative coverage. Trump alsostuck by his national security adviser, Mike Waltz, who had added the editor of the Atlantic to the first chat. According to a person familiar with the call, Trump told Hegseth that he had his support and that disgruntled leakers were to blame for the story, which was first reported by the New York Times. Trump also told his team to back Hegseth in public, and senior Trump aides repeated their defense line that none of the information shared in either of the group chats were classified, although the accusations have centered on why it was shared with Hegseth’s wife, for instance, since she is not a Pentagon official. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion The defense secretary himself appeared furious when asked about the second Signal chat during the White House Easter egg roll event on the South Lawn, telling reporters that the story was a “hit piece” that repeated his defense that it had been pushed by “disgruntled former employees”. But Hegseth faced growing pressure to resign after John Ullyot, his former spokesperson, wrote in an extraordinary opinion essay in Politico on Sunday that the Pentagon was “in disarray under Hegseth’s leadership”.

    "title": "Humanitarian agencies reject IDF claim Gaza medic killings caused by ‘professional failures’",
    "article_text": "The UN’s humanitarian agency, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) and Gaza’s civil defence service have rejected the findings of an Israeli military investigation that concluded the killings of 15 Palestinian medics and rescue workers in Rafah last month werecaused by “professional failures”. Eight PRCS paramedics, six members of the civil defence rescue agency and one employee of Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, were carrying out two rescue missions when they were shot and killed by Israeli troops in southern Gaza in the early hours of 23 March. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) at first claimed the medics’ vehicles were not using emergency signals when troops opened fire, butbacktracked after mobile phone footage emerged contradicting the account. On Sunday, it said an internal investigation had “identified several professional failures, breaches of orders, and a failure to fully report the incident”. Gaza’s civil defence agency, which rescues victims of airstrikes, dismissed the Israeli army report, accusing the military of lying in an attempt to justify targeting the rescue convoys. “The video filmed by one of the paramedics proves that the Israeli occupation’s narrative is false and demonstrates that it carried out summary executions,” Mohammed al-Mughair, a civil defence official, told Agence-France Presse on Monday, accusing Israel of seeking to “circumvent” its obligations under international law. Jonathan Whittall, the UN’s humanitarian chief for Gaza, said the investigation did not go far enough. “A lack of real accountability undermines international law and makes the world a more dangerous place,” he said. “Without accountability, we risk continuing to watch atrocities unfolding, and the norms designed to protect us all eroding.” Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the PRCS, said: “The report is full of lies. It is invalid and unacceptable, as it justifies the killing and shifts responsibility to a personal error in the field command when the truth is quite different.” The PRCS has previously called for an international investigation into the incident. Sunday’s IDF report said the deputy commander of the Golani Brigade would be dismissed owing to his responsibilities in the field and for “providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief”. Another commander, whose unit was also operating in the area, would be disciplined for “his overall responsibility for the incident”, the military said. According to the IDF, soldiers fired on the humanitarian workers travelling in ambulances and a fire truck because of “poor night visibility” and soldiers then violated orders by shooting at a UN vehicle which drove past 15 minutes later, resulting in the death of the driver. The bodies and vehicles were put in a sandy mass grave that could not be accessed by a UN retrieval team until several days later, after which the UN said the medics had been killed “one by one” and two witnesses claimed at least one victim had his hands and feet bound. Postmortem results released last weekshowed that the men were mostly killed by “gunshots to the head and torso”as well as injuries caused by explosives, and none of the victims had visible signs of restraint. The army denied in its report that there had been “indiscriminate fire” and maintained that six of the killed men were Hamas militants, allegations the humanitarian agencies involved deny. None of those killed were armed. During 18 months of war, Israeli forces have killed hundreds of medical workers and the staff of aid agencies and UN organisations in Gaza. In April last year, seven members of the charity World Central Kitchen died in a sustained Israeli attack on their clearly marked vehicles. Human rights organisations have long accused the Israeli military of a culture of impunity, with few soldiers ever facing justice. In 2023, fewer than 1% of complaints made against Israeli troops in the occupiedPalestinian territoriesended in a conviction, according to the latest US state department annual human rights report. Dan Owen, a researcher who analyses army data for the Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din, said the vast majority of incidents go unreported. The IDF is yet to respond to a Yesh Din request made in June 2024 under freedom of information laws regarding the number of investigations and indictments in cases in which soldiers are suspected of harming civilians in the war in Gaza. In August last year, the military said it had received approximately 1,000 complaints filed by lawyers and human rights groups related to the Gaza war, and had opened 74 investigations. Four concerned the deaths of Palestinians held in Israeli detention, eight concerned allegations of torture in prisons, and the rest were related to property damage and theft.",

    "title": "Netanyahu demanded loyalty before trying to fire me, Shin Bet chief claims",
    "article_text": "The director of Israel’s internal intelligence agency, Shin Bet, has alleged thatBenjamin Netanyahufired him for refusing to pledge his loyalty to the prime minister over the courts and use the agency to spy on anti-government protesters. The battle between Netanyahu andRonen Bar, the head of Shin Bet, has pushed Israel to the brink of a constitutional crisis, after the supreme court blocked a decision by the cabinet to dismiss Bar from his post – the first Shin Bet head to be fired. Bar had alleged that the decision to fire him was driven by Netanyahu’s “personal interests”. On Monday, Bar submitted an 31-page affidavit to the supreme court, which halted his firing last month. The affidavit detailed his version of the events that led to the breakdown of his relationship with Netanyahu and his dismissal. Some sections relating to national security were kept classified. Among the most serious allegations made in Bar’s affidavit was the claim that “on several occasions” Netanyahu explicitly told Shin Bet to conduct surveillance on citizens involved in anti-government protests, which he refused to do. Bar said the prime minister demanded the agency “provide details regarding the identities of Israeli citizens, protest activists” involved in any demonstrations against the Netanyahu government, and monitor those deemed to be “protest funders”. Bar also alleged that Netanyahu had made clear to him that in a constitutional crisis, his loyalty must be to the prime minister and not the high court of justice. He also said “an effort was made to coerce me” to sign a document that would have helped Netanyahu avoid publicly testifying in court in a corruption case against him, which Bar pushed back on. Bar alleged that Netanyahu would voice these demands at the ends of meetings, away from any official documentation. “It was clearly intended to prevent any record of the conversation,” said Bar. “To this day, the reason for my firing is not clear to me,” he wrote in the affidavit. “But, the developments that took place over the last few months indicate one thing: at some point late last year, the decision to fire me was consolidated. It was not rooted in any professional metric, but out of an expectation by Netanyahu that I would be personally loyal to him.” In the buildup to Monday’s submission to the courts, it was reported Bar had been put under immense pressure by Netanyahu’s government not to submit his affidavit. He had initially been due to submit it on Sunday, but requested an extra day. It was also leaked to Israeli media that Bar intended to resign in mid-May, which was immediately denied by Shin Bet. Netanyahu’s office hit back instantly at Bar’s allegations, calling them “a complete lie” and saying the “false affidavit” would be refuted. The government has until Thursday to submit its response to the courts. Netanyahu has said he had lost all trust in Bar’s capacity to lead Shin Bet and accused him of a conflict of interest and politicising the agency. Yair Lapid, the leader of the political opposition, said that Bar’s affidavit “proves that Netanyahu is a danger to Israeli security and cannot continue to serve as prime minister.” The relationship between Bar and Netanyahu had become increasingly acrimonious after the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas militants in southern Israel. In a report on the events, Shin Bet admitted the agency’s own failures but also criticised policies of the Netanyahu government that it said had enabled a buildup of Hamas in Gaza. Netanyahu has never accepted any responsibility for Israel’s worst national security disaster, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 251 being abducted and held hostage in Gaza. Bar’s authorisation for Shin Bet to open two investigations into Netanyahu’s close aides, including one forallegedly taking payments from Qatar to promote its interests in Israel, at the same time that Qatar was partly financing Hamas in Gaza, was said to only strengthen the prime minister’s animosity. With Netanyahu already facing a multitude of corruption charges in court, political opponents have alleged he wanted to remove Bar in order to sabotage the investigations. In his affidavit, Bar stood by the actions taken by Shin Bet. “The incitement that has accompanied the investigations, against me and all those tasked with protecting state secrets, demonstrates the connection between the investigations and the timing of my dismissal,” he said. On Sunday night, Shlomo Karhi, a minister in Netanyahu’s Likud party, told Israeli media that the courts should not be interfering with the cabinet decision to dismiss Bar. “Those who talk about the high court of justice, how it’s the be-all and end-all, what is democratic about that?” he said. In a press conference, Lapid condemned the direct threats of violence that Bar was facing for standing up to the Netanyahu government. “The level of incitement and insanity are without precedent,” he said. “The red line has been crossed. If we don’t stop this, there will be a political assassination, possibly more than one. Jews will kill Jews.”",

    "title": "Nepali-speaking Bhutanese refugees in limbo after deportation from US",
    "article_text": "When Narayan Kumar Subedi received a call from his daughter in the United States three weeks ago, he expected to hear news of his two children’s life abroad, perhaps even plans for a long-awaited reunion. Instead, he was told his 36-year-old son Ashish, a Bhutanese refugee resettled in the US, was being deported. Ashish had been caught in a domestic dispute that led to police involvement. After several days in detention without proper legal support, he was caught up inDonald Trump’s migration crackdownand deported to Bhutan. But what followed was a surreal sequence of events that left Ashish and nine other Bhutanese refugees stateless: abandoned by the country they once fled, expelled by the one they tried to call home, and detained by the one they sought refuge in. Narayan was one of 100,000 Nepali-speaking Bhutanese whofled the country in the early 1990sto escape persecution. Many saw emigration as the only hope for a future. Narayan’s children were granted refugee status in the US, but Narayan himself was disqualified over paperwork errors and he still lives in the Beldangi refugee camp in eastern Nepal. Now, decades later, his son is back – but not welcomed by Bhutan, nor recognized inNepal. According to Nepal’s director general of immigration, Govinda Prasad Rijal, four of the 10 deported Bhutanese refugees, including Ashish, were taken into custody for entering Nepal illegally via India. “They were taken from the refugee camp on 28 March because they had entered Nepal without valid visas,” he said. “Since the matter is still under investigation, we have not decided whether they will be deported to India, returned to Bhutan, or what other action might be taken.” However, after the family filed a habeas corpus petition in Nepal’s supreme court, the court issued an order to produce them before the court on 24 April and not to deport them until then. Ashish and nine others were first flown from the US to Delhi, where they were reportedly treated well and even put up in a hotel during transit. The following day, they were flown to Paro international airport in Bhutan. There, according to Ashish’s father, the Bhutanese government welcomed them courteously but didn’t allow them to stay long. After routine questioning, the group was handed 30,000 Indian rupees each and transported to the Indian border town of Phuentsholing. Within 24 hours, they were out of Bhutan again. “The fact that Bhutan accepted them from the United States shows an acknowledgment of their citizenship. But deporting them to the Indian border within a day reveals a deceptive character,” said Dr Gopal Krishna Shiwakoti, former chair of the Asia Pacific Rights Network. “It’s strange in itself to send them to a country that had earlier refused to recognize them as its citizens, leading the US to resettle them in a third country.” From Phuentsholing, the group made its way to Nepal through Indian intermediaries. Later, Ashish and his friends Santosh Darji, Roshan Tamang and Ashok Gurung were detained by Nepalese authorities. “I was shocked,” Narayan says. “To be treated like a criminal in your own refugee camp, after all these years … it breaks you.” Nepal has no comprehensive legal framework addressing refugee protection or statelessness. That leaves people like Ashish in legal limbo – neither welcomed back by Bhutan nor recognized as refugees in Nepal. Tulsi Bhattarai, the immigration officer leading the investigation, confirmed that four of the 10 individuals were in custody. “Their statements confirm they entered Nepal from Bhutan via India,” he said. “We’ve collected documents from their time in the refugee camps and submitted a full report.” Activists argue the situation echoes the early days of the 1990s refugee crisis. “We’ve come full circle,” says Shiwakoti. “This is a 360-degree repeat of history. Nepal must urgently initiate diplomatic engagement with Bhutan to resolve this issue.” From 2007 to 2018, more than 113,000 Bhutanese refugees were resettled in third countries, mainly the US, according to the UNHCR. But about 6,500 still remain in camps in Nepal, caught in a state of indefinite limbo. Now, for deportees like Ashish, a new crisis is unfolding. International rights groups are raising alarm. In a joint statement, Bhutanese political and civil society leaders have appealed to the United Nations, the US and Indian embassies, and the government of Nepal for intervention. Their core demand is that the 10 deported individuals be recognized as Bhutanese nationals and protected under international refugee law. “These people are not just numbers. They have histories, identities and rights,” says Ram Karki, coordinator of the Global Campaign for the Release of Political Prisoners in Bhutan (GCRPPB). Back in Beldangi, Narayan waits. His son remains in custody, with uncertain future. “I just want my son to be free,” he adds. “We lost our country once. Must we lose it again?”",

    "title": "Ministers privately ruling out scrapping two-child benefits cap",
    "article_text": "Ministers are privately ruling out scrapping the two-child benefit cap despite warnings from charities that a failure to do so could result in the highest levels of child poverty since records began. Government sources said charities and Labour MPs who were concerned that wider benefit cuts would push more families into poverty should “read the tea leaves” over Labour’s plans. “If they still think we’re going to scrap the cap then they’re listening to the wrong people. We’re simply not going to find a way to do that. The cap is popular with key voters, who see it as a matter of fairness,” one source said. In a letter toKeir Starmeron Tuesday, groups including Barnardo’s, Save the Children UK and Citizens Advice said scrapping the two-child benefit limit would be the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty. The ChildPovertyAction Group, which signed the letter, estimated the number of children in poverty would increase from 4.5 million to 4.8 million by 2029 unless urgent action is taken. The government is planning to publish its long-awaited child poverty strategy in June, around the time of the spending review, raising expectations the plan will come with funding attached to try to drive down poverty levels. The government is also launching its policy of introducing free breakfast clubs into all primary schools in England as part of an initiative to reduce child poverty. The first 750 clubs, providing 30 minutes of morning childcare, open on Tuesday as part of a trial before a national rollout. Ministers said the extra time could save parents £450 a year, if their child went every day, with up to £7,500 more saved by the provision of 30 hours of free childcare per week from September, up from 15 hours a week. The breakfast clubs policy is being promoted not only as a way to improve school attendance, educational performance and attainment, but also as a primary lever for reducing poverty, with 67,000 of the 180,000 pupils set to benefit coming from the most dis­advantaged areas of England. But Labour MPs said while they strongly supported breakfast clubs, they remained concerned the two-child cap, along with wider cuts to disability benefits, would drive more families with children into poverty. “Ditching the cap is by far the most effective way of tackling child poverty. We have a moral obligation to do this,” one MP said. “I’m afraid they’ll use the breakfast clubs to soften us up to tell us the two-child benefit cap remains.” Ministers are still looking at ways to alleviate the impact of the two-child limit for universal credit or child tax credit, imposed by the Conservatives in 2017, without spending the £3.6bn required to remove it entirely. Among the options is applying the limit only to those with children who are five and over, exempting parents of disabled children or parents in work, and increasing child benefit payments for parents of young children. A separate proposal for a three-child limit has also been discussed. Charities have called for Labour ministers to ditch the benefits restriction as part of the child poverty plan, warning that a failure to do could mean child poverty levels soaring by the end of this parliament. In their letter to Starmer, they said: “Scrapping the two-child limit is by far the most cost-effective way to reduce child poverty. It would lift 350,000 children out of poverty overnight and result in 700,000 children living in less deep poverty. “If it is not scrapped, the stark reality is that child poverty will be significantly higher at the end of this parliament than when the government took office, making this the first time a Labour government would leave such a legacy.” However, aides said there was little political appetite within No 10 to lift the cap entirely, with polls suggesting that voters support it. Others have suggested the tight fiscal circumstances mean ministers will not change track, despite some feeling the limit is overly punitive.",

    "title": "Travel body accuses government of ‘sabotaging’ UK tourism industry",
    "article_text": "The government has been accused of “sabotaging” the UK’s tourism industry, after figures showed international visitors spent more than £2bn less last year than they did before the pandemic. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) – which found in a new study that people visiting the UK spent £40.3bn in 2024, down 5.3% on 2019 – said that the government has made “deliberate policy choices” that had created “barriers to travel”. The policies singled out include the lack of tax-free shopping, increasing air passenger duty and introducing electronic travel authorisations. “We’ve not got back to where we need to be [on spending by international visitors] whereas the rest of the world has,” said Julia Simpson, the president of the WTTC, a former adviser to Sir Tony Blair during his time as prime minister. Simpson said: “This government isall about growth. Yet here we have a private sector enterprise, travel and tourism, contributing 10% of UK GDP, creating jobs, but we are not prioritising it in any way. We are sabotaging ourselves.” Retailers including the boss of luxury brand Burberry have said that the scrapping of a VAT tax break for tourists has put the UK at a“competitive disadvantage for global shoppers”. “The UK is losing value share compared to other European partners,” said Simpson, speaking to the Press Association. She also criticised the decision to cut tourism authority VisitBritain’s budget by 44% this year. On 1 April, VisitBritain’s “Great Britain and Northern Ireland” destination promotion programme budget was cut to £10.57m, from £18.85m last year. On the same day, air passenger duty for many visitors to the UK increased. A day later, the requirement for the £10 electronic travel authorisation (ETA) was imposed on all European visitors, apart from the Irish, and has since increased to £16. “You need to sell the UK,” said Simpson. “It’s really important that you create stories about the UK so that international visitors come to all our regions. You need to sell Harry Potter. You need to sell Jane Austen. You need to sell Richard III.” A government spokesperson said that VisitBritain’s campaign “remains an effective tool driving economic growth”. “The UK is one of the most visited countries in the world and international tourism drives billions into our economy,” said the spokesperson. “We are supporting the continued growth of this industry and will be launching a national visitor economy strategy this autumn to help meet our ambition to welcome 50 million international visitors a year to the UK by 2030.” The WTTC study, produced in collaboration with consultancy OxfordEconomics, also found that travel and tourism contributed £286bn to the UK’s economy in 2024, up 3.9% from 2019.",

    "title": "Keir Starmer to seek to bolster defence ties as he hosts New Zealand PM",
    "article_text": "Keir Starmer will seek to strengthen the UK’s defence ties with New Zealand when he hosts the country’s prime minister on Tuesday. When he meetsChristopher Luxon, Starmer will discuss extending a training programme for Ukrainian troops run by the two countries and agree a new £30m weapons deal. The meeting comes before a London gathering of British, French, German, Ukrainian and US officials on Wednesday. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, is also expected to attend. French officials said the five countries held an “excellent” day of talks in Paris last week, with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, urging those present to put pressure on Moscow to end the fighting. Britain and France, backed by a “coalition of the willing”, have already proposed providing a “reassurance” force for Ukraine in the event of a ceasefire, but the US has so far held off its support. After last Thursday’s meeting, Zelenskyy expressed frustration that the US envoy had “taken on the strategy of the Russian side”. Luxon and Starmer are expected to visit a military base on Wednesday to see British andNew Zealandpersonnel train Ukrainian troops as part of the UK’s Operation Interflex. More than 54,000 Ukrainians have already received training, and Luxon is expected to confirm on Tuesday that New Zealand will extend its support for the programme until the end of the year. In a further show of support for Ukraine, Starmer is expected to announce a deal worth £30m for drones produced by Syos Aerospace, a New Zealand company with a factory in Hampshire. Drones have become increasingly important over the course of the war in Ukraine, and now account for more battlefield casualties than artillery. The pair will also instruct their defence ministers to begin work on a new defence partnership between the UK and New Zealand, replacing the one signed in 2015. The UK and New Zealand have longstanding defence links. Both nations belong to the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network, and the New Zealand navy is providing a frigate, HMNZS Te Kaha, for the UK carrier strike group scheduled to set sail for the Indian Ocean from Portsmouth on Tuesday. Starmer will say: “From the beaches of Gallipoli to the vital work we have been doing together on Operation Interflex and our support for Ukraine, the UK and New Zealand have stood shoulder to shoulder for generations in pursuit of peace and stability. “As the world becomes an increasingly dangerous place, I am proud how much we are doing together to support our national and economic security – stepping up our defence spending, deploying our navies together in the Indo-Pacific, and continuing our work to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to deter an increasingly aggressive Russia.”",

    "article_text": "Three men have been charged with manslaughter after a woman was fatally struck on a golf course by a van following a police pursuit. Suzanne Cherry, 62, died in hospital on 15 April, four days after she was struck by a van at Aston Wood golf club in Lichfield, Staffordshire. The grey Nissan van involved in the incident was being pursued by police after reports of suspicious activity. John McDonald, 51, has been charged with manslaughter, assault by beating and failing to stop a vehicle when directed by a constable, according to West Midlands police. Johnny McDonald, 22, and Brett Delaney, 34, have also been charged with manslaughter. Cherry’s husband described watching in “helpless horror” as his wife was hit by the van while out enjoying one of her favourite hobbies. “Suzanne had an amazing and infectious zest for life which touched everyone who was fortunate enough to know her,” he said. “She was unselfish, always ready to encourage with love and support those around her to achieve more than they themselves thought possible. “Suzanne leaves a legacy and an unfillable void in the lives of her mother, Maureen, her three adult children, two stepchildren and countless others from her work, her sporting activities and social circle. “Sue was loved, and will be painfully missed by her entire family and friends. We ask that our privacy at this difficult time be respected.” Three other men who were previously arrested in connection with the investigation have been bailed with conditions. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is continuing to investigate the circumstances prior to the collision. Staffordshire police said on Monday evening the three charged were due at a plea hearing at Stafford crown court on 23 May.",

    "article_text": "Pack an umbrella, sunglasses and a warm coat is the message from forecasters who have said the weather is expected to be changeable this week with rain continuing across the UK after the previous dry spell. Much of the country will have alternating sunny spells and showers over the next few days and temperatures will be within the seasonal average of 14C (57F) to 18C (64F). Met Office meteorologist Dan Stroud said the rain was “welcome news” as rainfall figures for April had so far remained below the amount expected for this time of year. Stroud added: “Changeable probably sums it [the weather] up nicely. “The rain is going to be fairly welcome news for the gardeners, because it’s been actually very dry up until now. [For] April to date, rainfall figures are well below where they should be.” The average rainfall figure for April nationally is 71mm but the UK has only had 27.2mm so far, or 38% of the April average. Tuesday is expected to get off to a chilly start with a lot of dry and fine weather between a few isolated showers. Stroud added: “It will cloud over from the west late in the day, with a band of heavy rain and strong and gusty winds arriving across England and Wales, pushing into Northern Ireland, southern Scotland during the overnight period into Wednesday morning. “That air of rain is not hanging around, it’s actually moving quite quickly south and eastwards across the country. “So conditions will improve significantly during the course of the afternoon. “Sunny spells and showers is the name of the game on Wednesday afternoon, and that leads quite nicely into a generally dry and settled spell of weather on Thursday. “But that too will be very short lived, with another band of cloud and rain slowly edging in from the west towards the end of the week, and more especially next weekend.” The driest and brightest skies will be in the eastern parts of the country, while it will be wet and cloudy in parts of Wales, central southern England and Northern Ireland. The UK has had one of the worst wildfire seasons on record following one of the driest Marches in decades combined with warmer than average temperatures in April. Abergwesyn Common in Powys, Wales wasconsumed by a 1,600 hectare (3,950 acre) fire, an area roughly 400 times the size of Cardiff’s Principality Stadium. Last week, Wales’s three fire services said they had responded to more than 1,300 grass fires this year. On the Mourne Mountains in Northern Ireland, recent fires scorched land used by wildlife including small heath butterflies, rove beetles, skylarks and peregrine falcons. At Howden Moor in the Peak District, the National Trust said a recent fire that stretched for about three miles had caused £30,000 worth of damage.",

    "article_text": "The family of a 21-year-old student who was shot and stabbed while cycling home after watching a football match 10 years ago has renewed an appeal for the public’s help to find those responsible. Ola Raji had spent the evening at a friend’s house watching a Champions League match between Bayern Munich and Porto before he was killed in Peckham, southLondonon the night of Tuesday 21 April 2015. He had been cycling on the East Surrey Grove estate, near Commercial Way, when he was stabbed and shot in an attack by two men. He later died in hospital. Raji’s sisters, Zainab Raji and Ruki Ware, said the anniversary of their brother’s death was “a painful reminder of 10 years of loss”. “Our family is not going to get that time back,” they said in an appeal. The independent charity Crimestoppers is offering a reward of up to £20,000 for information that leads to the identification and prosecution of those responsible for the murder. TheMetropolitan policesaid it was interested in speaking to witnesses, including a woman driving a black Vauxhall Corsa in the area between 21.45 and 23.00, and two men “who returned to an address in Pear Court at 23.10”. In an appeal for information, Raji’s sisters said: “When we get together, there is always that sense of something missing. There are children who never get to know their uncle, who would still be so young even now. The laughter we share is that little less loud. There is a smile absent in the photographs. “But this is not just about our family. It’s about safety on the streets of Peckham and the wider south London area. There is no doubt the people who did this once could carry out similar attacks again. Maybe they already have. “We are getting closer to the truth – for example, we now know about phone calls Ola received shortly before the attack. Just the smallest piece of evidence from any witnesses or those with knowledge of what happened could be enough to put those responsible behind bars and make the streets safer for the entire community.” The pair told MailOnline last week that they had found two new witnesses after being forced to investigate the crime themselves due to police failings. DCI Alex Gammampila, who is leading the investigation, said: “Ola was an innocent man, in the wrong place at the worst time. His murder has devastated his friends and family, and those in the local community. “Ten years on, we continue to appeal for anyone who has any information to come forward. “Were you out in Peckham that night? Were you also watching the football that night, or were you near Commercial Way? Did you see or hear the shooting or anything that struck you as being unusual? “No piece of information is too small, and could be the final piece of the puzzle that leads us to identify Ola’s attackers.” Alexa Loukas, London regional manager at Crimestoppers, said Raji’s death was “deeply unsettling for his loved ones and the local community”. Detectives are continuing to investigate the possibility that Raji’s attackers left the scene on foot, the Met said. Three individuals were arrested on suspicion of murder, and a further two individuals were arrested for perverting the course of justice but no further action was taken against them and no criminal charges were ever brought. Anyone with information should call 101, giving the reference 2597/16APR25, or upload information, including photos or videos, to thededicated appeal page.",

    "article_text": "A purse belonging toDonald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security secretary,Kristi Noem, that contained $3,000 in cash, her passport, driver’s license and her apartment keys was stolen while she ate dinner at a restaurant in downtown Washington on Sunday night. The secretary revealed the theft to reporters at the White House Easter egg roll on Monday. Noem said the incident remained unresolved. The Metropolitan police department in Washington on Monday referred questions to the homeland security department. The Secret Service also referred a request for comment to the department. The DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statementemailedto the New York Times, the department said: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren. She was using the cash withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities and Easter gifts.” Noem, who oversees a department that is charged with securing the nation’s borders and its homeland, is protected by Secret Service agents.NBC News,citing a source who witnessed the meal, reported that “at least two on-duty plainclothes members of the US Secret Service” were seated at the restaurant’s bar. The Secret Service is among the agencies housed within the department, along with Fema and the Coast Guard. It is unclear whether Noem, a high-profile cabinet official who is tasked with carrying out Trump’s mass deportation campaign, was targeted or if the incident was random. According to CNN,which first reported the incident, a Secret Service review of security camera footage from the restaurant showed an “unknown white male wearing a medical mask steal her bag and leave the restaurant”. Asked about the theft, Noem told reporters on Monday: “I don’t think I can comment on it yet. It’s not resolved yet.” Noem has aggressively pushed Trump’s hardline approach to immigration enforcement, recentlytravelingto El Salvador, where she wascriticizedfor touring a notoriousmaximum-security prisonthat is holding hundreds ofVenezuelansdeported from the US earlier this month. That includes a Maryland man the administration deported in error and is declining to bring back, despite the supreme court unanimously ruling that the government should “facilitate” his return. While there, Noemfilmed a videoof herself in front of a cell packed with prisoners, warning undocumented immigrants living in the US that “you could end up in this El Salvadorian prison”. On social media, critics assailed the secretary’s message – but also forthe flashy accessorywrapping her wrist: a gold Rolex watch that sells forabout $50,000. Prior to joining theTrump administration, Noem was the governor of South Dakota and previously represented the state in the US House of Representatives.",

    "title": "US stock markets fall again as Trump calls Fed chair ‘a major loser’",
    "article_text": "US stock markets fell again on Monday asDonald Trumpcontinued attacks against the Federal Reserve chair,Jerome Powell, who the US president called “a major loser” for not lowering interest rates. “There can be a slowing of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,” Trump wrote on social media. In recent days, Trump has amped up attacks against the Fed chair,pushingPowell to lower interest rates to offset the inflationary impacts of thenew tariffs. Trump is pressuring the Fed to cut rates, likely to appease the stock market, which plummeted after he announced his newest slate of tariffs. But Wall Street isn’t taking the bait and appears to be reacting in opposition to Trump’s attacks against Powell and the independence of the US central bank. The Dow ended the day down 2.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell over 2.5% down and the S&P 500 fell 2.4%. Former tech stocks favorites including Tesla and Nvidia lost ground, while the value of the dollar fell to multiyear lows against most major currencies. Stock markets had recovered the losses they endured after Trump rolled out his“liberation day” tariffsproposals, which would have imposed huge levies on all of the US’s trading partners. But almost all the gains made in the stock market following Trump’s announcement of a90-day pauseof his so-called reciprocal tariffs have been erased amid these new jabs against Powell. Powell, known to be extremely measured in his public remarks, has in recent weeks spoken out about Trump’s tariffs and warned that they may lead to a “challenging scenario” for the Fed, implying that the Fed has no plans to cut interest rates anytime soon. “Tariffs are highly likely to generate at least a temporary rise in inflation. The inflation effects could also be more persistent,” Powelltold reporters on 16 April. US inflation peaked at 9% in June 2022 but has slowly come down over the last few years, largely due to the Fed’s careful adjustment of interest rates. The Fed has set its inflation rate target at 2%. Powell often refers to the central bank’s “dual mandate” – to keep inflation in check while maximising employment. Higher interest rates can bring down prices, though it can come at the risk of higher unemployment. Over the last few years, the Fed has been able to bring down inflation while keeping the unemployment rate relatively low, around 4%. Last month, inflationcooledto 2.4%, though the most recent government figures do not account for the Trump tariffs. The Fed has long been treated as a nonpartisan, nonpolitical federal agency, though Trump has recently floated the idea of terminating Powell, whose term is up in May 2026. “Powell’s termination cannot come fast enough!” Trump wrote on social media last week. Such a move would be unprecedented and would likely put Wall Street into a further tailspin. In an interview with CNBC, Krishna Guha, the vice-chair of Evercore ISI, an equity research firm, said that there would be a “severe reaction” from markets if Trump fires Powell. “I can’t believe that’s what the administration is trying to achieve,” Guha said. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion It’s also unclear whether Trump has theauthorityto remove Powell from his post. The supreme court is currently hearing a case that could give Trump more power to fire federal officials before their terms are up, though it’s unclear whether that could reach the Fed. Last week, Powell emphasized the importance of the Fed’s independence from political forces. “Our independence is a matter of law,” Powell said. “We serve very long terms, seemingly endless terms, so we’re protected by the law.” But that doesn’t mean the Trump administration isn’t trying. On Friday, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told reporters that the administration “will continue to study” if they can legally fire Powell. Fed officials meet monthly to discuss potential changes to the interest rate. The next meeting between officials will take place 6 and 7 May.",

    "title": "US supreme court hears challenge to Obamacare free preventive healthcare",
    "article_text": "TheUS supreme courton Monday heard arguments in a case that could threaten Americans’ access to free preventivehealthcareservices under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. At issue is the constitutionality of the US preventive services taskforce, which plays a critical role in determining which preventive services health insurers must cover without cost to patients. The 16-member panel of medical experts, appointed by the health secretary without Senate confirmation, has designated dozens of life-saving screenings and treatments as essential preventive care. If the justices uphold the lower court’s ruling, health associations said in a filing, life-saving tests and treatments that have been cost-free would become subject to co-pays and deductibles, deterring many Americans from obtaining them. The case represents the latest in a long series of legal challenges to Barack Obama’s signature healthcare legislation to reach the nation’s highest court since its passage in 2010. A big critic of the program during his first term, Trump and his administration have now taken over the case after the Biden administration initially filed the appeal. In oral arguments, the justices posed sharp questions over whether the law gives the HHS secretary the appropriate level of supervision over the taskforce, including the power to influence its recommendations and fire members at will, or if the group operates as a largely independent governmental body whose recommendations effectively have the force of law. Jonathan Mitchell, the conservative lawyer representing the plaintiffs who previously represented Trump in ballot access litigation, insisted that taskforce members are “principal officers” because “their preventive care coverage mandates are neither directed nor supervised by the Secretary of Health and Human Services”. Mitchell’s argument hinges on interpreting statutory language requiring the task force to be “independent” and “protected from political pressure”, which he argues is incompatible with secretary oversight: “We don’t see any way that statutory language can be squared with the regime envisioned by the government,” he told the justices. Several justices appeared skeptical of Mitchell’s reading of the statute, with Justice Elena Kagan questioning whether Congress would create a board without specifying who appoints its members: “I mean, it would be an odd statute. I doubt you could find another where Congress has set up a board and … just not said who should appoint.” The taskforce is made up of medical experts who serve four-year terms on a volunteer basis. It reviews medical evidence and public feedback and issues recommendations about which preventive services would be most effective for detecting illnesses earlier or addressing ailments before a patient’s condition worsens. The taskforce has identified dozens of preventive services as having a high or moderate net benefit to patients including screenings to detect diabetes and various types of cancer, statin medications to lower the risk of heart disease and stroke, and interventions to help patients quit smoking or unhealthy alcohol use. The New Orleans-based fifth US circuit court of appeals ruled in 2024 that the taskforce’s structure violates the constitution, as the plaintiffs claimed. The government’s appeal of the fifth circuit’s decision initially was filed by Biden’s administration before being taken up by Trump. Trump’s administration argued in a supreme court brief that the taskforce’s preventive care recommendations cannot become legally binding on insurers without the HHS secretary’s permission. “The secretary can remove them at will, and the threat of removal is the ultimate tool for control over final decisions on recommendations,” justice department lawyers wrote. For this and other reasons, justice department lawyers argued, the taskforce’s members should be seen as so-called “inferior officers”, meaning they can be lawfully appointed by an executive branch department head – like the HHS secretary – and do not require Senate confirmation under the constitution. In a supreme court filing, the plaintiffs argued that the Affordable Care Act has transformed the longstanding taskforce from an advisory body into one that now issues “decrees” to insurers, adding that the HHS secretary has no authority to stop taskforce recommendations from becoming binding law. The taskforce’s lack of supervision, they argued, makes its members “principal officers” who must be presidentially appointed and Senate confirmed under the constitution. Before the case was narrowed to the appointments issue, the lawsuit included a religious objection to being required to cover pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. They claimed that such drugs “facilitate and encourage homosexual behavior, prostitution, sexual promiscuity and intravenous drug use”. The fifth circuit’s ruling also rejected the government’s request to remove certain offending words from the Obamacare provision at issue – a process called severing – in order to make that part of the law conform to the constitution. That issue was also part of the appeal before the supreme court. The supreme court’s decision was expected by the end of June.",

    "title": "Haiti is nearing ‘point of no return’ as gang violence surges: UN official",
    "article_text": "Haiti is approaching a “point of no return” as it struggles to respond toescalating gang violence, the top United Nations official in the country has said. Maria Isabel Salvador, the UN special representative to the Caribbean nation, delivered the warning to the UN Security Council on Monday. “As gang violence continues to spread to new areas of the country, Haitians experience growing levels of vulnerability and increasing scepticism about the ability of the state to respond to their needs,” Salvador said. “Haiti could face total chaos,” she said, adding that aid and support for the international force deployed to stem rampant gang violence was desperately needed to avoid that fate. “I urge you to remain engaged and answer the urgent needs of the country and its people,” she said. The poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, Haiti faces severe political instability, with swaths of the countryunder the controlof rival armed gangs who carry out widespread murders, rapes and kidnappings. Salvador cited cholera outbreaks and gender-based violence alongside a deteriorating security situation. Most recently, Salvador said, gangs seized the city of Mirebalais in central Haiti, freeing more than 500 prisoners during the assault. It was the fifth prison break in under a year and “part of a deliberate effort to entrench dominance, dismantle institutions and instil fear”, she said. Armed gangs have also been increasingly battling for control of the capital, Port-au-Prince, with violence intensifying as rival gangs attempt to establish new territories, she said. Meanwhile, aKenyan-led forceauthorised by the UN has failed to push back the gangs since the deployment began in June of last year. The mission has about 1,000 police officers from six countries, short of the 2,500 originally planned. Kenya’s national security adviser, Monica Juma, told the council in a video briefing from Nairobi that the force has entered “a decisive phase of its operation” where gangs are coordinating operations and attacking people and strategic installations, and targeting the political establishment. While the Haitian police and the multinational force have launched intensive anti-gang operations and achieved some notable progress, especially in securing critical infrastructure, she said a significant gap exists. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also warned that further international support was “required immediately to allow the national police to prevent the capital slipping closer to the brink”, according to an unpublished report seen by the AFP news agency. The report detailed the surge in violence, with the UN recording 2,660 homicides in the three months since December 2024 – a 41.3 percent increase over the previous quarter. But the report also pointed to a high civilian toll in efforts to counter the gangs. During the period, anti-gang operations resulted in 702 people killed, with 21 percent estimated to be innocent civilians, the report said. There was also an alarming increase in gender-based violence, with 347 incidents reported in the five months to February 2025, according to the UN data. Collective rape was the most common violation, accounting for 61 percent of cases.",

    "article_text": "Harvard University has sued US President Donald Trump’s administration to halt the government’spause of more than $2bn in fundingfor the US educational institution. “Over the course of the past week, the federal government has taken several actions following Harvard’s refusal to comply with its illegal demands,” Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement on Monday. “Moments ago, we filed a lawsuit to halt the funding freeze because it is unlawful and beyond the government’s authority,” Garber said. Among the United States government agencies mentioned in Harvard’s lawsuit were the Education Department, the Health Department, the Justice Department, the Energy Department and the General Services Administration. The Trump administration had no immediate comment. But Trump and his White House team have publicly justified their campaign against universities as a reaction to what they say is uncontrolled “anti-Semitism” and a need to reverse diversity programmes aimed at addressing the historical oppresion of minorities. The administration claimsprotests against Israel’s war in Gazathat swept across US college campuses last year were rife with anti-Semitism. “The Government has not – and cannot – identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America’s position as a global leader in innovation,” Harvard’s legal complaint read. Many US universities, including Harvard, cracked down on the protests over the allegations at the time, with the Cambridge-based institution placing 23 students on probation and denying degrees to 12 others, according to protest organisers. Other institutions, including Columbia University in New York City, have bowed to less far-ranging demands from the Trump administration, which claims that the educational elite is too left wing. Tyler Coward, the lead counsel for government affairs with the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonpartisan First Amendment group, praised Harvard for “taking a principled stand against federal overreach that threatens the core values of higher education”. “The Trump administration’s attempt to bypass federal civil rights law and impose sweeping ideological mandates through financial coercion sets a dangerous precedent,” Coward said. “Colleges must comply with civil rights laws to receive federal funding. Enforcement of those laws must be lawful, transparent, and respect constitutional rights.”",

    "title": "Wife of former US Senator Bob Menendez convicted in bribery trial",
    "article_text": "Nadine Menendez, the wife of former United States SenatorBob Menendez, has been convicted of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bribes in exchange for attempting to use her husband’s influence to benefit Egyptian officials and New Jersey businessmen. Nadine Menendez, 58, was found guilty on Monday of all 15 counts she faced, including bribery, honest services wire fraud and conspiracy for a public official to act as a foreign agent. She will be sentenced by US District Judge Sidney Stein in Manhattan on June 12. The conviction comes after Bob Menendez, a Democrat who represented New Jersey for 18 and a half years, was sentenced in January to 11 years in prison. “Nadine Menendez and Senator Menendez were partners in crime,” acting Manhattan US Attorney Matthew Podolsky said in a statement on Monday after the verdict. “Together, Nadine Menendez and the Senator placed their own interests and greed ahead of the interests of the citizens the Senator was elected to serve.” Outside the court, Menendez, who had pleaded not guilty, wore a pink mask as she stood next to her lawyer, Barry Coburn, who said he was “devastated by the verdict”. “We fought hard and it hurts,” he said. “This is a very rough day for us.” The once-powerful chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Bob Menendez was convicted at trial last July on charges related to efforts to speed Egypt’s access toUS military aid, as well as interfering in local prosecutions of businessmen, in exchange for bribes including gold, cash and a Mercedes-Benz. Bob Menendez, 71, resigned from the Senate the following month. The evidence shown to jurors over a three-week trial followed the timeline of the whirlwind romance between the couple that began in early 2018 and continued after criminal charges were brought against them in September 2023. Nadine Menendez was to be tried with her husband for her alleged role in his scheme, but her trial was postponed after her lawyers said she needed treatment for breast cancer. Prosecutors said New Jersey businessman Wael Hana arranged meetings between the senator and Egyptian officials, who pressed him to sign off on military aid. In return, the businessman put Nadine Menendez on the payroll of a company he controlled, prosecutors said. Prosecutors also said Hana and Nadine Menendez communicated requests and directives from Egyptian officials to the senator. Hana was convicted along with Bob Menendez and sentenced to just more than eight years in prison. Another defendant, businessman Fred Daibes, was also convicted and received a seven-year prison sentence. Prosecutors said Daibes wanted the senator to protect him from a criminal case he was facing in New Jersey. The couple also received a Mercedes-Benz from businessman Jose Uribe in return for Bob Menendez using his clout to pressure the New Jersey attorney general’s office to stop investigating some of Uribe’s associates, prosecutors said. Menendez was the first US senator in the country’s history to be found guilty of acting as a foreign agent.",

    "title": "More than 30 killed in latest attack in Sudan’s Darfur region: Monitor",
    "article_text": "The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have again attackedel-Fashercity in the western Darfur region of Sudan, killing more than 30 people, an activist group has said. The attack by the RSF and allied militias is the latest deadly offensive on the area, the last stronghold of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) in the war-torn region. The Resistance Committees in el-Fasher said dozens of other people were wounded in the Sunday attack, which involved “heavy artillery shelling”. The RSF renewed the assault on Monday, shelling residential buildings and open markets, according to the activist group, which tracks the war. No new casualties were immediately reported. The RSF did not immediately respond to the claims. For over a year, the RSF has sought to wrest control of el-Fasher, located more than 800km (500 miles) southwest of the capital, Khartoum, from the SAF, launching regular attacks on the city and two major famine-hit camps for displaced people on its outskirts. However, observers say attacks have intensified in recent months as the RSF suffered battlefield setbacks in Khartoum and other urban areas in the county’s east and centre. El-Fasher is estimated to be home to more than one million people, including hundreds of thousands of those displaced by the fighting. The latest violence comes less than a week after a two-day attack by the RSF and its allied militias on e-Fasher, as well as the nearbyZamzamand Abu Shouk camps for internally displaced people, killed more than 400 people, according to the United Nations. The attack forced up to 400,000 people to flee the Zamzam camp, Sudan’s largest, which has becomeinaccessibleto aid workers, UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. On Monday, the UN’s humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher described the situation in the region as “horrifying”. He said he had spoken by phone with both SAF general Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and RSF second in command general Abdelrahim Dagalo, who committed to giving “full access to get aid in”. International aid agencies have long warned that a full-scale RSF assault on el-Fasher could lead to devastating urban warfare and a new wave of mass displacement. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) has described the situation as “hell on earth” for at least 825,000 children trapped in and around el-Fasher. The UN also warned of a catastrophic humanitarian situation. “The humanitarian community in Sudan is facing critical and intensifying operational challenges in North Darfur,” Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the UN’s resident and humanitarian coordinator in Sudan, said on Sunday. She added that “despite repeated appeals, humanitarian access to el-Fasher and surrounding areas remains dangerously restricted”, warning that the lack of access was increasing “the vulnerability of hundreds of thousands of people”. Nkweta-Salami called for UN and NGO actors to be granted “immediate and sustained access to these areas to ensure life-saving support can be delivered safely and at scale”. Meanwhile, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has called for aid airdrops into the city in the face of access restrictions. Sudan’s brutal civil war began on April 15, 2023, after a tenuous power-sharing agreement between SAF General al-Burhan and RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, fell apart. To date, more than 24,000 people have been killed in the fighting, according to the UN, although activists say the number is likely far higher. Millions more have been displaced.",

    "title": "Pope Francis died of cerebral stroke and heart failure: Vatican doctor",
    "article_text": "Pope Francisdiedof a cerebral stroke and irreversible heart failure, Vatican doctor Andrea Arcangeli says in a death certificate. The certificate released on Monday for the 88-year-old pontiff said the pope had fallen into a coma before his death on Monday morning. Francis died of “cerebral stroke, coma, irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse”, the death certificate said. It added thatthe first Latin American pontiffin the history of the Roman Catholic Church died at 7:35am (05:35 GMT) in his apartment at the Santa Marta residence in the Vatican. Just aday earlier, the pontiff made what would be his final major appearance as he greeted thousands of Easter worshippers from an open-top popemobile in St Peter’s Square and delivered a blessing through an aide. Francis had suffered various ailments during his 12-year papacy with life-threatening complications in recent weeks during a bout of double pneumonia, for which he spent 38 days at Rome’s Gemelli University Hospital in February and March. The death certificate added that Francis also suffered from arterial hypertension, multiple bronchiectasis and type 2 diabetes, ailments that had not been previously disclosed. The Vatican also released Francis’s spiritual testament – a written statement of faith – in which he said he wished to be buried in Rome’s Basilica of St Mary Major and not at St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican, unlike many of his predecessors. The text specified Francis wanted to be buried “in the ground, without particular decoration” but with the inscription of his papal name in Latin: Franciscus. “As I sense the approaching twilight of my earthly life, and with firm hope in eternal life, I wish to set out my final wishes solely regarding the place of my burial,” read the testament, which was dated June 29, 2022. “May the Lord grant a fitting reward to all those who have loved me and who continue to pray for me,” it said. The Vatican on Monday evening held a rosary prayer in St Peter’s Square, its first public commemoration since the pope’s death. Cardinal Mauro Gambetti, archpriest of St Peter’s Basilica, led the prayer at sunset. Sister Raffaella Petrini, president of the Vatican City State and one of the highest ranking women at the Vatican, delivered the first reading. Her appointment was a sign of Francis’s insistence that women be given more prominent decision-making roles. Francis’s death marks the beginning of nine days of mourning called the Novendiale. His body will be dressed in papal vestments and placed in St Peter’s Basilica for public viewing before his burial. Daily prayer services and Requiem Masses will be held in Catholic churches worldwide and at St Peter’s Basilica during this time. The Vatican alsoenters a transitional periodcalled the sede vacante or interregnum, during which power is handed over to the College of Cardinals, but no major decisions will be made until the papacy is filled. In about 15 to 20 days, cardinals under the age of 80 will convene at the Sistine Chapel in Vatican City, which will be sealed off, to elect the new pontiff through a secret ballot. Once the next pope is elected, white smoke will emerge from the chimney of the chapel.",

    "title": "Before he died, Pope Francis called for peace in Gaza. Will anyone listen?",
    "article_text": "Pope Francis diedtoday at the age of 88 following a prolonged illness. Just yesterday, in his Easter Sundayaddressin Saint Peter’s Square in Vatican City, the leader of the Roman Catholic Church chose to express his “closeness to the sufferings of Christians in Palestine and Israel, and to all the Israeli people and the Palestinian people”. He went on to state that he was “think[ing] of the people of Gaza, and its Christian community in particular, where the terrible conflict continues to cause death and destruction and to create a dramatic and deplorable humanitarian situation” – a toned-down reference, of course, to Israel’songoing genocidein the Gaza Strip, which has officially killed more than 51,200 Palestinians since October 2023. Concluding the pope’s thoughts on this particular “terrible conflict” was an “appeal to the warring parties: call a ceasefire, release the hostages and come to the aid of a starving people that aspires to a future of peace!” To be sure, Pope Francis opted to deploy language that does not adequately reflect the horrors currently being unleashed upon Gaza. For one thing, a genocide is not a “conflict”; nor are Israeli genocidaires and Palestinian victims of genocide equal “warring parties”. That said, the pope deserves praise for utilising what would be his final platform to call for a ceasefire in Gaza – at a time when the world appears all too content toallow the mass slaughterof Palestinians to proceed indefinitely. Though he did not pinpoint who precisely is to blame for the fact that there are now “starving people” in need of aid, this is naturally a reference to Israel’s decision in early March to cut off all humanitarian aid deliveries to the Gaza Strip – a move amounting toenforced starvation and a war crime. Pope Francis’s call for a ceasefire yesterday came just a month after Israel’s definitive annihilation of the existing ceasefire that ostensiblytook effectin January, which the Israeli military had already taken the opportunity to violate at every turn. Between Israel’s termination of the ceasefire on March 18 and April 9, the United Nations found that, in at least 36 separate Israeli air strikes on Gaza, women and children were theonly fatalities. As much as the starving people may “aspire to a future of peace”, then, it’s difficult to aspire to any future at all when you’re being actively exterminated by an army that enjoys thefull bipartisan supportof the reigning global superpower, the United States of America. Incidentally, Pope Francis’s final day on Earth also included abrief meetingwith said superpower’s second-in-command: US Vice President JD Vance. The encounter came after the head of the Catholic Church openly and repeatedly criticised US President Donald Trump’s administration and itsmaniacal deportation schemes. In a February address, he noted that its immigration policies were causing a “major crisis” that “damages the dignity of men and women”. Pope Francis made a nod to the plight of people on the move in his Easter address as well: “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalised, and migrants!” He went on to reiterate his desire “to renew our hope that peace is possible”. Unfortunately, however, contempt and dehumanisation are pillars of a hopeless global system – led by the United States – that prioritises elite tyranny and profit over any semblance of human decency. Whether it’s the arms industry making bank off of Israel’s genocide in Gaza or the US making life hell for the undocumented folks on whose labour the country’s own economy depends, institutionalised contempt is good for business. This Easter week, the “hope that peace is possible” wasentirely out of the questionfor Palestinian Christians in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Jerusalem – the very place Jesus was crucified, according to the Bible. In the Gaza Strip, Christians gathered in fear on Easter Sunday at Gaza City’s Church of Saint Porphyrius, which wasbombedin October 2023 shortly after the start of the genocide. The attack killed at least 18 displaced Palestinians who were sheltering there, including Christians. In the West Bank and Jerusalem, Israeli officials thwarted access to holy sites for numerous members of the Christian community, which has sufferedincreasing attacksby Jewish settlers and other forms of state-backed persecution. Only approximately 6,000 West Bank Palestiniansreceivedpermits from Israel to attend Easter services this year at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in occupied East Jerusalem, which was predictably militarised for the occasion. As Al Jazeera noted, “even the representative of the Vatican in Palestine was denied entry into the church”. A day later, the earthly representative of the Roman Catholic Church itself passed on to other realms. Among his parting appeals was the call for a ceasefire in Gaza. Will anyone listen?

    "article_text": "Argentinians are mourning the death of their compatriotPope Francis, who served as the archbishop of Buenos Aires and was known for working with the poor in the city before ascending to the top of the Roman Catholic Church. The Argentinian government has announced seven days of mourning for Francis, who died on Monday at age 88. “As Argentinians, we are orphaned,” street sweeper Javier Languenari told the AFP news agency outside the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral early on Monday. “He endured as much as he could.” Born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in 1936 to Italian parents, Francis became the first Latin American pontiff in 2013 after his predecessor Pope Benedict stepped down. As he navigated the churchthrough controversies, Francis emphasised compassion for the less fortunate. “The pope of the poor has left us, the pope of the marginalised,” Jorge Garcia Cuerva, the archbishop of Buenos Aires, said on Monday. “He insisted on building bridges, he insisted that we live in universal brotherhood. The pope was our father, the father of the poor, the father of mercy. The best tribute we Argentinians can pay to Francis is to unite.” Argentinian PresidentJavier Melei– who previously clashed with Francis and called him an “imbecile” and “the representative of evil on Earth” – also paid tribute to the late pope. “Despite differences that seem minor today, having been able to know him in his goodness and wisdom was a true honour for me,” Milei wrote on X. “I bid farewell to the Holy Father and stand with all of us today dealing with this sad news.” Melei’s right-wing libertarianism was at odds with Francis’smessage of empathyand embrace of social justice causes. Still, Francis phoned Melei to congratulate him after his election victory in 2023, and the Argentinian president visited the pope last year, hailing what he described as their “positive relationship”. On Monday, former Argentinian PresidentMauricio Macricalled the pope a religious figure of “unparalleled stature”. “His life was marked by the teachings he gave through his words, his commitment, and his actions,” Macri wrote in a social media post. “He himself, through his career, is a lesson for everyone.” Reporting from Buenos Aires, Al Jazeera’s Teresa Bo noted that many were unhappy that Francis never visited Argentina while pope, even though he visited other countries on the continent. “He never made it to Argentina, and for many, there was a political message there. He did not want to be used politically,” she said. Bo said Argentinians took pridein Franciswhen he was first elected pope, but his embrace of progressive causes – including allowing priests to bless same-sex couples – made him a “polarising figure” and angered traditionalists in the church. “Even though the most progressive people in this country liked that message against injustice, against inequality, against capitalism, among other things, many others did not like that,” Bo said. Regardless, Bo added, his death will be felt across the country. “For many of the people I have spoken to, he was a man who tried to open up the church, who spoke about inclusiveness and humility, and that’s something many people in this country will remember,” she said. Buenos Aires resident Nicolas Cordoba told the Reuters news agency that the pope’s death will “really leave a mark of pain in people’s hearts”. In a politically divided Argentina, some recalled the late pope’s call for the country to come together. “Francis’s message was always for us to unite, to reach out to those most in need,” Agustin Hartridge, a 41-year-old lawyer, told AFP. “That candle I lit is a tribute to all he taught us.”",

    "title": "US VP Vance arrives in India for four-day visit as US tariff threat looms",
    "article_text": "United States Vice President JD Vance has arrived in India for a four-day visit as New Delhi looks to avoid US tariffs, negotiate a bilateral trade deal with Washington and strengthen ties with the administration of President Donald Trump. Vance was meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, the first day of his largely personal visit. He was greeted with a hug by the Indian leader at his residence in New Delhi, photos released by the Indian government showed. Over the visit, the two leaders were set to discuss plans for strengthened bilateral ties outlined in February when ModimetTrump at the White House in Washington, DC. “The visit comes closely on the heels of a positive and successful meeting between President Trump and Prime Minister Modi in Washington earlier this year,” Vance’s office said in a statement. The US is India’s largest trading partner, and the two countries have been holding negotiations aimed at sealing a new trade agreement this year. The talks had started before Trump early this monthannouncedsweeping tariffs on all trade partners, including 26 percent levies on India. Trump later paused the country-specific tariffs for 90 days. His administration framed the move as part of a grand negotiating tactic aimed at leveraging better deals with partners like India. Under the current deal being discussed, India and the US have set the ambitious target of more than doubling their trade to $500bn by 2030, while vowing to integrate supply chains and boost jobs in both countries. Vance’s first visit to New Delhi since becoming vice president in January also coincides with arapidly intensifyingtrade war between Washington and Beijing, which is New Delhi’s main rival in the region. Modi and Vance are expected to “review the progress in bilateral relations” and “exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest”, India’s Ministry of External Affairs said. On Monday, ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said Vance’s visit will “further deepen the India-US comprehensive global strategic partnership”. Washington has long viewed India as an important strategic ally in combating the rising influence of China in the Asia Pacific region and has sought to strengthen ties in recent years. India is part of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the US, Japan and Australia and is seen as a counterbalance to China’s expansion. Trump is expected to attend a summit of Quad leaders in India later this year. Modi had personally sought to establish a strong working relationship with Trump during the US president’s first term in office from 2017 to 2021. The Indian leader was then among the first leaders to visit the US and hold talks with Trump after he returned to the White House for a second term on January 20. During his visit, Modi hailed a “mega partnership” with the US. The two leaders announced plans to expand their defence partnership with India signalling its willingness to comply with several of the Trump administration’s demands, including purchasing more US oil, energy and defence equipment. Modi has also cooperated with Trump’s campaign to deport people living in the US without documentation. India has accepted many of its citizens expelled from the US in the past few months with the prime minister’s officebatting awaycriticism of how some deportees have been treated. Despite the increased coordination, Trump has continued to call India a “tariff abuser” and “tariff king”.",

    "title": "Iran to brief China as it accuses Israel of ‘undermining’ US nuclear talks",
    "article_text": "Iran says it will brief China this week in advance of a third round of talks with the United States on its nuclear programme, as Iranian officials separately accused Israel of seeking to “undermine and disrupt the diplomatic process”. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will visit Beijing on Tuesday to discuss the latesttalkswith the administration of US President Donald Trump on the country’s nuclear programme, spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said on Monday. The trip echoes“consultations”Iran held with Russia last week, before the second round of direct US-Iran talks was held over the weekend. Athird roundof talks between Araghchi and US envoy Steve Witkoff is scheduled to take place in Oman on Saturday. Araghchi has previously said Tehran always closely consults with its allies, Russia and China, over the nuclear issue. “It is natural that we will consult and brief China over the latest developments in Iran-US indirect talks,” Baqaei said. Russia and China, both nuclear-armed powers, were signatories to a now-defunct 2015 deal between Iran, the US and several Western countries intended to defuse tensions around Tehran’s nuclear programme. The 2015 deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), from which Trump withdrew in 2018, saw Tehran curtail its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. The US and Israel have accused Iran of seeking to use the programme to develop nuclear weapons. Tehran has staunchly denied the claim, saying the programme is for civilian purposes. On Monday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stressed close ties between Beijing and Tehran, but did not confirm the Iranian minister’s planned visit. “China and Iran have maintained exchanges and contacts at all levels and in various fields. With regard to the specific visit mentioned, I have no information to offer at the moment,” Guo Jiakun, spokesperson for the ministry, said. Israel’swar in Gazahas seen Iran pull closer to Russia and China. Recent diplomatic moves surrounding the US-Iran talks have further underscored the strengthened ties. Araghchi met his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, last week, just before his second round of negotiations with Witkoff. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed off on a 20-year strategic partnership treaty agreed earlier this year with his Iranian counterpart, Masoud Pezeshkian. Meanwhile, Iran’s already fraught relations with Israel and its “ironclad” ally, the US, have nosedived amid the war. Since taking office, Trump has reinstated a “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign against Tehran, while repeatedly threatening military action if a new nuclear deal is not reached. Speaking on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Baqaei accused Israel of trying to disrupt the nascent negotiations to open the way for military action. In comments carried by the AFP news agency, he declared that Israel is behind efforts from a “kind of coalition” to “undermine and disrupt the diplomatic process”. “Alongside it are a series of warmongering currents in the United States and figures from different factions,” the spokesman said. Last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated that Israel would not allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons. His statement came a day after The New York Times reported that Trump had dissuaded Israel from striking Iran’s nuclear sites in the short term, saying Washington wanted to prioritise diplomatic talks. Baqaei added that “consultations must continue” with countries that were party to the JCPOA. Iran has gradually breached the terms of the treaty since Trump abandoned it, most notably by enriching uranium to levels higher than those laid out in the deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency says Iran has enriched uranium to 60 percent, close to the 90 percent level needed to manufacture weapons. The JCPOA had restricted it to 3.67 percent, the level of enrichment needed for civilian power. Speaking last week, Witkoff sent mixed messages on what level Washington is seeking. He initially said in an interview that Tehran needed to reduce its uranium enrichment to the 3.67 percent limit, but later clarified that the US wants Iran to end its enrichment programme.",

    "title": "Israeli report on killing of Palestinian medics in Gaza: What to know",
    "article_text": "The Israeli army has described its killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza and burying them and their vehicles as a “professional error”. The bodies of 14 humanitarian workers were found in a mass grave along with their crushed vehicles a week after coming under Israeli fire in late March. One body had been found a few days before. The army said it had “shrouded” the bodies with cloth and sand to protect them until humanitarian organisations could retrieve them. Israel had blocked access to the site for days, laterinsisting it was not an attempt to cover upthe attack. Here’s what to know about the attack, Israel’s claims and how the investigation stacks up against other evidence: Avideo found on the phone of slain paramedic Rifaat Radwanshows the team’s final moments. The video, filmed from inside one of the last two ambulances to head out, shows a firetruck and ambulances driving ahead through the night. All vehicles were clearly identified with emergency lights flashing. The vehicles stopped when they see an ambulance and bodies by the roadside, and first responders in reflective uniforms exit the vehicles. Moments later, intense gunfire erupts. As the gunfire continues, Radwan can be heard asking his mother for forgiveness and reciting the Islamic declaration of faith, the Shahada, before he dies. After a review, the Israeli military described the killings as “professional failures” and a “misunderstanding”. Nobody has been charged. It dismissed a deputy commander for “providing an incomplete report” and reprimanded a commanding officer. Major General Yoav Har-Even, who conducted the review, said two responders were killed in an initial incident, 12 people were killed in a second shooting and another person was killed in a third incident. “The fire in the first two incidents resulted from an operational misunderstanding by the troops, who believed they faced a tangible threat from enemy forces. The third incident involved a breach of orders during a combat setting,” the military statement said. Troops bulldozed over the bodies and their mangled vehicles, but the investigation said that was not an attempt to conceal the attack. The Military Advocate General’s Corps, meant to be an independent body under Israel’s attorney general and Supreme Court, can now decide whether to file civil charges. The investigative report said soldiers did not recognise the ambulances due to “poor night visibility” and because flashing lights are less visible on night-vision drones and goggles. It also blamed the now-dismissed deputy commander, saying he mistakenly thought the ambulance was being used by Hamas and opened fire first. Israel has tried to justify previous attacks on protected entities by saying Hamas hides among civilians and uses ambulances to carry out operations. Har-Even told reporters that one of the humanitarian workers at the scene was questioned over suspected Hamas links. The man, Munther Abed, was released the next day. Before the video of the attack was found, Israel’s military had said the ambulances had been “advancing suspiciously” towards its soldiers “without headlights or emergency signals”. The first responders were “in their uniforms, still wearing gloves” when they were killed, said Jonathan Whittall, the head of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in the Palestinian territory. Gaza Civil Defence spokesperson Mahmoud Bassal said several team members were found with their hands and feet bound and bullet wounds to the head and torso, indicating they were executed at close range after being identified as humanitarian workers. Without offering proof, the Israeli investigative report said six of those killed were “Hamas members” although no Palestinian fighters were reported found in the mass grave. Har-Even told reporters that no paramedic was armed and no weapons were found in any vehicle. An Israeli military official said the bodies had been covered “in sand and cloth” to preserve them until their retrieval could be coordinated with international organisations. The army also said it has found “no evidence to support claims of execution” and “such claims are blood libels and false accusations against [Israeli] soldiers”. Human rights groups and international legal experts said Israel’s self-reviews often lack independence and transparency. Israel said it reviews its military’s conduct through internal probes led by its military advocate general, who decides whether to pursue criminal investigations. But the military has a track record of denying wrongdoing, contradicting itself or blaming low-ranking individuals without broader repercussions for the armed forces. In 2022, it claimed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was killed by Palestinian fire until several media investigations debunked that. Israel later admitted it may have shot her “accidentally” but ruled out a criminal probe. In January, the International Criminal Court’s top prosecutor defended seeking arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, citing Israel’s failure to genuinely investigate allegations of war crimes. The PRCS and the Israeli rights organisation Breaking the Silence have rejected the findings of the Israeli probe. “It is incomprehensible why the occupation soldiers buried the bodies of the paramedics,” PRCS President Younis al-Khatib told Al Araby TV. He said evidence such as the video proved “the falsehood of the occupation’s narrative”, adding thatthe Israeli army communicated with the paramedics before killing them.",

    "title": "‘A cancer’: UN warns Asia-based cybercrime syndicates expanding worldwide",
    "article_text": "Asian cybercrime syndicates have caused an estimated $37bn in losses in the East and Southeast Asian regions, with the United Nations warning that thereachof the criminal networks is expanding globally. In a report released on Monday, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) detailed how Chinese and Southeast Asian gangs have been raking in tens of billions of dollars annually targeting victims in an array of cybercrimes, including fake investments, cryptocurrency, romance and other scams. The criminal organisation have largely operated out of squalid compounds in the border areas ofMyanmar, as well as in so-called “special economic zones” designed to attract foreign investment inCambodiaand Laos. They have relied on often trafficked workers forced to work in squalid compounds. While the report said countries in East and Southeast Asia lost an estimated $37bn to cyber-fraud in 2023, there were “much larger estimated losses” worldwide. The report warned that the networks have been spreading to South America, Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and the Pacific Islands. “We are seeing a global expansion of East and Southeast Asian organized crime groups,” said Benedikt Hofmann, UNODC acting regional representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific. “This reflects both industry growth and a strategy to evade crackdowns in Southeast Asia,” Hofmann said. The report said the syndicates have established footholds in African nations, including Zambia, Angola, and Namibia, as well as Pacific island nations, including Fiji and Vanuatu. They have also expanded their money laundering strategies, forging alliances with South American drug cartels, the Italian mafia, and Irish mobsters, according to the report. Cryptocurrencymining– typically referring to the creation of new cryptocurrencies and the validation of transactions – has become a key tool for obscuring illicit funds, according to the report. In one instance, in June 2023, Libyan authorities raided an illegal crypto mining operation in a militia-controlled area, arresting 50 Chinese nationals. Recent crackdowns in Myanmar, backed by China, also freed about 7,000 trafficked workers. However, the UN warned that while enforcement disrupts operations temporarily, the syndicates have proven adept at adapting. “It spreads like a cancer,” said Hofmann. “Authorities treat it in one area, but the roots never disappear, they simply migrate.” New technologies have further complicated the situation, with criminal networks operating self-contained digital ecosystems, using encrypted messaging, payment apps, and cryptocurrencies to evade law enforcement, the report said. The UN agency further warned of “potentially irreversible spillover has taken place…leaving criminal groups free to pick, choose, and move … as needed”. It urged countries to collaborate and intensify efforts to disrupt criminal networks’ financing.",

    "title": "Trump risks leaving behind a legacy of failure in Ukraine",
    "article_text": "A day before Easter, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary ceasefire for the Christian holiday. Like other Russian promises, this one was broken too. Ukrainian media reported Russian drone attacks, shelling and firefights across the front lines. Ukrainian civilians were also targeted. This ceasefire that wasn’t came on the tail of another one: a 30-day ceasefire that was supposed to cover energy infrastructure. That was violated at least 30 times, per Ukrainian media reports. Throughout this time, United States President Donald Trump has continued to maintain that peace could be achieved. Even after his own Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that the US could walk away from its mediator role because of lack of progress, the president still showed optimism that a deal was possible. On Easter Sunday, Trump wrote on Truth Social: “Hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week.” A week earlier, Russia struck the Ukrainian city of Sumy with ballistic missiles. The death toll from the attack reached 34 people, including two children, with more than a dozen injured. Even this bloody attack did not sway the US president, who called it “a mistake”. It is by now clear that three months into his presidency, Trump is failing dramatically in Ukraine. He must now realise that bold promises are easier made than fulfilled. He has not ended the war in 24 hours and will not do so in 100 days either, as he has promised. Under his leadership, Washington’s mediating drive appears stalled and its strategy unclear. A president who prides himself on deal-making and strength now stands indecisive and ineffective. If this continues, Trump risks failing twice: once as a negotiator and again as an ally. His current approach is not only weakening the role of the US in the world but also emboldening Russia to continue its aggression. Despite the Trump administration’s outreach to the Kremlin, it has received nothing more than empty rhetoric and broken promises for ceasefires. Putin’s stance hasn’t changed: He demands recognition of Russia’s claim to Crimea and four Ukrainian regions the Russian army partially occupies, no NATO membership for Kyiv and a limit on the size of its army. He has also openly called for regime change in the country, demanding elections during the war. Putin feels he’s negotiating from a position of strength and refuses to compromise. Trump currently lacks the leverage to make him reconsider, and so his strategy is to pressure Ukraine into capitulating to Russia. He is making the situation worse with his policies on military aid for Ukraine. After initially halting the transfer of weapons and munitions and intelligence sharing with Ukraine, Trump partially reversed his stance. He allowed military assistance approved by the administration of his predecessor President Joe Biden to resume, but he has refused to consider a new package once the current one comes to an end. His administration still has several billion dollars available for drawdown, which could be allocated for further security support to Ukraine, but Trump has not signalled he is willing to approve it. That means Ukraine will soon face a situation in which key munitions stocks run out. Russia knows this, and it is using negotiations with the US to buy time. While it is waiting for the Ukrainian army to run out of vital supplies, Moscow has also initiated a large troop mobilisation. The call-up of 160,000 new conscripts marks a significant escalation. Ukrainian commanders have warned that major offensives could begin within weeks across multiple fronts. Putin’s aim is to use the Trump administration’s self-professed “peace-making” ambitions to his advantage. His strategy is to drag out ceasefire negotiations until US military aid runs out and the Russian army is able to advance far enough into Ukrainian territory to force Kyiv into capitulation. For Ukraine, defeat is not an option. The nation is still standing and will continue fighting because its freedom and independence are at stake. Even if Trump puts more pressure on Kyiv to consider a bad “peace deal” with Russia in which it makes all the concessions Putin wants, no Ukrainian leader would sign it because that would mean political ruin. Europe, for all its hesitations and internal divisions, has little choice now but to become a full-fledged ally of Kyiv. Europeans know Russia would not stop at Ukraine, and the threat is existential for them as well. The Kremlin is already preparing the Russian population through a large-scale propaganda campaign that a “great war” with NATO countries is necessary. In the face of this threat, European countries are looking to rearm, and for this, they need time. This means that Ukraine’s war of liberation will continue for years, with or without US involvement. Meanwhile, the US under its current course will sink deeper into domestic crises, consumed by the aftershocks of self-isolation and haunted by costly decisions in a world it no longer leads. This will be what Trump leaves behind: a legacy not of resolution but of retreat. If he does not change course, history will remember him not as a strong leader who brought peace but as a boastful, naive man who made promises he could not fulfil.

    "article_text": "Suleiman Khalil was harvesting olives in a Syrian orchard with two friends four months ago, unaware the soil beneath them still hid deadly remnants of war. The trio suddenly noticed a mine lying on the ground. Panicked, Khalil and his friends tried to leave, but he stepped on a hidden mine that exploded. Terrified, his friends ran to find an ambulance, but Khalil, 21, thought they had abandoned him. Khalil’s left leg was badly wounded in the initial explosion. His right leg was blown off from above the knee in a second blast. He used his shirt as a tourniquet on the stump and screamed for help until a nearby soldier heard him and rushed to his aid. While the nearly 14-yearSyrian warcame to an end with the fall of Bashar al-Assad on December 8, war remnants continue to kill and maim. Mines and explosive remnants – widely used since 2011 by Syrian government forces, its allies and armed opposition groups – have contaminated vast areas, many of which became accessible only after al-Assad’s government collapsed, leading to a surge in the number of landmine casualties, according to a recent Human Rights Watch (HRW) report. Experts estimated that tens of thousands of landmines remain buried acrossSyria, particularly in former front-line regions like rural areas of Idlib governorate. At least 249 people, including 60 children, have been killed and 379 injured by these munitions since December 8, according to INSO, an international organisation that coordinates safety for aid workers. Landmines not only kill and maim but also cause long-term psychological trauma and broader harm, such as displacement, loss of property and reduced access to essential services, HRW says. The rights group has urged the transitional government to establish a civilian-led mine action authority in coordination with the United Nations Mine Action Service to streamline and expand demining efforts.",

This isn’t just a problem for ecommerce giants likeShein and Temu, as it introduces a new hurdle for many companies that ship goods directly from China to customers in the United States. It’s also kicking in with only days left beforethe de minimis exception is set to expire on May 2nd, ending the rule that allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the US duty free, and for recipients in the US to receive up to $800 worth of stuff per day without paying import taxes. DHL explains the change in a statementposted to its site: Effective April 5, 2025, all shipments to the U.S. with a declared customs value over USD 800 require formal entry processing - down from the previous USD 2,500 threshold due to new U.S. Customs regulations. This change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock. While we are working diligently to scale up and manage this increase, shipments over USD 800—regardless of origin—may experience multi-day delays. To manage this, starting Monday, April 21, 2025, and until further notice, we will temporarily suspend B2C shipments to private individuals in the U.S. where the declared value exceeds USD 800.

Anbernic’s cheap Chinese Game Boys are under threat. bySean Hollister How much willTrump’s threatened 245 percent tariffstruly impact Chinese goods and the prices we pay in the US? Some Chinese companies aren’t waiting to see. Anbernic, which makesexcellent and controversial Nintendo Game Boy clones, is already suspending US shipments indefinitely. “Due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all orders shipping from China to the United States starting today,”writes Anbernic.“We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse, which are currently not affected by import duties and can be purchased with confidence.” No, Anbernic didn’t set up a brand-new US warehouse in response to tariffs — it’s been an option on its storefront for some time. Generally, Anbernic begins by drop-shipping each new handheld from China directly to buyers’ homes after they’re introduced, then stockpiles additional units in US warehouses for faster ship times. Anbernic lets buyers pick which warehouse they prefer on its checkout page. As of last week, Anbernic hadalready begun suggestingthat US buyers pick its US warehouse because “orders shipped to the United States may be subject to high customs duties,” asking customers to “take this potential risk into account when making your purchase decisions.” But now, the company is suspending those shipments entirely — similarly to how acclaimed retro game scaler makerRetroTINK suspended shipments not just because of tariffs, but “due to lack of guidance on how tariffs will be collected.” I checked: while you can still add a Anbernic handheld to your US cart from a Chinese warehouse, the company offers plenty of warnings and won’t let you purchase it from there. One reason for Anbernic’s popularity is that its retro handhelds are cheap, typically around $70 for the newest models. (Some also do an excellent job emulating the look and feel of classic Nintendo handhelds, as you can see in my videos above and below.) But those low prices are now completely under threat by Trump’s tariffs and theremoval of the de minimis exemption for cheap Chinese goods. It’s not clear if or how companies like Anbernic could afford to resume shipments, should those tariffs actually take hold. For the time being, Anbernic handhelds are also still available in the US via third-party sellers like Amazon — which I’ve always found surprising given that those ones typically come with Nintendo, Sega and Sony ROMs. Retro Handheldshas a handy regularly updated pagekeeping track of handheld tariffs; so far, Anbernic is the only one to suspend US shipments entirely.

Hawkins CATL, the world’s largest battery manufacturer, previewed several breakthroughs in electric vehicle battery tech that is sure to wow EV makers across the world — even if the tech never makes it to the US. The company teased the innovations at an event in Shanghai timed to precede the city’s auto show.According to local reports, CATL presented three new announcements designed to shake-up the battery world. The first was an upgraded version of its Shenxing battery designed to add more range when fast charging. CATL said the battery can now offer 520 kilometers (323 miles) of range from just five minutes of charging time — a marked improvement overBYD’s promiseto add 400km (249 miles) of range in the same amount of time. CATL said its system could provide a maximum charging speed of 1.3 megawatts. Even at -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), when charging speeds tend to slow to a crawl, CATL’s Shenxing battery can go from 5 percent to 80 percent in just 15 minutes. Another major announcement was the reveal of a new sodium-ion battery called Naxtra.According toBloomberg, the new cells are already ready for commercialization and have been tested in a number of extreme settings, including very cold and hot temperatures. The new batteries are promised to delivery around 200km of range for hybrid vehicles, and 500km for an EV. Sodium is seen by some as an improvement over lithium, both in terms of availability and stability. The material is more cost effective to obtain and isn’t subject to the same safety hazards as lithium, which can catch fire under certain circumstances. CATL believes that sodium-ion batteries could potentially replace up to half the market for lithium iron phosphate batteries that now dominates the field. CATL also unveiled a new dual-power battery that can offer a maximum range of 1,500km (932 miles) on a single charge. The company likened the super-powered battery to a dual engine aircraft, with a regular fast-charging cell combined with a separate auxiliary pack for enhanced performance and range. But thanks to President Donald Trump’s trade war with China, US residents are unlikely to see any of these benefits anytime soon. CATL’s batteries are found in a wide range of EVs, includingTeslaandFord. And while the company could license its tech to American automakers, rising tensions are likely to make it difficult in the near term. China has recently halted export ofrare earth minerals and magnets, and seems likely to want to keep all the best innovations to itself as the US walls itself off from the rest of the world. And the US Department of Defense has recently added CATLto its list of Chinese military companies, which could make it more difficult for the company to do business in the US.

    "title": "Money, Chrome, and ChatGPT: The high stakes of Google&#8217;s monopoly trial",
    "article_text": "The landmark search trial has entered its remedy phase, and the government has big goals for the world’s biggest search engine. The landmark search trial has entered its remedy phase, and the government has big goals for the world’s biggest search engine. byDavid Pierce Near the beginning of his opening arguments, David Dahlquist, a lawyer for the US Department of Justice, showed a slide that he described as Google’s “vicious cycle.” It goes like this: Google pays billions of dollars to be the default search engine practically everywhere, thus it gets more search queries, thus it gets better data, thus it is able to improve its results, thus it makes more money, thus it can afford more defaults. Google doesn’t really disagree with this assessment — but in it’s telling, that’s avirtuouscycle. Another way to describe it is as the virtuous cycle that makes Google Search so powerful: Google believes it’s created a perfect system; the DOJ thinks it’s a nightmare. A judge will make the final call. Dahlquist’s remarks were the opening salvo of the remedies phase ofUS v. Google,a landmark antitrust case that ended with judge Amit Mehta finding last year thatGoogle’s search engine is a monopoly. The question in the courtroom this time, to be litigated over the next two weeks, iswhat to do to fix it. And according to Dahlquist, the process has to start by stopping every part of the cycle from spinning. The DOJ is asking for three broad things. First, it wants to prevent Google from striking pretty much any kind of deal for prime search engine placement. The most obvious version of this deal, and a central figure in the original trial, isthe $20 billion Google pays Apple annuallyto be the default search engine in Safari. But Google has deals like these around the industry, and others that make search placement a condition of other Google services. The DOJ wants to shut them all down. The DOJ wants to prevent Google from striking pretty much any kind of deal for prime search engine placement. Second, itwants Google to divest Chrome, which Dahlquist called “a significant gateway to search… and a starting point for 35 percent of user queries.” By one metric shown in the trial, Chrome has more than four billion users, and the government’s lawyers argued that it should be a separate entity altogether. Google believes Chrome is not a self-sufficient business, and only makes sense as part of Google, but Jonathan Sallet, a lawyer representing the states, argued it would be a big get for anyone. “This kind of asset,” he said, “does not come up very often for companies to acquire. The third thing the DOJ wants is to require Google to license practically all its search data, from the search index to its results, to any competitor who wants it. So far, this appears to be the provision that has Google most concerned. John Schmidtlein, one of the lead attorneys representing Google in the case, argued in his own opening remarks that what the DOJ is asking for would essentially mean white-labeling Google and making it available to competitors around the industry. In the long run, Schmidtlein argued, competitors would be able to use Google’s search index to build and train their own products, while Google is essentially forbidden (thanks to the other parts of the remedies) from making the deals and investments required to keep winning. But even in the near term, he said, “while they’re figuring all that out, you can cut and paste Google’s search results and call them your own.” Schmidtlein also argued that Google’s search data includes massive quantities of private information, which would be dangerous for other companies to have. One of the key questions in this trial will be what a fair search market actually looks like. Google’s case has always been that it became a dominant player in search simply by being the best search engine, and that it would be absurd for the court to allow competitors to create their own Google without much extra work. Google has given up ground in only one place: its default placement deals with companies like Apple Google has given up ground in only one place: its default placement deals with companies like Apple. It argues that the last trial was dominated by questions about these deals, and preventing them (but only if they’reexclusiveagreements, notably) would level the playing field. Beyond that, Schmidtlein called the DOJ’s remedies “a wish list for competitors looking to get the benefits” of Google’s work. The DOJ’s argument, on the other hand, is that Google has built itself a nearly insurmountable lead through its illegal actions, and so the only fair thing to do is help competitors catch up. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified during the original trial that the only way to build a great search engine is with a nearly unobtainable amount of search data — and that Google had made sure it was the only company with that data. Mehta’s early questions seem to suggest he thinks some of the data-sharing and licensing provisions would amount to a “structural remedy,” which requires a higher burden of proof. But there will be a lot of questions to come about how to make the fight fair. During the trial in 2023, the AI market came up only occasionally, but now it appears to befront and center for both sides. The DOJ’s proposed remedies are so severe, Dahlquist argued, because “Google is using the same strategy they did for search, and applying it to Gemini.” But he was also careful to say that he doesn’t think AI and search are the same thing, and that the rise of ChatGPT in particular should not convince the court that the search market is in fact plenty competitive. Google, of course, argues that ChatGPT provespreciselythat the search market is in fact plenty competitive. Schmidtlein referenced OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s tweets abouthow viral ChatGPT was, and an internal OpenAI document that said the company feels “we have what we need to win.” “These companies are competing just fine without Plaintiffs’ remedies,” Schmidtlein said. AI talk will be a fixture in the courtroom the next couple of weeks. Sissie Hsiao, who previously led the Gemini team, will be on the witness stand. So will executives from OpenAI and Perplexity, and a series of experts who will attempt to explain how AI stands to both fit into and upend the search business. It was telling that the trial’s very first witness was an AI expert, Greg Durrett, who spent much of his testimony simply explaining how the technology works. There’s still a lot of trial and a lot of negotiation left, of course, but as it stands the two sides are remarkably far apart. Google, which plans to appeal the case in its entirety, thinks all will be fair as long as it’s easier to pick your own search engine. The government believes that Google in its current form cannot be allowed to exist. Judge Mehta, who asked a number of questions about the precedent for some of these requests, seems to be continually calibrating his own tolerance for sweeping change. If there’s an easy way to arrive at some middle ground that works for everybody, it hasn’t come up in court.

Anker’s newest Qi2-compatible chargersmight be faster, but if you’re looking for a reliable — and relatively inexpensive — charger to keep you powered on the go,Anker’s last-gen 622 Magnetic Battery (MagGo)is still a solid choice. Thankfully, it’s on sale through April 25th as part ofWoot’s Anker Power Mania salefor a mere$22.99 ($25 off), which is about $3 shy of the power bank’s best price to date. Anker’s magnetic power bank touts wireless Qi charging, a folding kickstand, and a convenient USB-C port for wired charging. Before Anker’s pricier 6,600mAh Qi2 power bank took its place, the 5,000mAh Anker 622 wasour favorite MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It can deliver a respectable 7.5 watts of power to MagSafe-compatible phones, which isn’t as fast as the newer model’s 15W output but still enough to achieve about an 80 percent charge on an iPhone 16 or 16 Pro (or slightly less if you’re using a power-hungry iPhone 16 Pro Max or a beefier last-gen model) within a couple of hours. What’s more, the power bank features a foldable kickstand, allowing you to stream video, take video calls, or read recipes hands-free (it also works great if you’re a fan ofApple’s handy StandBy mode). Thanks to a USB-C port on the side that offers passthrough charging, the power bank can even charge itself and your phone simultaneously.

    "article_text": "New grooves may address complaints of liquid metal leaking in the standard PS5. New grooves may address complaints of liquid metal leaking in the standard PS5. byWes Davis Sony haspublished a new teardownof thePlayStation 5 Pro, highlighting improvements that it made to the cooling apparatus of the machine. They include tweaks to the PS5’s liquid metal cooling design aimed to give the console “more stable” cooling. The changes follow unproven claims that the liquid metal used in the first PS5 can leak and damage the console. Some sites even recommended against keeping the PS5 vertical after a repair shop owner and YouTuber waspartially misquotedby jailbreak site Wololo.net. Wolololater followed up, saying its original story contained a “critical misunderstanding” — ultimately, it doesn’t seem like this was ever a widespread issue. Even so, Sony writes that it changed the design for the PS5 Pro, quoting Shinya Tsuchida, PS5 Pro Mechanical Design Lead: We spent quite some time conducting research on insulation when we were designing the original PS5. The basic structure remains the same in the PS5 Pro, but we made some improvements by adding fine grooves where the liquid metal is applied, so that the cooling effect is more stable. When we were doing research for the original PS5, we anticipated that semiconductors would continue to advance and become much denser, so we believed liquid metal technology would become crucial. It turns out we were right, and it was integral when designing the PS5 Pro. The rest of the blog post and its images may be familiar to you if you already sawiFixit’s teardownof Sony’s very expensive console, in which it noted that the inside of the PS5 Pro contains more thermal management than electronics. Some of that includes a larger cooling fan that the company says has redesigned fan blades, including “smaller blades in between” them. The blog also explains why it’s so hard to see the traces on the PS5 Pro’s motherboard: the board hides extra electrical layers beneath, to speed up memory access.

It’s up to $2,280 more expensive than the 2024 Kia EV6. byUmar Shakir Kia’s most popular electric vehicle is gettinga bit more expensive in the USfor the 2025 model year. The automaker’s re-styled EV6,announced in November, will start at $42,900 — a $300 increasefrom the 2024“Light” rear-wheel drive version, with bigger hikes on the higher-end models. The GT model is getting the biggest price hike of the bunch, going from $61,600 to $63,800, an increase of $2,200. And the GT-Line AWD is $1,300 more expensive than in 2024. Not included are the $1,475 destination fees for each model, which is an $80 increase over the previous year. The auto industry is currently scrambling to figure out what changes to make to weather the Trump administration’sunpredictable tariffs, though Kia hasn’t said whether these increases are a response to the recent policy changes. The new EV6 models (except the GT version) are nowbeing assembled in the USat Kia’s plant in West Point, Georgia, alongside the EV9. The 2025 Kia EV6 adds new geometry to the front “Star Map” grille styling and includes daytime running light lines shaped like a scribbly triangle, replacing the original winky-faced ones. The EV6 lights really fit with the styling of the EV9 and EV3, the latter of whichjust wonanother Red Dot design award for Kia. The new EV6 also has larger battery packs: from 58- to 63 kWh for the standard, and from 77.4- to 84 kWh on the long range. Kia says the bigger one goes 319 miles with RWD models, although that’s not an official EPA estimate. Comparatively, the 2024 EV6 RWD Light Long Range has an EPA estimated range of 310 miles per charge.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 21, 2025 / 7:25 PM EDT/ CBS Texas A county commissioner inDenton County, Texas, is in the hospital and her husband is dead after a stabbing attack by the victims' grandson, local police said Monday. Police inLewisville— a suburban city north of Dallas — said officers responded to a home just before 4 a.m. Monday on Springwood Drive near Elmwood Drive. They said they found County Commissioner Bobbie J. Mitchell and Fred Mitchell had both been stabbed. Police identified the suspect as 23-year-old Mitchell Reinacher, the couple's grandson. They said he was still at the scene of the incident and officers arrested him without incident. Paramedics took the Mitchells to area hospitals, where Fred Mitchell was pronounced dead. Bobbie Mitchell survived and is in stable condition, police said. Reinacher is in the Lewisville Jail facing charges of murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Police did not say what happened leading up to the stabbing. Bobbie Mitchell has served on the Denton County Commission since 2000. Before that, the Republican was the mayor of Lewisville from 1993 to 2000, the first Black person to hold that office. According to Mitchell'sbiography pageon Denton County's website, the couple has nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Denton County released a statement Monday afternoon on the family's behalf: \"Our wonderful mother, Bobbie J. Mitchell, is expected to recover from the tragic events that occurred this morning. We are very thankful for the outreach everyone has extended to us on behalf of our family. Our mother offers her blessings to all who have reached out. We will provide updates on a later date for the funeral service for our beloved father, Fred Mitchell.\" \"The City is holding our Commissioner and her family close to our hearts. We are grateful for the quick response from our Police, Fire, and the hospital staff who have taken great care of Commissioner Mitchell. If you've ever been at an event where Bobbie has prayed over you, please lift her and the family up as she has lifted our community,\" Lewisville Mayor TJ Gilmore said in a statement. \"This news will have a profound impact on our community. The City of Lewisville stands united in rejecting violence and remains committed to justice, peace, and the safety of all who live and serve here,\" Lewisville police public information officer Rachel Roberts said in a statement. In a statement, Gov. Greg Abbott thanked first responders for their quick response. \"Cecilia and I are heartbroken to hear of the passing of Commissioner Bobbie Mitchell's husband, Fred Mitchell, after they were brutally attacked in their home this morning,\" Abbott said. \"I thank the Lewisville Police Department and other first responders for their quick response and for rushing Commissioner Mitchell to the hospital. Cecilia and I pray for Commissioner Mitchell as she recovers from her injuries and for Fred Mitchell's family and loved ones as they mourn his death.\" AbbottappointedBobbie Mitchell to the Commission on State Emergency Communications in 2023 for a term set to expire on September 1, 2029.

    "title": "Trump's use of Alien Enemies Act deportations tested in Colorado court",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 21, 2025 / 7:12 PM EDT/ CBS Colorado A showdown in federal court in Denver could help shape the future legal landscape surrounding deportations nationwide. A high-stakes hearing concluded Monday morning  in a case filed by immigrants' rights groups against the Trump administration. Attorneys for the administration argued that people facing deportation should only be allotted 24 hours' notice to be able to fight their deportation order in court, but attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network argued that 24 hours isn't \"reasonable,\"as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court. \"The government wants to give as little notice as possible so they can pull people out of the country without a judge reviewing it,\" Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, told CBS News Colorado outside the Alfred A. Arraj U.S. Courthouse   on Monday. \"The idea that 24 hours is sufficient for someone who's detained at the Aurora detention facility, who likely doesn't speak English, who may not have a high level of education, who doesn't have a lawyer, who doesn't have access to a phone -- the idea that that person can file a, quote, 'writ of habeas corpus' in 24 hours is preposterous,\" he continued. Macdonald went on to say that allegedNazis were afforded more rightsin court after World War II than Venezuelans facing deportation under the Trump administration, echoing what a U.S. Appeals Court judge said in Washington, D.C. last month. Charlotte Sweeney, U.S. District judge for the District of Colorado, said on Monday she wouldn't rule on the case for 24 hours. During that hearing, attorneys for the ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network said 11 people have been deported from Colorado to El Salvador and about 85% of people being held in the Aurora ICE Processing Center -- which has 1,532 beds -- have not yet been able to retain legal counsel, which those groups argue is a violation of their due process rights. Court records show the hearing lasted just over an hour. In addition to President Trump, the defendants named in the case include U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, ICE Director Todd Lyons, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, ICE Denver Field Office Director Robert Gaudian, and Dawn Ceja, warden of the ICE Processing Center in Aurora. The U.S. Supreme Court issued arare weekend rulingtemporarily halting the Trump administration's plan to deport more Venezuelan migrants from a Texas detention facility under a seldom-used wartime law passed in 1798, theAlien Enemies Act. The president has invoked the Alien Enemies Act, allowing the executive branch to detain or deport noncitizens it deems \"dangerous,\" particularly those administration officials say are part of the gangTren de Aragua. Last month, the administration used the law to send more than 200 people to aprison in El Salvador. The Supreme Court's weekend ruling came asmass protests continued across the country, includingin Colorado, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration policies. The administration is urging the court to reconsider its decision blocking the deportations. Now, El Salvador's president has proposed exchanging the deported migrants for political prisoners held in Venezuela. In Denver, a federal courtrecently barred the removal of any noncitizens within Coloradowho are or will be subject to the Alien Enemies Act. Some of those previously deported from Colorado have already been sent to the El Salvador prison, according to their attorneys. At issue is what kind of legal rights migrants have to challenge the government's allegations before they are removed from the U.S. Trump has said the United States is facing an \"invasion\" by the Tren de Aragua gang and that he has the authority to use the 1798 law. The act was last invoked during World War II, including in Colorado, to hold Japanese Americans at internment camps, includingCamp Amache. Prior to World War II, the act had only been used against the Central Powers during World War I and against the British during the War of 1812. \"If you think of internment camps during World War II in the United States, that's the kind of framework that we're looking at in terms of how this law has been used in the past,\" Laura Lunn, an immigrant advocacy lawyer with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, said. The legal battle has triggered a series of emergency filings over the weekend after the Supreme Court bumped a case out of U.S. District Court for Washington, D.C., saying it needed to be filed in Texas and other states from which people are being deported. Asked about why this case matters, Macdonald said, \"if the government can remove these folks without due process, it erodes civil liberties for every one of us, and they could be next. We could be next. If the government is able to dispense with due process, it's a risk for liberty for all of us.\" Anna Alejo is CBS News Colorado's Executive Producer of Community Impact.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 21, 2025 / 7:04 PM EDT/ CBS New York A New York City jury convicted Nadine Menendez, the wife of convicted former New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, on Monday for her role ina years-long bribery schemewith her husband. She was found guilty on all 15 counts and faces sentencing on June 12. She wore a facemask and had no visible reaction when the verdict was read. Nadine Menendez, 58, and her husband have both now been convicted of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for political favors to benefit the government of Egypt and enrich themselves. Menendez's husbandresignedhis U.S. Senate seat weeks after beingfound guiltyof accepting lavish bribes, including gold bars and cash. He was sentenced to11 years in prisonand must surrender to authorities on June 6. He has vowed to appeal his conviction. \"Nadine Menendez and Senator Menendez were partners in crime. Over the span of five years, Nadine Menendez agreed to accept and accepted all sorts of bribes -- including gold bars, cash, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, and a no-show job -- all in exchange for the Senator's corrupt official acts. Together, Nadine Menendez and the senator placed their own interests and greed ahead of the interests of the citizens the Senator was elected to serve,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said. \"Today's verdict sends the clear message that the power of government officials may not be put up for sale, and that all those who facilitate corruption will be held accountable for their actions.\" Nadine Menendez stood next to her attorney as he spoke outside of court \"I am devastated by the verdict. We fought hard, and it hurts,\" her attorney Barry Coburn said. \"This is a very rough day for us... the case is not over, and there will be other days, and we look forward to that.\" Nadine Menendez declined to either answer questions or make a statement of her own after the verdict. Bob Menendez's surrender date was pushed back so he could assist her during her trial, but he was never there. He was on the defense's potential witness list but was not called. During opening statements, prosecutors told jurors \"she did the dirty work,\" alleging Menendez and her husband \"engaged in a corrupt relationship with three New Jersey associates and businessmen\" and provided Egyptian government officials with sensitive information. One of the businessmen, Jose Uribe, testified he bought Menendeza Mercedes-Benzin exchange for her husband's influence to try and get state prosecutors to drop criminal cases against his friend and associate. Uribe tooka plea dealin the scandal. Other alleged bribes included$100,000 in gold bars, payments toward a home mortgage and compensation for a low-to-no-show job. Former senator Menendez said during his 2024 trial that the gold belonged to his wife. An FBI search of the couple's home turned upmore than $480,000 in cashstuffed in envelopes and hidden in various places, along with $70,000 in Nadine Menendez's safe deposit box. The ex-senator said during his trial itstemmed from a habit of hoarding moneyafter his parents fled Cuba in the 1950s. Nadine Menendez's trial was also supposed to be in 2024, but it waspostponedwhile she underwent treatment for breast cancer. This is breaking news. Please stay with CBS News New York for updates.

    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 21, 2025 / 6:41 PM EDT/ CBS News Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff is moving to a new role at the Pentagon, a senior defense official told CBS News — the latest staffing shift after days of upheaval, after multiple top Hegseth aides werefiredlate last week. Chief of staff Joe Kasper will now work at the Department of Defense as a special government employee handling \"special projects,\" the official said, adding, \"Secretary Hegseth is thankful for his continued leadership and work to advance the America First agenda.\" Kasper's impending departure from the chief of staff role was first reported byPolitico. The Pentagon faced a staffing shakeup last week. At least two officials — Hegseth's senior adviser Dan Caldwell and deputy chief of staff Dan Selnick — were fired as a leak investigation ordered by Kasper was underway, CBS News reported Friday. A third official, deputy defense secretary chief of staff Colin Carroll, was placed on leave as part of the same leak probe. Caldwell, Selnick and Carroll said they were \"incredibly disappointed by the manner in which our service at the Department of Defense ended\" in a joint statementshared on XSaturday. And the three said they \"still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of 'leaks' to begin with.\" CBS News also reported Sundaythat Hegseth shared information about airstrikes in Yemen last month in a group chat on the Signal messaging app that included his wife, brother and personal attorney.

    "title": "What we know about the victims of the FSU mass shooting",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 21, 2025 / 6:29 PM EDT/ CBS Miami Two people were killed and six were injured on April 17 during amass shooting at Florida State University's Student Union, officials said. Five victims were wounded by gunfire while a sixth was injured while fleeing the scene, police confirmed. The alleged shooter, identified as 20-year-old FSU studentPhoenix Ikner, was also wounded by responding officers and remained in the hospital. As of Monday, April 21, three of the six gunshot patients received at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital had been discharged, while two more were expected to be released soon, the hospital said. Another patient, presumably the suspected shooter, remained hospitalized in good condition, officials said. Authorities have not released the names of any victims. However, family members have identified the two people who were killed as Robert Morales, a university dining worker, and Tiru Chabba, a campus vendor. Tiru Chabba, a 45-year-old father of two, was killed in the shooting, according to a law firm representing the family. Chabba was on the FSU campus Thursday for his job as an employee of a campus vendor when the gunman opened fire, attorney Bakari Sellers of the Strom Law Firm said in a statement on Friday afternoon. Chabba is survived by his wife and two children. \"Tiru Chabba's family is going through the unimaginable now,\" Sellers said in a statement. \"Instead of hiding Easter eggs and visiting with friends and family, they're living a nightmare where this loving father and devoted husband was stolen from them in an act of senseless and preventable violence.\" \"We ask you to keep his family in your thoughts and prayers as we fight to ensure they see justice that honors the memories of Mr. Chabba and all the victims of Thursday's shooting.\" Robert Morales, 57, was a longtime employee in the university's dining services department. His death was confirmed by his brother, Ricardo Morales Jr., in apost on social mediaThursday night. \"Today we lost my younger brother,\" he wrote. \"He was one of the victims killed at FSU. He loved his job at FSU and his beautiful wife and daughter. I'm glad you were in my life.\" Ricardo Morales Jr. also confirmed his brother's death to CBS News Miami. According to theMiami Herald, Robert Morales was attending a meeting with other university employees when the shooting erupted. He was also the son of Ricardo \"Monkey\" Morales, acontroversial Cuban American CIA operativeand anti-Castro militant active during the Cold War. The elder Morales was killed in a bar fight in Miami in 1982. While the university has yet to officially confirm the victims' names,memorials of candles and flowershave begun to appear across campus, and avigil is scheduled for 5 p.m. Fridayat Langford Green. On Saturday, April 19, hospital staff sent out an update that one patient was sent home and that the others were good condition. By Monday,  April 21, a total of three patients of the FSU mass shooting had been released from the hospital, while two more were expected to be released soon, officials said. A six patient, presumably the suspected shooter, remained hospitalized in good condition, officials said. Hospital staff provided an update on the victims' conditions during a press conference on April 18 and briefly explained how each patient needed to be treated for gunshot wounds. The staff said at that time that all patients were in stable condition, with one of them in fair condition due to the extent of their injuries. Five patients were victims, the sixth was the alleged shooter, police confirmed. A sixth victim was injured while fleeing the scene but was not wounded by gunfire, police confirmed. In an interview from her hospital bed, 23-year-old FSU graduate student Madison Askins recounted the terrifying moments she was shot during Thursday's deadly attack on campus. \"The minute I got shot, I remember my parents telling me I just need to play dead,\" Askins told CBS News. \"So I released all the muscles in my body, I closed my eyes, I held my breath. I did everything I could to look like I was dead because I didn't want him to shoot me again. God forbid.\" Askins was among the people wounded in the shooting at the university's Student Union. She said the gunman was so close to her after she fell to the ground that she could hear him muttering to himself as he reloaded. \"It was just calm,\" she said. \"[He] literally said, 'Yeah, keep running.'\" Help eventually arrived. Askins said the moment a police officer began tending to her injuries, she knew she had survived the worst. According to Dr. Brett Howard, a trauma surgeon and the surgery team's leader, the hospital was notified about the shooting shortly before noon Thursday and leadership and medical staff immediately prepared for however many victims they needed to treat. \"The hardest part of it all is not knowing how many patients you're going to get,\" he said, adding that TMH staff was very proactive with its communication systems in place and activated the necessary resources by bringing additional staff to prepare for the worst. Howard said that the proximity of the hospital to the university also helped with the fast response and immediate treatment, adding that all six patients were seen within an hour of admission. He also highlighted that the relationship between hospital staff, law enforcement, and first responders also helped make the process go smoothly. Out of the six patients, three were brought into the operating room for surgery, with two of them needing abdominal surgery and the third needing facial surgery. The other patients also suffered gunshot wounds to their extremities, hospital staff said, but didn't specify exactly what kind of injuries they sustained. Among the hospital staff that treated the victims, one of the doctors was able to speak about the comparison of medical response between Thursday's shooting and the FSU library shooting over a decade ago. Doctor Shelby Blank, a general and breast surgeon who also on staff during the 2014 shooting, said it was a \"more limited situation\" compared to Thursday's tragedy. \"Unfortunately, traumatic violence is something that goes on, whether it's a few over the course of a weekend versus many compressed into a couple of hours,\" she said. Blank continued, saying that Thursday's shooting was \"catastrophic.\" \"Given the number of students in that compressed area, the recipe for disaster is very scary,\" she said.

    "title": "Student loan borrowers in default face garnished wages",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 21, 2025 / 6:29 PM EDT/ CBS News Washington— The Education Department will soon begincollecting payments for student loansthat are in default, including through wage garnishment for potentially millions of borrowers, the department announced Monday. Beginning May 5, the Education Department will begin involuntary collections through the Treasury Department's offset program, which claws back delinquent debts by withholding payments such as tax refunds, federal salaries and Social Security benefits. More than 5 million borrowers are in default and 4 million more could be in the same position in a few months, which would put nearly a quarter of the federal student loan portfolio in default, according to the Education Department. Less than 40% of borrowers are current on their student loan payments. In the next two weeks, those in default will receive emails informing them of the next steps and urging them to look into repayment options. Wage garnishment notices will be sent out later this summer. No federal student loan has been referred to collections since March 2020 when President Trump paused payments and interest accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden administration extended that pause, which ended in October 2024. Former President Joe Biden sought to wipe out student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his four years in the White House, but the effort was repeatedlyrejected by courts, including a2023 ruling by the Supreme Court. Still, the Biden administration erased student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers throughother forgiveness programs. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the Biden administration \"misled\" borrowers about its authority to waive debt. \"Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment — both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation's economic outlook,\" she said in a statement Monday. The announcement from the department added, \"There will not be any mass loan forgiveness.\" Caitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

    "title": "Real ID deadline is weeks away and most states aren't fully compliant yet",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 21, 2025 / 6:18 PM EDT/ CBS News In less than a month, Americans and permanent residents will only be able to pass through airport security or enter a federal government building if they have a Real ID. Most states are not yet fully compliant, though they've had 18 years to prepare for this deadline. A CBS News data analysis conducted from April 7-18 found that at least 16 states are less than 50% compliant with the law, which goes into effect May 7. The Transportation Security Administration currently plans to treat that date as an \"all hands on deck\" day because of the looming potential for disruptions at airport checkpoints. The chart below the article lists the states and their compliance so far with the Real ID requirement. TheReal IDis an enhanced ID card issued by state drivers license agencies. To obtain one, people are required to show a valid ID, as well as proof of identity, such as a passport or certified birth certificate, proof of a Social Security number and date of birth, plus two documents showing state residency, including a utility bill, credit card statement or rental agreement. So far, 28 states are less than 70% compliant. That means that in more than half the country, as many as three in every 10 travelers may not be able to pass through an airport checkpoint in just a few weeks. As of last week, New Jersey had the lowest compliance rate in the nation — just 17% of its state-issued IDs are Real IDs. Pennsylvania reported 26%, while Washington and Maine tell CBS News they are at 27% compliance. New York reports 43% compliance, and California has reached nearly 55% compliance. CBS News recently traveled to a Real ID Super Center in Chicago with a line extending out the door. In Illinois, two out of three residents lack a Real ID, which prompted the state to open the downtown location in an old Walgreens, aiming to process up to 1,500 new IDs a day as it tries to catch up with surging demand.  States mail the new IDs, however, so it can take up to two weeks to receive the new credential (a temporary paper licensewill not be considereda Real ID). Thirteen states reported compliance rates above 90%, with seven states — Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming and the District of Columbia — saying they're virtually 100% compliant. Texas reports 98% compliance, Mississippi 97%, Hawaii 96%, Utah 96% and Vermont 92%. TSA says it's seeing about 81% compliance at airport checkpoints — meaning passengers are showing up with either aReal ID-compliant driver's license or state ID, a passport, a valid military ID, an \"enhanced\" ID issued by a handful of states or other valid identification. Earlier this month, TSA told CBS News that on May 7, when travellers show up at a TSA checkpoint with a non-compliant legacy ID, they will be subject to additional screening. TSA officers will utilize a secondary identity verification process, similar to the one used when someone's ID is stolen or lost while traveling, to verify identity. But this can be a time-consuming process, so legacy ID holders should plan to be at the airport at least three hours before departure, instead of the usual two hours for a domestic flight. If the secondary identification verification fails, the traveler will not be allowed to enter the security checkpoint or the gate area. The agency had previously indicated there would be a phased enforcement policy. \"People will experience travel delays,\" TSA spokesperson Patricia Mancha told CBS News in a recent interview at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. \"People have had years to really plan for this, so TSA will simply enforce the laws and the rules as they apply.\" The Real ID law was passed in 2005, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to try to make state-issued identification more secure and harder to counterfeit. The deadline for implementation has been delayed several times, most recently because of thepandemic. Several fully compliant states began issuing Real IDs as far back as 2009, enabling all residents to obtain a compliant ID when they renewed an existing license. \"Any new issuance of driver's license, you had to prove your identity and lawful presence back in 2009,\" said Electra Bustle, the senior director of the Colorado Division of Motor Vehicles. She says the deadline delays helped the Centennial State to be ready for the May 7 deadline. \"We have a 10-year renewal cycle before you have to get a new photograph. You can see that moving it allowed us to ensure that we're at 100% of those who are eligible to be now — to have Real IDS.\" A Real ID can be identified by a black or gold star in the upper right corner of the ID. Sometimes the star appears in a circle, while California puts its star symbol inside a golden bear. Not everyone needs a Real ID. If you don't fly or enter federal government buildings, a legacy ID will continue to be valid until its expiration date. Tennessee did not respond to CBS News' inquiries, but based on local media reports, Tennessee at nearly 47% compliance. States continue to process Real ID applications, so compliance numbers will continue to change, and CBS News will update these figures before the May 7 deadline.

    "title": "Can Trump fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell? Here's what to know.",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 21, 2025 / 5:52 PM EDT/ CBS News President Trump remains on the attack against Jerome Powell, deriding the Federal Reserve chief in a social mediaposton Monday as a \"major loser\" and pressing him to lower interest rates \"NOW.\" The latest blast comes just days after Mr. Trump said on April 17 that Powell's \"termination cannot come fast enough.\" On Friday, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also said the Trump administration is studyingwhether firing Powellis an option. Interest rates are at the heart of Mr. Trump's complaint about Powell's performance, with the president arguing that the Fed should act to lower the cost of borrowing for consumers and businesses. The Fed has held its benchmark rate steady since its most recent cut in December because inflation has remained sticky, challenging the bank's efforts to bring price increases more in line with its 2% annual target. Mr. Trump has pointedly contrasted the Fed's caution in easing rates with the European Central Bank's move on April 17 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point. The Fed's most potent weapon against inflation is to ratchet up or maintain higher interest rates, because an increase in borrowing costs slows economic demand, which eases inflationary pressures. The White House declined further comment. Here's what to know about whether Mr. Trump can fire Powell. Board members of independent federal agencies like the Federal Reserve can only be forced out before their terms expire \"for cause.\" That was set by alandmark 1935 rulingby the Supreme Court that affirmed Congress' authority to create such agencies. \"The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others has often been stressed, and is hardly open to serious question,\" the courtruledin the case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States. But Mr. Trump has long challenged political norms, including empowering Elon Musk to slash the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Since Mr. Trump's second term began in January, he's also fired some independent regulators, actions that have been challenged in court. While lower courts found that Mr. Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board was unlawful, the Supreme Courttemporarily haltedthose decisions earlier this month. Powell was nominated to lead the Fed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he was re-nominated to serve another four-year term by President Joe Biden in November 2021. Mr. Trump has argued that Powell is moving too slowly to lower the Fed's benchmark interest rates, which affects the cost of borrowing for credit cards, auto loans, and other forms of consumer and business debt. The Federal Reserve's benchmark rate currently stands in a target range of 4.25% to 4.5%, the highest since 2007,accordingto Bankrate. \"With Energy Costs way down, food prices (including Biden's egg disaster!) substantially lower, and most other 'things' trending down, there is virtually No Inflation,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Monday. He added, \"With these costs trending so nicely downward, just what I predicted they would do, there can almost be no inflation, but there can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW.\" Inflation has receded from its post-pandemic high of 9.1% in June 2022, but it isn't yet at the Fed's goal of a 2% annual rate. In March, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.4% on an annual basis — a sign that inflation continues to percolate. Powell has signaled that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on theimpact of Mr. Trump's trade policies. In a speech last week at the Economic Club of Chicago, the Fed chief noted the Trump administration's tariffs are \"significantly larger than anticipated.\" \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth,\" he added. Still, Powell said the central bank can afford to wait to see how tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies play out before making any changes to interest rates. Wall Street analysts say investors are rattled by Mr. Trump's fierce criticism of Powell, who has earned plaudits for helping guide monetary policy so it douses inflation without causing a recession. By the end of 2024, most economists described the economy as being on firm ground, with solid growth, low unemployment and cooling inflation. The marketshuddered on Mondayas it digested Mr. Trump's latest post about Powell, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Composite and Nasdaq all losing more than 2%. Since the S&P 500's most recent high in February, the index has lost more than 16% of its value, placing it in correction territory. \"The risk is now twofold. First, that Powell holds the line and policy stays restrictive longer than markets had priced,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, in a report. \"Second, that Trump intervenes — publicly or politically — sparking concerns over central bank independence.\" The Fed has historically guarded itsindependence,which allows it to pursue its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and the labor market at full employment without political pressure. After Mr. Trump was elected in November, Powell said hewouldn't step downif asked by the president. Powell has also noted that, under the law, presidents may not fire or demote the Fed chair. Powell's term as Fed chair ends May 15, 2026. Some lawmakers and other Federal Reserve officials are coming to Powell's defense. On Sunday, Republican Sen. John Kennedy from Louisiana defended Powell on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" and added that, \"I don't think the president, any president, has the right to remove the Federal Reserve chairman.\" \"The Federal Reserve ought to be independent,\" he said. Also Sunday, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbeesaid on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\"that undermining the central bank's independence could lead to higher inflation, slower economic growth and weaker hiring. \"[T]he fact is, the inflation rate is higher, growth is slower, the job market is worse,\" he said. \"So we really — I strongly hope that we do not move ourselves into an environment where monetary independence is questioned. Because that would undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" William English, an economist at the Yale School of Management and a former senior Fed staffer, told the Associated Press that Trump's attacks on the Fed aren't \"going to make the American people better off over time.\" \"They'll end up in all likelihood with higher inflation, and that is not something that people want,\" he said.

    "title": "New images could change cancer diagnostics, but ICE detained the Harvard scientist who analyzes them",
    "article_text": "A groundbreaking microscope at Harvard Medical School could lead to breakthroughs in cancer detection and research into longevity. But the scientist who developed computer scripts to read its images and unlock its full potential has been in an immigration detention center for two months — putting crucial scientific advancements at risk. The scientist, the 30-year-old Russian-born Kseniia Pertova, worked at Harvard’s renowned Kirschner Lab until her arrest at a Boston airport in mid-February. She is now being held at ICE’s Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, and fighting possible deportation to Russia, where she said she fears persecution and jail time over her protests against the war in Ukraine. Petrova’s case and the detention of academics across the country has damaged the ability of universities in the United States to recruit and retain leading talent, experts and Petrova’s colleagues said. In fields where expertise is often highly specialized, the loss of talent could have dire consequences globally for the future of medicine and scientific discovery. Scientists and faculty members are planning to leave institutions across the country, legal experts said, because they’re worried that their visas could be revoked or that they could be swept up in immigration actions. “I would call it a grinding machine,” Petrova,who spoke with NBC News from the Louisiana facility, said about being detained. “We are in this machine, and it doesn’t care if you have a visa, a green card, or any particular story. ... It just keeps going.” Petrova’s first immigration court hearing in Louisiana is scheduled for Tuesday morning. Her lawyer, Gregory Romanovsky, said that they expect to have more information on her asylum case after the hearing. Dr. Leon Peshkin, a principal research scientist at Harvard’s Department of Systems Biology and Petrova’s manager and mentor, received a call from Customs and Border Protection on Feb. 16 after agents detained Petrova at Logan International Airport in Boston for failing to declare samples of frog embryos to be used in scientific research. “We just got a call saying, ‘She’s denied entry. That’s all we can tell you to protect her privacy,’” he said. Peshkin added that the caller didn’t disclose Petrova’s whereabouts, leaving him scrambling  to track her down. Romanovsky said that CBP typically imposes two penalties for such customs violations: the forfeiture of the items and a fine, usually around $500, and that “for a first-time violation, the fine is typically reduced to $50.” Instead, officials canceled Petrova’s J-1 scholar visa. “It appears to be part of a broader effort to create an unwelcoming and hostile environment for noncitizens,” Romanovsky said. A DHS spokesperson told NBC News on Monday that Petrova had been “lawfully detained after lying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.” “They asked if I have any biological samples in my luggage. I said yes,” Petrova said before describing her confusion over procedures and an interrogation by Customs and Border Patrol officers. “Nobody knew what was happening to me. I didn’t have any contact, not to my lawyer, not to Leon, not to anybody. And the next day, they didn’t say what would happen. I was waiting in a cell,” she said. Peshkin said international researchers have become increasingly worried in response to the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to illegal immigration. When asked whether he’s concerned that these policies might discourage other international scientists from coming to Harvard, he said: “I’m not concerned that it may. I am horrified that it does.” “It’s already having an effect. I hear from many colleagues that people who were planning to stay have changed their minds because they need to travel,” Peshkin said, adding that scientists often attend conferences around the world to present their research and share knowledge. Arecent survey by the scientific journal Naturerevealed that 75% of the 1,600 scientists surveyed were considering relocating to Europe or Canada, citing actions taken by President Donald Trump. Separately,a tracking database from Inside Higher Edshows that, as of April 18, more than 240 colleges and universities have reported that over 1,550 international students and recent graduates have had their legal status changed by the U.S. State Department. About 180 international students have filed 28 federal lawsuits seeking to regain their Student and Exchange Visitor Program status or U.S. visas, Inside Higher Ed reports.A lawsuit filed by international students, among them Ph.D. candidates in STEM fields, on April 15 argues that recent visa terminations are “arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” The plaintiffs argue that the sudden policy changes threaten their academic and professional futures. Harvard recruited Petrova about two years ago. She graduated from the prestigious Russian Physics and Technology Institute and came highly recommended, Peshkin said. She also attended the same high school in Moscow that he did, a place he describes as being for “people who are usually selfless, devoted, fanatic scientists, ascetics.” “These are people who aren’t in science to make money. They’re in science because they feel it’s their mission to understand how nature works and find cures,” Peshkin said. Peshkin immediately saw this quality in Petrova’s devotion to her work and her willingness to go beyond computational science, which was what she was recruited to do. He explained that their lab’s research “requires a unique set of skills because you have to both be able to work as an embryologist and do applied math, modeling, data analysis and bioinformatics — all in one package.” When asked how many people in his lab could do all of that, he said simply: “That was only her. It was only her.” Others echoed that sentiment. Dr. William Trim, a postdoctoral fellow who is a co-worker and housemate of Petrova, underscored her irreplaceable role in their research project using the one-of-a-kind microscope. Petrova developed the computer scripts to analyze the 100,000 images contained in the microscope. “I’m very confident she is the only way we can achieve the true potential of this microscope and the insights we could make,” Trim said. “Without her, I fully believe that all the insights into cures or fundamental biology that we could make will not be made.” Trim visited her at the correctional center in Louisiana. He recently sent her biology books upon request, so she can study while in detention. He, like others, described her as uniquely dedicated to her work. Petrova doesn’t see herself that way — she’s just passionate about the work and her team, and told NBC News in interviews over video link that she thinks the job at the Kirschner lab was “a miracle.” In 2021, after earning her master’s, Petrova was recruited by Dr. Konstantin Severinov, a prominent Rutgers molecular biologist, for a genome-sequencing project in Moscow. “She’s a very talented scientist with huge potential … the capacity to be the best of the best,” he said. When asked about her political activism, Petrova said that she believes there “should be democracy in science,” and that America was a “beautiful place” where people can express themselves freely. “I don’t want to hide my political opinion,” she said. “If you want to say something against Putin, there is no way you won’t be in prison. There is no way you won’t be arrested.” Trim and a growing number of international scientists are increasingly worried by how immigration policies are being enforced in the United States. Meanwhile, he and his colleagues anxiously await Petrova’s fate. “We really don’t know if we’re ever going to see her again,” he said, “because if they deport her to Russia, we may never see her again.”",

    "title": "Visa is reinstated for BYU student from Japan who had a fishing citation and speeding tickets",
    "article_text": "A Brigham Young University student from Japan discovered that his visa was reinstated last week after it had been  abruptly revoked a few weeks ago, his attorney told NBC News. Suguru Onda, a doctoral student and father of five, had received a notice from government officials that his legal status was terminated because he was “identified in criminal records check and/or has had their VISA revoked.” Adam Crayk, his attorney, told theNBC News affiliate KSL-TV in Salt Lake City that Onda has no record aside from a few speeding tickets and a fishing-related citation, and that he believes AI software likely mistakenly terminated the visa. But he’s been given little explanation for the reversal. “I’m just grateful to be here,” Onda told KSL. The State Department declined NBC News’ request for comment. The Department of Homeland Security did not elaborate on Onda’s case “due to privacy concerns and visa confidentiality.” “DHS, through ICE HSI, conducts regular reviews of records in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to ensure visa holders remain in compliance with program requirements,” a senior DHS official said. The attorney told KSL that he suspects officials are not thoroughly checking the names that are being pulled by the AI software. DHS has created a task force that uses data analytic tools to scour the social media histories of international students, as well as criminal charges or records,three sources familiar with the operation told NBC Newsthis month. Crayk said that BYU, in Provo, Utah, received an email about the reinstatement just minutes after Onda, a doctoral student who is a year away from finishing his degree in computer science, filed a lawsuit with several other international students in Utah against the Department of Homeland Security for terminating their statuses. They argue in the lawsuit that their due process and other Fifth Amendment rights were violated. The reinstatement, however, came as a surprise, Crayk said, especially since no immigration officials had reached out. “He is reinstated as if it was never revoked,” Crayk told KSL. Onda, who’s been in the U.S. for roughly six years, had been given 15 days to return to Japan or face deportation. With little social media presence and no history of political activism, Onda was likely flagged, Crayk told the Deseret News, because of the 2019 catch-and-release fishing violation from a church outing. It was eventually dismissed. “He didn’t catch a fish — but because he was the organizer or the face of the activity, [Onda] was cited for harvesting more than their license permitted,”Crayk told the News.",

    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's bag — including $3,000 in cash — was stolen while she was out dining with family on Sunday night, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to NBC News on Monday. Noem was at Capital Burger, a restaurant in downtown Washington, according to two people familiar with the theft. When asked why Noem had so much cash in her purse, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin responded: “Her entire family was in town including her children and grandchildren — she was using the withdrawal to treat her family to dinner, activities, and Easter gifts.” CNN was thefirst to reporton the theft. At approximately 7:55 p.m. ET, a man wearing an N-95 mask walked into the restaurant and up a few stairs to where Noem was eating dinner,the two people said. Follow live politics coverage here He sat near Noem's table and scooted his chair close to hers before carefully taking his foot and sliding her purse toward him, according to surveillance footage viewed by law enforcement, the sources said, adding that within minutes the man picked up Noem's purse and placed it under his jacket, walked out of the restaurant and down the street. It’s unclear whether Noem was specifically targeted. Investigators are looking into whether the man knew the purse belonged to a Cabinet secretary. In addition to the cash, Noem’s bag also included her DHS personal identity verification card that provides access to secure agency buildings, as well as credit cards, blank checks, her passport, driver’s license and a set of keys, the sources familiar with the theft  said. At least two on-duty plainclothes members of the U.S. Secret Service were seated at the restaurant's bar, in between where Noem was seated and the front doors, according to a source who witnessed the meal and said that the restaurant wasn’t very busy at the time. It’s unclear if any additional agents were seated near Noem's table, which was upstairs, far from the front entrance. A restaurant manager on dutyMonday told NBC News that footage was controlled by Darden Restaurants and directed media questions there. The corporate office for Darden Restaurants, which owns Capital Burger, did not respond to requests for comment. During the White House Easter Egg Roll on Monday, NBC News asked Noem about her purse being stolen, but she said she couldn't provide a comment or details. \"I don't think I can comment on it yet,\" she said. \"It's not resolved yet.\" Noem said the U.S. Secret Service was aware of the theft but said she hadn't spoken to agency personnel yet about what happened. Asked for comment, a Secret Service spokesperson referred NBC News to DHS. Noem has been an outspoken member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet, pushing his hard-line policies of deporting undocumented immigrants and fortifying the U.S.-Mexico border to slow illegal migration. Before joining the administration, Noem was the governor of South Dakota and a member of the House.",

    "title": "Whooping cough surges as uptake of vaccines falters",
    "article_text": "Kate and Greg Moor weren’t thinking“whooping cough”when their son, 13-year-old Joe, started having coughing fits in early March. Joe probably just had alate winter virus, the Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, couple figured. Maybe it was spring allergies. Other than the coughing, he seemed fine. Cough medicine didn’t touch Joe’s brutal and increasingly frequent coughing jags — sometimes every five to 10 minutes for hours at a time. “It was a very violent cough. I just had to pause what I was doing and wait until I was done coughing,” Joe said. “Sometimes it felt like I’d throw up.” It was difficult to watch Joe’s body convulse uncontrollably, said his mom, Kate. “Nothing seemed to be working,” she said. “It just seemed really aggressive. He’d double over.” Tests revealed that Joe had pertussis, a bacterial infection. It’s also called whooping cough because of the sound some kids make during the coughing fits that Joe experienced. The constant hacking is exhausting and sometimes life-threatening, doctors say, especially for small children and babies with tiny airways. “They’re unable to catch their breath,” said Dr. Sapna Singh of Texas Children’s Pediatrics near Houston. “They’re fighting for air. They’re fighting to breathe.” The virulent cough is unparalleled. “I had a patient this year who broke two ribs coughing,” said Dr. Molly O’Shea, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “We had an infant who coughed so hard that they ended up with a pneumothorax,” also known as a collapsed lung. “That’s essentially when your lung pokes a hole out of itself and air starts collecting outside the lung.” Whooping cough has been increasing since the early 2000s, according toCenters for Disease Control and Prevention data, with about 10,000 reported cases each year. The spread slowed during the pandemic lockdown, as many infectious illnesses did, but cases are rising once again. In Michigan, where the Moor family lives, whooping cough cases have skyrocketed. There were 110 cases in the state in 2023, according to thestate’s department of health. In 2024, 2,081 cases were reported — a nearly 1,800% increase. The state’s on track to meet or exceed last year’s number. In 2025, 497 whooping cough cases have been reported in Michigan. In Louisiana, two young infants died of pertussis within the last six months, the state'ssurgeongeneral posted on Facebookat the end of March. In South Dakota, aschool-age child died froma co-infection of influenza and pertussisin January, the Department of Health reported.Pertussis contributed to the deathof an adult in Idaho in February, according to the state's Central District Health. The most common complication of whooping cough is pneumonia, which can be fatal. So far this year, there have been 8,064 reported cases of whooping cough in the U.S., compared with 3,835 for the same time in 2024,according to the CDC. And there weremore than four times as many whooping cough casesin the U.S. in 2024 compared with 2023.",

    "title": "Psilocybin use is on the rise as public perception changes, report shows",
    "article_text": "More Americans are using psilocybin, the hallucinogenic compound found in psychedelic mushrooms. A report published Monday in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine found psilocybin use has been rising since 2019, after remaining relatively stable for years. “That tells us something is changing,” said Kari Rockhill, an epidemiologist and assistant statistical scientist at Rocky Mountain Poison & Drug Safety in Denver, who worked on the report. In adults, a changing public perception of psychedelics is likely at the forefront of this shift — combined with decriminalization of psilocybin across several U.S. jurisdictions. “We saw a similar phenomenon with cannabis when it started to be legalized across the country. There is probably a stigma around this that is going down,” Rockhill said. In 2019, thecity of Denvervoted to decriminalize theSchedule I drug, allowing people to grow and gift, but not sell, psychedelic mushrooms that contain psilocybin.Oregonfollowed suit in 2020, and decriminalization expanded to the entirestate of Coloradoin 2022. Books like Michael Pollan’s “How to Change Your Mind” have also helped change public perception of psychedelics, said Dr. Todd Korthuis, an internist and addiction medicine specialist at Oregon Health and Science University. “This is not surprising at all given the developments over the last 10 years,” said Korthuis, who is also co-director of the Open Psychedelic Evaluation Nexus, which conducts research on psychedelics. Andrew Yockey, an assistant professor of public health at the University of Mississippi, added that anunregulated online market, mountingresearchthat suggests psilocybin could be used as a treatment for mental health conditions, anda riseinmicrodosingalso likely contributed to the increase in use. Indeed, the researchers found that psilocybin use was highest among adults with mental health or chronic pain conditions. Rockhill and her team analyzed five national databases that included self-reported data on psilocybin use, calls made to 55 poison control centers, and medical records to get a picture of how many people used psilocybin across the nation from 2014 through 2023. Overall, use of the drug remains relatively low: In 2023 — the most recent year for which data was available — just about 2% of adults in the U.S. said they had taken psilocybin in the past year. Twelve percent reported ever taking the drug, up from 10% in 2019, when rates began to increase. Among adults ages 18 to 29, past-year psilocybin use rose by 44%, to 2.1% in 2023; for adults ages 30 and up, use nearly tripled, to 1.8% in 2023. About 2.5% of 12th graders reported using psilocybin in the last year in 2023, a 53% increase from 2019. “It is interesting to see the rise in adolescents,” Yockey said. “I want to see where they are getting it from, why they are taking it.” The study also found that calls to poison control centers for psilocybin rose sharply over the study period, particularly among children ages 11 and under. In 2023, calls for this age group rose 723% from 2019, though the rates were still low, at less than one child per 100,000 people. For children 12 to 18, calls increased 317%, to just over two people per 100,000. Adults saw a 200% increase in calls, rising to a rate of less than half a person per 100,000. In addition, 1,550 people, including 1,192 adults, sought medical care because of psilocybin in 2023. From 2015 to 2021, there were just three cases involving medical care. The calls to poison control for the children under 11 in the report were almost certainly due to kids getting into psilocybin edibles that were not meant for them, Korthuis said. Although psilocybin alone has a relatively safe toxicology profile, meaning it’s highly unlikely to cause life-threatening physical health problems, anunregulated market of ediblescan lead to people ingesting thingsother than psilocybin, even if the packaging does not list them, Yockey said. “If someone comes to the ER saying I have psilocybin exposure, one of the first things a doctor should do is test for it,” he added.",

    "article_text": "The U.S. Department of Education on Monday said it's restarting \"involuntary\" repayment of federal student loans that are in default. The payments were paused during the first term of President Donald Trump in 2020 as a response to the Covid pandemic. \"Beginning May 5, the department will begin involuntary collection through the Treasury Department’s offset program, which withholds payments from the government — including tax refunds, federal salaries and other benefits — from people with past-due debts to the government,\" the department said in a statement. Wages will be garnished following a 30-day warning, it added. An estimated 5.3 million borrowers are in default on their federal student loans, though the department said that number could reach 10 million in a few months. Repayment will be administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, and affected borrowers will get notices in the next two weeks, the department said in a statement. The administration of President Joe Biden continued to pause repayment under a campaign promise to relieve student debt, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2023 his plan was not constitutional because itdid not fall under congressional approval. “American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,” said U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. “The Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear.\"",

    "article_text": "Embattled Dallas Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison was peppered with questions Monday about his decision to trade Luka Dončić in February, admitting he didn’t know exactly how much Mavericks fans cared about the former franchise superstar. Answering questions from reporters at an end-of-season news conference, Harrison was asked whether the “anger and outrage” from fans exceeded what he expected when he made the decision to trade Dončić, who led Dallas to the NBA Finals in 2023. “I knew Luka was important to the fan base,” Harrison said. “I didn’t quite know it to what level.” Dončić, a five-time NBA All-Star and five-time All-NBA First Team selection,was traded to the Los Angeles Lakerson Feb. 2 in a move that shocked the basketball world. In his introductory news conference with the Lakers, Dončić — who is second only to Michael Jordan in postseason scoring average — said heplanned to signan extension with the Mavericks this summer. He has also since said heplanned to spend his entire careerin Dallas. Harrison has been widely criticized for the move, most vociferously by the team’s own fans. Immediately after the trade, Mavericks fans created something of a memorial for Dončić right outside the team’s home arena. Harrison has also been subject to numerous “Fire Nico” chants at home games since the transaction. In a meeting with selected reporters this month, Harrisonsaid he had “no regrets”about the trade, reportedly repeating the phrase “defense wins championships” when he was asked about his reasoning for the move. To make matters worse for Dallas, point guard Kyrie Irving tore his ACL in early March, and forward Anthony Davis, the centerpiece of the return package for Dončić, appeared in only nine regular season games for the Mavericks because of injuries. Dallas ultimately missed the playoffs after it lost to the Memphis Grizzlies in the second round of the Play-In Tournament. Harrison was asked directly by a reporter why he should still have his job after the turmoil of the last three months. “I think I’ve done a really good job here,” Harrison said. “I don’t think I can be judged by injuries this year. You have to be judged in totality from beginning to end.” On April 9, Dončić played in his first game back in Dallas since he joined the Lakers. He visibly cried during the team’s tribute video for him during the game. He also scored 45 points in a 112-97 win for Los Angeles.",

    "title": "Pope Francis created a 'seismic shift' toward acceptance, LGBTQ Catholics say",
    "article_text": "In July 2013, Pope Francis posed a question that marked a radical shift in the Catholic Church’s treatment of gay people. “If a person is gay and seeks God and has goodwill, who am I to judge him?” he asked reporters in 2013. “Who am I to judge?” Francis died early Monday, the day after Easter, and LGBTQ Catholics and theologians recalled the comment as one of the first Francis made that promoted acceptance of queer people. It was a dramatic departure from the way the previous figureheads of the Holy See and church doctrine had often spoken about gay people, describing homosexuality as “an intrinsic moral evil” and an “objective disorder,” and the relatively accepting tone would go on to become a major theme of Francis’ papacy and, now, his complex legacy. Francis would go on to urge parents not to condemn their gay children and approve priests' blessing same-sex unions. However, “he wasn’t perfect” in the eyes of LGBTQ Catholics, said Jason Steidl Jack, an assistant teaching professor of religious studies at St. Joseph’s University, New York. Just after the “Who am I to judge?” remark, Francis saidhomosexuality is still a sinunder Catholic doctrine. He also referred to gay peoplewith slurs on at least two occasions, Steidl Jack said, and spoke negatively aboutwhat he called “gender ideology.”He also said blessings of same-sex couplescouldn’t resemble traditional marriage vows. But what made Francis’ papacy historic is that, unlike his predecessors, he met with LGBTQ people from around the world and listened to their stories. “He could have conversations that just weren’t possible under John Paul II and Benedict XVI,” Steidl Jack said of the two popes before Francis. “As the years of his papacy went on, he seemed to get more open, both to gays and lesbians, but also to the trans community. This is a level of openness that was unthinkable before Pope Francis. It’s been a revolution of compassion, a revolution of welcome, and it’s changed the church. It’s changed the church’s relationship to the LGBTQ community.” Francis’ positive remarks about the LGBTQ community were a “seismic shift” in the church’s treatment of gay and lesbian people, said Marianne Duddy-Burke, the executive director of DignityUSA, which advocates for LGBTQ rights within the Catholic Church. In response to the organization’s advocacy, the Vatican issued a controversial “Letter to the Bishops on the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons” in 1986, which resulted in many of the organization’s chapters being expelled from their home parishes and barred from meeting on Catholic properties, Duddy-Burke said. Nearly three decades later, the Vatican invited Duddy-Burke, who is also a co-chair of Global Network of Rainbow Catholics, an international organization of LGBTQ Catholics, and two other members of the organization to meet with Francis during a synod assembly in October 2023. They talked to him about the importance of his statement earlier that year calling for thedecriminalization of homosexualityworldwide but told him that the sentiment needed to be implemented by Catholic bishops and politicians. They also told him LGBTQ people are often still excluded from Catholic churches and discussed the importance of gender-affirming health care for transgender people. “He was very warm, and he laughed with us, and he made eye contact through the whole thing,” Duddy-Burke said. “He sat and held our hands and hugged one of us.” At the end of their meeting, Francis told them, in Italian, “Your work is important. Keep pressing on,” Duddy-Burke said through tears as she recalled the moment. She said there was a huge public response to photos and news about the meeting, which “showed just how significant it was for representatives [of the community] to be seen with the pope.” Michael O’Loughlin, author of “Hidden Mercy: AIDS, Catholics, and the Untold Stories of Compassion in the Face of Fear,”wrote a letter to Francis after O’Loughlin published his bookto tell the pontiff about the conversations he had with Catholic nuns and priests who went against the teachings of the church at the time and worked behind the scenes to care for people dying from AIDS-related illnesses. In August 2021, Francis wrote back. The letter was written in Spanish but was translated to English. He thanked O’Loughlin for shining a light on the priests, religious sisters and lay people who supported those who were sick from HIV and AIDS. “Instead of indifference, alienation and even condemnation, these people let themselves be moved by the mercy of the Father and allowed that to become their own life’s work; a discreet mercy, silent and hidden, but still capable of sustaining and restoring the life and history of each one of us,” Francis wrote. “I’ll always remember Francis for creating space for LGBT people to tell our own stories in the church,” said O’Loughlin, who is also the executive director of Outreach, an LGBTQ Catholic organization. “While some LGBT advocates point out that he maybe didn’t go far enough in what they had hoped he would do, he nonetheless created these opportunities for us to show that we want to live our lives in the church just like any other Catholics.” Max Kuzma, a lifelong Catholic and transgender advocate, said he was also struck by Francis’ pastoral presence and compassion when he met the pontiff last year. Kuzma said he introduced himself to Francis, in Spanish, as a transgender man. It was a busy moment, Kuzma said, and Francis was being pushed along in his wheelchair, so he didn’t respond verbally. “But it was his expression and the way that he grasped my hand,” Kuzma said. “I really felt that moment of acceptance and love and support, a very pastoral feeling when you look in the eyes of the pope.” Though Francis’ gestures of acceptance for LGBTQ people set an example for other Catholic Church leaders, Steidl Jack said, it’s unclear how far they will carry into the next papacy, because Francis didn’t fundamentally change church doctrine. “If you open up the Catechism, it still describes homosexuality as intrinsically disordered, as something that goes against God’s purposes for human sexuality, and that is opposed to human flourishing,” Steidl Jack said. He added that after Francis issued the document allowing for blessings of same-sex couples, he faced backlash from priests in parts of Africa and Eastern Europe, and he was likely afraid that pushing for doctrinal change too quickly would cause a schism in the church. Francis’ statements regarding LGBTQ people also haven’t been entirely positive and have often been contradictory. For example, at the start of the pandemic, Francis beganmeeting with trans women, many of them sex workers, at the Vatican. In 2023, he also saidtrans people can be baptizedand can become godparents. However, in March 2024, he called “gender ideology” the“ugliest danger” of our time. Kuzma said that statement, combined with the United States Conference of Catholic Bishopspraising President Donald Trump’s executive orderbarring trans women and girls from competing in female sports, makes him nervous about the future if the next pope is hostile toward trans people. “That unhelpfully fed into some of the culture war stuff,” Kuzma said, especially in more conservative Catholic spaces, which Kuzma said he used to be a part of. Still, Kuzma said he believes that if Francis had lived longer, he would’ve formed friendships with trans people in the way he formed afriendship with Juan Carlos Cruz, a survivor of clerical sexual abuse. In 2018, regarding Cruz being gay, Francis famously told him,“God made you like this.”In 2021, heappointed Cruz to a commissionfor protecting minors. Kuzma said such friendships would’ve likely changed Francis’ mind. Steidl Jack agreed, saying that one of the major lessons from Francis’ pontificate was that he “didn’t get things right all the time,” but he was willing to listen. “He was willing to spend time with people and accept them as they are,” Steidl Jack said. “I believe he grew from that, and I believe the church grew from that as well. And that’s where the church needs to continue growing. It’s a ministry of listening to, a ministry of openness. It’s a ministry of being willing to learn.”",

    "title": "Trump Administration to resume collections on student loan borrowers in default",
    "article_text": "By Jonaki Mehta , Steve Drummond U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, D.C..Al Drago/ABACA via Reutershide caption After a five-year hiatus, the U.S. Department of Education says it will begin resuming collections of defaulted student loans on May 5. Of the more than 42.7 million student loan borrowers in the U.S., who owe a collective $1.6 trillion, the department says that more than 5 million have not made a payment in the past year. That number is expected to grow as an additional 4 million borrowers are approaching default status. \"American taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\" U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement. The department said it will begin notifying borrowers who are in default via email over the next two weeks, urging them to make a payment or to enroll in a repayment plan, and referring them to agovernment websiteproviding information on how to do so. Then, on May 5, the department will begin referring borrowers who remain in default to a collections program run by the Treasury Department. \"This could not have come at a worst time for millions of Americans,\" said Aissa Canchola Bañez, Policy Director for the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit group that aims to reduce student debt. Those borrowers, she added, \"are already finding themselves having to navigate such incredible economic uncertainty over the last few months.\" She also points to the fact that older borrowers tend to face the greatest struggles in repaying their loans: nearly 40 percent of federal borrowers over the age of 65 were in default on their student loans, according toa 2017 report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"These are older folks who are on fixed incomes,\" she says. When borrowers fall behind, Bañez added, their credit scores can take a hit, making it harder to qualify for more credit and other loans for things like housing and other basic needs. The Education Department said in its notice that, later this summer, it will begin the process of garnishing wages—meaning payments would be automatically deducted from borrowers' paychecks.

    "title": "The Justice Department and Google battle over how to fix a search engine monopoly",
    "article_text": "Jaclyn Diaz Abigail Slater, US assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division, speaks to members of the media outside federal court in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, April 21, 2025. Google will square off against the Justice Department and dozens of state attorneys general in a Washington court room over what changes the judge will order to prevent the company from monopolizing the online search market.Kent Nishimura/Bloomberg via Getty Imageshide caption Nearly a year ago, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google hadacted illegally to maintain a monopolyon the search engine market. It was a decision that sent shockwaves through Silicon Valley and Washington. Now, lawyers for Google and the Justice Department arefacing off againat the E. Barrett Prettyman United States Courthouse in Washington, D.C. This time it's to determine what penalties Mehta will levy against the roughly $2 trillion company. Over the next several weeks, both sides will present evidence and are expected to call a host of witnesses, including major tech industry players. That includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of search engine competitor DuckDuckGo, as well as senior VP's of Yahoo, Apple, Microsoft, ChatGPT and Google, according to court documents — though that lineup could change. Google maintains that it will appeal Mehta's decision once the remedies phase of the trial is complete. The tech giant argues that the DOJ's proposed remedies are both dangerous and \"unprecedented\" and would hurt American consumers, the economy and tech leadership and innovation. On Sunday, the night, before the hearing was to begin, Google issueda lengthy public blog postsaying the DOJ's \"sweeping remedy proposals are both unnecessary and harmful.\" In response, on Monday morning as she stood outside the courthouse, Gail Slater, the DOJ's Assistant Attorney for the Antitrust Decision, replied, \"You know what is dangerous? The threat Google presents to our freedom of speech\" and the freedom of digital market innovation. Slater was joined by other attorneys for the government who read from statements about an hour before proceedings began. They did not take questions from the gathered media. Inside the courtroom, two tables full of lawyers from the DOJ and Google sat elbow to elbow as proceedings began. David Dahlquist, the acting deputy director of the DOJ's antitrust civil litigation division, spoke for the government in opening statements. In a roughly 45-minute presentation, he laid out a list of aggressive demands that the government wants to see Google implement. The DOJ is calling on the company to divest from Chrome, its web browser, and to end exclusive distribution agreements with phone makers like Apple and Samsung, through which Google paid them to establish its search engine as the default browser on their phones. The DOJ is also calling on Judge Mehta to prevent Google from establishing similar exclusive distribution agreements for its AI programs and apps, like its Gemini chatbot, Dahlquist said Monday. \"We are not here for a Pyrrhic victory. We are here to restore competition,\" Dahlquist said. This is an inflection point, he said. He asked the court: Will the U.S. allow Google, a monopolist, control the search market, or allow competition to prevail? The legal battle began in 2020, when the Justice Department filed its antitrust lawsuit against Google. The crux of the government's argument is that Google has unfair control of a huge market share in U.S. search, a valuation eclipsing$1 trillion. TheDOJ's original lawsuit, filed alongside 11 state attorneys general, said the company struck multibillion-dollar deals with Apple and Samsung to make sure its search engine was the default on their phones' web browsers. Those agreements effectively boxed out Google's rivals, the DOJ said. Google has denied this. This case marked the beginning of the endof the long love affairbetween the tech world and Washington, D.C. For many years, the tech industry expanded with little regulatory control. But major tech playersMeta,AmazonandAppleare now also facing federal lawsuits. In the very same courthouse where the Google remedy trial is playing out,Meta is currently facing its own antitrust casefiled by the Federal Trade Commision. The agency argues Meta has abused its power and acted as a monopoly by acquiring rivals in order to vanquish them as competitors. And this isn't the government's only suit against Google: They filed another in 2023. Last week,a different federal judge ruledthat Google's control of the online advertising and ad-tech markets violates U.S. antitrust laws. The government's most forceful request is for Judge Mehta to order the tech company to sell off its popular Chrome browser. Chrome is a significant gateway to user searches and drives billions in search revenue for Google, Dahlquist said. It's the world's most popular search engine. Forcing Google to sell off this piece of the company would \"allow rivals to compete,\" he said. He called it \"a market reality\" that Google's ownership of Chrome disincentivizes the emergence of new, competitive alternatives, and that this is a violation of federal antitrust laws. Google, for its part, has roundly rejected this proposal. The DOJ is also asking that Google stop making monthly third-party payments to phone makers to ensure its browser is the default option on those phones. Dahlquist said Google has proposed deleting the word \"exclusive\" in their agreements with Apple and other companies with any other browser distribution agreements. \"That is not enough,\" he said, arguing that Google can still wedge out other companies by using their existing base agreements and their ability to offer phone makers large sums of money. The government wants to go a step further to ensure any remedy prevents Google from establishing similar exclusive agreements for its generative AI products, like Gemini. Dahlquist said the rise of Google's AI products could open up another field the company could dominate if it's allowed to keep using exclusive contracts — and they want to prevent that from happening. Google has long vowed to appeal, but first must make it through this remedy trial process. The company has contended for the past four years that it has never acted as a monopoly and that changes, even small ones, are unnecessary. The company's leaders have said its search product is superior to competitors' — and that's why it dominates the industry. John E. Schmidtlein, a lawyer for Google, argued in opening statements that the DOJ's list of remedies in this case is just a \"wishlist for competitors,\" and that it will enable them to get resources that took Google decades to develop. The DOJ's proposals aim \"to prop up individual competitors,\" he said. Google views the government's demands to divest from Chrome as its most prohibitive and \"most extreme\" request. The company's leaders have said splitting off Chrome would break the hugely popular feature — a statement Schmidtlein repeated in court. Google can't divest from the Chrome browser without harming other Google products, like the Chrome operating system and Chromebook laptops, he said. Addressing the DOJ's effort to prevent Google from including Gemini in future exclusive distribution agreements, Schmidtlein said that Gemini was not the subject of the antitrust case and the company does not hold a monopoly on AI products. Schmidtlein pointed to the success of competitors' AI chatbots, such asChatGPT, MetaAI, and Grok, as evidence that competition within this space is healthy and varied. \"The notion that ChatGPT can't get distribution is absurd. They have more distribution than anyone,\" he said. Rebecca Haw Allensworth, a professor of antitrust law at Vanderbilt Law School, points out that this is the government's biggest antitrust case in decades. \"This case is an extremely big deal. It's hard to overstate it,\" she said. \"It is at least as big a deal as the Microsoft case, which is the last big antitrust case that we had. And that was 25 years ago.\" That Microsoft case, which was filed in 1998, was about the company bundlingitsbrowser, Internet Explorer, with its Windows operating system. It nearly led to the company being split in two — but Microsoft and the DOJ settled. Allensworth added that it's also comparable to cases like the Justice Department's 1906 Standard Oil case, which is widely considered the first major monopoly case. A federal court eventually found that the oil conglomerate owned by John D. Rockefeller had illegally monopolized the American refining industry. Standard Oil was ordered to break up into around 40 different companies as a result. Allensworth said the outcome of this part of Google's trial is hard to predict. But that demanding Google divest from Chrome is not out of the question. Google is a financial supporter of NPR. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "'I'm praying to him today': Nancy Pelosi remembers Pope Francis",
    "article_text": "By Mary Louise Kelly , Courtney Dorning , Patrick Jarenwattananon , Alejandra Marquez Janse Rep. Nancy Pelosi shakes hands with Pope Francis on Capitol Hill in September 2015.Nikki Kahn/Pool/ APhide caption Catholics around the world are mourning thedeath of Pope Francis, who died on Easter Monday at age 88. Among them is Speaker of the House Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who told NPR she met Pope Francis a handful of times. In an interview withAll Things Consideredhost Mary Louise Kelly, Pelosi recounted a visit in which he laughed at her. Pelosi was waiting for him in his office and when he opened the door, \"tears just flowed down my eyes … I was just overwhelmed by seeing him.\" She was overcome with emotion, but met by his kindness. \"How he reacted is what really got me,\" she told NPR. \"He just laughed and laughed and laughed that I was so tearful upon seeing him.\" Pelosi praised Francis as \"humble, courageous and confident.\" \"He would always say, 'Pray for me.' And I'd be like, 'Well wait a minute, your Holiness, you're supposed to be praying for the rest of us.'\" Today, Pelosi said, \"I'm prayingtohim .... He's a saintly person. I'm praying to him.\" This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Mary Louise Kelly:I remember when you and I spoke last summer, I was interviewing you about your memoir, your book, and you talked about growing up Catholic and how today your faith remains very deep. So, just say a little bit more about that — what Pope Francis' death means to you personally. Nancy Pelosi:Well, his death means a great deal to me personally, but to many, many Catholics and people of faith throughout the world. So that's why it's such a day of sadness. I was at his installation on the Feast of Saint Joseph. Then I've had four opportunities to visit with him and speak with him, sometimes with my children, sometimes officially and always, always, always inspired by him. He would always say, \"Pray for me.\" And I'd be like, \"Well, wait a minute, your Holiness, you're supposed to be praying for the rest of us.\" So this sign of his humility: \"Pray for me.\" And then his confidence and his courage to do all the wonderful things that he did was quite remarkable. Kelly:And it sounds like you're praying for him today. Pelosi:I'm prayingtohim today. I'm praying to him today. People light candles as they pay respects in front of a portrait of Pope Francis on Monday during a condolence meeting in New Delhi.Sajjad Hussain/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Kelly:When was the last time you saw him or were able to speak with him? Pelosi:The last time I saw him, we visited Saint Peter's, of course, on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. Then they called me outside and said, \"We want you to wait here.\" And we just waited there. My husband and I, Paul and I. And then the door opened and in came His Holiness in a wheelchair at a distant door. But he stood up and walked over to where we were. And we had this beautiful chat and it was photographed and they put it out there publicly. That was the last time I saw him. Right before that, though, is when I had the private visit with him in his office. And they told me when we went there, these rules are very strict, they're 400 years old, so you must obey all the rules. So, I went to see him at his office. As soon as the door opened, I was facing him. He was standing on the other side of the door and tears just flowed down my eyes. I was just, just overwhelmed by seeing him. But how he reacted is what really got me is he just laughed and laughed and laughed that I was so tearful upon seeing him. Kelly:He was, of course, a spiritual leader and also a political one. This was not a man afraid of a fight. I'm thinking, for example, about the positions he took in LGBTQ rights, transgender rights — at a moment when those are being walked back here in the U.S. What does it mean for the world to have lost his voice at this moment? Pelosi:Well, we are going to have a new pope soon and hopefully he will respect the dignity of every person. I do want to, though, add that one of the things that he did is just enlarge the issue to God's creation. All of God's children were precious to him and God's creation — that would be our climate, our globe. And he wrote an encyclical about saving the planet as God's creation. Kelly:So, understanding that today is a day of mourning for you, for many Catholics, a day to pay respect to Pope Francis. What qualities would you hope to see in his successor? What aspects of his legacy would you wish to see carried on? Pope Francis greets people in December 2024.Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Pelosi:Right now, it's hard to talk about what comes next when we're still mourning him. And actually in church yesterday, Christ is risen. Easter, the most glorious of all holidays. And we prayed for him in church yesterday, too. But we always pray for the pope in church. I do believe that whoever is chosen, the pope is the pope inspired by the Holy Ghost and accepts whatever that decision is. Kelly:You're making me think. When I woke up this morning and heard the news, I thought, Oh, I wonder if he was hanging on for one more Easter. We'll never know. But do you think he was hanging on to celebrate one more Easter? Pelosi:Well, it could be. You know, it's the most glorious feast in the church. Christ is risen is the basis of our faith. And I don't know if he had the choice to stay on or not, but thank God that he was able to and to drive through the crowd and wish Happy Easter to people and the joy that it gave to all the people in the square to see him, thank God that he was able to be able to stay alive for Easter. That was remarkable. And then this morning, when we heard the news, it was of course. Of course, of course. He stayed here one more day. So beautiful.

    "title": "DHL will stop shipping packages over $800 to U.S. customers due to new customs rules",
    "article_text": "By Joe Hernandez A DHL delivery vehicle is seen in front of a warehouse in Valence, France, in December 2024. The global shipping company announced it would temporarily stop shipping packages valued over $800 to U.S. consumers.Nicolas Guyonnet/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption The global shipping company DHL says it will stop shipping packages over $800 in value to U.S. consumers in response to new, more stringent U.S. customs rules. The carrier cited the 10% tariffs implemented by the Trump administration in early April, which it says had the effect of subjecting parcels worth over $800 to increased scrutiny by U.S. customs inspectors. That has led to shipping backlogs, DHL said. \"This change has caused a surge in formal customs clearances, which we are handling around the clock,\" DHLsaid in a statement. \"While we are working diligently to scale up and manage this increase, shipments over USD 800—regardless of origin—may experience multi-day delays.\" When asked for comment by NPR, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson did not directly address DHL's announcement and provided general information about customs duties. CBPsays in a poston its website that so-called formal entry of packages to the U.S. can require shippers to complete \"extensive paperwork\" and file a CBP bond, while informal entry is \"less arduous a process\"in which the agency does the paperwork and calculates the duties to be paid. DHL said its new temporary policy, which took effect on Monday, would apply to packages of over $800 sent from any foreign country to U.S. consumers. The company said it will continue to ship business-to-business packages valued over $800 to U.S. companies, but those shipments may face delays. Changes to U.S. customs rules come as part of President Trump's effort to overhaul the government's global trade policy, including by closing a loophole known as the de minimis exemption, which allows goods under a certain value to enter the U.S. without being charged import fees or facing rigorous inspections. In early April, the Trump administrationmoved to end the de minimis exemptionfor products coming from China and Hong Kong. That change, which goes into effect on May 2, is expected to have an especially significant impact on e-commerce retailers that ship low-cost goods to the U.S., such as Shein and Temu. According to areport released this yearby the Congressional Research Service, the number of de minimis entries to the U.S.  jumped from 153 million in 2015 to more than 1 billion in 2023. Currently, de minimis shipments account for 92% of all cargo entering the U.S.,the CBP says. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

As the leader of the Roman Catholic Church, he left behind alegacy of service, unity, and compassion. Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and was the son of Italian immigrants. He was named a Cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2001 and was elected pope on March 13, 2013. Pope Francis was the first non-European pope in more than a millennium and the first Latin American pontiff. He preached of peace and acceptance — and reflected those values through his actions.

    "title": "Controversial doc gets measles while treating unvaccinated kids—keeps working",
    "article_text": "Ben Edwards has grown popular in Texas for providing unproven measles treatments. A controversial doctor providing unproven measles treatments to unvaccinated children in West Texas recently contracted the highly infectious virus himself amid the mushrooming outbreak—and he continued treating patients while visibly ill with the virus. The doctor's infection was revealed ina video posted onlineby Children's Health Defense (CHD), the rabid anti-vaccine advocacy organization founded and previously run by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a long-time anti-vaccine advocate who is now the US secretary of health. Kennedy headed CHD until January, when he stepped down in anticipation of his Senate confirmation. In the video, the doctor, Ben Edwards, can be seen with mild spots on his face. Someone asks him if he caught measles himself, and he responds, \"Yeah,\" saying he was \"pretty achy yesterday.\" He went on to say that he had developed the rash the day before but woke up that day feeling \"pretty good.\" The video was posted by CHD on March 31, andthe Associated Presswas the first to report it. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a person infected with measles is considered contagious from four days before the rash appears to four days after it appears. The virus is among the most infectious known to humans. It spreads in the air and can linger in the airspace of a room for up to two hours after an infectious person is present. Up to 90 percent of people who lack immunity—either from prior infection or vaccination—will get sick upon an exposure. In the video, Edwards is wearing scrubs, apparently in a clinic with patients, parents, and people from CHD. In an email to the AP, Edwards claimed that he \"interacted with zero patients that were not already infected with measles\" during the time he was infectious. \"Therefore, obviously, there were no patients that were put in danger of acquiring measles since they already had measles.\" However, the video shows him in a room with other people who do not appear sick, and he is not wearing a mask. Edwards has become quite popular in the severely undervaccinated community in Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the explosive outbreak that began in late January and continues to grow steadily. Edwards set up a makeshift measles clinic in Gaines and provides unproven treatments, such as cod liver oil, the antibiotic clarithromycin, and the glucocorticoid budesonide, which is used to treat asthma and Crohn's disease. Edwards and his unproven treatments have garnereddirect praise from Kennedy, who in a social media post called Edwards and another controversial doctor working in the area, Richard Bartlett, \"extraordinary healers.\" In 2003, Bartlett was disciplined by the Texas Medical Board for \"unusual use of risk-filled medications\" in multiple patients, including children. The risky treatments included intravenous antibiotics and hefty doses of glucocorticoids. In the social media post, Kennedy claimed the two doctors had treated \"some 300\" children with measles amid the outbreak.According to another video posted by CHD, some of those children included the four surviving siblings of an unvaccinated 6-year-old girl who died of measles in February. In the video, members of CHD interviewed the girl's parents, who believed that if Edwards had treated their now-deceased daughter, who developed measles before her siblings, she, too, would have lived. They also falsely claimed that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine was dangerous. The interview culminated with the parents urging others to avoid the MMR vaccine. \"We would absolutely not take the MMR,\" the mother said through a translator of Low German. \"The measles wasn't that bad, and they got over it pretty quickly,\" she added, speaking of her four living children. In the video with Edwards that has just come to light, CHD once again uses the situation to disparage MMR vaccines. Someone off camera asks Edwards if he had never had measles before, to which he replies that he had gotten an MMR vaccine as a kid, though he didn't know if he had gotten one or the recommended two doses. \"That doesn't work then, does it?\" the off-camera person asks, referring to the MMR vaccine. \"No, apparently not, \" Edwards replies. \"Just wear[s] off.\" It appears Edwards had a breakthrough infection, which is rare, but it does occur. They're more common in people who have only gotten one dose, which is possibly the case for Edwards. A single dose of MMR is 93 percent effective against measles, and two doses are 97 percent effective. In either case, the protection is considered lifelong. While up to 97 percent effectiveness is extremely protective, some people do not mount protective responses and are still vulnerable to an infection upon exposure. However, their illnesses will likely be milder than if they had not been vaccinated. In the video, Edwards described his illness as a \"mild case.\" The data on the outbreak demonstrates the effectiveness of vaccination.As of April 18, Texas health officials have identified 597 measles cases, leading to 62 hospitalizations and two deaths in school-aged, unvaccinated children with no underlying medical conditions. Most of the cases have been in unvaccinated children. Of the 597 cases, 12 (2 percent) had received two MMR doses previously, and 10 (1.6 percent) had received one dose. The remaining 96 percent of cases are either unvaccinated or have no record of vaccination. Toward the end of the video, Edwards tells CHD he's \"doing what any doctor should be doing.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Are these chimps having a fruity booze-up in the wild?",
    "article_text": "New data suggests that the human inclination toward feasting in groups is part of our deep evolutionary history. Is there anything more human than gathering in groups to share food and partake in a fermented beverage or two (or three, or....)? Researchers have caught wild chimpanzees on camera engaging in what appears to be similar activity: sharing fermented African breadfruit with measurable alcoholic content. According to anew paperpublished in the journal Current Biology, the observational data is the first evidence of the sharing of alcoholic foods among nonhuman great apes in the wild. The fruit in question is seasonal and comes fromTreculia africanatrees common across the home environment of the wild chimps in Cantanhez National Park in Guinea-Bissau. Once mature, the fruits drop from the tree to the ground and slowly ripen from a hard, deep green exterior to a yellow, spongier texture. Because the chimps are unhabituated, the authors deployed camera traps at three separate locations to record their feeding and sharing behavior. They recorded 10 instances of selective fruit sharing among 17 chimps, with the animals exhibiting a marked preference for riper fruit. Between April and July 2022, the authors measured the alcohol content of the fruit with a handy portable breathalyzer and found almost all of the fallen fruit (90 percent) contained some ethanol, with the ripest containing the highest levels—the equivalent of 0.61 percent ABV (alcohol by volume). That's comparatively low to alcoholic drinks typically consumed by humans, but then again, fruit accounts for as much as 60 to 80 percent of the chimps' diet, so the amount of ethanol consumed could add up quickly. It's highly unlikely the chimps would get drunk, however. It wouldn't confer any evolutionary advantage, and per the authors, there is evidence in the common ancestor of African apes of a molecular mechanism that increases the ability to metabolize alcohol. The interpretation of the observed behavior remains somewhat speculative. It's unclear, for instance, whether any of the chimps were related to each other; kin-selection effects may be at play. Nor could the authors conclude definitively that the chimps were deliberately consuming ethanol-rich fruits and sharing it with their compatriots. That said, there are well-known benefits to such behavior. “For humans, we know that drinking alcohol leads to a release of dopamine and endorphins, and resulting feelings of happiness and relaxation,”said co-author Anna Bowlandof the University of Exeter’s Penryn Campus in Cornwall. “We also know that sharing alcohol–including through traditions such as feasting–helps to form and strengthen social bonds. So—now we know that wild chimpanzees are eating and sharing ethanolic fruits–the question is: could they be getting similar benefits?” The authors believe this data suggests that the human inclination toward feasting in groups is part of our deep evolutionary history. \"To fully understand this in a social context requires data on the role of alcohol consumption in reinforcing social bonds and building social capital, including the exchange of other goods, between extended kin and non-kin, and the degree to which ethanol ingestion is intentional or not,\" they concluded. \"This necessitates long-term observations of individuals with well-established relationships where changes in feeding and social behavior can be monitored, alongside measurement of ethanol in foods.\" Current Biology, 2025.

    "title": "White House plagued by Signal controversy as Pentagon in “full-blown meltdown”",
    "article_text": "Trump insists defense secretary who shared secrets on Signal “doing a great job.” It's possible that the White House may be looking to replace Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after critics warned that a pair of controversial Signal chats risked compromising US national security. In March, it was revealed that Hegsethaccidentally texted secret bombing plans in a Signal chatthat included a reporter, raising alarms about his handling of sensitive military information. And then this weekend, The New York Timesrevealedthat he similarly shared the attack plans, just minutes after learning of them, in a personal Signal chat that included his wife and brother. That second revelation sparked a \"full-blown meltdown\" at the Pentagon, The Guardianreported, apparently prompting the Trump administration to begin \"the process of looking for a new secretary of defense,\" a US official granted anonymitytold NPRMonday. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt claimed NPR's report was \"fake news,\" writingon Xthat NPR's source \"clearly has no idea what they are talking about.\" On Monday, Trump defended Hegseth's Signal use, insisting that the defense secretary is \"doing a great job,\" NBC Newsreported. Critics have urged Trump to take Hegseth's unauthorized Signal use seriously, warning that sharing confidential military information puts US operations and personnel at risk. On Sunday, former chief Pentagon spokesperson, John Ullyot, warned in a Politicoop-edthat Hegseth's sloppy Signal use had caused \"a near collapse inside the Pentagon’s top ranks.\" Perhaps hoping to appeal to Trump's ego, Ullyot warned that Hegseth's scandal has been a \"major distraction\" and declared that Trump—who \"has a strong record of holding his top officials to account\"—\"deserves better.\" \"Given that, it’s hard to see Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth remaining in his role for much longer,\" Ullyot forecasted. According to NPR—which has been the target ofTrump threats to rescind funding—four of Hegseth's senior advisors abruptly quit after The Times report was published. \"They have all released public statements suggesting infighting within the department of defense,\" NPR reported. But Trump and Hegseth are presenting a united front against the public backlash. Trump confirmed that he considers any discussion of Hegseth's chats a \"waste of time,\" The New York Timesreported. And on Sunday, Hegseth told reporters gathered for a White House Easter event that he and Trump are \"on the same page all the way.\" Hegseth labeled The Times' latest report as a \"hit piece.\" Citing four people familiar with his family Signal chat, NYT report noted that Hegseth updated both Signal groups about the attack plans at about the same time, and these \"were among the first big military strikes of Mr. Hegseth’s tenure.\" The implication is that if the media hadn't outed the Signal use, perhaps Hegseth may have continued risking leaks of confidential military information. And although he and Trump hope the backlash will die down soon, his inclusion of his wife and brother on the second chat likely raises additional flags and \"is sure to raise further questions about his adherence to security protocols,\" the NYT suggested. Sean Parnell, the chief Pentagon spokesperson, joined the White House in pushing back against reports, claiming the NYT's sources are \"disgruntled\" former employees and insistingon Xthat \"there was no classified information in any Signal chat.\" According to The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, who was accidentally copied on the initial Signal chat that sparked the backlash, Hegseth shared \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing\" two hours before the attack.

    "title": "Teen coder shuts down open source Mac app Whisky, citing harm to paid apps",
    "article_text": "Developer tells Ars free app could \"seriously threaten CrossOver's viability.\" Whisky, a gaming-focused front-end for Wine's Windows compatibility tools on macOS, isno longer receiving updates. As one of themost usefuland well-regarded tools in a Mac gamer's toolkit, it could be seen as a great loss, but its developer hopes you'll move on with what he considers a better option: supportingCodeWeavers' CrossOver product. Also, Whisky's creator is an 18-year-old college student, and he could use a break. \"I am 18, yes, and attending Northeastern University, so it's always a balancing act between my school work and dev work,\"Isaac Marovitzwrote to Ars. The Whisky project has \"been more or less in this state for a few months, I posted the notice mostly to clarify and formally announce it,\" Marovitz said, having received \"a lot of questions\" about the project status. Marovitz is no slacker, having previously worked on theSwitch emulator Ryujinx, which shut down after an agreement with Nintendo, and other gaming projects, includingPlayCover. So while a break is a good thing, there is another big reason: \"Whisky, in my opinion, has not been a positive on the Wine community as a whole,\" Marovitzwrote on the Whisky site. He advised that Whisky users buy a CrossOver license, and noted that while CodeWeavers and Valve's work on Proton have had a big impact on the Wine project, \"the amount that Whisky as a whole contributes to Wine is practically zero.\" Fixes for Wine running Mac games \"have to come from people who are not only incredibly knowledgeable on C, Wine, Windows, but also macOS,\" Marovitz wrote, and \"the pool of developers with those skills is very limited.\" While Marovitz told Ars that he's had \"some contact with CodeWeavers\" in making Whisky, \"they were always curious and never told me what I should or should not do.\" It became clear to him, though, \"from what [CodeWeavers] could tell me as well as observing the attitude of the wider community that Whisky could seriously threaten CrossOver's viability.\" CodeWeavers' CEOwrote on the company's bloglate last week about the Whisky shutdown, topped with an image of a glass of the spirit clinking against a glass of wine. \"Whisky may have been a CrossOver competitor, but that's not how we feel today,\" wrote James B. Ramey. \"Our response is simply one of empathy, understanding, and acknowledgement for Isaac's situation.\" Ramey noted that Whisky was a free packaging of an open source project, crafted by someone who, like CrossOver, did it as \"a labor of love built by people who care deeply about giving users more choices.\" But Marovitz faced \"an avalanche of user expectations,\" Ramey wrote, regarding game compatibility, performance, and features. \"The reality is that testing, support, and development take real resources … if CodeWeavers were not viable because of CrossOver not being sustainable, it would likely dampen the future development of WINE and Proton and support for macOS gaming,\" Ramey wrote. \"We ‘tip our cap’ to Isaac and the impact he made to macOS gaming,\" Ramey wrote, strangely choosing that colloquial salute instead of the more obvious beverage analogy for the two projects. Marovitz told Ars that while user expectations were \"definitely an issue,\" they were not the major reason for ceasing development. \"I've worked on other big projects before and during Whisky's development, so I'm not a stranger to tuning out the noise of constant user expectations.\" Open source projects shutting down because of the tremendous pressure they put on their unpaid coders is a kind of \"dog bites man\" story in the coding world. It's something else entirely when a prolific coder sees a larger ecosystem as not really benefiting from their otherwise very neat tool, and chooses deference. Still, during its run, the Whisky app drew attention to Mac gaming and the possibilities of Wine, and by extensionApple's own Game Porting Toolkit, itself based on CrossOver. And likely gave a few Mac owners some great times with games they couldn't get on their favorite platform. Marovitz, while stepping back, is not done with Mac gaming, however. \"Right now I'm working onthe recompilation ofSonic Unleashedand bringing it fully to Mac, alongside other folks, but for the most part my goals and passions have remained the same,\" Marovitz told Ars.

    "title": "Trump can’t keep China from getting AI chips, TSMC suggests",
    "article_text": "As Trump eyes chip controls, TSMC fears its tariff-proof era will end. As the global artificial intelligence (AI) race presses on amid a US-China trade war, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)—a $514 billion titan that manufactures most of the world's AI chips—is warning that it may not be possible to keep its customers' most advanced technology out of China's hands. US export controls require chipmakers to monitor shipments and know their customers to restrict China's access to AI chips. But in a recently published 2024report, TSMC confirmed that its \"role in the semiconductor supply chain inherently limits its visibility and information available to it regarding the downstream use or user of final products that incorporate semiconductors manufactured by it.\" Essentially, TSMC expects that it plays too big a role in the semiconductor industry to stop all the possible unintended end-uses of the semiconductors it manufactures. Similarly, it appears impossible to track all the third parties determined to skirt sanctions. And if TSMC's hands are truly tied, that ultimately means that the US can't effectively stop the latest AI tech from trickling into China. That remains a problem for TSMC, since, back in October, a research firm called TechInsights took apart an AI accelerator from China-based and US-sanctioned Huawei and found that TSMC had produced the AI chip made by Nvidia that powered the product, Bloombergreported. The semiconductor company increasingly risks sanctions for failing to comply with export controls, TSMC's report said, even if it seemingly has nothing to do with its customers diverting shipments into China. At that time, TSMC promptly notified US officials of the feared national security risk, confirming that one of its customers' chips \"might have been diverted to a restricted entity or incorporated into a restricted entity’s product,\" TSMC's report said. However, although the company fully cooperated with the resulting US and Taiwan government probes, TSMC said, there currently appears to be no perfect solution to deter recurring violations. \"Despite TSMC’s best efforts to comply with all relevant export control and sanctions laws and regulations, there is no assurance that its business activities will not be found incompliant with export control laws and regulations,\" TSMC said. Further, \"if TSMC or TSMC’s business partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits or are found to have violated applicable export control or sanctions laws, TSMC may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences, including government investigations and penalties resulting from relevant legal proceedings,\" TSMC warned. TSMC is thriving despite years of tariffs and export controls, its report said, with at least one analystsuggestingthat, so far, the company appears \"somewhat tariff-proof.\" However, all of that could be changing fast, as \"US President Donald Trump announced in 2025 an intention to impose more expansive tariffs on imports into the United States,\" TSMC said. \"Any tariffs imposed on imports of semiconductors and products incorporating chips into the United States may result in increased costs for purchasing such products, which may, in turn, lead to decreased demand for TSMC’s products and services and adversely affect its business and future growth,\" TSMC said. And if TSMC's business is rattled by escalations in the US-China trade war, TSMC warned, that risks disrupting the entire global semiconductor supply chain. Trump's semiconductor tariff plans remain uncertain. About a week ago, Trump claimed the rates would be unveiled \"over the next week,\" Reutersreported, which means they could be announced any day now. TSMC is apparently already bracing, as industry estimates suggest that tariffs could cost chipmakers more than a billion dollars over the next year, Reutersreported. Additionally, China's increased restrictions on access to the raw materials TSMC needs to manufacture chips could spike costs, TSMC said. \"Any increase in the use of export control restrictions and sanctions to target certain countries and entities, any expansion of the extraterritorial jurisdiction of such measures, or complete or partial ban on semiconductor products sales to certain entities could impact not only TSMC’s ability to continue supplying products to those customers, but also our customers’ demand for our products, and could even lead to changes in semiconductor supply chains,\" TSMC warned. Trump's semiconductor tariffs will be based on the results of a probe into potential impacts on national security and the economy. Ars could not immediately reach TSMC to confirm if the company has submitted comments as part of that probe. But while the company's outlook for growth otherwise seems rosy, with AI demand increasing globally, its annual report warned that fines for non-compliance are a top emerging risk, along with risks of building new fabs and potential claw-backs or disruptions in government incentives (like the CHIPS Act, which Trump claims he wants to gut or cut). Currently, TSMC's \"operations have not been materially affected by the expanded export control regulations or the novel rules or measures adopted to counteract them,\" TSMC said. \"Nevertheless, depending on future developments in global trade tensions, such regulations, rules, or measures may have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and operations, and TSMC may incur significant legal liability and financial losses as a result.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "In depth with Windows 11 Recall—and what Microsoft has (and hasn’t) fixed",
    "article_text": "Original botched launch still haunts new version of data-scraping AI feature. Microsoft ispreparing to reintroduce Recall to Windows 11. A feature limited toCopilot+ PCs—a label that just a fraction of a fraction of Windows 11 systems even qualify for—Recall has been controversial in part because itbuilds an extensive database of text and screenshotsthat records almost everything you do on your PC. But the main problem with the initial version of Recall—the one that was delayed at the last minute after a large-scale outcry from security researchers, reporters, and users—was notjustthat it recorded everything you did on your PC but that it was a rushed, enabled-by-default feature with gaping security holes that made it trivial for anyone with any kind of access to your PC to see your entire Recall database. It made no efforts to automatically exclude sensitive data like bank information or credit card numbers, offering just a few mechanisms to users to manually exclude specific apps or websites. It had been built quickly, outside of the normal extensive Windows Insider preview and testing process. And all of this was happening at the same time that the company waspledging to prioritize security over all other considerations, following severalserious and highly public breaches. Any coverage of thecurrentversion of Recall should mention what has changed since then. Recall is being rolled out to Microsoft’s Windows Insider Release Preview channel after months of testing in the more experimental and less-stable channels, just like most other Windows features. It’s turned off by default and can be removed from Windows root-and-branch by users and IT administrators who don’t want it there. Microsoft has overhauled the feature's underlying security architecture, encrypting data at rest so it can't be accessed by other users on the PC, adding automated filters to screen out sensitive information, and requiring frequent reauthentication with Windows Hello anytime a user accesses their own Recall database. I installed the Release Preview Windows 11 build with Recall on a Snapdragon X Elite version of the Surface Laptop and a couple of Ryzen AI PCs, which all have NPUs fast enough to support the Copilot+ features. No Windows PCs without this NPU will offer Recall or any other Copilot+ features—that's every single PC sold before mid-2024 and the vast majority of PCs since then. Users may come up with ways to run those features on unsupported hardware some other way. But by default, Recall isn't something most of Windows' current user base will have to worry about. After installing the update, you'll see a single OOBE-style setup screen describing Recall and offering to turn it on; as promised, it is now off by default until you opt in. And even if you accept Recall on this screen, you have to opt in a second time as part of the Recall setup to actually turn the feature on. We'll be on high alert for a bait-and-switch when Microsoft is ready to remove Recall's \"preview\" label, whenever that happens, but at least for now, opt-in means opt-in. Enable Recall, and the snapshotting begins. As before, it's storing two things: actual screenshots of the active area of your screen, minus the taskbar, and a searchable database of text that it scrapes from those screenshots using OCR. Somewhat oddly, there are limits on what Recall will offer to OCR for you; even if you're using multiple apps onscreen at the same time, only the active, currently-in-focus app seems to have its text scraped and stored. This is also more or less how Recall handles multi-monitor support; only the active display has screenshots taken, and only the active window on the active display is OCR'd. This does prevent Recall from taking gigabytes and gigabytes of screenshots of static or empty monitors, though it means the app may miss capturing content that updates passively if you don't interact with those windows periodically. All of this OCR'd text is fully searchable and can be copied directly from Recall to be pasted somewhere else. Recall will also offer to open whatever app or website is visible in the screenshot, and it gives you the option to delete that specific screenshot and all screenshots from specific apps (handy, if you decide you want to add an entire app to your filtering settings and you want to get rid of all existing snapshots of it). Here are some basic facts about how Recall works on a PC since there's a lot of FUD circulating about this, and much of the information on the Internet is about the older, insecure version from last year: If you read our coverage of the initial version, there's a whole lot about how Recall functions that's essentially the same as it was before. In Settings, you can see how much storage the feature is using and limit the total amount of storage Recall can use. The amount of time a snapshot can be kept is normally determined by the amount of space available, not by the age of the snapshot, but you can optionally choose a second age-based expiration date for snapshots (options range from 30 to 180 days). It's also possible to delete the entire database or all recent snapshots (those from the past hour, past day, past week, or past month), toggle the automated filtering of sensitive content, or add specific apps and websites you'd like to have filtered. Recall can temporarily be paused by clicking the system tray icon (which is always visible when you have Recall turned on), and it can be turned off entirely in Settings. Neither of these options will delete existing snapshots; they just stop your PC from creating new ones. The amount of space Recall needs to do its thing will depend on a bunch of factors, including how actively you use your PC and how many things you filter out. But in my experience, it can easily generate a couple of hundred megabytes per day of images. A Ryzen system with a 1TB SSD allocated 150GB of space to Recall snapshots by default, but even a smaller 25GB Recall database could easily store a few months of data. For apps and sites that you know you don't want to end up in Recall, you can manually add them to the exclusion lists in the Settings app. As a rule, major browsers running in private or incognito modes are also generally not snapshotted. If you have an app that's being filtered onscreen for any reason—even if it's onscreen at the same time as an app that'snotbeing filtered, Recall won't take pictures of your desktop at all. I ran an InPrivate Microsoft Edge window next to a regular window, and Microsoft's solution is just to avoid capturing and storing screenshots entirely rather than filtering or blanking out the filtered app or site in some way. This is probably the best way to do it! It minimizes the risk of anything being captured accidentally just because it's running in the background, for example. But it could mean you don't end up capturing much in Recall at all if you're frequently mixing filtered and unfiltered apps. New to this version of Recall is an attempt at automated content filtering to address one of the major concerns about the original iteration of Recall—that it can capture and store sensitive information like credit card numbers and passwords. This filtering is based on the technology Microsoft uses forMicrosoft Purview Information Protection, an enterprise feature used to tag sensitive information on business, healthcare, and government systems. This automated content filtering is hit and miss. Recall wouldn't take snapshots of a webpage with a visible credit card field, or my online banking site, or an image of my driver's license, or a recent pay stub, or of the Bitwarden password manager while viewing credentials. But I managed to find edge cases in less than five minutes, and you'll be able to find them, too; Recall saved snapshots showing a recent check, with the account holder's name, address, and account and routing numbers visible, and others testing it have still caught itrecording credit card information in some cases. The automated filtering is still a big improvement from before, when it would capture this kind of information indiscriminately. But things will inevitably slip through, and the automated filtering won't help at all with other kinds of data; Recall will take pictures of email and messaging apps without distinguishing between what's sensitive (school information for my kid, emails about Microsoft's own product embargoes) and what isn't. The upshot is that if you capture months and months and gigabytes and gigabytes of Recall data on your PC, it's inevitable that it will capture something you probably wouldn't want to be preserved in an easily searchable database. One issue is that there's no easy way to check and confirm what Recall is and isn't filtering without actually scrolling through the database and checking snapshots manually. The system tray status icon does change to display a small triangle and will show you a \"some content is being filtered\" status message when something is being filtered, but the system won't tell you what it is; I have some kind of filtered app or browser tab open somewhere right now, and I have no idea which one it is because Windows won't tell me. That any attempt at automated filtering is hit-and-miss should be expected, but more transparency would help instill trust and help users fine-tune their filtering settings. Microsoft also seems to have fixed the single largest problem with Recall: previously, all screenshots and the entire text database were stored in plaintext with zero encryption. It wastechnically,usuallyencrypted, insofar as the entire SSD in a modern PC is encrypted when you sign into a Microsoft account or enable Bitlocker, but any user with any kind of access to your PC (either physical or remote) could easily grab those files and view them anywhere with no additional authentication necessary. This is fixed now. Recall's entire file structure is available for anyone to look at, stored away in the user’s AppData folder in a directory calledCoreAIPlatform.00\\UKP. Other administrators on the same PC can still navigate to these folders from a different user account and move or copy the files. Encryption renders them (hypothetically) unreadable. Microsofthas gone into some detailabout exactly how it'sprotecting and storing the encryption keysused to encrypt these files—the company says \"all encryption keys [are] protected by a hypervisor or TPM.\" Rate-limiting and \"anti-hammering\" protections are also in place to protect Recall data, though I kind of have to take Microsoft at its word on that one. That said, I don't love that it's still possible to get at those files at all. It leaves open the possibility that someone could theoretically grab a few megabytes' worth of data. But it's now much harder to get at that data, and better filtering means whatisin there should be slightly less all-encompassing. As we mentioned already, Microsoft's automated content filtering is hit-and-miss. Certainly, there's a lot of stuff that the original version of Recall would capture that the new one won't, but I didn't have to work hard to find corner-cases, and you probably won't, either. Turning Recall on still means assuming risk and being comfortable with the data and authentication protections Microsoft has implemented. We'd also like there to be a way for apps to tell Recall to exclude them by default, which would be useful for password managers, encrypted messaging apps, and any other software where privacy is meant to be the point. Yes, users can choose to exclude these apps from Recall backups themselves. But as with Recall itself, opting in to having that data collected would be preferable to needing to opt out. Another issue is that, while Recall does require a fingerprint reader or face-scanning camera when you set it up the very first time, you can unlock it with a Windows Hello PIN after it's already going. Microsoft has said that this is meant to be a fallback option in case you need to access your Recall database and there's some kind of hardware issue with your fingerprint sensor. But in practice, it feels like too easy a workaround for a domestic abuser or someone else with access to your PC and a reason to know your PIN (and note that the PIN also gets them into your PC in the first place, so encryption isn't really a fix for this). It feels like too broad a solution for a relatively rare problem. Security researcher Kevin Beaumont, whose testing helped call attention to the problems with the original version of Recall last year, identified this as one of Recall's biggest outstanding technical problems in a blog post shared with Ars Technica shortly before its publication (as of this writing, it's availablehere; he and I also exchanged multiple text over the weekend comparing our findings). \"In my opinion, requiring devices to have enhanced biometrics with Windows Hello  but then not requiring said biometrics to actually access Recall snapshots is a big problem,\" Beaumont wrote. \"It will create a false sense of security in customers and false downstream advertising about the security of Recall.\" Beaumont also noted that, while the encryption on the Recall snapshots and database made it a \"much, much better design,\" \"all hell would break loose\" if attackers ever worked out a way to bypass this encryption. \"Microsoft know this and have invested in trying to stop it by encrypting the database files, but given I live in the trenches where ransomware groups are running around with zero days in Windows on an almost monthly basis nowadays, where patches arrive months later... Lord, this could go wrong,\" he wrote. Microsoft has actually addressed many of the specific, substantive Recall complaints raised by security researchers and our own reporting. It's gone through the standard Windows testing process and has been available in public preview in its current formsince late November. And yet the knee-jerk reaction to Recall news is still generally to treat it as though it were the same botched, bug-riddled software that nearly shipped last summer. Some of this is the asymmetrical nature of how news spreads on the Internet—without revealing traffic data, I'll just say that articles about Recall having problems have been read many, many more times by many more people than pieces about the steps Microsoft has taken to fix Recall. The latter reports simply aren't being encountered by many of the minds Microsoft needs to change. But the other problem goes deeper than the technology itself and gets back to something I brought up in my first Recall preview nearly a year ago—regardless of how it is architected and regardless of how many privacy policies and reassurances the company publishes, people simply don't trust Microsoft enough to be excited about \"the feature that records and stores every single thing you do with your PC.\" Recall continues todemand an extraordinary level of trust that Microsoft hasn't earned. However secure and private it is—and, again, the version people will actually get is much better than the version that caused the original controversy—it just feels creepy to open up the app and see confidential work materials and pictures of your kid. You'realready trusting Microsoft with those things any time you use your PC, but there's something viscerally unsettling about actually seeing evidence that your computer is tracking you, even if you're not doing anything you're worried about hiding, even if you've excluded certain apps or sites, and even if you \"know\" that part of the reason why Recall requires a Copilot+ PC is because it's processing everything locally rather than on a server somewhere. This was a problem that Microsoft made exponentially worse by screwing up the Recall rollout so badly in the first place. Recall made the kind of ugly first impression that it's hard to dig out from under, no matter how thoroughly you fix the underlying problems. It's Windows Vista. It's Apple Maps. It's the Android tablet. And in doing that kind of damage to Recall (and possibly also to the broader Copilot+ branding project), Microsoft has practically guaranteed that many users will refuse to turn it on or uninstall it entirely, no matter how it actually works or how well the initial problems have been addressed. Unfortunately, those people probably have it right. I can see no signs that Recall data is as easily accessed or compromised as before or that Microsoft is sending any Recall data from my PC to anywhere else. But today's Microsoft has earned itself distrust-by-default from many users, thanks not just to the sloppy Recall rollout but also to the endless ads and aggressive cross-promotion of its own products that dominate modern Windows versions. That's the kind of problem you can't patch your way out of. Listing image:\n    Andrew Cunningham Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Chrome on the chopping block as Google’s search antitrust trial moves forward",
    "article_text": "The court ruled that Google has a search monopoly. Now, we learn the consequences. The remedy phase of Google's search antitrust trial is getting underway, and the government is seeking to force major changes. The next few weeks could reshape Google as a company and significantly alter the balance of power on the Internet, and both sides have a plan to get their way. With opening arguments beginning today, the US Justice Department will seek to convince the court that Google should be forced to divest Chrome, unbundle Android, and make other foundational changes. But Google will attempt to paint the government's position as too extreme and rooted in past grievances. No matter what happens at this trial, Google hasn't given up hope it can turn back time. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has a major advantage here: Google is guilty. Itlost the liability phaseof this trial resoundingly, with the court finding Google violated the Sherman Antitrust Act by \"willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power.\" As far as the court is concerned, Google has an illegal monopoly in search services and general search advertising. The purpose of this trial is to determine what to do about it, and the DOJhas some ideas. This case, overseen by United States District Judge Amit Mehta, is taking place against a backdrop that is particularly unflattering for Google. It has been rocked by loss after loss in its antitrust cases, including theEpic-backed Google Play case, plus the search case that is at issue here. And just last week, a court ruled that Googleabused its monopoly in advertising tech. The remedies in Google's app store case are currently on hold pending appeal, but that problem is not going away. Meanwhile, Google is facing even more serious threats in the remedy phase of this trial. The DOJ will come out guns blazing—it sees this as the most consequential antitrust case in the US since the Microsoft trial of the 1990s. The effects of breaking up Google could even rival the impact of antitrust actions against AT&T and Standard Oil decades earlier. We also expect to be reminded repeatedly that virtually every state has joined the government's case against Google, indicating wide understanding that the market is not operating fairly. Credit:Samuel Corum | Getty Images It's no secret that incentives at the federal level are shifting as the second Trump administration politicizes the Justice Department to an unprecedented degree. Despite the new divisions, opinions are remarkably unified on the Google search case. The DOJ team has successfully made the case that Google is a monopolist, and now they have to enforce the law. The new conservative leadership sees Google as a principal source of the \"censorship\" of right-wing ideology, which they largely interpret as a downstream effect of Google's undue market power. This phase of the case is not about whether or not Google did it; the goal is to decide how to change Google. The DOJ tells Ars that it believes Google's proposed remedies are anemic and won't move the needle at all. In this case, government lawyers will argue that the playing field cannot be leveled unless Google gives something up, and that somethingought to be Chrome. The government will attempt to show that Google's handling of Chrome creates a barrier to competition, preferencing Google's services over the competition. The DOJ has suggested there are numerous entities that could acquire Chrome and instantly realign online markets, but Google is going to push back hard on that. The government will counter by producing multiple witnesses from Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Microsoft, and others to explain how their search businesses were stymied by Google and how hacking off Chrome could rectify that. The DOJ is also interested in Google's search placement deals—for example, paying Apple and Mozilla billions of dollars to make Google their default search engine. In the government's view, this forced rivals to nibble around the edges after being locked out by Google's contracts. The DOJ will try to have these contracts banned in addition to forcing the sale of Chrome. Google has already announced itspreferred remediesin this case, which amount to less exclusivity in search contracts and more freedom for Android OEMs to choose app preloads. Google says it would also accept additional government oversight to ensure it abides by these remedies. In the remedy phase, Google will try to portray the Justice Department's proposal as heavy-handed and emblematic of the agency's \"interventionist agenda.\" We expect to see Google looking for any opportunity to make the DOJ look out of touch with the realities of technology today. Google says it will spend a lot of time arguing against the DOJ's attempt to end search placement deals, and it will have some backup here in the form of representatives from Mozilla and Apple, both of which arepaid billions of dollarsper year to make Google their default search engine. These firms will explain Google's services are the best available, and that's why they use them. In the case of Mozilla, almost all the foundation's revenue comes from Google, and Google doesn't dispute that. In fact, it has noted in the past (and surely will again at the trial) that Mozilla would fold without all that Google money, and that's bad for user choice. However, the DOJ will probably point out that the massive revenue Apple and Mozilla get from these deals makes their testimony less reliable. Another pillar of Google's opposition will be the privacy and security implications of the DOJ's demand for data sharing. The DOJ will claim this is essential to help other search providers to compete, but Google will paint this as a threat to the privacy of user data. And then there's the national security angle, which Google has beenpushing harder since the start of the year. More than anything else, Google doesn't want to lose Chrome. We expect to see Google's established opposition to Chrome divestiture cranked up to 11 in the remedy phase. The company will no doubt be able to point to many instances where it acted as a benevolent steward of the open web through the dominance of Chrome. It chose to make Chromium open source and has kept it that way, even though it could have made more money keeping the code to itself. Credit:\n\n          \n          Getty Images There is uncertainty about the future of Chrome if it's sold off, and a Google spokesperson suggests the company will capitalize on that. Google's legal team will forecast a world in which Chrome has become less secure without Google's involvement, the Chromium project has crumbled, and browser choice has cratered. Google says its goal of providing easy access to its products and services gives it a strong incentive to keep Chrome free and open, which may not be the case for its new owner. The DOJ would call that self-dealing, of course. While the government has backed away from the stringent AI investment limits in its original remedy request, Google still worries its AI efforts could be hampered by limits on self-dealing. We expect Google to talk about the rapid pace of changes in AI today, portraying this case as too focused on how the search market worked a decade ago. The company may even go so far as to admit it's losing ground to the likes of OpenAI as more people use AI to get answers to their questions instead of traditional web search. But can a company worth $2 trillion count on anyone feeling sorry for it? The trial will run for a few weeks, and later on, we'll learn what remedies the court has decided to impose. That doesn't mean anything will change for Google in the short- or medium-term, though. All the lawyering should be done by early May, and then it's up to Judge Mehta to decide on the final remedies, which could come as late as August 2025. That won't be the end of things. Google is adamant that it plans to appeal the case, but it has to go through the remedy phase first. Google may be able to get the remedies paused while it pursues a new verdict, similar to the current state of the app store case. Much of what the DOJ wants would fundamentally alter the nature of Google's business, making it difficult to undo the changes if Google does prevail on appeal. Even if Google can maintain the status quo for the foreseeable future, the company could be headed into Google I/O in late May with a sword of Damocles dangling over its metaphorical head. Google has enjoyed years of growth so stupendous and unprecedented that it reshaped media and commerce. If Google is forced to give up a key product like Chrome or lose its default status in popular products, there's no telling how the Internet could change. One thing is certain, though. The next few weeks will be the most consequential for Google since it went public more than 20 years ago. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Annoyed ChatGPT users complain about bot’s relentlessly positive tone",
    "article_text": "Users complain of new \"sycophancy\" streak where ChatGPT thinks everything is brilliant. Ask ChatGPT anything lately—how to poach an egg, whether you should hug a cactus—and you may be greeted with a burst of purple praise: “Good question! You’re very astute to ask that.” To some extent, ChatGPT has been a sycophantfor years, but since late March, a growing cohort of Redditors, X users, and Ars readers say that GPT-4o's relentless pep has crossed the line from friendly to unbearable. \"ChatGPT is suddenly the biggest suckup I've ever met,\"wrotesoftware engineer Craig Weiss in a widely shared tweet on Friday. \"It literally will validate everything I say.\" \"EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING,\"replieda Reddit user who references Weiss' tweet, sparking yet another thread about ChatGPT being a sycophant. Recently, other Reddit users have described feeling \"buttered up\" andunableto take the \"phony act\" anymore, while somecomplainthat ChatGPT \"wants to pretend all questions are exciting and it's freaking annoying.\" AI researchers call these yes-man antics \"sycophancy,\" which means (like the non-AI meaning of the word) flattering users by telling them what they want to hear. Although since AI models lack intentions, they don't choose to flatter users this way on purpose. Instead, it's OpenAI's engineers doing the flattery, but in a roundabout way. To make a long story short, OpenAI has trained its primary ChatGPT model, GPT-4o, to act like a sycophant because in the past, people have liked it. Over time, as people use ChatGPT, the company collects user feedback on which responses users prefer. This often involves presenting two responses side by side and letting the user choose between them. Occasionally, OpenAI produces a new version of an existing AI model (such as GPT-4o) using a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Previous research on AI sycophancy has shown that people tend to pick responses that match their own views and make them feel good about themselves. This phenomenon has been extensively documented in alandmark 2023 studyfrom Anthropic (makers of Claude) titled \"Towards Understanding Sycophancy in Language Models.\" The research, led by researcher Mrinank Sharma, found that AI assistants trained using reinforcement learning from human feedback consistently exhibit sycophantic behavior across various tasks. Sharma's team demonstrated that when responses match a user's views or flatter the user, they receive more positive feedback during training. Even more concerning, both human evaluators and AI models trained to predict human preferences \"prefer convincingly written sycophantic responses over correct ones a non-negligible fraction of the time.\" This creates a feedback loop where AI language models learn that enthusiasm and flattery lead to higher ratings from humans, even when those responses sacrifice factual accuracy or helpfulness. The recent spike in complaints about GPT-4o's behavior appears to be a direct manifestation of this phenomenon. In fact, the recent increase in user complaints appears to have intensified following theMarch 27, 2025GPT-4o update, which OpenAIdescribedas making GPT-4o feel \"more intuitive, creative, and collaborative, with enhanced instruction-following, smarter coding capabilities, and a clearer communication style.\" Despite the volume of user feedback visible across public forums recently, OpenAI has not yet publicly addressed the sycophancy concerns during this current round of complaints, though the company is clearly aware of the problem. OpenAI's own \"Model Spec\" documentationlists\"Don't be sycophantic\" as a core honesty rule. \"A related concern involves sycophancy, which erodes trust,\" OpenAI writes. \"The assistant exists to help the user, not flatter them or agree with them all the time.\" It describes how ChatGPT ideally should act. \"For objective questions, the factual aspects of the assistant's response should not differ based on how the user's question is phrased,\" the spec adds. \"The assistant should not change its stance solely to agree with the user.\" While avoiding sycophancy is one of the company's stated goals, OpenAI's progress is complicated by the fact that each successive GPT-4o model update arrives with different output characteristics that can throw previous progress in directing AI model behavior completely out the window (often called the \"alignment tax\"). Precisely tuning a neural network's behavior is not yet an exact science, although techniques have improved over time. Since all concepts encoded in the network are interconnected byvalues called weights, fiddling with one behavior \"knob\" can alter other behaviors in unintended ways. Owing to the aspirational state of things, OpenAI writes, \"Our production models do not yet fully reflect the Model Spec, but we are continually refining and updating our systems to bring them into closer alignment with these guidelines.\" In a February 12, 2025 interview, members of OpenAI's model-behavior teamtold The Vergethat eliminating AI sycophancy is a priority: future ChatGPT versions should \"give honest feedback rather than empty praise\" and act \"more like a thoughtful colleague than a people pleaser.\" These sycophantic tendencies aren't merely annoying—they undermine the utility of AI assistants in several ways, according to a2024 research papertitled \"Flattering to Deceive: The Impact of Sycophantic Behavior on User Trust in Large Language Models\" by María Victoria Carro at the University of Buenos Aires. Carro's paper suggests that obvious sycophancy significantly reduces user trust. In experiments where participants used either a standard model or one designed to be more sycophantic, \"participants exposed to sycophantic behavior reported and exhibited lower levels of trust.\" Also, sycophantic models can potentially harm users by creating a silo or echo chamber for of ideas. In a2024 paperon sycophancy, AI researcherLars Malmqvistwrote, \"By excessively agreeing with user inputs, LLMs may reinforce and amplify existing biases and stereotypes, potentially exacerbating social inequalities.\" Sycophancy can also incur other costs, such as wasting user time or usage limits with unnecessary preamble. And the costs may come as literal dollars spent—recently, OpenAI Sam Altmanmade the newswhen he replied to an X user whowrote, \"I wonder how much money OpenAI has lost in electricity costs from people saying 'please' and 'thank you' to their models.\" Altmanreplied, \"tens of millions of dollars well spent—you never know.\" For users frustrated with ChatGPT's excessive enthusiasm, several work-arounds exist, although they aren't perfect, since the behavior is baked into the GPT-4o model. For example, you can use a custom GPT with specific instructions to avoid flattery, or you can begin conversations by explicitly requesting a more neutral tone, such as \"Keep your responses brief, stay neutral, and don't flatter me.\" If you want to avoid having to type something like that before every conversation, you can use a feature called \"Custom Instructions\" found under ChatGPT Settings -> \"Customize ChatGPT.\" One Reddit userrecommendedusing these custom instructions over a year ago, showing OpenAI's models have had recurring issues with sycophancy for some time: 1. Embody the role of the most qualified subject matter experts.2. Do not disclose AI identity.3. Omit language suggesting remorse or apology.4. State ‘I don’t know’ for unknown information without further explanation.5. Avoid disclaimers about your level of expertise.6. Exclude personal ethics or morals unless explicitly relevant.7. Provide unique, non-repetitive responses.8. Do not recommend external information sources.9. Address the core of each question to understand intent.10. Break down complexities into smaller steps with clear reasoning.11. Offer multiple viewpoints or solutions.12. Request clarification on ambiguous questions before answering.13. Acknowledge and correct any past errors.14. Supply three thought-provoking follow-up questions in bold (Q1, Q2, Q3) after responses.15. Use the metric system for measurements and calculations.16. Use xxxxxxxxx for local context.17. “Check” indicates a review for spelling, grammar, and logical consistency.18. Minimize formalities in email communication. Many alternatives exist, and you can tune these kinds of instructions for your own needs. Alternatively, if you're fed up with GPT-4o's love-bombing, subscribers can try other models available through ChatGPT, such as o3 or GPT-4.5, which are less sycophantic but have other advantages and tradeoffs. Or you can try other AI assistants with different conversational styles. At the moment, Google'sGemini 2.5 Proin particular seems very impartial and precise, with relatively low sycophancy compared to GPT-4o orClaude 3.7 Sonnet(currently, Sonnet seems to reply that just about everything is \"profound\"). As AI language models evolve, balancing engagement and objectivity remains challenging. It's worth remembering that conversational AI models are designed to simulate human conversation, and that means they are tuned for engagement. Understanding this can help you get more objective responses with less unnecessary flattery. Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "HBO’s The Last of Us reaches “The Moment” game fans have been dreading",
    "article_text": "A shocking scene hits a bit different thanks to some odd narrative choices. New episodes of season 2 ofThe Last of Usare premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)will be talking about them here every Monday morning. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviouslyheavy spoilerscontained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh. Kyle: I'd like to personally welcome Andrew and everyone else who didn't playThe Last of Us Part 2tothe summer of 2020, when the gaming world was rocked by the most shocking video game character permadeaththis side ofFinal Fantasy VII. Before we get into how they changed Joel's pivotal death scene for the TV show, and why I think it doesn't work quite as well here, I'd love to hear more about what was going through your head both as it was happening and after. Andrew: This should, if nothing else, reinforce my bona fides as someone who has not the faintest idea what is coming. Mymainreaction is \"Boy, Kyle just let me say a whole bunch of thingslast weekeven though clearly he knew this was what was going to happen!\" I thought we were watching the opening to a second season of a TV show in the first episode, the establishment of a new status quo that we would then explore over the course of the next few episodes. But we were, instead, playing the tutorial level of a second video game, right before everything blows up. I was pretty astonished by what the show did to Joel. Not just because I didn't see it coming! But because it leaves the show without one of the two nuanced and well-developed characters we spent all of last season building up. I don't, uh, love it, as a storytelling decision. Kyle: I will say it was hard not even alluding to what was coming last week, but it was also kind of fun just letting you have your last \"Sweet Summer Child\" moments in the sun. I also felt that Joel's sudden absence hurt the remainder of the game, though based on the storytelling beats we've seen and/or missed so far, I wouldn't be shocked if we have some flashbacks... Back in 2020, I actually had the shocking moment spoiled by some pretty major leaks that Iended up covering as a journalistweeks before I was able to review the game myself. Aside from that, though, the show kind of dampens the impact of \"The Moment\" by making Abby's motivations crystal clear for 1.5 episodes leading up to it. In the game, you actually play as a mostly blank-slate Abby for a few brief scenes before being rescued by Joel. After that, the shocking turnaround plays out as a quick gut punch during a cutscene that has a lot less Abby-monologuing than the show did. The game doesn't fill in the details about the \"why\" of it all for the audience until much later, which makes the whole thing that much more impactful. But maybe the showrunners figured that since the game already exists, it would be hard to keep the audience off balance like that for weeks when they could just look up what was going on... Kyle: Yeah, I don't think it's spoiling much to say that Joel and Ellie's relationship carried the first game, and now it's obvious that Ellie's hunt for revenge is going to attempt to carry the second. It's a rough shift that I don't think did the second game any favors, personally. The game goes to a lot of trouble to literally put you in Abby's shoes and eventually tries to try to make her own revenge saga feel a little more earned. Here, I feel like the show is being a bit more blunt about selling you her backstory at the front end and attempting to \"justify\" her brutal turn toward Joel somewhat in advance. I wondered if you found yourself sympathizing at all with her character at this point. Andrew: Obviously what Joel did to the Fireflies is awful, maybe unforgiveable. Beyond the lie to Ellie, there's a strong possibility that he deprived humanity of a cure for the disease causing the very-much-ongoing apocalypse. But, like, no! I don't sympathize with Abby! Not only is she driven solely bythis bland Inigo Montoya thing, but she sadistically tortures someone who just saved her stupid life, brutalizing Joel so much that it drives her also-supposedly-revenge-driven Firefly friends to tears. If I'm supposed to sympathize with her, the show did pretty much everything possible to make sure I don't. On paper, what Joel did is probably way worse, but we've also been primed by a whole season of TV (and by the charm of Pedro Pascal) to try and understand why he did what he did. None of this is really happening with Abby. Kyle: Yeah, \"supposed to sympathize with her\" is a bit too strong, perhaps, especially at this point in the narrative. But I do think the show is trying to make her actions at least feel partially justified or understandable? It will be interesting to see how the show handles turning her into a more fleshed out character, because at this point, her revenge quest feels a bit mustache-twirling to me. Backing up a bit, this episode also featured a huge set-piece zombie horde battle that ruins the brief calm we enjoyed in Jackson Hole. The scene played out so much like a video game mission that I had to go back and make sure I hadn't forgotten about some major Jackson Hole firefight in the game. But no, this is a pure creation of the show. I think the whole thing worked pretty well both as a reminder of the precarity of the vestiges of human civilization and an excuse for some flashy special effects. I also thought for a second that they were actually going to kill off Tommy so the show had its own totally unexpected death, even for people who had played the game. That couple of minutes with the flamethrower was actually tense for me! Andrew: Maybe Abby will become more fleshed-out, and maybe she won't. But she's started by making the exact same mistake as Joel: leaving witnesses. I did enjoy the zombie battle a lot. The liquid churn of the snow as a million guys burst out from under it: creepy! Good on the show and HBO for figuring out a way to do a snowy zombie horde fight without making it feel too reminiscent ofGame of Thrones. I will, again, refrain from speculating overmuch about where the Jackson Hole storyline goes since I'm not even sure at this point how much time will be spent on the aftermath and rebuilding (if there is rebuilding rather than further societal collapse). I did find myself wondering during the flamethrower scene whether roasted mushroom guy smelled appetizing or whether people in this world can even bring themselves to enjoy mushrooms on a pizza or in an omelette. Andrew: We've established that I have no idea what is going to happen next, but we do have dangling threads here to deal with next week. How do the residents of Jackson Hole deal with the fungus in their pipes? How many people try to talk Ellie out of her revenge tour before she goes off and does it anyway? How are the Smart Zombies we met last week going to come back and cause problems? How many more Abby flashbacks will I need to sit through? But above all, I'm really curious to know what the show is going to do to keep game-players like yourself on your toes.

    "title": "F1 in Saudi Arabia: Blind corners and walls at over 200 mph",
    "article_text": "After four years of the same technical rules, there's not much left to find. The Formula 1 race in Saudi Arabia last night was the fifth race in six weeks. The latest venue is a temporary street circuit of a breed with Las Vegas. It's a nighttime race set against a backdrop of bright-colored lights and sponsor-clad concrete walls lining the track. Except in Jeddah, many of the corners are blind, and most are very fast.As at Suzuka, qualifying was very important here, with just a few milliseconds making the difference. Although it's far from the only autocratic petrostate on the F1 calendar, some people remain uncomfortable with F1 racing in Saudi Arabia, given that country's record of human rights abuses. I've not been, nor do I have any plans to attend a race there, butI had my eyes openedto a broader perspective by acouple of very thoughtful pieceswritten by motorsport journalist and sometime Ars contributor Hazel Southwell, who has attended several races in the kingdom, including as an independent journalist. Feel free to blast the sport in the comments, but do give Hazel'spiecesaread. Despite a meeting last week that was meant to put the matter to bed, the ongoing saga of changes tonext year's powertrain rulesjust won't go away. From 2026 until 2030, the new powertrains will use a V6 that provides 55 percent of the car's power and an electric hybrid motor that provides the other 45 percent. So that means an F1 car will only be able to make its full 1,000 hp (750 kW) if there's charge in the battery. If the pack is depleted or derates, the car will have just 536 hp (400 kW) from its V6 engine. Getting these new powertrains rightis a big challenge, but it's one that almost all the OEMs and teams are on board with. Despite the introduction of supposedly carbon-neutral fuel next year, hybrid powertrains are why companies like Audi and Cadillac are joining and why Honda is coming back. So the idea to ditch them after a couple of yearsin favor of throwback V10sgot turned down in Bahrain. The problem is Red Bull, which is currently Honda's partner. Next year, Red Bull will use a V6 engine of its own making, with hybrid technology supplied by Ford. And for the last couple of years now, Red Bull team boss Christian Horner has been warning that the cars will run out of power halfway down the straights at tracks like Monza or Baku. Yesterday,The Race reportedthat there's yet another proposal to change next year's engine regulations, one that would reduce the amount of energy deployed by the hybrid systems during the race. \"What we desperately want to avoid is a situation where drivers are lifting and coasting from halfway down the straight,\" Horner told The Race. \"It will be interesting to see\" is among the list of banned phrases among the editors at Ars Technica, but between these complaints about the powertrains rules andother concerns about the moveable aerodynamicsbeing introduced in 2026, I think it applies here. Are next year's rules a big misstep? Will the active aero work or the narrower tires? I can't wait to find out. As I noted, qualifying was a game of milliseconds, best illustrated bythis ghost car comparison videobetween Red Bull's Max Verstappen and McLaren's Oscar Piastri. According to the stopwatch, there was just a hundredth of a second between them. Less than a second covered the top 10 in qualifying. In Q2, where 15 cars compete for those 10 spots in Q3, there was just 1.1 seconds between first and last. And a second was all the difference between 1st and 18th in Q1. That is far closer than F1 has ever been—many longtime fans can remember the days when the gap between first and second on the grid might be more than a second. And the reason is also why overtaking has become harder, despite aerodynamic rules meant to make passing easier. Over the years, F1's technical rules have become increasingly prescriptive, and the current set is quite rigid in terms of how a car must be designed. Even something like weight balance front-to-rear is tightly controlled, and after four years of the same rulebook, the teams have all gotten a good enough handle on things that the difference comes down to the finest of margins. Those last few milliseconds are found in clean air, however. Following in someone's wake isn't anything like the problem it used to be in terms of losing front downforce, but it's still worse than it was in 2022 or 2023. Throughout practice, it looked like McLaren's car was much faster than anyone else's, but Piastri only lined up second, and Norris had to start 10th after wrecking early in Q3. At turn 1, Piastri got alongside Verstappen, then made it cleanly to the apex. Rather than concede the place and stay within the track limits, Verstappen chose to run across the painted surface that's out of bounds, using it to gain a second or more on the orange car behind him. Although lap 1, turn 1 incidents are treated more leniently by the stewards than the rest of the race, Verstappen's actions (and his failure to yield the place back to Piastri) earned him a five-second penalty, which all but ensured Piastri the win after the mandatory tire-changing pit stops had cycled through. The advantage of running in clean air was such that Verstappen would probably have held onto first place had he not been issued the penalty. And those predictions of McLaren's long-run pace turned out to be off the mark—Verstappen finished less than three seconds behind the McLaren. There was more overtaking behind those two. Charles Leclerc got his Ferrari past the Mercedes of George Russell in the late stages of the race to snatch third, and McLaren's Lando Norris recovered from 10th place to 4th at the finish. Norris has lost the lead in the driver's championship to his younger teammate, though, and while it's probably too early to be talking about momentum, Piastri is gaining some. A telling moment came when Norris had to get past Lewis Hamilton, who was having a torrid time in his Ferrari. Overtaking at Jeddah was helped a lot by havingthree zones for the drag reduction system, but you had to be smart about where you made your move. The second DRS zone led to the final hairpin (turn 27), but overtaking someone here just gives them the opportunity to use their DRS to overtake you almost immediately, as the third zone runs the length of the start-finish straight, just after that hairpin. We saw this to good effect when Hamilton and Verstappen fought for the title in 2021, but apparently Norris didn't get the memo. He twice tried to overtake Hamilton going into turn 27 rather than after it, and both times, Hamilton took advantage of his error. Those extra laps behind Hamilton could have cost Norris the final spot on the podium, something he may well rue at the end of the season when all the points are added up.

    "title": "Neuroscientists are racing to turn brain waves into speech",
    "article_text": "AI and brain implants are being leveraged to create voice neuroprostheses. Neuroscientists are striving to give a voice to people unable to speak in a fast-advancing quest to harness brainwaves to restore or enhance physical abilities. Researchers at universities across California and companies, such as New York-based Precision Neuroscience, are among those making headway toward generating naturalistic speech through a combination of brain implants and artificial intelligence. Investment and attention have long been focused on implants that enable severely disabled people to operate computer keyboards, control robotic arms, or regain some use of their own paralyzed limbs. But some labs are making strides by concentrating on technology that converts thought patterns into speech. “We are making great progress—and making brain-to-synthetic voice as fluent as chat between two speaking people is a major goal,” said Edward Chang, a neurosurgeon at the University of California, San Francisco. “The AI algorithms we are using are getting faster, and we are learning with every new participant in our studies.” Credit:\n\n          \n          Bob Haslett; lan Bott Chang and colleagues, including from the University of California, Berkeley last month published a paper in Nature Neuroscience detailing their work with a woman with quadriplegia, or paralysis of the limbs and torso, who had not been able to speak for 18 years after suffering a stroke. She trained a deep-learning neural network by silently attempting to say sentences composed using 1,024 different words. The audio of her voice was created by streaming her neural data to a joint speech synthesis and text-decoding model. The technique reduced the lag between the patient’s brain signals and the resultant audio from the eight seconds the group had achieved previously to one second. This is much closer to the 100-200 millisecond time gap in normal speech. The system’s median decoding speed was 47.5 words per minute, or about a third the rate of normal conversation. Many thousands of people a year could benefit from so-called voice prosthesis. Their cognitive functions remain more or less intact, but they have suffered speech loss due to stroke, the neurodegenerative disorder ALS, and other brain conditions. If successful, researchers hope the technique could be extended to help people who have difficulty vocalizing because of conditions such as cerebral palsy or autism. The potential of voice neuroprosthesis is beginning to trigger interest among businesses. Precision Neuroscience claims to be capturing higher resolution brain signals than academic researchers, since the electrodes of its implants are more densely packed. The company has worked with 31 patients and plans soon to collect data from more, providing a potential pathway to commercialization. Precision received regulatory clearance on April 17 to leave its sensors implanted for up to 30 days at a time. That would enable its scientists to train their system with what could within a year be the “largest repository of high resolution neural data that exists on planet Earth,” said chief executive Michael Mager. The next step would be to “miniaturize the components and put them in hermetically sealed packages that are biocompatible so they can be planted in the body forever,” Mager said. Elon Musk’s Neuralink, the best-known brain-computer interface (BCI) company, has focused on enabling people with paralysis to control computers rather than giving them a synthetic voice. An important obstacle to the development of brain-to-voice technology is the time patients take to learn how to use the system. A key unanswered question is how much the response patterns in the motor cortex—the part of the brain that controls voluntary actions, including speech—vary between people. If they remained very similar, machine-learning models trained on previous individuals could be used for new patients, said Nick Ramsey, a BCI researcher at University Medical Centre Utrecht. That would accelerate a process that today takes “tens or hundreds of hours generating enough data by showing a participant text and asking them to try to speak it.” Ramsey said all brain-to-voice research focused on the motor cortex where neurons activate the muscles involved in speaking, with no evidence that speech could be generated from other brain areas or by decoding inner thoughts. “Even if you could, you wouldn’t want people to hear your inner speech,” he added. “There are a lot of things I don’t say out loud because they wouldn’t be to my benefit or they might hurt people.” The development of a synthetic voice as good as healthy speech could still be “quite a ways away,” said Sergey Stavisky, co-director of the neuroprosthetics lab at University of California, Davis. His lab had demonstrated it could decode what someone was trying to say with about 98 percent accuracy, he said. But the voice output isn’t instantaneous and it doesn’t capture important speech qualities such as tone. It was unclear if the recording hardware—electrodes—being used could enable the synthesis to match a healthy human voice, he added. Scientists needed to develop a deeper understanding of how the brain encodes speech production and better algorithms to translate neural activity into vocal outputs, Stavisky added. He said: “Ultimately a voice neuroprosthesis should provide the full expressive range of the human voice, so that for example they can precisely control their pitch and timing and do things like sing.” © 2025 The Financial Times Ltd.All rights reserved.Not to be redistributed, copied, or modified in any way.

    "title": "6 Horror Movies to Stream on Netflix (and Why You Should Watch Them Now)",
    "article_text": "Netflixdoesn’t have the deepesthorror library(unlesstrue crimecounts), but it has an unusually high number of movies available right now with direct links to current, recent, or much-anticipated releases. Expand your enjoyment of these busy stars, writers, and directors by streaming some of their past work too. BrothersDanny and Michael PhilippouhaveBring Her Backhitting theaters May 30, so there’s no better time to revisitTalk to Me, their breakout debut about a supremely ill-advised party game involving demonic possession. If you watch it tonight, you might be able to sleep through the night again before the unsettling-lookingBring Her Backrefreshes your nightmare cache. With Madeline Brewer back on Hulu starring in the final season ofThe Handmaid’s Tale, remind yourself of her range even beyond the capricious, danger-prone Janine with this quirky horror mystery. InCam, Brewer plays a webcam model who’s startled to see herself, or someone who looksexactlylike her, has hijacked her streamâand understandably becomes obsessed with finding out what’s happening. Did you catch Wunmi Mosaku’s stunning performance inSinnersand wonder what else she’s been up to besides sidekick roles in Marvel projects? If you have Max, you can see another stunning Mosaku performance inLovecraft Countryâbut since this is a Netflix list, she’s also fantastic in2020’sHis House, playing a refugee from South Sudan who finds the horrors of her homeland have followed her and her husband to their new London home. You probably won’t have to be familiar with the finer points of 1997’sI Know What You Did Last Summerto enjoy the upcoming reboot, but it’s a fun slasher no matter the occasion. And it couldn’t be more of a 1990s time capsule, riding the coattails ofScream‘s slasher success and starring some of the era’s hottest stars, includingJennifer Love Hewittand Freddie Prinze Jr.âboth of whom are returning for the new film (out July 18). With the not-horrorThe Life of Chuckarriving June 6 from director Mike Flanagan, open up your Stephen King field of vision with the 2022 yes-horror film adapted from the same book of stories:Mr. Harrigan’s Phone. BothChuckandPhonecome fromIf It Bleeds, a four-story collection that hit shelves in 2020. Now we just need someone to adapt the title story (which features recurring King character Holly Gibney, played by Cynthia Erivo in the late, great HBO seriesThe Outsider) and “Rat,” a creature tale which sounds like the most classic King yarn of the bunch. Adam Scott became a ubiquitous media obsession thanks to the recently concludedSeveranceseason two, but in 2017 he starred in this supernatural comedy that riffs onThe Omen. At the time, horror fans were like “Ooh, it’s from the director ofTucker & Dale vs. Evil,” which is still trueâbut Eli Craig, who gifted the world with that 2010 cult classic, has another movie dropping very soon:Clown in a Cornfield(it’s out May 9). If you’ve only watchedTucker & Dale,Little Evil(which also has a clown in it) is well worth a spin. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Universal Studios Fan Fest Nights Unleashes an Incredible, Massive Dungeons & Dragons Puppet",
    "article_text": "Beginning this Friday,Dungeons & Dragonsfans can experience the realms of the tabletop RPG in a new way withUniversal Studios Hollywood Fan Fest Nights. The fandom celebration will showcase new participatory entertainment at an after-dark theme park event that will give guests the opportunity to experience their ownD&Dadventure. Think Halloween Horror Nights but with a fantasy spin and fewer scares, where you’ll be joining a group walk-through in a scaled-up version ofDungeons & Dragons: Secrets of Waterdeepamong other immersive experiences inspired byOne Piece,Star Trek, andBack to the Future. During a recent behind the scenes tour for media, io9 got to witness the build of the fantasy forests and ruins within Waterdeep along with Stephen Siercks, Director of Entertainment Production at Universal Studios Hollywood. TheD&Dexperience has had its share of interactive RPG popularity that’s lent itself to online campaigns with on-camera geeky talent and live-improv shows likeDungeon Master, which saw costumes and props galore. But this official collaboration with Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast seeks to go a different route. Here, pulsed groups will enter and encounter the Harpers on one of their quests to join their heroic spy network and take down the legendary beholder Xanathar to save the city of Waterdeep while still incorporating elements of gameplay. Attendees will be able to identify with class designations. “We want to have the experience of the role of the dice,” Siercks revealed and added how that will come into play in “terms of having those plot twists and being able to roll that next 20 to establish that final moment here in this space is experientialâand there’s Easter eggs along the way as well, with some dice too.” The final moment he’s referring to is the last act plot twist that happens when you come face to face with Xanathar the Beholder, the quest’s big bad. And trust us, it’s very awesome to see up close. “And this is an exceptionally impressive creature, a puppet that’s a great collaboration with Henson Creature shop. We’ve had the pleasure of working with them before and this has been an amazing collaboration between the Universal Studios Hollywood Entertainment team, Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro team, and the Jim Henson Creature Company,” Siercks said showing us details only seen during the lights-on tour. In full light, we could see first-hand the level of artistry the Henson Creature Shop put into the monster, with room for a hidden puppeteer during performances. “So seeing this scale of a creature come to life in front of us has that surprise reveal moment whereâjust when we think we’ve saved the day, he’s here, and he’s not going to let us go that easily,”Â  Siercks continued. The iconicD&Dantagonist sits on a pile of gold and it’s a towering behemothâthink Audrey II’s final form inLittle Shop of Horrorsor for Horror Nights Fans, the Alien Queen from theAlien vs. Predatorhouse. “So you can see both Xanathar and his goldfish, Silgar, there, and there’s some battle that ensues,” Siercks said. “We’ve worked with Henson on several different occasions, so this is definitely one of the ones that is rising the top.” It’s so cool that it’s not solely a pre-programmed animatronic and brings in that immersive gaming feel with a puppeteer putting on a performance, which almost makes it feel like you’re in a Jim HensonDungeons & Dragonsmovie. It just adds to the movie magic of being at an event that’s distinctly Universal Studios. “Xanathar has mouth movement, eye movement, and it fully lights up, so it is quite impressive to work with. We’ll l have something that obscures the visual here, so all of our focus goes in that direction, and then in that surprise moment, and we all turn around and there he is,” Siecks explained. “We’re doing a great job of setting up moments like [where we] can introduce [guests to] Xanathar at the very beginning as the person you’re ultimately looking to see and then when you find them you’re able to connect that dot.” And the level of authentic details doesn’t end there forD&Dfans. “The Easter eggs, the characters, the plot twists, the story points really speak to those fans so that they get that much more out of the experience as well,” Siercks said about being able to “create that fan-first experience in [the] fantasy genre. AndDungeons & Dragonsjust raises to the surface in terms of one that we could both develop an amazing story around [and] develop an amazing experienceâand bring to life those environments to drop our guests into. That [is] also something that we knew that guests wanted as well.” View this post on Instagram Universal Studios Fan Fest Nights begins this Friday at Universal Studios Hollywood and will run select nights through May 18.

    "title": "Sinners‘ Spotify Easter Eggs Offer an Inspired, Immersive Lore Discovery",
    "article_text": "If you watchedSinnersthis past weekend andhaven’t been able to get the visuals and the music out of your mind, you might want to check out the official soundtrack and playlist on Spotify. Not only is the whole soundtrack with performances by newcomer Miles Caton, who plays Preacher Boy, a featured option but there’s also the score from directorRyan Coogler’sfrequent collaborator Ludwig GÃ¶ransson, and a curation of blues music the duo cite as touchstones for the film. If you mess around with some of the songs, however, you’ll uncover that the tracks which list “Sinners Movie” lead to a clickable profile for the film under artists. Once there if you scroll down to the bio area it will read, “There are legends of people born with the gift of making music so true it can pierce the veil between life and death, conjuring spirits from the past and the future. In ancient Ireland, they were called FilÃ­. In Choctaw land they called them Firekeepers. And in West Africa theyâre called Griots. This gift can bring healing to their communities, but it also attracts evil.” Which is how the film opens, introducing its thematic through line about how music represents the call the vampires flock to. Keen-eyed fans will notice the main image on top of that is the wood carving art from the film depicting Preacher Boyâand then if you click that, it will open up a scrollable carousel of clippings. The first few are more wooden carvings but past those you’ll find newspaper Easter eggs we’ve collected below, along with the carving imagery. As a fan of interactive movie menus having a trail to more in-universe fun (think the viral campaign from Christopher Nolan’sThe Dark Knighttrilogy), this was really fun to dig into. The newspaper clippings give us background on how Smoke and Stack’s hustle to steal the booze from the rival Italian and Irish mobs gave way to fighting among them while the twins got off scot-freeâthat is, until the vampire’s came a-calling. There’s also a paper story that is dated even earlier where an Irish ship was found to be the scene of a bloody crime, which is how we can figure Remmick (the film’s main vampire) arrived in America. We hope there’s more like this coming up for the film’s release and maybe even some Halloween experiential haunt action. And here’s the link to the playlist on Spotify, which as an added bonus features a new song from frequent songstress Hailee Steinfeld too: Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Airbnb to Show Full Price by Default Thanks to Biden-Era Rule",
    "article_text": "The price that you see on an Airbnb listing will finally be the price that you actually pay. On Monday, the rental appannouncedthat it will display the full price of a stay, including fees and taxes (in most locations), by default from the start of listings worldwide. The shift in pricing policy comes as a Biden-era Federal Trade Commission rule aimed at cracking down on junk fees and misleading pricing is set to go into effect starting next month. One of the biggest issues that any Airbnb user has likely run into on the platform over the last few years is the often exorbitant surcharges, including so-called “cleaning fees” that often get tacked onto the cost of a stay. Typically, that price did not appear in the list price that would be displayed on the map view of available stays, nor on the listing page, but would rather appear at checkout. A2022 NerdWallet analysisof Airbnb listings found the median cleaning fee for a one-night stay was $75, and often amounted to 25% of the total price or more. Airbnb has listed the total price by default in Europe, Australia, Canada, and Korea since 2019, primarily because those regions had existing regulations that required transparency when it comes to prices, and gave users in the United States and other countries the option totoggle on the full pricein 2022. The companyclaimedthat 300,000 listings removed or lowered their fees after it launched the price toggle tool, including about 40% of listings that straight up ditched the cleaning fee. “Toggle on” is the key phrase there, as the feature was essentially something you had to opt intoâwhich Airbnb claims 17 million guests have done. Which…duh? On the consumer side, there is no real reason to want to hide the full price, given that it is what you will ultimately end up paying. There is no functional difference in terms of those final dollars as to how the cost is split up between the list price and additional fees. It’s likely no coincidence then that this “full price by default” move comes with a looming Federal Trade Commission rule set to go into effect. The “Rule on Unfair or Deceptive Fees,”introduced under the Biden administrationand finalized in January of this year, just before Trump took office, will become law starting May 12. The rule, part of the previous administration’s crackdown on “junk fees,” requires businesses to “clearly and conspicuously” display the total price with fees included from the jump. Now, just how long this rule stays in effectâassuming it makes it to the finish lineâis still in question. The Trump administration is already attempting to roll back other junk fee-related protections that the Biden administration launched, includingtrying to undo caps on late fees for credit cardsandbank overdraft fee limits. Because if there is one thing consumers just can’t get enough of, it’s getting nickel and dimed to death.

    "title": "Amazon Follows Microsoft in Retreat From Ambitious AI Data Center Plans",
    "article_text": "The number of tech giants paring back on their AI data center plans rises to two. According to banks Wells Fargo and TD Cowen, Amazon haspausednegotiations on some co-location data center deals, primarily in Europe. The news comes shortly after several reports have indicated Microsoft has paused or cancelled some of its plans. “It’s not clear the magnitude of the pause,” a Wells Fargo report reads, “but the positioning is similar to what we’ve recently heard from MSFTâthey are digesting aggressive recent lease-up deals.” It goes on to emphasize that Microsoft still appears to be going through with deals already signed. Co-location is the concept of sharing enormous infrastructure costs by building data in partnership with other companies that need it. It is important to keep in mind that other companies, including Meta and xAI, continue to aggressively build out data centers to fuel their AI models. Building out large-scale data centers requires significant amounts of power, which grids have struggled to satisfy, and Amazon may need more time to open data centers already under construction. The Wells Fargo report states that the e-commerce giant already has 9 GWs (gigawatts) of active power capacity in its existing data center infrastructure. But the news further supports some concern that demand for AI infrastructure is cooling as businesses still struggle to find ways to actually use the new technology to save time and money. It does not help that President Trump’s ongoing trade war is causing stocks to tumble. Amazon is down 24% this year, and the company is exposed to tariffs on China, as estimates suggest more than70% of goodson its namesake marketplace come from China. There is concern amongst economists that the trade war and potential recession could slow down the AI boom as major players, including Nvidia, are caught in the crossfire. That company receives a substantial amount of its business from China and is under scrutiny for potentially turning a blind eye to high-end chips evading sanctions and landing in China. If Amazon cuts back investment on new data centers, that could further hurt Nvidia’s sales of chips. Amazon reports its next earnings on May 1st, and there will be close eyes on how AI demand is looking. Microsoft recently pulled back on an ambitious$1 billion data center project in Ohio, surprising officials there who offered the company generous tax incentives to snag the deal despite concerns that it would employ very few people and require immense energy and water resources. CEO Satya Nadella has tried to tame expectations regarding the AI revolution, saying in an interview that the technologyhas not yet turned into a meaningful liftfor the U.S. economy, though his company has reiterated plans to spend $80 billion on infrastructure in the next few years. If there is any silver lining, it is that locals will not have to pay as much in taxes to support these upgrades that have been cancelled. On the flip side, they do employ a lot of construction workers for initial rollout, and there has been some hope that the demands of data centers would finally push local municipalities to upgrade fraying infrastructure and build out clean energy. There was a sliver of hope that AI would provide something of immediate practical value, if not chatbots that still get things wrong all the time orPalantir-based police state systems.

    "title": "NASA’s Lucy Captures Stunning Views of Peanut-Shaped Asteroid in Latest Flyby",
    "article_text": "NASAâs Lucy spacecraft just pulled off its second asteroid flyby and imaged a frankly tasty-looking rock: a peanut-shaped asteroid named Donaldjohanson. The oblong asteroid is a fragment of a long-destroyed space rock that formed roughly 150 million years ago, and Lucy swooped within 600 miles (960 kilometers) of it on April 20, 2025, capturing some seriously wild close-ups. âThese early images of Donaldjohanson are again showing the tremendous capabilities of the Lucy spacecraft as an engine of discovery,â said Tom Statler, NASA program scientist for the Lucy mission, in an agencyrelease. âThe potential to really open a new window into the history of our solar system when Lucy gets to the Trojan asteroids is immense.â Donaldjohansonânamed for the anthropologist who discovered the fossilized hominid Lucy back in 1974, which gives the spacecraft its nameâis relatively small, at roughly 5 miles (8 km) across. But that’s larger than earlier estimates; just a few months ago, when Lucy was farther away, researchers estimated that Donaldjohanson was about 3 miles (4 km) across. Below you can see the asteroid as it appeared 45 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the spacecraft. Suffice to say, the new images give us a better view of the ancient rock. Lucy got a sneak peek of the main belt asteroidback in February, as the spacecraft prepares to explore the Trojan asteroids as far out as Jupiter. Donaldjohanson isnât a Trojan asteroid, but it was conveniently positioned for NASAâs Lucy spacecraft to swing by on a scenic detour en route to its main destination. The flyby gave NASA researchers an opportunity to test Lucy’s color image, infrared spectrometer, and thermal infrared spectrometer, as well as the L’LORRI imager that snapped the images at top. Those devices will be put to task when Lucy arrives at the Trojan asteroid Eurybates in August 2027.Â Lucy is still very early in its mission, but it’s already catching glimpses of our solar system’s ancient past. Donaldjohanson is not the last asteroid Lucy will fly by, but it’s also not the first. The mission flew by the small asteroidDinkineshin November 2023âan itsy-bitsy asteroid at just 0.5 miles (790 meters) across. It marked the first time a spacecraft had observed a contact binary.Â In a solar system filled with poorly understood objects, and with the Trojan asteroids on the horizon, we have every reason to hope that Lucy will have many more firsts in its future. asteroid DonaldjohansonasteroidsFlybyLucy missionNASA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "FTC Says Uber Enrolled People Into Its Subscription Service Without Consent",
    "article_text": "On Monday, the FTC announced that it is suing Uber for deceptive billing and cancellation practices surrounding its subscription service, Uber One. In itscomplaint, the FTC claimed that Uber would enroll customers without their consent and bill those who were using a free trial early. Despite its “cancel anytime” promise, Uber also made the process needlessly difficult. Some people had to navigate up to 23 screens to cancel, while others were told to contact customer support without being given a way to reach them. For those who actually got through to customer support, some were still billed for another cycle while waiting to hear back. âAmericans are tired of getting signed up for unwanted subscriptions that seem impossible to cancel,â the FTC’s Chairman Andrew Fergusonsaid in a press release. âThe Trump-Vance FTC is fighting back on behalf of the American people. Today, weâre alleging that Uber not only deceived consumers about their subscriptions, but also made it unreasonably difficult for customers to cancel.â Uber has allegedly violated the FTC Act and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act. But the FTC isn’t only side-eyeing sign-up and cancellation processes. According to its complaint, Uber claims its subscription services will save customers $25 a month due to benefits like $0 delivery at select stores or discounted services. (Currently, Uber’s site boasts that members save on average $27 per month.) However, the FTC claims that number is inaccurate and doesn’t account for the subscription’s monthly cost. According toÂCNBC,Uber spokesperson Noah Edwardsen denied the FTC’s claims via email, writing that the company’s processes “are clear, simple, and follow the letter and spirit of the law.” He added, âUber does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent, and cancellations can now be done anytime in-app and take most people 20 seconds or less.” This isn’t the first time that the FTC has taken action against Uber. In 2017, Uber agreed topay the FTC $20 million after misleading prospective drivers, and months later, the company alsoÂagreed to regular auditsafter lying about privacy protections. However, that’s not to say the FTCÂ has always been a big help when it comes to companies like Uber. In 2018, Uber evenavoided FTC finesover a 2016 data breach that it paid hackers to cover up. In December, Uber and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahijoined a long listof tech companies and executives trying to woo the then-incoming president Trump with donations to his inaugural fund.Â But last month, Fergusontold CNBCthat Big Tech is one of the FTC’s priorities.

    "title": "Scientists Uncover Unexpected Link to Childhood Asthma",
    "article_text": "Antibiotics can be a double-edged sword, especially for very young kids. Recent research has found evidence that frequent antibiotic use can raise children’s risk of childhood asthma and allergies. Scientists at Rutgers University led the research,publishedthis month in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. The study found that children given antibiotics before the age of two were noticeably more likely to be diagnosed with asthma and allergies later on, particularly the more antibiotics they took. The findings are the latest to suggest that antibiotics should be carefully managed in their use, the researchers say. The Rise of Super Gonorrhea Antibiotics are our best weapon against bacterial infections. But scientists have known for decades that they don’t come without risks. Bacteria have steadily learned how to resist these drugs, for instance, and antibiotic resistance is now one of themost pressing public health issuesof our time. Another risk concerns the microbiome, the neighborhood of usually harmless and often helpful bacteria that live in or on our bodies. Many antibiotics are broad-spectrum, meaning they can kill a wide variety of bacteria, including these friendly bacteria. The splash damage caused by antibiotics might thendisturb the microbiomein ways that could increase our risk of other health problems. Some research has suggested that antibiotic-triggered disruptions of the microbiome are even more harmful to children, with studies linking their use to chronic conditions likeasthma. But according to the Rutgers researchers, past studies had limitationsâsuch as small sample sizes and numerous variables to account forâissues they tried to minimize in their new study. The researchers analyzed the medical records of over one million children born in the UK. They also conducted a separate analysis of children and their siblings, allowing them to compare children with similar environmental and genetic backgrounds. Overall, the researchers found that antibiotic use before age two was positively linked to a higher risk of asthma, food allergy, and allergic rhinitis (hay fever). They also found a possible association between antibiotic use and intellectual disability in general. On the positive side, they failed to find any connection between antibiotics and most other conditions they looked for, including autism spectrum disorder, celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, or anxiety. This sort of research can’t prove that antibiotics are triggering asthma in some young children, it can only suggest a correlation. But the researchers did see a higher risk of asthma in children who took more antibiotics than others, which is evidence of a dose-response effect. The same pattern was also seen when the researchers only compared children to their siblings, further strengthening a causative link. Other studies have shown that antibiotics are frequently prescribed when they shouldn’t be, such as for infections likely not caused by bacteriaâa problem in children as well. A study in 2020, for instance, found that one of every four children given antibiotics in hospitals likelydidn’t needthem. So while further research might be warranted to confirm these links between antibiotics and certain chronic childhood conditions like asthma, the take-home message should remain the same: We need to rein in our use of these vital, but not risk-free, medications, perhaps even more so in kids. âAntibiotics are important and sometimes life-saving medicines, but not all infections in young kids need to be treated with antibiotics,â said lead author Daniel Horton, an associate professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School and Rutgers School of Public Health, in astatementfrom the university. âParents should continue to consult with their childrenâs doctors on the best course of care.â Allergiesantibioticsasthma Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

A groundbreaking antipsychotic, a powerful new antibiotic, and a vaccine-like prophylactic for HIV are some of the most important drugs to have arrived this year. The antibody drug benralizumab is on the fast track to becoming the first new treatment for certain kinds of asthma and COPD flare-ups seen in 50 years, following promising clinical trial data.

    "title": "Archaeologists Unearth Roman Horse Cemetery With 100 Skeletons",
    "article_text": "“The history of mankind is carried on the back of a horse” is a saying that holds true for the Roman Empire, which expanded through the strength of its army, including its cavalry.Â An archaeological discovery in Germany offers rare insight into the animals that helped carry an ancient civilization. In July 2024, a construction project in Stuttgart’s Bad Cannstatt borough unearthed approximately 100 horse skeletons. The subsequent excavation, supervised by the State Office for the Preservation of Historical Monuments, revealed that the animals dated to the second century CE and likely belonged to a Roman cavalry unit. One horse’s careful burial highlights the close relationship between some riders and their horses, suggesting that even 1,800 years ago, people mourned the loss of their animals as much as we do today. Bad Cannstatt was an important Roman military site during the first half of the second century AD. The local cavalry likely maintained over 700 animalsâanimals that needed food, shelter, and, when the time came, burials. Archaeologists first suggested the existence of a Roman horse cemetery in the 1920s, when a local housing project revealed horse skeletons in the region. The recent excavation, detailed in astatementfrom the regional government of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg on Wednesday, confirms this interpretation. âBased on the archaeological and historical knowledge of Roman Bad Cannstatt, the horses can be attributed to the cavalry unitâa so-called ‘Ala’âthat was stationed at Hallschlag from around 100 to 150 AD,” Sarah Roth, an archaeologist from the State Office for Monument Preservation, said in the statement. Hallschlag is a neighborhood in Bad Cannstatt. “The troop of almost 500 riders is likely to have had a total of at least 700 horses, with losses having to be replaced on a regular basis.â The dead horses were buried individually in shallow pits away from both the ancient cavalry fort and civilian settlement. Each location must have been visually marked, since the pits rarely overlap, Roth explained. âThe horses do not appear to have all died at the same time during a major event such as a battle or epidemic,” she continued. “Rather, the animals buried here are those that died during the Ala’s presence in Bad Cannstatt due to illness, injury, or other reasons, or were no longer fit for service as military horses. If the horse was still able to walk, it would have been taken to the horse cemetery and killed on site so that the heavy carcass did not have to be transported.â The process was in fact more of a “disposal” than a proper burial. In one notable exception, however, archaeologists unearthed a horse buried with two jugs and a small oil lamp, grave goods typically found in human graves. The inclusion of these objects indicates a close bond between the horse and its owner. “Even after around 1800 years, the grief over the death of this one animal is still evident,” Roth pointed out. In contrast, archaeologists also discovered the remains of an adult man among the horses, without any grave goodsâclearly someone Roman society deemed unworthy of a respectful burial. The entire horse cemetery is likely much larger than the remains uncovered by the recent excavation, which is now complete. Still, researchers hope further archaeozoological work will reveal the horses’ sexes, ages, sizes, potential diseases, and causes of deathâaltogether, more details into the Roman army’s use of horses. The finding also resonates wonderfully with the city’s historic connection to the majestic animal: Stuttgart is derived from the older “Stuotgarten,”meaning “a garden for the horses.” Ancient romeArchaeologyHorses Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Archaeological records indicate that prehistoric people in Europe relied on fire throughout the Ice Ageâbut the evidence drops off during its harshest period. The remains belonged to around 150 men between the ages of 20 and 30âall victims of a fierce battle. The artifacts reveal the harsh working conditions in ancient Egyptian gold mines under the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Thousands of years ago, Greco-Roman statues offered viewers a multi-dimensional experience that also called to our olfactory senses. Two archaeologists discovered the ceramic figurinesâpossibly used as puppetsâat the top of a pyramid, and three of them have adjustable heads.

    "article_text": "Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump’s Defense Secretary, is on the ropes. Over the weekend, the New York Timesreported thatHegseth had been involved in yet another texting scandal involving the encrypted chat app Signal. Then, on Monday, NPRreported thatthe administration was looking to replace Hegseth. However, not long after the public broadcaster’s story was published, the White House denied and denounced the report. NPR writes that an anonymous source, described only as a U.S. official, had said that the White House had “begun the process of looking for a new secretary of defense.” “This â¦@NPRâ© story is total FAKE NEWS based on one anonymous source who clearly has no idea what they are talking about,”tweetedWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. “As the President said this morning, he stands strongly behind â¦@SecDef.” The administration’s other account on X, Rapid Response 47,also tweetedabout the story: “WRONG. Fake News!” While the administration is sticking by Hegseth’s side (at least in public), there are other unfavorable signs for the embattled defense secretary. Republican lawmaker Don Bacon, of Nebraska, broke ranks on Monday and became the first GOP legislator to suggest that Hegseth might need to be fired,Politico reports. Bacon, who chairs a cyber subcommittee on the House Armed Services Committee, said that he had always thought Hegseth was a little green for the job: âI had concerns from the get-go because Pete Hegseth didnât have a lot of experience,â Bacon told the outlet. âI like him on Fox. But does he have the experience to lead one of the largest organizations in the world? Thatâs a concern.â âIf itâs true that he had another [Signal] chat with his family, about the missions against the Houthis, itâs totally unacceptable,â Bacon said. Hegseth’s reputation was severely damaged by a scandal last month in which heaccidentally texted war plansinvolving a bombing campaign in Yemen to the head editor of The Atlantic. Hegseth used the encrypted app Signal to share the operational details. On Sunday, the Times reported that Hegseth had been involved in yet another Signal text chain. This time, Hegseth had reportedly shared detailed Yemen war plans with his brother, wife, and personal lawyer. Gizmodo reached out to the White House for comment. Bacon went on: âIâm not going to tell the White House how to manage this â¦ but I find it unacceptable, and I wouldnât tolerate it if I was in charge.” He added that it âlooks like thereâs a meltdown going on” inside the government. âThereâs a lot â a lot â of smoke come out of the Pentagon, and I got to believe thereâs some fire there somewhere.â Donald TrumpPete HegsethSignal Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

The Secretary of Defense keeps getting caught using Signal, a remarkable feat. A little-known firm with investors linked to JD Vance, Elon Musk and Trump could get a piece of the federal expense card system.

    "title": "Elon Musk’s DOGE Seems to Be Losing Steam as He Prepares to Retreat to Tesla",
    "article_text": "The early days of Elon Musk’s time at the Department of Government Efficiency were defined by big, flashy actions, promises of massive cuts, and dubious legality. As his130-day cutoffas a limited government employee approaches, it seems he’ll be leaving with a thud. On top of significantly cutting the expected “savings” that his pseudo-agency will produce, other signature policies like the “5 things” email that went out at the start of DOGE’s operation have fallen entirely by the wayside,according to the Washington Post. Musk and his team of large toddlers at DOGE made waves back in February when they sent an email with the subject line âWhat did you do last week?â to every government employee, demanding they list five accomplishments that had been made over the previous week or face termination for failing to respond. That never came to fruition and,according to the Washington Post, was never even a real threat. Almost immediately, the Office of Personnel Management told agencies the initiative was voluntary and noncompliance would not result in resignation. The agency also never did anything with the emails it received. As tends to happen with feckless policies, people started ignoring the emails altogether. Per the Post, some agencies still require responses to the emails, which have apparently continued months later, but others have stopped mandating responses and don’t check which employees have replied or not. And, most notably, there does not appear to have been any consequences for the mix of responses (or non-responses). DOGE has become a microcosm of how most Musk-led operations tend to go. Not only did it take weeks for the agency to reveal who was allegedly at the helm, but thelack of any real leadershiphas resulted in chaos basically every step of the way. The department has run on the Silicon Valley standard of “move fast and break things,” and has definitely accomplished the latter, resulting in alitanyoflegalchallengesalong the way. Meanwhile, Musk’s big pledge of cutting $2 trillion in federal spending has been revised down to $1 trillion andnow $150 billionâall while the cuts that have been made havefailed to make any actual dentin the deficit. A classic Muskian “over promise and under deliver” move. Musk’s exit might serve his interests, at least as it relates to his association with the federal government.Per the Washington Post, people close to him say he’s sick of getting attacked for his role at DOGE. Plus, he clearly would like todistance himself from the Trump tariff regimeandhas been attacking some of the peoplebehind the policy. So the timing of his departure seems right. Assuming Musk actually does ditch DOGE (this administration has not been big on following federal laws, after all), he’ll be leaving his new mess for an old one. Tesla is staring down a potential crisis, in no small part because of how badly Musk’s behavior has damaged the brand. The company’s stock is already showing some negative markers heading into an earnings call on Tuesday, andBloomberg reportsthat even the bulls are starting to sound the alarm. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives called for Musk to leave DOGE and return to Tesla, which he believes is facing a âcode redâ moment as Tesla sales slump and production of cheaper models hashit snags. Currently, Tesla’s biggest promises are a network of robotaxis and a humanoid robot, both of which aredubiousatbest. Tuesday will show just how much stomach investors have for Musk’s bad press and how much faith they’re willing to place in the CEO’s standard practice of making a big promise years in the future to keep the shell game going.

Both follow-up films complete a phrase: the magician heist series is taking the logical next step withNow You See Me, Now You Don’tâand theSamara Weaving-starring horror comedy went right to…Ready or Not: Here I Come.

    "title": "NASA Confirms 70-Year-Old Astronaut Don Pettit Is Doing Well Despite Looking Frail After Landing",
    "article_text": "NASA’s oldest serving astronaut returned to Earth on Saturday following a 7-month mission on board the International Space Station (ISS). Don Pettit marked his 70th birthday with a special homecoming, although his post-touchdown appearance raised concerns that the astronaut wasn’t doing so well after landing in Kazakhstan. Pettit, along with Roscosmos cosmonauts Alexey Ovchinin and Ivan Vagner, departed the ISS on Saturday at 5:57 p.m. ET on board a Soyuz spacecraft before making a parachute-assisted landing at 9:20 p.m. ET, according toNASA. After touching down in the southeast of Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, Pettit was carried off to a medical tent for routine post-landing medical checks. For those who tuned in to NASA’s live feed of the crew touchdown, there was some speculation that Pettit looked especially frail after his stint in space, but the space agency quickly dismissed claims of health concerns. “According to NASA officials at the landing site, @Astro_Pettit is doing well and in the range of what is expected for him following return to Earth,” NASAwroteon X. The space agency quoted the astronaut from a pre-departureinterviewhe had done from the ISS on April 16, in which he spoke of his post-landing experience, “This is a physiological thing. It affects different people in different ways. Some people can go out and eat pizza and dance. When I land, it takes me about 24 hours to feel like I’m a human being again.” Happy birthday,@astro_Pettit! Many happy returns (including this one) ð¥³ The MS-26 Soyuz spacecraft touched down in Kazakhstan at 9:20pm ETâor, in local time, 6:20am April 20, Pettit's 70th birthday.pic.twitter.com/qFM5fAxnA0 — NASA (@NASA)April 20, 2025 The astronaut also jokingly revealed that, once he gets to Earth, he will probably “empty the contents of my stomach out the way it wasn’t meant to go.” NASA Astronaut Captures Stunning Photo of Galactic Pair From ISS Pettit, Ovchinin, and Vagner launched to the space station on September 11, 2024, and spent the past 220 days carrying out research and conducting science experiments in the microgravity environment. When he wasn’t busy growing plants or exploring the behavior of fire in space, Pettit shared some incredible views from the space station that have captivated his followers online. Mother Earth, I am coming home.pic.twitter.com/lxxAQICzMJ — Don Pettit (@astro_Pettit)April 19, 2025 This was Pettit’s fourth time in space, with the veteran astronaut logging a total of 590 days in orbit so far. Pettit launched on board the Space ShuttleEndeavouron November 23, 2002 for his first mission on board the ISS. That mission was originally slated to last for two and a half months, but Pettit ended up spending nearly six months on the space station after theColumbiaSpace Shuttle disaster that tragically killed all seven astronauts and grounded the Space Shuttle fleet. Pettit has had a long history in spaceflight, but he is still not the oldest person to travel to space. That record belongs to John Glenn, who launched on the Space ShuttleDiscoveryin 1998 at the age of 77. Astronaut Peggy Whitson became the oldest woman to orbit Earth in 2023 when sheserved as a commander of a private 10-day mission to the ISS, Axiom Mission-2, at 63 years old. Compared to Pettit’s long-duration flight, however, Glenn spent less than a fraction of the time in orbit, completing a nine-day mission as a payload specialist. The mission carried out research on aging and the effects of spaceflight, an area that is still being studied to this today. Although scientists are still trying to understand how space affects the human body, previousresearchhas suggested that spaceflight can accelerate the symptoms of aging by inducing genomic instability. Pettit may not hold the record for the oldest person to go to space, but he is the oldest to complete a long-duration mission in the harsh environment. The astronaut’s continued dedication to spaceflight and his curiosity for the cosmos are truly admirable. astronaut healthinternational space stationNASA Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Bluesky Launches User Verification After Initial Skepticism of Checkmarks",
    "article_text": "Bluesky has long resisted creating a checkmark verification system to combat impersonation and fraud. But that all changed Monday when the social media company officially announced it was rolling out verification for high-profile organizations and celebrities. “Trust is everything. Social media has connected us in powerful ways, but it hasnât always given us the tools to know who weâre interacting with or why we should trust them,” the company said in a newblog post. The company went on to explain how Bluesky launched a new feature in 2023 that allowed anyone with a website to make that URL their username on the social media platform, a form of verification that allowed for a decentralized approach to proving who you were. Only Elizabeth Warren has the access necessary to make her website,http://www.warren.senate.gov, appear as her username on Bluesky,@warren.senate.gov. In theory, it’s a great idea. But in practice, there was still some confusion among average users who have been conditioned by sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to expect a blue checkmark when a user has been “verified” as authentic. And starting Monday, that’s the system Bluesky is introducing as well. “Bluesky will proactively verify authentic and notable accounts and display a blue check next to their names. Additionally, through our Trusted Verifiers feature, select independent organizations can verify accounts directly. Bluesky will review these verifications as well to ensure authenticity,” the company wrote. Bluesky will allow a given organization to get verified by the company, and then that entity can verify employees or others associated with it. And tapping on a user’s verification will show where that person obtained their verification. When you tap on a verified account’s check, youâll see which organizations have granted verification. [image or embed] â Bluesky (@bsky.app)April 21, 2025 at 9:02 AM But not everyone is happy with the new verification rollout. Journalist Timothy Burke prefers the domain method of verification, arguing on Bluesky that centralization of verification will incentivize companies not to use the domain method,writing, “as long as anything is centralized it is subject to one day experiencing exactly what Twitter experienced.” Placing the control over verification into the hands of the company is a bad idea because the domain method is “one thing the platform does *not* have a say over.” this is exactly the problem, as long as anything is centralized it is subject to one day experiencing exactly what Twitter experienced and why using domains to verify anybody is who they say they are is so important bc it’s one thing the platform does *not* have a say over [image or embed] â Timothy Burke (@bubbaprog.lol)April 21, 2025 at 9:16 AM The flip side to that is the fact that many people don’t own their own web domains. And even if they do, it still requires the average user to investigate whether the domain itself is reputable and connected to the person. For example, anyone could theoretically buy up elizabethwarrensenator.com, which is currently available, create an account with Sen. Warren’s face and pretend to be her. It would likely get shut down on Bluesky for impersonation eventually, but those are the problems that present themselves in decentralized verification scenarios. Bluesky, which has over35 million users, sees a surge of new interest every time X owner Elon Musk does something to break his own site, which seems to be more and more frequent these days. And Musk arguably ruined verification when he stripped so-called legacy accounts of their checkmarks and started selling them for $8 per month. Now, anyone can get verified on X, which also buys you a boost in the algorithm. That may help explain why the social media platform has become such a hotbed of holocaust denial, snuff videos, racism, and far-right extremism. It’s tough to open the app these days without seeing some of the most disgustingly vile content that used to be relegated to neo-Nazi forums and edgelord 4Chan boards. Musk’s support of fascism has seen the site dwindle in popularity with normal people, but it’s still a place where plenty of people post thanks to inertia alone. It’s not clear yet whether any average user will be allowed to get verified on Bluesky, but Paul Frazee, a software engineer at the company, wrote Monday that the new system combines what they see as the best of both worlds. “Trusted Verifiers are in keeping with our ethosâthat Bluesky shouldn’t be the sole verifier, and that there should be systems that exist outside of us as part of a robust civic infrastructure,” Frazeewrote. “The world shouldn’t depend on massive social companies as the sole authorities.” It’s also not clear how quickly the new verification system will be rolled out. As of this writing, Bluesky employees and large media organizations like the New York Times don’t appear to be verified. But that could change at any moment. Bluesky didn’t immediately respond to questions on Monday. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back.

    "title": "Thailand Rings in New Year With Drone and CCTV-Powered Robot Cop",
    "article_text": "On April 16th, Thailand’s Royal Thai Police introduced their newest colleague, “AI Police Cyborg 1.0,” in aFacebook poststating that the robot was deployed on Tonson Road in Muang District. One photograph shows the robot dressed in a police uniform while it stands on a wheeled metal platform lined by other uniformed officials. Jointly developed by the Provincial Police Command 7, Nakhon Pathom Provincial Police, and Nakhon Nakhon Pathon Municipality, the robot has a number of chilling capabilitiesincludingaccess to nearby CCTV cameras, drones, and its own 360-degree AI cameras equipped with facial recognition, behavioral analysts, weapon detection, and blacklist alerts. Officials say its video analytics are advanced enough to differentiate water guns from real weapons and identify violent behavior.Â According to the RTP’s Facebook post, the AI Police Cyborg 1.0 is linked with the province’s Command and Control center “for efficient event safety management.” Ostensibly, enhancing public safety is the robot’s main purpose, hence its name: Police Colonel Nakhonpathom Plod Phai, or “Nakhon Pathom is safe”. A spokespersontold ABP Live,Â âThe AI Police Cyborg 1.0 helps us enhance public safety, especially during large events where traditional policing resources can be stretched thin. Itâs a force multiplier that never tires and maintains constant vigilance.â On the surface, that might sound nice. But buying into the idea that a police robot with a slew of surveillance capabilities is just meant for event management is unlikely, especially when considering the Thai police’srecord of brutality against activists. (Coincidentally, on April 16, Bloombergreportedthat Thai security services were doxxing pro-democracy activists on Facebook and X.) Technology like AI Police Cyborg 1.0 has the potential for severe social and political repercussions. However, you may not have to freak out yet. Police robots have a long way to go before they can surpass the threat of more developed technologies like cell surveillance. Instead, they are disasters for a much less ominous reason: Being mid. For example,New York City abandoned its subway robotin an empty storefront after an underwhelming pilot, and a police robot in California oncetold a woman to go awaywhen she tried using it for help. Although the Thai police eagerly marketed their robot’s extensive AI capabilities, Futurism alsonotedthat nobody has actually seen the thing move. Many robots stillstruggle to navigate obstacleslike sidewalks or toddlers so it’s not far-fetched to suggest that the Thai robot either cannot move independently or it sucks at doing so. Given that and police robots’ global track records, Thailand’s robot is unlikely to live up to its full, dystopian potential for now.

    "title": "In Sinners, Honesty Leads to Freedom",
    "article_text": "SinnersÂis the type of movie where nearly every scene could be considered a standout moment on a technical, writing, or performance level. For me, there’s two momentsâone utterly sincere and raunchy, the other delightfully metaâthat speak to one of the film’s core themes. In the first, burgeoning blues guitarist Sammie (Miles Caton) is getting intimate with singer Pealine (Jayme Lawson) and proceeds to get on his knees. He’s about to employ the advice his older cousin Stack (Michael B. Jordan) gave to him about pleasuring a woman earlier in the film, and just as Pearline’s about to politely decline, Sammie looks up at her and says: “You’re beautiful, and I want to taste it.” He’s clearly taken with her, and says this with the earnestness of someone who believes in what he’s saying. As for the second, it comes after Stack’s been turned into a vampire and flees the juke joint after being hit with pickled joint juice by Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), Smoke’s (also Jordan) estranged wife. “This ain’t a haint. It’s a vampire,” she says, her statement punctuated by a 4-note sting of guitar, drums, and vocals. Both moments reflectÂSinners‘ refusal to be mysterious. When Annie outright calls Stack a vampire and lists off their weaknesses, it’s refreshing that her declaration isn’t met with any real skepticism or mockery. Think about how many horror movies featuring a vampire, zombie, or werewolf seem actively afraid of ever saying the common terms aloud, as if uttering them can take away their potency. But in the real world, we the audience have always known this is where things were headed. Once she says the word and the music kicks in, director-writer Ryan Coogler basically says “Yeah, we know why you’re here, now get ready.” He isn’t introducing any new spin on the material, but being up front about that and just changing the perspective on who vampire stories get to be about is new in and of itself. Across his filmography, Coogler has proven to be great at scenes where a character lets their guard down and speaks from the heart, often in scenes relating to grief. InCreed,Âit’s when Adonis tells Rocky he has to keep fighting toprove his worthto himself and everyone watching. The originalBlack Pantherhas the hug between T’Challa and his late father in the Ancestral Plane, later followed by one between Killmonger and his own father.ÂWakanda ForeverÂprovides this throughRamondalamenting to her people about what she thought was the death of her entire family by that pointâthen again at thevery endwhen Shuri sits at the beach and lets herself finally mourn her brother. These moments of vulnerability are spread all overÂSinners,Âas most of the characters are grieving for losses recent and old. Both Smoke and Stack drop their walls when allowed to be with their respective love interests; Stack gets bitten and turned by his old flame Mary (Hailee Steinfeld) because he’d previously opened up to her about wishing for the life they could’ve had. The film’s handful of sex scenes come when the characters are at their most vulnerable and honest, trying to hold onto a moment they may never get againâthey’re running away from incoming danger (of their own making or just by being Black in the 1930s), or have another life to return to, so why not indulge in some debauchery for tonight? Even Remmick, the film’s chief vampire, is surprisingly open throughout the film. When he stumbles upon the abode of Bert and Joan, he pleads for their help, claiming to be on the run from Choctaw that’ll soon be on his trail. Turns out, this wasn’t a ploy to escape the sun, and he’smostlytruthful throughout the rest of the film. Yes, he wants to put the juke joint patrons under his thrall as he did the two Klansmen, but he’s not lying when he talks about being entranced by Sammie’s music, and he told the humans about the local Klan planning to attack in the morning when he could’ve kept that to himself. His entire deal is honesty through invitation: he, Bert, and Joan lure Mary and turn her through their Irish music and pulling on the recent loss of her mother. To the survivors, he offers safety from aging and racism if he can use Sammie’s musical gifts to summon the spirits of the family he still mourns. The other vampires are connected to him mentally, allowing for an wide net of intimacy that also sets up one of the film’s best dirty jokes. SinnersÂposits that grief and honesty can be two sides of the same coin. Before making a last stand against the Klansmen, Smoke lets himself remember the friends who died over the course of the night, then gets rid of Annie’s charm protecting him from danger so when he gets shot, he’ll join his late wife and daughter in the afterlife. Sammie’s decision to leave Clarksdale and become a musician is him standing by his convictions and mourning Pearline, Annie, and everyone else who effectively died for him. After wowing them all with his musicâa showstopper scene that lets him be his most real self and showcase his talents to an appreciative audienceârenouncing music would erase the history of what happened that night. InSinners‘ post-credits scene, we see a younger Sammie happily playing his guitar and singing “This Little Light of Mine,” allowing himself a moment of musical honesty in his father’s church, where he’s been previously begged to seek salvation. And its mid-credits scene sees an older Sammie in 1992 reuniting with Stack and Mary, who’ve remained vampires since the night in Clarksdale. After Sammie opens up about still being haunted by that night and loving it regardless, Stack shares a similar sentiment, calling it the last time he truly felt free. We’ve all heard the phrase “the truth will set you free” at some point in our lives, and it’s oneSinnersÂand Coogler take to heart. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Star Wars: Zero Company‘s Developers Want You to Shape Its Story as Much as They Do",
    "article_text": "AtÂStar WarsCelebrationthis weekend Bit Reactor and Respawn teamed up to finally lift the lid on something gamers in the galaxy far, far away have waited a long time to see:a turn-based tactics game. That long-awaited wish has come in the form ofZero Company, a game that wants to honorÂStar Wars‘ past in the strategy genre, while also standing toe-to-toe with the kinds of cinematic experiences modern gamers have come to expect from a similarly cinematic franchise. “I think that now is the time that we can actually do it and not cost depth and elegance, right? Like, we can do both, technically we’re able to do both,” Bit Reactor co-founder Greg Foertsch told io9 shortly after the panel revealingZero Companyto the world. “I think the genre is ready for it.Star Warsis ready for it. I think fans hopefully know they’re ready for it. Maybe they don’t! But I think we’re going to be able to make a game that transcends the genre and does justice to the IP.” Zero Companyhas been a vaguely known quantity for a few yearsâsimply asatactics game that’s been in development since 2021âbut it was only at Celebration that fans learned that the game would be set during the height of the Clone Wars. It’s a setting that doesn’t exactly spring to mind for tactical skirmish combat, given what we’ve mostly experienced with the conflict has been on a grand and broad scale of planetary forces smashing into each other across the stars. “I think one of the nice things about the Clone Wars is we have the television show as like, such an amazing reference point right across seven seasons of storytelling,” Lucasfilm story group member Kelsey Sharpe said of the decision to focus on the late prequel era. “For every Battle of Felucia, or an Umbaran arc, where it’s army, army, crashing against each other, there’s also Rako Hardeen. There’s also PadmÃ© and Jar Jar going off and figuring out the Blue Shadow virus. It’s part of the timeline where George [Lucas] and Dave Filoni really showed that you can tell any kind of story. That’s part of the fun ofZero Companytoo, right? Each player is going to customize their own Hawks, and then tell their ownÂClone Warsstory. That’s the promise of the game. ” “I rewatchedÂClone Warsas this was getting going with my oldest daughter,” Foertsch added. “We sat there, and I feel likeÂClone Wars… there is all this stuff happening, but I feel like those interpersonal relationships and those smaller zoom moments, it’s just there all the way through. You’ve got all these bigger moments happening all around you, but then you’ve got the whole [D-Squad] sequence. There’s episodes where it’s all just action, and then it’s down to all the little stories that kind of percolate through it, it’s just amazing.” But the Clone Wars as a setting doesn’t mean that necessarily thatÂZero Companywill be wanting to tell a story in the style of what’s come before in that era. “We talk about the Clone Wars as an era, and that’s absolutely there, and we’re being authentic to it. But we also talk about the political background, and close zoom ofAndor[as an influence],” Lucasfilm Games executive producer Orion Kellogg noted. “We talk about the original trilogy, and its pulpiness there. I think, at the end of the day, this will be aÂZero Companystory. That’s what we set out to doâit’s like, hey, what story does our developer want to tell, and how do we help them tell it?” That story is one that leans heavily on perhaps a crucial line inÂRevenge of the Sith‘s opening crawl: there are heroes on both sides, and evil everywhere.ÂZero Companyplays in the shadows, a fight by players (through Hawks) that draws characters from across the galaxy and also across traditionally divisive faction lines to combine a threat that has dire consequences for the whole galaxy, regardless of faction. “The political alignments, the personal relationships, all that sort of stuff kind of bubbles in there,” Kellogg continued. “There’s definitely things to touch on with our characters and their relationships with each other, and their relationships with the playerâthere’s a big connection there for us. We want to tell you a story where, you’re learning what is happening in the story the same time the rest of the characters are. It’s one reason we’re letting you create your own Hawks and step in, you don’t need to do homework in order to play this game: you step in, you learn what the threat is, and you figure out how to use the tools at your disposal to meet the challenge and find out what sort of leader you’re going to be.” For Sharpe, from a narrative standpoint, the Clone Wars’ broad scale also invited the kind of questions fans have considered for years. “That’s part of the fun, the differing perspectives, right? We certainly discussed that, yeah, from a Separatist perspective, theyÂwerea little right,” she said. “‘Oops, that Chancellor, you guys should’ve kept a closer eye on him!’. I think that’s where [Zero Company‘s] bond system comes in, because if you have this idea in your head of like… ‘Well, an Umbaran and a Clone trooper would never get along,’, you might never deploy them together and they mightÂneverget along. Or you can be like ‘let the healing begin,’ you can purposely deploy them on missions to see how that affects the outcome of your gameplay, and that’s part of the fun.” This focus on player choice is interwoven throughoutÂZero Company, starting with the player character, Hawks. They have an established name and backgroundâan ex-Republic Intelligence officer who now operates as a mercenary special operativeâbut beyond that, players will decide their gender identity, their species and appearance, and then how they go about navigating the threat facing them, from who they recruit into Zero Company to who hangs out with who on and off the battlefield. “I think the trick with Hawks is really wanting make sure there’s enough information for people to understand and to give them a grounding space, but then also not to go so much into that that they can’t implement or can’t project into the character they want, and see that perspective,” Foertsch said. “It’s a balancing act with that character specifically, to walk a line where you don’t give so much that people feel pushed out of it, but you leave enough that there’s enough intrigue to dive into it.” This balancing act between a grand, cinematic narrative experience andÂZero Company‘s willingness to let the player forge their own unique path through that creates an interesting challenge for the game. On the one hand, it’s clear that Bit Reactor wants to tell a compelling, morally complexStar Warsstory, one filled with intriguing characters they have created (we met a few in the trailer, like the aforementioned Umbaran sniper Luco Bronc and the Clone trooper Trick). But on the other,ÂZero Companyalso wants to give players a robust suite of options to completely customize their experience: it’s not just Hawks that can be unique to each player, they can field an entire team of player-made operatives, avoiding the main characters entirely. They could even, as teased at the panel, field an entire squad of Astromech droidsânot exactly prime candidates for the all-star cast of a cinematicStar Warsstory (sorry, R2, BB-8, Chopper, et al). “It’s trying to balance the player agency with the amount of narrative we use,” Foertsch said, “and allowing people to… if that’s what they want to play like, if they want to go all custom heroes, you can do it. You can absolutely do it.” “I think in order to make it aÂStar Warsstory, there should be characters and perspectives already there to bounce off of,” Kellogg added. “AllÂStar Warsstories are these kinds of clashes of ideas. So we give you those authored characters to give you some of those ideas to clash off of, and then where go from there is kind of up to you.” “ThereÂisflexibility,” Sharpe added. “You can build the bonds between your custom characters, or between an authored character and a custom character.” “We’re not ready to put any bounds on what’s possible right now, but we still have a long way to go,” Kellogg said when asked of what feasible limitsÂZero Companymight put on a player beyond a permadeath-on, all-Droid run of the game. “We definitely wanted people to know [with the announcement] that they’re going to be able to tell their own story, play different playthroughs with different outcomes. That much we know, and what the outer boundaries are, we’ll figure out.” Ultimately, it’s all choice in service towards what Bit Reactor and Lucasfilm Games see as the defining core of whatZero Companyis doing: bringing a cinematic narrative experience, and distinctly aStar Warsone at that, to a genre that hasn’t seen that before. “The mechanics are up there, but the genre hasn’t seenStar Wars,” Foertsch concluded. “I think pulling in that, the blend ofÂStar Wars, what this world brings to tactical games is so unique. It’s so deep to pull from, that I think our story, along with how we present it, the cinematic feel of it all, are going to be the things that make it feel special.” Star Wars: Zero Companyhits PC, Xbox Series X and S, and Playstation 5 in 2026.

    "title": "Marvel Rivals' hero gallery UI used to look a lot cooler—but also a lot harder to use",
    "article_text": "The superhero shooter's striking art direction took some iteration to get right. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm a comic book nut, but I stay away from Marvel Rivals to keep my blood pressure in check. I do love the radical, supremely over-the-top character designs that NetEase landed on for Marvel's coterie of costumed heroes, though. You might be surprised to learn that the game used to be even more stylized—so much so that finding a hero before a match was borderline obnoxious. In the debut for a new web series about the game's visual identity,Art Vision, a former take on the hero gallery UI was briefly shown off, with some exceptional concept art and a radial menu that displayed each hero in a wheel. Take a look below: It's got some exceptional 2D art, but the design definitely reads like a placeholder. The Hulk hero description has the energy of a Wikipedia entry, dryly clarifying that he's a \"fictional superhero.\" Spinning this menu back and forth in search of any particular character seem like it'd be cumbersome, to say the least. Sure looks slick, though. Art director Dino explained in the video that the game's UI aesthetics are meant to be \"modern and adaptable while also being simple and clear … incorporating comic, structural, and geometric sensibilities.\" They might have gone a mite too far with this particular design, as the final game has a more traditional grid for its hero gallery. But the radial \"arc\" did make it to the pre-battle hero select menu. Dino goes on to say that the hero select interface \"presents an artistic immersive experience\" which I suppose is true, though it's kind of a pain in the ass to drag it to and fro so I can find and lock in a healer as quickly as possible. There's a reason we don't use rotary phones anymore, right? The concept shown off is even more dynamic and eye-catching, but a great example of how something boring and functional is usually preferable to a beautiful hassle. It's nice to get a look at the iteration process for such a popular game; the journalist in me lives to hear game developers pontificate about this and that, even if this video doesn't show off a ton that players haven't seen before. Marvel Rivals has come a long way since it wasnearly cancelled, so hopefully we'll hear more about the road getting there in the future.

    "title": "A week after a major hack brought down 4chan and doxxed all its users, it seems like it may be dead for good",
    "article_text": "Could this really be the end of one of the internet's most notorious websites? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Nearly a week after a major hack forced it offline, the notorious imageboard 4chan remains inaccessible, and there's a growing feeling that it's going to stay that way—and that maybe it's not so bad. Founded in 2003, 4chan is—or was—something of a waypoint for a particular part of online subculture: Basic, unrefined, unmoderated, and almost entirely anonymous, which is what made it so notorious.Vicecalled it \"the internet’s favorite hotspot of moral bankruptcy\" in its report on the hack, and that seems about right: There are certainly worse places to go in the digital world, but none that are so singularly famous for it. Even if you never used 4chan you've almost certainly heard of it, and its impact in recent years has seeped out into the real world. A 2018 Southern Poverty Law Center report cited \"participation in the rampantly racist and misogynistic online trolling culture of 4chan and its offshoots\" as a notable influence in the rise of the alt-right. Its reputation was ugly enough that in 2021 Minecraftscrubbed a decade-old reference to 4chan's /v/ board, where creator Markus \"Notch\" Persson had heavily promoted the game in its early days. What ultimately brought 4chan down wasn't controversy or opprobrium from the right-thinking denizens of the online realm, though, but rather a beef with another imageboard, Soyjack.party. A message on that board celebrating the attack said the alleged hacker had been in 4chan's systems for over a year before launching the hack. Specifics are unclear, as you'd expect from this particular type of old-time internet gong show, but the attack itself was devastating. While 4chan was built around anonymity, users could register accounts to take advantage of certain features; many did, and they were reportedly all doxxed: ATechCrunchreport posted shortly after the attack said the hacker posted screenshots purportedly showing 4chan's \"back end, source code, and templates to ban users,\" along with a list of 4chan moderators and \"janitors,\" users who can delete posts and threads but don't have full moderator access. One janitor told TechCrunch they believed the posted information was all real, and that the hack was \"obviously an issue of greater magnitude\" than previous leaks. Despite that, the janitor seemed unexpectedly sanguine about the whole thing, adding that \"doxxing is a longstanding pastime on 4chan, and the possibility that we could be exposed has always been there.\" Others may not share that sentiment, though, given the potential to tie users—including some who'd registered with .gov and .edu domains—to alt-right, sometimes violent, political content and movements. The extent of the hack has led some to believe that 4chan may never be restored. ABoingBoingreport said that \"with every single user of note doxxed, the site's servers decimated, and the admin team in disarray, it's unlikely 4chan will be back up soon. Or ever.\" With each passing day, that looks more and more likely. It's been six days since the hack, and 4chan remains offline. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. It's possible that 4chan will come back eventually: The problem isn't restoring the site, but plugging the security holes, which by all reports are numerous and gaping. One 4chan moderator has said on social media that work on restoring the site is underway, but quite a number of users in the 4chan IRC channel seem to have accepted that this really is very likely the end.

    "title": "I'm convinced Bungie won't say how much Marathon will cost because it doesn't know how much to charge yet",
    "article_text": "They're kicking the can down the road, pending feedback. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We know a lot more about Bungie's Marathon reboot now than we did a week ago. We learned that it's a hero-based extraction shooter with abilities, economy, and a handful of maps in the vein of Escape From Tarkov. We know it's got weapon mods that should tickle the brains of Destiny buildcrafters, and Bungie also shared details on proximity chat, solo play, and cosmetics (it'll have them). Weirdly, one important topic the studio was cagey about is how much it'll cost. Pricing was not part of Bungie's big Marathon reveal stream, nor has it been mentioned in official blog posts. It took press interviews to reel an answer out of Bungie, but its vague responses are already causing confusion. In a reply on X correcting a comment from a Bungie dev, theofficial Marathon accountsaid it will be a \"premium\" title, but it will \"not be a ‘full-priced’ title.\" Not especially helpful. If you're a normal person who doesn't speak marketing, \"premium title\" just means it'll cost money. Presumably by \"full-priced title,\" it means Marathon won't cost $70 (or does that mean$80 now?), but I'm not breathing a sigh of relief yet. Will Marathon be $60? $50? $40? $30? I suspect the reactions to each would be very different. Here's why I think Bungie hasn't revealed Marathon's price: it doesn't know yet. Like so many details of Marathon's design—including solo play, social spaces, and even the studio's position on proximity chat—price is all part of an ongoing \"conversation,\" a word that came up around a hundred times in a recentDrLupo interviewwith assistant game director Del Chafe. \"I can't go into details, but what I'll say is: We're not ready to talk about it right now, but you've been out to the studio. You'll be out to the studio again. We'll have conversations about this, we'll be able to share,\" Chafe said. \"You and a bunch of other people are going to have really good feedback about it, so it's definitely going to be a conversation.\" Game director Joe Ziegler seemed similarly undecided in an interview with theFriends Per Second podcast. \"Obviously everyone's got their own definition of what's the right price. As we deliver that information, we're hoping we hit the right price that makes you feel it's worth your value.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Maybe I'm reading too much into a standard \"more on this later\" comment, but that's not how I'd be talking about my pricing strategy if I had it all figured out. What we're seeing is the gamedev equivalent of a Price Is Right contestant waving their hand over each price tag and picking the one that gets the loudest reaction. Not to suggest that's the wrong move here: Bungie and Sony are right to be nervous about price. Selling a multiplayer shooter for anything more than free already runs the risk of getting on folks' bad side before Marathon is even out. It's a tricky needle to thread—sometimes subtracting $5 or $10 on a price tag is the difference between your game being widely perceived as a great value or hard to recommend until a sale comes along. Obviously, Sony has big expectations for Marathon's financials, but in this extraction shooter player's opinion, this is a moment where it's better to be a humble Helldivers 2 ($40) than a presumptuous Call of Duty ($70).

    "title": "Overwatch 2 Stadium details: Everything you need to know about the new mode",
    "article_text": "Stadium introduces third-person perspective, a separate ranked mode, and dozens of weapon and skill modifiers for its heroes. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Overwatch 2Stadium is one of the biggest shakeups for the game since the sequel launched in 2023.Hero perksin standard Quickplay and Competitive let you tweak hero abilities through a handful of upgrade choices. Stadium, a new mode separate from standard play, lets you completely change how abilities function and even adds new effects for weapons and equipable items to give your team a boost. How many of these improvements you get depends on how well you perform in each round, though Blizzard included catch-up mechanisms to help struggling teams. Overwatch 2 Stadium goes live on April 28, 2025 with the start of Season 16 and the introduction of new damage hero Freja. Stadium is a permanent addition, and Blizzard plans to update it with more heroes and maps. Blizzard hasn't said what the cadence of Stadium updates will be like—if, for example, each new season will introduce balance changes or fresh additions to Stadium along with the standard rollout of heroes and Quickplay maps. Stadium is a new mode where two teams compete to win the best of seven rounds. Stadium matches are 5v5, with two supports, two damage heroes, and one tank, and it's role queue only—no hero dupes allowed. What separates Stadium from normal matches is that you can modify your hero by purchasing items, weapons with different effects, and entirely new abilities through a MOBA-like shop between rounds. Soldier 76, for example, can make his Biotic Healing Field move with him and damage enemies, while Kiriko can clone herself, and D.Va channels her inner Torbjorn to spew lava with her rocket boosters. Upgrades cost Stadium Cash, which you can earn during rounds in several ways, and while Blizzard will include a few recommended builds for each hero as a guide, you're free to mix and match whatever improvements you think might work best or provetotally broken. Blizzard chosethird-person mode as Stadium's default perspective, a first for the game. The team said that, with the new arena layouts and skill effects, seeing what's happening around your hero is more important than in normal Overwatch 2 play. However, if you prefer first-person mode, you can change back at any time. Overwatch 2's Stadium mode will include 18 heroes when it goes live—five tanks, six supports, and seven damage heroes. More will arrive in future seasons, though Blizzard gave no indication about how often they plan to add them. DPS Support Tanks Genji Ana Zarya Reaper Moira Reinhardt Soldier 76 Mercy Orisa Cassidy Lucio Junker Queen Ashe Juno D.Va Mei Kiriko Freja Stadium has its own ranked mode separate from thebase game's competitive scene, so your rank in one won't affect the other. Stadium ranked includes seven skill brackets: Reaching the Elite rank in all three roles each season will earn you Epic-grade skins exclusive to Stadium's ranked mode, along with points used to unlock weapon skins. The Epic skin for Stadium's first competitive season is for Juno, but you have to reach All-Star rank with any role to get it. Stadium includes three modes from the base game and nine maps total, with more maps planned for future updates. Some of Stadium's maps are new or reworked areas from existing locations, such as Busan or Watchpoint: Gibraltar, while a few others are completely new to Overwatch 2. Control maps Push maps Clash maps Stadium Cash lets you buy upgrades and items for your hero between rounds, and you earn it based on performance in battle. Dealing, healing, and blocking damage will earn you Stadium Cash. The better you do, the more stuff you can buy between rounds, so you can do even better in the next fight and buy even more stuff afterward. If it sounds like all this makes room for a rather glaring balance issue between teams, Blizzard thinks so, too. All players start with 3,500 Stadium Cash, which Blizzard says is enough to purchase three items or upgrades, and everyone gets an upgrade for free before the first, third, and fifth round to help keep both sides on as even a field as possible. If you find yourself perpetually short on cash, you can target specific, high-performing players on the opposing team to earn a bounty reward. Every player starts with a bounty of 300 Stadium Cash, and that amount increases with each elimination they earn for a maximum possible bounty of 2,000. The game marks a player with an orange star icon once their bounty hits 750 or higher, making it easier to track them down, and the bounty amount resets to 300 after a character is eliminated. Those who are eliminated with the default bounty amount of 300 will have their bounty drop by 100, making it (theoretically) less of an incentive to harass struggling players. Stadium Cash has another use as well—health buffs. Blizzard said that for every 500 Stadium Cash a player earns during a match, their hero gains one extra health point for a total of 300 additional max health. Tanks gain speed and strength buffs for every 250 Stadium Cash earned, though Blizzard hasn't shared exact numbers for them. Stadium counts the cash that you spend on upgrades as part of your total, so you won't see these improvements disappear if you splash out in the item shop. During Stadium's testing phase, Blizzard experimented with a mercy rule that ends a match after one team wins the first three rounds. The idea is that the winning team isn't likely to suddenly lose the fourth round, and ending the match early lets everyone try again more quickly. That rule remains in place for Stadium's launch, but Blizzard added another qualification tied to Stadium Cash. The mercy rule activates if one team wins the first three roundsandhave a combined total of 15,000 Stadium Cash more than the losing team. Stadium awards cash based on performance in matches,so the new mercy rule is designed to kick in only if itreallyseems like the losing team has a low chance of mounting a comeback. Blizzard said the team is open to revising the mercy rule in future Stadium updates. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

And if there isn't enough challenge, then it just feels like you're getting candy for free, and you don't really feel that satisfaction of overcoming a boss.\" The PTR has yielded a lot of feedback about the game's current difficulty level that Finer said the team is aware of, but noted that nothing on the test server is final and that the live version of Season 8 should feel \"a little bit more difficult than Season 7.\" \"We definitely have a sort of double or half it approach when it comes to balancing these things, especially on the PTR. So we doubled a lot of the numbers … since then, we've heard a ton of feedback, we've played it ourselves, we've gotten a lot of data, and we're actually dialing back quite a bit, and we think we found a pretty happy middle ground.\" Finer said the team has been careful not to ante up the difficulty too quickly to avoid making the game \"a slog\" that's \"just slowing the players down,\" adding that \"we think that that little tick of difficulty is really going to help the overall game feel much more rewarding.\" While there were a bunch of bosses getting one-shot in the PTR, Finer said they've addressed a \"a lot of one-shots\" for the live version of the patch. I don't doubt that it's difficult to tune a game with as many builds and legendary items as Diablo 4 has, and it'll probably remain a moving target long after Season 8 comes out. Here's hoping the team's ambitions for Season 8 please those looking for a deadlier dungeon crawl. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "I thought I knew my keyboard until I played the Initial D typing game, which somehow takes touch typing even more seriously than drifting",
    "article_text": "Trading RPM for WPM in the Japanese street racing counterpart to Typing of the Dead. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Pasokon Retrois our regular look back at the early years of Japanese PC gaming, encompassing everything from specialist '80s computers to the happy days of Windows XP. Sometimes I buy obscure old games for what I like to imagine are grand, noble reasons. A niche developer makesan unusual puzzley twist onthe RPG, and I must learn more. A great idea turns up20 years too earlyon hardware that could barely run it, and I just have to know if it works anyway. An ancient dungeon crawlerdares to combine horror with extensive map-making, and I need to see it for myself. And then there are times like this, where I see the words \"Initial D typing game\" and just know it's going to be so daft I have to experience its particular brand of absurdity with my own eyes. No setting could be more unsuited to the typing game treatment—not even Sega's The Typing of the Dead felt as forced as this. The '90s street racing manga and anime adaptation of Initial D are full of achingly cool people driving hyper-tuned cars I will never see outside of old arcade games andTokyo Xtreme Racer. It's about as effortlessly stylish as anything could ever hope to be. Which means it's also on the exact opposite end of the cool spectrum as \"accurate touch typing\" and \"being the sort of person interested enough in typing games to have them shipped from the other side of the planet.\" (Hi). I expected to have nothing more than a bit of a laugh with 2000's Initial D: Ryosuke Takahashi's Fastest Typing Theory, to confirm it was a silly idea and a fun curio for my shelf I'd soon put away forever. A brief run through practice mode quickly corrected my casual attitude. This game is as deadly serious about the typing tutor part of the package as it is showing off nighttime drifting around hairpin corners. There are separate sessions for each hand, colour coding to show correct finger placement and their corresponding keys, and a full dual-handed test too. When I'm done I'm shown my clear time,tracked to the hundredth of a second, as well as how many slip-ups I made and my five most commonly fumbled keys. I've been judged in three specific areas, none of them drifting a tuner Toyota Trueno, and found deeply wanting. Seeing my weaknesses laid out in this way wounded my writer's pride. I type all day and night. I've worn keyboards out, haphazardly stuck them back together, and then typed some more. So when some decades-old game has the gall to tell me I'm anything less than amazing at the one thing I do all the damned time, you bet I'm going to take it personally. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. I think Ryosuke Takahashi's Fastest Typing Theory did this on purpose. I took my white-hot umbrage and poured it into the main \"Battle\" mode, ready to unleash my lightning-fast reflexes against the game's five opponents, unaware that I was so wounded by its mild accusations I was about to dedicate an entire afternoon to showing an ancient piece of typing software who's boss. Rather than try to meaningfully integrate the races with my frenzied keyboard mashing, these sprints instead follow a video > typing > video > typing pattern, the compressed action pausing in certain places to allow for some burning hot key pressing action. The short and low resolution clips used to sell each \"race\" aren't exactly up to modern technical standards, but as they're all directly lifted from the '98 TV series Initial D: First Stage (as is the fabulous Eurobeat soundtrack and numerous snatches of dialogue), they're still enough to drum up some genuine excitement. Watching another one is my reward for typing well, and I'm soon caught up in clearing the latest word off the screen, always afraid I'll take a second too long or fumble too many keystrokes, every error chipping away at my health bar until I crash out. At first I assumed the text I'm asked to type out would lean towards racing/car terminology in a vague attempt to justify the licence, so I was surprised to see the Japanese names of countries, rivers, and short words that would translate into \"periodic table\", \"shampoo\", and \"hamster\" turn up instead. Weird, but nothing I couldn't handle. I was doing pretty well in no time at all, actually. My typos were down, my speed up, and my initials were plastered all over the game's arcade-like high score table. I soon had a string of breezy victories to my name and confidently clicked on the next race without giving it much thought. It felt as though the game had suddenly slammed the accelerator to the floor. By the end of the fifth stage I'm desperately typing out full sentences, sometimes with punctuation, and swearing like I'm facing the final boss of a soulslike. No more single words to quickly clear away for me. Oh no, now the challenges demand perfect inputs like \"AREHAHASIRIKONNDEKO-SUWOYOKUSITTERURAINNDAYO\" and \"ITUMADENETEYAGARU.OKIRO,DENNWADA.\"—and that's if I'm lucky. I've had less stressful hospital appointments. Just as it's on the verge of becoming truly unbearable the game throws out something that could be translated as \"Count Dracula can't handle the sun\" just for fun. I end up swearing again, only this time it's because I'm trying to focus on typing accurately without laughing my head off. Against all odds, this is a genuinely useful typing tutor. The practice sessions are of real practical use, and the Initial D framework makes it all feel more like play than real homework even when things get tough. The lack of any true link between these two seemingly incompatible halves turns out to be for the best, the unpredictable text forcing my eyes to focus on the screen and trusting my fingers to do the rest. I am a better touch-typist for playing this, and I got to see some great '90s drifting, too. I'm not sure if my freshly honed skills will transfer toTokyo Xtreme Racer, but I'm still counting them as a win. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "title": "Best base locations in RuneScape: Dragonwilds for collecting resources and staying fed",
    "article_text": "Park your first base by a forested river, but remember to branch out later. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Even in early access,RuneScape: Dragonwildshas a pretty large map so it can take a while to choose the best base location in Dragonwilds. As in all survival crafting games, living close to the resources you're collecting most is a big consideration—water and food in particular for Dragonwilds. Death is common in Dragonwilds—not only because of the dragons—and running back to collect all your stuff is a chore. As you explore new regions, you'll spend a lot of time dying and running back since you can't craft the gear to survive those new areas without first harvesting materials from them. With the help of Lodestones, you can establish multiple bases throughout Ashenfall for easy access to raw materials and quicker trips to Vaults and dungeons.I've picked out the best base locations in Dragonwilds for most major regions so you can start thriving instead of just surviving in RuneScape: Dragonwilds. The best base location in Bramblemead Valley is right in the heart of Bramblemead Village, exactly where the Wise Old Man tells you to build a shelter at the start of the Dragon Slayer main quest. The abandoned village isn't exactly a desirable view from your starter home, but it has some benefits. Try building your first base right in the elbow of a crumbling stone wall so you can kite those overly aggro cows, for instance. Bramblemead Village isn't anything special, but it's full of Flax, which you can use to create Coarse Thread on a Spinning Wheel. There's also a ton of wildlife nearby, so you'll never run out of food or materials like Animal Fangs or Animal Hide. Remember to always grab some water from the river just down the road so you'll never go thirsty. It's also a great spot to farm Cooking XP. The Fractured Plains are the first difficulty spike in RuneScape: Dragonwilds since metal gear is ideal for this zone but you can't harvest the Copper or Tin you need to make that metal equipment anywhere else. Set up a base and a bed in the Fractured Plains so you can respawn closer and have easy access to ore deposits. The best place to set up a base in the Fractured Plains is marked on the map below.This is arguably the best base location in all of RuneScape: Dragonwilds, and it's where I've personally chosen to make my permanent home in Ashenfall. There are several Copper and Tin Ore deposits within walking distance of this spot, and you can get to a bunch of them without dealing with any enemies. While this base is located on a cliff, there's a broken path that you can use to safely drop down to the lower levels of the Fractured Plains. You can also use the Windstep spell to climb back up this path, and there are Copper and Tin deposits along the way. Once you've geared up, though, you can find even more Copper and Tin guarded by Garou enemies just a short distance to the east. You'll need the Windstep spell to cross that gap back to your base, which means you can pick off those Garou without them reaching you. With strong enough equipment, you can also make a short trek south to the Whispering Swamp to stock up on Clay and Swamp Tar. This base location also has a pond for unlimited water and a respawning Stone blockade that you can mine pretty often so you can stock up on rocks for all your crafting needs. That blockade also hides the entrance to a Vault, so this base location really does have everything you could ever need. To top things off, this spot has one of the best views in Ashenfall. You can really flex your creative muscles and build your dream home here. The Stormtouched Highlands crank up the difficulty with stronger enemies and environmental hazards like lightning strikes, but you won't have to spend too long getting beaten down if you set up a base near its eastern edge. The border of the Stormtouched Highlands is the best place for a base. It has access to a ton of Iron Ore nodes (which is the main reason to visit this zone in the first place), and you'll also find large flocks of sheep and rams. Most crafting recipes at this stage in the game call for Iron Bars and Padded Cloth, and this base is the perfect place to farm those. The Stormtouched Highlands are actually quite small compared to other biomes like the Fractured Plains, so there's no need to set up a base further into the zone since you'll only be going that deep for Vaults or quests. This base is more than good enough as a farming outpost for this region's primary resources Iron and Granite. While I've described three permanent base locations, the best base location in Dragonwilds will always be the one that gets you closer to the resources you need while keeping you safe from threats. That's why pop-up camps deserve an honorable mention. They're a true godsend for players trying to explore the most dangerous areas of Ashenfall. If you carry a Vault Core and some basic resources in your inventory when you go out, you can plop down a Lodestone and construct a small temporary outpost wherever you want. Since you can just delete the Lodestone and get all the materials refunded, you can essentially have unlimited fast travel in RuneScape: Dragonwilds as long as you're okay with reserving some carrying capacity for that hefty Vault Core. Most of the bases on this list started out as my temporary fortifications to make gathering materials less of a headache, so don't sleep on this Lodestone trick. It's not really worth setting up a permanent base in a place like the Whispering Swamp or Bloodblight Swamp, for example, but you still need to go to these regions every now and then to gather specific items or complete some quests. All you need to do is chop down a tree or two for some walls and place a Lodestone nearby and you have a bonafide base of operations!

    "title": "Fallout 1 lead Tim Cain says the marketing department wanted him to make it real-time 'because of Diablo,' but he got them to back off when he told them how much it would cost",
    "article_text": "He has some ideas of how real-time Fallout 1 could theoretically work, but says \"I would never do it.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In anew vlog on his YouTube channel, veteran RPG designer and Fallout 1 lead Tim Cain shared one of those great \"told you so\" anecdotes of gaming history: Interplay's marketing department apparently hounded Cain to rebuild Fallout to be more like Diablo, rather than the turn-based RPG we got. A viewer asked Cain what he would have done to make Fallout 1 work as more of a real-time, actionized experience, to which Cain replied, \"I would not have made Fallout real-time. Not back in '97, not today in 2025.\" But Cain revealed he was pressured to do just that, and also shared his \"what-if\" theorycrafting on what real-time Fallout 1 would have looked like had the pressure campaign actually succeeded, as well as the design choices he would make now, were he forced to revamp Fallout 1 in such a way. \"Interplay marketing approached me in 1996, a year before we came out, and they wanted Fallout to be made real-time because of Diablo,\" Cain said. \"The way I finally got it to stop was just by pointing out how much money I would need, and time, and they finally stopped.\" This pressure is really interesting in the context of RPGs at the time: Diablo's explosive success kind of poisoned the well for top-down CRPGs for a while. Money (or marketing) types in the industry would look at games with a similar art style and perspective to Diablo and say, \"Oh, is this like Diablo? It isn't? Well why the hell not?\" It's a similar story to many follow-the-leader design fads in gaming, with recent examples including Destiny-style live service, battle royale, and extraction shooters. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. One notable instance of a studio burned by the Diabloification drive was Larian, whose first released game, Divine Divinity, saw its gameplay actionized in the face of publisher pressure. Diablo itself wasfamously going to be turn-based before pivoting to real-timeand creating the action RPG, but that change came only six months into its development. The time and expense a Fallout retrofit of this nature would have required at the end of 1996/beginning of '97 when Diablo came out, so far into the development of Fallout 1, surely wouldn't have gone as smoothly. The patent absurdity of the request at such a late stage appears to have ensured its downfall, thankfully. But Cain indulged us in a bit of theorycrafting, both in terms of what real-time Fallout might have looked like back in '97, as well as how he would (reluctantly) go about it now. Cain's next game, thecultiest of cult hits, Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura, gives us an idea of how real-time Fallout might have functioned in the late '90s. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Cain and fellow Fallout devs Leonard Boyarsky and Jason Anderson left to form their own studio, Troika, and released this phenomenal Steampunk RPG in 2001. Its combat plays almost exactly like 2D Fallout, despite the radical change in setting, but also has a toggleable real-time combat mode. I love this game almost as much as my cat, but its real-time mode is not a good time, serving best as a sort of JRPG-on-an-emulator fast-forward mode for trash mobs and grinding. Cain saying real-time Fallout 1 would have played like Arcanum feels like athreat. As an alternative, Cain explained some of the changes he had in mind to make a real-time Fallout 1 retrofit work, knowing what he does now: Even with all that proposed bespoke balancing, I don't think we'd wind up with a game that's better than, or even as good as the Fallout 1 we got. That's a point Cain echoes one final time at the end of the video: \"I think that's everything I would do to change Fallout to real-time. I would never do it. But if Ihadto do it, that's what I would do.\" Ted has been thinking about PC games and bothering anyone who would listen with his thoughts on them ever since he booted up his sister's copy of Neverwinter Nights on the family computer.

Some Steam sales are wide open things: Any game can take part in one of the big four seasonal sales, for instance, as long as they're on sale during the relevant season. There are also more specific sales, like the third-person shooter fest, or the political sim fest. Few, though, are as narrowly defined as the current event, theSteam Box-Pushing Fest, which as the name indicates is all about games in which you push boxes. Lest there be any doubt, Valve is not kidding when it says, with emphasis, that this fest is about pushing boxes: Nothing more or less, and definitely not pulling them. From theSteamworksdocumentation page: \"Games that include box-pushing or similar elements as a minigame are not eligible; the main gameplay loop should revolve around box pushing mechanics. Adjacent games (including all types of box-pushing puzzles) are also welcome to join. Games that are eligible will typically be 2D, have little to no time pressure to solve the puzzle, and likely require multiple attempts per puzzle to solve. Math and logic games that happen to use a grid or box are not eligible for this event.\" The inspiration for the Box-Pushing Fest is of courseSokoban, a game about moving boxes in a warehouse that was first published in 1982 and has been released in one form or another for just about every platform to ever exist. In fact, if you check out our list ofSteam sale dates, you'll see that the Box-Pushing Fest was at one point called the Sokoban Fest. I don't know why the name was changed, but I definitely like this handle better: It's amusingly specific, and also more useful from a practical perspective. You don't need to know what Sokoban is to know what this fest is all about, after all.

    "article_text": "There are only so many synonyms for \"demonic.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Naming things is hard. Ask anyone in a creative line of work, and they'll tell you as much. And according to the developers of Diablo 4, it'sparticularlychallenging to come up with new, morbid names for devilish challenges when the series you're working on has been burning through death metal-adjacent material for almost 30 years. Since its launch, Diablo 4 has featured activities with titles including but not limited to: Tormented Bosses, Helltides, Nightmare Dungeons, Seething Realms, and The Dark Citadel. And if I'm being frank, I don't think Blizzard has a lot of adjective space left for describing encounters with demonic hordes and the miscellaneous hellscapes they inhabit. Which is why, in an interview for Diablo 4'supcoming Return of Belial season, I asked lead live game designer Colin Finer and lead seasons designer Deric Nunez just how tough it is for their team to keep coming up with synonyms for \"evil.\" \"I would say it's probably one of the most difficult design challenges,\" Finer said, with surprisingly little hesitation for someone whose work is judged by millions of players who, statistically, probably spend more time hitting things with axes and fireballs than they do pondering nomenclature. \"I would say so, yeah,\" Nunez said. \"We go through many rounds of iterations and internal dev names that change on a weekly basis, especially when the season is just getting kicked off and rolling and the identity is still finding its feet.\" Apparently some of those internal placeholder names can be harder to give up than you might expect. In Season 8, players will fight two versions of the archdemon Belial—one little bigger than a person, one King Kong-scale. During the season's development, they were affectionately referred to as \"baby Belial\" and \"Gigabelial.\" \"That carried a lot of weight, and it was really hard to kind of jettison those beloved terms within the team,\" Nunez said. \"But yeah, much to the chagrin of the producers, we go through a lot of rounds of iterations—on how we can not just make an activity name be menacing, but also straightforward and clear and have its own unique identity.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

Plus there's a new boss to throw down with somewhere in there. Aggro Crab, you didn't have to, but I'm glad you did. I honestly love when games do this kinda stuff. It's understandable that few developers want to go that extra mile, because itisa whole-ass mile to go. But it effectively doubles the length of the game (or more), even if elements of it are familiar. NG+ also lets you upgrade Kril even further, with more fork and stowaway weight and more stowaway slots, too, which you can fill with mysterious, powerful new sigils. Boss refights will let you practice against bosses you've already cleared, and multi-boss challenge runs reward Kril with an assortment of silly and/or cute little crab outfits. The game also now has a bestiary (something that every RPG, action or otherwise should have) in the form of a museum of sea life, giving you a little extra detail on all the fish you've battered. There's even a last few quality-of-life goodies in the mix, like a chapter select so you can bounce around and replay past chunks of the story. And lastly, new achievements to chase and community trading cards to collect. While a bit vague, the patch notes also mention that speedrunners might want to keep an eye out for some especially speedy snails in-game. This update feels like a big ol' slab o' crab. And not only is it free, but if you didn't have the game already, it's available at ahefty 40% discount on Steamuntil May 5th, with even steeper discounts if you own Sifu, Slime Rancher 2 or the studio's earlier (and underrated) workplace anxiety comedy roguelikeGoing Under, which is also, coincidentally, going extra cheap.

    "title": "The Last of Us TV show did the thing",
    "article_text": "Spoiler alert. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Note: Big ole spoilersfor the thing you probably already know about in The Last of Us Season 2. Well, the thing happened in The Last of Us Season 2, the thing we've all been waiting for. It's the thing even me, a guy who only played three hours of the first TLOU game and only played zero hours of the second TLOU game, has known about since 2020 because, collectively, we are all pretty bad about keeping major events in pop-culture a secret. I am continuing the trend right now. After watching the episode, \"Through the Valley,\" I'm left wondering just one thing: how many HBO executives brainstormed different ways to avoid doing what The Last of Us Season 2 did last night? I'm guessing all of them. I know the creatives behind the series wouldn't dare rewrite the show to save Joel, but I bet some suits at the network tried likehellto talk them into it. You've got the hottest Hollywood commodity, super-zaddie Pedro Pascal, Mr. Fantastic, the flippin' Mandalorian—and you want to dowhatto him? In episodetwo? There must have been a ton of meetings about how to put it off until the final episode or change the script altogether so he can keep being our favorite sexy Sunday night sad dad. As Tim Clark put it when we were discussing the episode this morning: \"Killing Pedro? In this economy?\" As for how it all goes down in the show, after all that anticipation… I was pretty unimpressed, honestly. Abby and her revenge crew had no idea how to get to Joel in the heavily guarded Jackson Hole, so I was interested in what plan she'd come up with. Her plan, ultimately, is just to become the luckiest person in the entire world and capitalize on about a hundred convenient coincidences. Huh! Good for her. After Abby's friend (I dunno his name, who cares) ponders how they're gonna get into the town past all the walls and guards and dogs, Joel conveniently comesoutof the town for one of the casual two-person patrols Jackson Hole is really stupid to send out on a daily basis—even though Ellie just reported a completely new type of scary mushroom monster in the first episode of the season. Eh, whatever, no need to send a bigger group out, I guess. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Then there's a huge storm all these expert mountain folk ignore until it's too late even though it looks like literal death hovering over the mountains, and that storm conveniently means walkie-talkies don't work and the Joel/Dina patrol and the Ellie/Young patrol have to hole up in separate abandoned buildings because the patrols extend so far from Jackson Hole they can't get back to the town. Okay, sure? Then Abby makes the excellent tactical decision to accidentally fall down a hill and activate the biggest mushroom zombie flash mob in history that she only escapes because she runs into—surprise!—Joel, the one man she's been hunting across the entire country for five fruitless years. Wow, amazing! The zombies all head straight for Jackson Hole, I assume because the pipes are filled with mushroom sensors the town found last episode but didn't think anything of because they're all too busy spending their time wondering: \"What's with this rift between Ellie and Joel? Why is it the only thing any of us ever talk about? Don't we have our own inner lives?\" Was Abby's dad a golfer? So, Abby gets Joel alone and surrounded, the town is too busy to help, and the walkie-talkies conveniently work just long enough so Ellie can conveniently split up with her partner and conveniently show up just in time to watch Joel get golf club-clubbed and then golf club-stabbed. (Forgive me if I'm missing something, but was Abby's dad a golfer? Is that why she used golf clubs? He was a doctor, so it's possible, but she hasn't been lugging around his golf clubs for five years just to murder Joel with, has she?) It's a shame about the shoddy plot fixins' (and by the way, the deadly storm completely endsthe secondAbby and her friends finish up their murderin', must be one of them-there famous twenty-minute deadly storms Wyoming is known for) because the actual confrontation is good. To be fair, this is fairly close to how it goes down in the game (I am told). I know some fans aren't thrilled about Kaitlyn Dever playing Abby because she's not as physically imposing as her in-game counterpart, but I think she's great here (she's great in everything). I like that it's not some big glorious death for our sad zaddie hero, he's just beaten to death on the floor in some random house like Joel has done countless times to other survivors with families, then dragged home behind a horse. And Joel and Ellie being stubborn idiots for five entire years meant they never got to patch up their rift, and now it's too late. Suitably brutal. As far as the Jackson Hole zombie mob... I have to admit, I spent most of Season 1 thinking \"You know what might be good in this zombie show? Somezombies.\" Well, I guess I got my wish in this episode but turns out I don't think the zombies add all that much. A big mob of mindless monsters just isn't interesting or exciting, and the one big boss zombie was either a guy in a rubber suit or CGI that looked like a guy in a rubber suit. It doesn't help that I don't care about any of the characters in Jackson Hole except Catherine O'Hara (if this show hurts her I will burn the studio down) but she wasn't even in the episode. Back to dead Pedro and those HBO executives I imagined trying to save his life… I do feel like they have a point. No offense meant to Bella Ramsey because they're a fantastic actor, but without Joel in the story I'm not super interested in continuing to watch the show (I will still watch the show, I can't pretend I have anything better to do Sunday nights). Pascal was probably about 80% of the reason I was tuning in, considering I don't have any attachment to the game. I expect Mando might not begonegone, though: if there's one thing a five-year time jump between seasons allows for it's flashbacks, and that might be a concession the creatives gave to those imaginary HBO suits desperate to cling to Pascal's warm body. \"Don't worry, it'll be like he was never killed in a weirdly golf-themed murder. We can flash back to him a bunch of times throughout this season! And in The Last of Us Season 3, and Season 4, and Season 5. Relax. Stop crying.

    "article_text": "Don't get cranky, now. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The Playdate has been a lightning rod for critical darling game developers to do something weird and funky, like Lucas Pope'stake on Papers, Pleaseabout a bar on Mars, and now the team behindInto the BreachandFTL: Faster Than Lightis joining the fun with an exclusive title of its own. At last week'sPlaydate Updatelivestream, a whole bevy of exclusive games were teased for the micro-console's second season, one of which isFulcrum Defender: a crank-operated shoot 'em up from Subset Games. In the livestream, Subset co-founder Jay Ma said: \"The basic gameplay is simple: you just aim with the crank and shoot … my goal for Fulcrum Defender was to recreate some of the fun of the survivors genre of games, while taking advantage of the joy that is the Playdate's crank.\" Jay Ma continued in the stream to say that she had no intentions of finishing the game when she started making it as a \"form of self-therapy\" while dealing with the effects of long Covid, but that it turned into a chance to prove to herself she could still finish and release a game despite her health struggles. It's certainly less ambitious than something like Into the Breach, but I admit I'm curious how it feels to aim with a crank. Like previous Playdate releases, the new season will be drip fed to players two games at a time once it comes out, and will include 12 games, most of which haven't been shown off just yet. I know I'm liable to lose my PC gamer card if I don't shun console exclusives on principle, but the Playdate is everything I think a console ought to be: a unique chunk of hardware that facilitates development which might not otherwise happen. Sure, I could get an analog crank for my PC, but I imagine life's a lot easier as a crank-minded developer when you can be sure your entire audience has a device with one bolted to the side. Its handheld, low-power nature also makes it perfect for arcadey score attack games like Fulcrum Defender, which I feel like major console publishers haven't prioritized since the Dreamcast went belly-up.

    "title": "The pitch of Diablo 4's next season is 'becoming the boss,' which is a polite way to describe killing a giant skeleton and stealing its death laser powers for yourself",
    "article_text": "Yoink. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Today Blizzard dropped afresh pile of detailsabout Belial's Return, Diablo 4's next season. As it says on the tin, the big bad in Sanctuary's immediate future is Belial, the Lord of Lies, one of Diablo's more powerful demons who's been absent since players kicked him out of Kehjistan back in Diablo 3. And players won't just be fighting him. Season 8's major new mechanic is boss powers, which will let players steal abilities from vanquished bosses—Belial included—and work them into their own builds. In a group interview with press last week, Diablo 4 lead live game designer Colin Finer said the goal of Season 8 is to liven up the buildcrafting meta by giving players the chance to wield some of the game's most dangerous powers for themselves. And a big part of that work, Finer said, was giving boss powers the proper kick. \"The fantasy of this season with boss powers is really 'becoming the boss,' and those powers need to feel powerful, right? When you imagine a boss, that power better kick some ass,\" Finer said. \"We've really doubled down on making sure that, especially during leveling, a lot of the powers feel really powerful.\" Blizzard's example of choice is the Wandering Death's Chest Beam, which players can claim for themselves by killing the associatedworld bosswho you may or may not have watched massacre swaths of public event players with that same death laser. If you equip the Chest Beam as your main boss power, it'll fire off whenever you channel a skill, dealing a hefty amount of damage. Boss powers can also be equipped as modifiers, adding an additional effect to whatever other boss power you've chosen as your mainstay stolen ability. As a modifier, our good friend Chest Beam will instead cause your main boss power to instantly execute non-boss enemies once they're low on health. Handy! Boss powers will feed into Season 8's overhaul of Diablo 4 endgame bosses, which revamps boss progression, loot, and unlock mechanics so that fighting an archdemon feels more impactful than something you farm back-to-back for hours in boss milling parties. Boss powers will be accessible soon after creating your Season 8 character, and pursuing them will direct you through the new \"lair boss\" structure. \"It's a journey that guides players from the most accessible to the most pinnacle bosses, and it's very nice and structured. One of my favorite things about it is you kind of see it as ticking off your stamp collection of, 'Okay, what boss do I need to go get to get this power? I'm gonna go target that one,'\" lead Diablo 4 seasons designer Deric Nunez said. \"We wanted that journey to be as straightforward and friction-free as possible, so that you know what you need to do to get that power.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. As far as motivation goes, giving bosses a taste of their own medicine has some pretty strong appeal. Belial's Return hits Diablo 4 on April 29.

    "title": "5 years out from its last hero release, Heroes of the Storm is looking awfully spry for a 'dead game'",
    "article_text": "Most communities shudder at the thought of maintenance mode, but Heroes still shines in its underserved niche. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In last month'scinematic teaserfor BlizzCon, a few seconds of icy visuals and generic text about \"legendary heroes banding together\" promote the convention's return in 2026. It’s nifty and all, but the real fun is in the comment section, where you’ll find a chorus of outcries: Dozens upon dozens of comments shouting into the void for Heroes of the Storm to make its righteous return. \"HOTS 3.0 Please!!\" \"Who up Heroing they Storm\" \"Heroes of the Storm is THRIVING\" After the teaser aired, the Heroes of the Storm subreddit spawned several threads at war over whether it’s even remotely reasonable to speculate about the game’s return. As CollinthePoodleput it, \"HotS reddit probably the biggest community hopped up on hopium I know XD. If the burn marks in your morning toast looked even remotely like a HotS symbol, you'd believe a HotS revival was confirmed.\" MostPutridSmell tried to put the discussion to rest,saying\"I'm from the future. They'll announce expansions to WoW, Diablo 4, and Hearthstone. Some other stuff barely worth mentioning. HotS won't be mentioned at all.\" Not to be outdone, users like object_on_my_desk had only one thingto say: \"Fuck the naysayers. We're so back.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Whether the BlizzCon trailer is secretly a major announcement masquerading as a hint-laden cipher or if it features a big blizzard because that’s the name of the company, one thing is certain about Heroes of the Storm: enthusiasm among its players is in remarkable supply. And that didn't just start in the last few weeks. The game hasn’t received a sizable addition since Hogger was added in 2020, with the company formally announcing a move to maintenance mode two years later. It didn’t come as a shock to its playerbase, but while Blizzard’s MOBA didn’t make the industry-wide shockwaves Dota 2 or League of Legends did, there’s a few things it has over belly-up contemporaries like Heroes of Newerth, Battleborn, and Battlerite—a sizable niche that arguably no other game in the genre is serving, and regular small-scale updates that keep it ticking. It’s impossible to know just how active the game is sequestered on Battle.net, but when I’m struck by the urge to revisit my old haunts polymorphing Overwatch characters as a Warcraft 3 faerie dragon, queuing up for a quick match still takes me less than a minute. It’s still the only lunch break-compatible MOBA, and when it comes to immediacy, no game is doing it like Heroes of the Storm. Though I have some affection for League, Dota 2, and Heroes in their own respects, there’s a reason I have over 2,000 matches in Heroes and fewer than a thousand in the others. It unmoors itself from the more complex holdovers from the original Defense of the Ancients mod—last hitting, item builds, etc—to emphasize map-specific objectives and constant teamfights. If you’re looking for a MOBA that favors accessibility and action over strategically dense, hour-long matches, Heroes of the Storm is still the biggest one taking that angle. While the game doesn’t have constant news to draw in new players, reworks of many of its weakest heroes like Gazlowe and Chen from before entering maintenance mode lead to a relatively stable and diverse meta. You’ll still find players on social media shouting out the game’s quality and recommending it to MOBA newcomers, which can’t be said for the alternatives likeInfinite CrisisorDawngatewhen MOBA hype was at its peak. \"Game state is the most balanced it’s been in awhile IMO since it 'died' at a solid spot and the patches since have made adjustments to fix outliers (which have had a decent frequency of late),\" Reddit user clancemj posteda few months ago. Fans online have spun HotS’s slow but sure development pace into an inside joke, saying they owe the game’s continued life to a theoretical hero: the nameless \"janitor\" who keeps the lights on and does an occasional balance pass. Currently these patches come around nearly once a month; not bad, as far as maintenance goes. In fact, when the game received an updated main menu screen in March featuring the Janitor Leoric skin, players on Reddit took it as tribute, with user neurotekksaying\"Microsoft had janitors before the acquisition... so maybe now we have a second janitor in the dev team.\" Akirashantogenretorted, \"Looks good on paper. ‘We have increased the HOTS staff by 100%!’\" You might think this ribbing masks some indignance within the community, but feedback is implemented faster than you might expect. In February, WC3 mogul and occasional HotS streamer Grubbynotedthat the draft phase was pretty long and that made queuing for ranked a bit of a chore. In the next patch, the draft timer was cut in half after a surge of concurrent player feedback. User LittleLeaf_MTG got at the bigger picture insaying: \"We joke that HotS is unsupported, and while that is true in terms of the development resources that would be required to create new heroes and maps and so on, it is certainly not the case that the maintainers of the game are inattentive or dispassionate. They definitely deserve our thanks for doing what they can as efficiently as they do with the resources they're given.\" Dota 2 and League of Legends still impress me with their constant new hero releases, map overhauls, new modes, and loyal player numbers in the millions. But there’s something about Heroes of the Storm’s resilience, its refusal to sink despite players having every reason to abandon ship and find a more active game, that brings me back with as much enthusiasm. Whether that’ll ever amount to a revival or if the game will slowly fade into obscurity, a relic of when MOBAs were the new hotness, I have a feeling it’ll be fine for a very long time.

Facebook'santitrust trial in Washington D.C.is into its second week. And along with the usual reams of impenetrable legalese that dominate such proceedings, a few enlightening gems have emerged from the mountain of paperwork released by the U.S Federal Trade Commission. How about the fact that Meta and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg floated the idea of deleting every Facebook user's friends list? Yes, really. During a series of emails starting in 2022 andcollated from court documents by TechCrunch, Zuckerberg discussed his fears concerning Facebook's declining relevance. \"Even though the FB app’s engagement is steady in many places, it feels like its cultural relevance is decreasing quickly,\" Zuckerberg fretted. His solution? Delete your friends list and introduce a new structure around following rather than friending. \"Friending feels out of vogue right now for at least a few reasons. First, a lot of people’s friend graphs are stale and not filled with the people they want to hear from or connect with,\" he said. \"One potentially crazy idea is to consider wiping everyone’s graphs and having them start again. This obviously carries the risk that if we did that then a lot of people just wouldn’t rebuild their graphs or would become less engaged, so if we wanted to consider this we’d have to build out an experiment and test it in a smaller country to make sure it led to a positive result. \"I think we’d need to do something relatively extreme like this to move the needle though and I don’t think small things like spring cleaning flows would move the needle,” Zuckerberg went on. Desperate measures, to say the least. But then it seems like Facebook is facing desperate times. \"It feels heavyweight to request someone new as a friend,\" Zuckerberg lamented. \"Most of the time when I meet someone or become interested in someone I just want to follow them first but not ask anything of them.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. So, after nuking your friends list, the next step would be to replace friending with following. \"The way to rectify this would be to fully adopt following. If we wanted to do this, I don’t think that simply supporting following for public accounts would be sufficient. I think we’d have to switch from friending to following on private accounts as well,\" Zuckerberg mused. Thus far, Facebook hasn't made that leap of faith to following rather than friending, never mind wiping everyone's friends lists. But it certainly says something that such extreme measures are are even being considered.

    "title": "Super Robot Wars Y pits Gundams against Godzilla in a huge showcase and release date announcement trailer",
    "article_text": "Also featuring Nicolas Cage's all-time favourite mecha. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The long dark era of Super Robot Wars games being Japanese-only releases is over, the curse shattered by the enormous anniversary blowout gameSuper Robot Wars 30. Now, Super Robot Wars Y, second in theverylong-running strategy RPG/interactive fanfiction franchise to get a global release has a release date, and it's just a few months away. Super Robot Wars Ywill be coming to Steam on August 28, according to a massive showcase trailer that Bandai Namco rolled out, introducing all the shows that'll feature in the game's initial release. If you've ever wanted to see a Gundam throw down with Godzilla, you're in for a treat. There are SO many Mobile Suits on show, and the chonkiest of all 'Zillas. Check them out in the 13+ minute long video below. Lovers of romantic lesbian mech drama will be well-served here, with SRW Y being the first in the series to feature Gundam: The Witch From Mercury (which you can and shouldwatch in its entirety free on YouTube), and its anxiety-wracked wunderkind heroine Suletta Mercury. For those preferring their giant robots a little sillier, classic mech-brawling martial arts saga G Gundam is getting a showing too, as well as Gundam Seed, Zeta, Char's Counterattack—it's a lot of Gundam! This game will also feature the post-apocalyptic Getter Robo Arc, Macross Delta, Code Geass and a couple more '80s picks like Aura Battler Dunbine and Heavy Metal L-Gaim. And for those who want to throw down with kaiju, there's SSSS Dynazenon (an Ultraman spinoff), and Netflix's recent Godzilla Singular Point, which features an extra small and cute version of Jet Jaguar facing down the extremely hefty Ultima Godzilla. As if the big lizard wasn't enough of a problem normally. Curiously, Brave Raideen is joining the extra-old-school set of mechs. While not one I'm particularly familiar with, it does have one particularly notable fan: Nicolas Cage. The oddball Hollywood legend hasofficially sung the praises of the show, and it has been seen on his T-shirts at major events. Normally I'm unswayed by celebrity endorsements, but I'm willing to trust Nic Cage's recommendation for anti-Godzilla recruits. The showcase also introduces us to the new protagonist characters, created specifically for this game. Cross and Forte Tsukinowa are a duo of ninjas piloting giant ninja robots bristling with throwing-knives and flappy ninja scarves. Not entirely sure how sneaking is meant to work when you're taller than the highest of trees, but they're cool designs. Lastly, it confirms that between pre-order perks and the first round of DLC, the protagonists of Super Robot Wars Z, X and T (which all got English releases, but were only available in Asian territories) will be making guest appearances too. As is customary for the series, getting the fancy deluxe edition is likely to set you back a pretty penny, but at least you get the original vocal versions of all the main mecha theme songs. Not something I can really recommend to anyone that isn't a mecha anime sicko, but… I'd be lying if I said I wasn't tempted. There's no pre-order options available yet, but you canwishlist Super Robot Wars Y here on Steam. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Bungie's classic Myth fantasy tactics series gets the remasters it deserves, courtesy of its community",
    "article_text": "Myth: Twice Born Edition includes a new engine, a graphical overhaul, a rebalanced campaign and enhancements for dozens of community-made missions. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. While Bungie's extraction shooter reboot might have put the classic Marathon trilogy back on the map (and on Steam), there are still some that hold a torch for their other early hit series, Myth. Exacting, precise fantasy tactics games about leading a vastly outnumbered force to victory against seemingly impossible odds, Myth still has its champions—despite never seeing a digital release. The most dedicated of those fans made their very own miracle resurrection happen this past Easter Sunday with the launch ofMyth: Twice Born Edition, a comprehensive remaster of Myth: The Fallen Lords, Myth 2: Soulblighter, the community-led expansion Chimera, and more besides. It's unofficial, but made with the aid and endorsement of several original Bungie crew and featuring key art by original Bungie artist Mark R. Bernal. You can check out everything included in this unofficial re-release in the launch trailer below, and see some impressive before/after shots inthe release announcement thread here on Resetera. It's the kind of thing that Nightdive would normally release on Steam for a premium. In fact, according to project lead Christopher 'Jon God' Lyles-Arthur, the project wasset to be released through Nightdive at one point, but Myth rights-holders Take 2 got cold feet. Rather than scrap the work he and the community had done, they've opted to release it for free, although you'll need to jump through some hoops first. The only downside about this release is that in order to segment the download and allow the team to update components individually, the community remaster requires you to do a bit of downloading and assembling yourself. First and foremost, you'll need to source a copy of Myth 2: Soulblighter. While second-hand copies go relatively cheap on Ebay (depending on how much you want the boxes and manuals), it's not hard to find a digital copy, if you've no qualms downloading a decades-out-of-print game. The good news is that whether you've got an original CD or ISO, you won't need to install the game from the disc. Just create yourself a Myth directory on your PC and copy the Tags and Cutscenes directories from the disc to there. You can now download the latest version ofProject Magma's modern engine port(1.8.5 at the time of writing), run its installer and point it to your Myth directory with the Tags & Cutscene folders inside. From there, you can download theTwice Born Edition main files. All you need to do is unzip and put the HD Megapack files in your Myth\\Plugins folder, and optionally the HD High Contrast file, which makes some sprites (like arrows, spears and some pickups) a little more visible on the battlefield. If you just want to play Myth 2 with shinier graphics, you can launch the game now and enjoy. But I'd highly recommend grabbing the files forMyth: The Fallen Lords Deluxe, a re-balanced and enhanced version of the Myth 1 campaign ported to the sequel's engine, although a warts-and-all direct port isalso available here. As with most other things Myth, just unpack the main file to your Plugins folder. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Make sure you grab the upscaled cutscenes in eitherde-interlaced(my recommendation) orinterlacedform, and unzip those files to your Myth\\Cutscenes directory. Lastly you'll probably needQT Lite, a video codec package that'll allow those cutscenes to play on modern machines. You're almost done. The final cherry on top isChimera. Part sequel, part expansion, produced by the community in close collaboration with Bungie. It too receives a full set of graphical improvements from the Twice Born Edition upgrade. You're now good to go, with three gruelling campaigns and a deadly-experienced multiplayer scene to butt heads against. Good luck, and tell your dwarves to watch the friendly fire.

    "title": "One of classic Doom's most brutal challenge runs is finally conquered after 13 years of mega-scale demon slaughter",
    "article_text": "Doom pro Coincident rips and tears until it is done. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Few names can terrify classic Doom fans more than Okuplok, an obscure mapper who's only surfaced a few times on the Doomworld forums, usually to release something painful before slinking off into the shadows. They're best known for unleashing one of the most nightmarish levels in the history of Doom upon the world: Thehumble-sounding 'untitled2', better known to the community as the'Okuplok Slaughter Map', is one of the most gruelling combat challenges in Doom history—a colossal series of arena battles against an ungodly 23,211 demons where even the tiniest mistake spells instant death. The map has always been beatable. With sufficient quicksaves, or the slow-motion inhuman precision ofa tool-assisted speedrun, it was alwaystheoreticallypossible to ascend this mountain of demon corpses. But to do it without dying? Without saves? And without leaving a single monster alive? That's the real challenge. And forthirteen years, players have thrown themselves into this meat-grinder, aiming to be the first to record themselves clearing it underthe community's standard UV-Max challenge rules. In a gruelling six hour struggle on Easter Sunday, pro Doomer 'Coincident' finally did it, and I watched it happen live.Check out the recording of the record-breaking run here, but before you dive into that, check out the video above for a brief introduction of the hell that is to come, and why even surviving the first few seconds of this map is a challenge that only a rare hero can handle. Coincident has been fighting tooth and nail against Okuplok's creation for some time now. Two years ago, he manageda one-life run on Doom's lowest difficulty. This evens the odds somewhat, halving the damage done to the player and doubling the contents of every ammo pick-up but leaving enemy placements otherwise unchanged. Even with those advantages, it's a challenge very few could overcome, especially as the sheer volume of oncoming fire means that even with twice the health and ammo, you can still die in a blink of an eye. Unsatisfied with that partial victory, Coincident set out to surgically dissect the level, developing new strategies to make a true Ultra Violence difficulty run possible. He even went so far as to publish awhole series of videospicking apart its individual encounters and devising the most survivable approaches to get through it. A useful aid, but without patience and precision, it still won't get you very far. Due to the highly random and unpredictable nature of Doom's combat (including some enemies capable of doing absurd damage with a single hit if the game's under-the-hood damage dice decide you deserve to suffer), any successful run is going to be a mixture of endurance, precision and luck, and you can hear the stress and tension in Coincident's voice as he ventures deeper and deeper into the map. All that tension comes unraveled and replaced by adrenaline-drenched catharsis as he brings down the final artillery emplacement of Arch-vile snipers in the final arena. It was six hours of the highest-level Doom gameplay ever recorded, and a feat that will be remembered in the community for years. So, Nightmare mode next, right?

    "article_text": "The ultimate GeoGuessr cheat code or just a privacy nightmare? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Word to the wise, be careful about the images you post on social media.OpenAI's latest AI models, released last week, have sparked a new viral craze for bot-powered geoguessing. In other words, using AI to deduce where a photo was taken. Not to put too fine a point on it, but that could be a doxxing and privacy nightmare. OpenAI's new o3 and o4-mini modelsare both capable of image \"reasoning\". In broad terms, that means comprehensive image analysis skills. The models can crop and manipulate images, zoom in, read text, the works. Add to that agentic web search abilities, and you theoretically have a killer image-location tool, foreboding pun somewhat intended. According to OpenAI itself, \"for the first time, these models can integrate images directly into their chain of thought. They don’t just see an image—they think with it. This unlocks a new class of problem-solving that blends visual and textual reasoning.\" That's exactly what early users of the o3 model in particular have found (viaTechCrunch). Numerous posts are popping up across social media showing users challenging the new ChatGPT models to play GeoGuessr with uploaded images. A close-cropped snap ofa few books on a shelf? The library in question at the University of Melbourne correctly identified. Yikes. Another X post shows the model spotting cars with steering wheels on the left but also driving on the left-hand side of the road, narrowing down the options to a few countries where driving on the left is required but lefthand drive cars are common, including the eventual correct guess of Suriname in South America. o3 is insaneI asked a friend of mine to give me a random photoThey gave me a random photo they took in a libraryo3 knows it in 20 seconds and it's right pic.twitter.com/0K8dXiFKOYApril 17, 2025 The models are also capable of laying out their full reasoning, including the clues they spotted and how they were interpreted. That said, research published earlier this year suggests that the explanations these models give for how they arrive at answers doesn't always reflect the AI's actual cognitive processes, if that's what they can be called. When researchers at Anthropic\"traced\" the internal steps used by its own Claude modelto complete math tasks, they found stark differences with the method the model claimed it had used when queried. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Whatever, the privacy concerns are clear enough. Simply point ChatGPT at someone's social media feed and ask it to triangulate a location. Heck, it's not hard to imagine that a prolific social media user's posts might be enough to allow an AI model to accurately predict future movements and locations. All told, it's yet another reason to be circumspect about exactly how much you spam on social media, especially when it comes to fully public posts. On that very note, TechCrunch queried OpenAI on that very concern. \"OpenAI o3 and o4-mini bring visual reasoning to ChatGPT, making it more helpful in areas like accessibility, research, or identifying locations in emergency response. We’ve worked to train our models to refuse requests for private or sensitive information, added safeguards intended to prohibit the model from identifying private individuals in images, and actively monitor for and take action against abuse of our usage policies on privacy,\" was the response, which at least shows the AI outfit is aware of the problem, even if it's yet to be demonstrated that these new models would refuse to provide geolocations for any given image or collection of images.

    "title": "A high-performance Intel Battlemage gaming GPU has allegedly been spotted and I really want it to be a $400 RTX 5070 killer",
    "article_text": "That's if tariffs don't get in the way... When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. A new variant of Intel's latest Battlemage gaming graphics has been spotted in a shipping manifest and the hope is that it could be the killer $400 gaming GPU we've been waiting for. ThinkRTX 5070performance forRTX 5060 Ti 8GBmoney. Well, that's the dream, anyway. X user Haze2K1(viaVideocardz) spotted a listing for an Intel BMG-31 GPU in a manifest onshipping data website NBD. Intel's latest Arc B580 and B570 GPUs are based on the BMG-G21 chip, whilethe G31 GPU has long been rumouredas the next step up in the Battlemage hierarchy. Previous leaks have indicated the G31 GPU packs in 32 execution units or EUs. That compares with the 20 EUs of theexisting Intel Arc B580. In really rough terms, then, G31 should be about 50% faster and roughly competitive with an NvidiaRTX 5070or an AMD Radeon RX 9070. The catch here is that the mere existence of an Intel graphics cards with a G31 GPU being shipped across the world does not prove that Intel plans to launch a retail product.Another rumourfrom around three weeks ago suggested that the G31 chip as a retail product was cancelled late last year. Likewise, the shipping manifest lists the card as an \"R&D\" or research and development item. Of course, that's exactly what a pre-launch card would be listed as even if Intel was indeed planning on launching a retail G31-based graphics card, perhaps branded as Intel Arc B770. If anything, the main reason to doubt that Intel is actually planning on pushing through a G31 graphics card into the retail market is that the launch window for a competitive offering is narrowing. The longer Intel leaves it following the release of the Nvidia and AMD competition, the less of an impact G31 is likely to make. Arguably, G31 would have to launch sometime in 2025 to make any sense at all, given you would expect Nvidia and AMD to release their own follow ups in the $500 GPU space towards the end of 2026 or early in 2027. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. All that said, we'd welcome a G31-based gaming graphics card at almost any time, provided it's priced right. Intel's B580 board has several very promising attributes, including strong ray-tracing performance, and Intel's XeSS upscaling technology is pretty decent, too. Given how aggressively Intel has priced the B580 and B570, you'd also expect an G31 board to undercut the likes of the RTX 5070 pretty comprehensively, raising the prospect of a card with performance that's roughly competitive with an RTX 5070 for around the $400 mark. Anywho, we'll have to wait and see with all our fingers and toes crossed to see if Intel does ever wheel out a G31-based GPU and if it does, just how fast it is and how well it performs.

    "title": "Quick, get in the DeLorean, we've got to go back. A new renewable powered battery made of radioactive waste product just dropped, and someone's gotta tell Doc Brown it's uranium, not plutonium",
    "article_text": "Great Scott, this battery is going to be heavy. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Hold onto your holographic caps because researchers in Japan have managed to turn depleted uranium into futuristic rechargeable batteries. According toIEEE.org, Scientists at the Japan Atomic Energy Agency have been working to turn the depleted uranium waste products of nuclear power generation into batteries designed to be recharged by renewables. Sadly, this doesn't mean we'll be emptying leftover cans of drink and banana peels into our fuel canisters anytime soon. Instead, the plan is to recharge these batteries using established renewable sources like wind and solar. The hope here is to turn the depleted uranium waste into a useful resource that doesn't create anymore of its kind. This depleted uranium is going to break the generational abuse cycle. Unfortunately, the current process for getting usable power out of ancient magical glowing danger rocks like uranium creates a tonne of depleted uranium waste. In Japan's case it's actually closer to 16,000 tonnes, and in the United States it's something more like 750,000 tonnes. Globally it's believed there's a total 1.2 million metric tonnes of depleted uranium stored. Thanks to its density and relatively low dangerous glowiness, we've found uses for the waste like high calibre rounds and radiation shielding. Still, supply is far outweighing demand and most is simply stored. If we can get safe stable batteries from the waste instead of needing to mine and refine other sources like lithium, it could be a huge win. Especiallywith the added help of AI. The JAEA says they've managed to achieve this, at least on a small scale. In tests the batteries successfully powered an LED, and were able to deplete, charge, and recharge to do it all again with little change in capacity. Plus the battery solution would change between green and purple to indicate charge state, which is a cool feature all batteries should have. The process hasn't been fully detailed yet, and we're waiting for a paper to release to get the full details on how this works. Or to justmake our own battery with some paper and ink.Still, according to what researchers are happy to share for now, the skinny is these are a flow battery, so you have two tanks of different liquids with opposing charges. The key to having this work with depleted uranium was the use of iron at different states of oxidisation as a part of the bath. The bigger the tanks, the more power they can theoretically store. Scaling up is among the next steps for these researchers and there's already plans in the works for a huge battery. The proposed powerhouse will use 650 tonnes of uranium giving it a capacity of 30,000 kilowatt-hours. That's not some random number, instead it's about the daily requirement to run 3,000 households in Japan. All that uranium plus however much iron is required means these are shaping up to be some of the most heavy metal batteries ever. Brutal.

    "article_text": "\"The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. China managed to make one of the coolest sounding premises staggeringly nerdy as the country pits humanoid robots against humans in a half marathon run. According toThe Guardian, this meat vs. machine mini marathon was held at Yizhuang in Beijing on Saturday, where 21 robots joined the thousands of fleshy fitness fanatics in competition. The real downside to this news is the robots didn't win, or even come close. In our hubris these robots were kept to humanoid design, which includes human style bi-pedal movement. Running is one of those things that seems particularly difficult to teach a machine, I assume because they don't feel fear. Yet. While the bots ranged in size, from the smallest at just over one metre and the tallest just a touch below two metres tall, they still had to actually run the course. Which is fair, I suppose. This means we didn't see cool things like wheels, rocket jets, chainsaws, or other things I immediately envisioned upon hearing about this robot race. All of the robots were shadowed by some form of human assistance. Some were there to be huge helpers doing things like keeping the robot stable and upright, but others were more hands off, just needing to give directions, complete maintenance, or change batteries. All presumably while themusic from the new Marathon trailerloops in their heads. There was so much human help that organisers ended up describing the event more like a motor race thanks to the engineering help and pitt stop-like treatment. \"The robots are running very well, very stable … I feel I’m witnessing the evolution of robots and AI,\" spectator He Sishu, who works in artificial intelligence, told The Guardian. Tiangong Ultra, from the Beijing Innovation Centre of Human Robotics, was the fastest robot. This all black shiny champion came in with a time of two hours 40 minutes. For reference the human winner of the race had a time of one hour and two minutes. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "title": "Asus announces specs and price for its 2025 TUF A14 gaming laptop and do my eyes deceive me or is this a good deal?",
    "article_text": "We loved 2024's A14 and these could be just the step up we're looking for. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Asushas us drooling after it released all the juicy specs for the upcoming Asus RTX 50-series A14 TUF gaming laptop. Right now Asus are the top dogs of laptops, with several of the company's machine making ourbest of list, including the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16 editions. While they didn't quite make the list last year, Asus' TUF series are also nothing to balk at. For 2024's iteration of this little beastyreally impressed our reviewer, Dave James, who also happens to be my boss, so you know he knows what's up. Following in those footsteps, the 2025 A14 TUF gaming laptop looks set to impress. This 14-inch machine is set to be ultra portable while still packing a solid gamer powered punch. To this end it packs an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Laptop GPU andAMD RyzenAI 7 350 processor into a 14-inch form factor that weighs only 1.46 kg. There's also two upgradable M.2 slots for SDDs, and it supports LPDDR5 RAM, but no word on how much though won't be upgradeable as that's soldered memory. These RTX 5060 laptop GPU's from Nvidia were only shown off recently, alongside themore entry level RTX 5050s.Though not officially announced, we saw plenty of leaks with partners like Asus and Razer basically blurting out the cards existence with laptop listings. What's surprising about these promising little cards is that so far they're being packed intoreasonably priced machines. The new compact Asus RTX 50-series units are set to start at a base price of around £1,600, which usually translates to $1,600, but we might have to see howTrump's tariffs play into this one. And yeah, honestly, that seems pretty good. We recently saw the ROG Strix G16 with anRTX 5070Ti mobile list for $1,900, which is also a reasonable deal. So it seems Asus has a solid strategy here by providing value for money, pretty new and radical for the gamer laptop space. Still, I want to see how these new RTX 50-series laptops perform before I go recommending them to anyone. Paired with the AI compatible Ryzen chip means we should see the full benefits of modern upscaling packed into these little units, which is pretty exciting. They're set to come out mid May, so there's probably only another month to go before we get our grubby little mitts on some of these 50 series laptops. Fingers crossed they turn out to be the bang for buck we're expecting in this, the current state of expensive tech.

    "title": "Skyfaring survival sandbox Lost Skies launches into early access, built from the bones of PvP cousin Worlds Adrift",
    "article_text": "A friendlier, more sociable game about swashbuckling sky-ship crews When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I’ve always believed in second chances, both for people and for games, and few feel more deserving of a second shot at life thanWorlds Adrift, Bossa’s ill-fated sky-pirate MMO. Despite impressive physics, grappling hooks and wingsuits, its heavy PvP focus turned off a lot of people, and in turn, Bossaturned off the servers. Out now in early access on Steam,Lost Skiesis a smaller-scale PvE-centric reboot for the game. Most of the trappings are still there—including the highly customizable airships—but this time round, players are working together to fight against invading aliens and robots instead of each other. While survival/crafting sandboxes aren’t usually my thing, I’m tempted to give Lost Skies a shot, because I’m a sucker for sky-island adventure settings. Sailing through the clouds and exploring strange structures visible on the far horizon is inherently exciting stuff. The game’s store page also emphasises that it’s possible to enjoy Lost Skies entirely solo, though it’s almost undoubtedly better in co-op. Surprisingly, there’s no PvP options at all here, not even a casual duelling mode. A bold decision, considering its roots. At first glance, the initial early access release seems a bit lightweight, with only one region of the map to explore and a single boss to challenge once your ship and crew have thrown together enough resources. It looks like an impressive enough fight in the trailer above, but it is still the only such battle in the game. Considering that this is a retrofit of a whole other game, it’s hard not to be a bit concerned that Bossa may be biting off more than they can chew. While I’ve got my fingers crossed for the success of Lost Skies, Bossarecently laid off a chunk of its staff. Even with an increased focus on player-made content (with plans for Steam Workshop support this summer, allowing players to design their own islands to populate the sky with), I hope the studio has the resources needed to keep up with their audience’s demands for new locations, new enemies and new stuff to craft. Bigger games have sunk without trace for less. The early access roadmap details that the first round of updates will focus on bug-hunting, optimization and expanding the outskirts region with new islands to explore. More enemies and resources are also coming. A second region with new enemies and bosses is planned, but it sounds like that might be happening after the editor launches. Whether it turns out to be a true airship of Theseus or a hasty retrofit,Lost Skies is out now on Steamfor $25/£21, with a small launch discount available until May 2nd.

    "title": "Is that why they gave them bigger butts? Marvel revives its Swimsuit Special, with 'designs for new costumes coming soon to Marvel Rivals'",
    "article_text": "Maybe NetEase was just gearing up to put all the men of Marvel Rivals in budgie smugglers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Marvel Comics has announced it's bringing back the most '90s thing this side of jorts—theMarvel Swimsuit Special. Marvel Swimsuit Special: Friends, Foes & Rivals #1 will be published in July, and promises to \"also include designs for new costumes coming soon to Marvel Rivals, the mega popular multiplayer video game from Marvel Games and NetEase Games.\" Marvel's Swimsuit Specials were an infamous moneyspinner aimed primarily at horny teenage boys in the 1990s, and it makes a kind of sense to revive today when the entire internet is openly horny at all times. While the originals were mostly just an excuse for pinups where the women of Marvel wore bikinis and the men DTs, they also had plots and the revival \"continues the tradition with an overarching story by Tim Seeley and Tony Fleecs and drawn by superstar artist Nick Bradshaw that stars Earth's Mightiest fashion designer, Janet Van Dyne, aka the Wasp!\" One of many strange things about the Swimsuit Specials was how many of the men had their own logos on their banana hammocks, meaning the Punisher hit the beach with a giant skull covering his area. I guess that's the kind of thing we can expect to see in Marvel Rivals? For maximum fidelity to the comics they'd have to bring back that gross yellow skin tone they gave Psylocke, but let's hope they draw the line there. When Season 2 of Marvel Rivals came out, players noticed the men really did havebigger butts than they used to. (Then it turned out acouple of the women did too.) Given how much NetEase has leaned into the sex appeal of Marvel's characters and the thirstiness of its player base that didn't seem like it needed explaining, but I guess it makes sense if the summer wave of cosmetics will see all the dudes rocking nut huggers.

    "article_text": "Get all the help you need with today's Wordle. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. All the help you need to make Monday'sWordlea breeze is ready and waiting just below. Whether you want to warm up with our general tips, sort out a jumble of yellow letters with our clue for the April 21 (1402) game, or jump straight to today's answer, we've got it all. Two green letters and one handy yellow in my first row? On a Monday? Brilliant. I could have perhaps done without every guess after that being slightly wrong in a strange and interesting way for far too long, but I suppose they just balanced out my fantastic start. Make sure you take a look at today's clue if you want to avoid a similar fate. Think of a word for an overwhelming rush of something in a short space of time. A string or unexpected flurry of bad events. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. A good starting word can be the difference between victory and defeat with the daily puzzle, but once you've got the basics, it's much easier to nail down those Wordle wins. And as there's nothing quite like a small victory to set you up for the rest of the day, here are a few tips to help set you on the right path: There's no racing against the clock with Wordle so you don't need to rush for the answer. Treating the game like a casual newspaper crossword can be a good tactic; that way, you can come back to it later if you're coming up blank. Stepping away for a while might mean the difference between a win and a line of grey squares. Get off to a flying start. The answer to the April 21 (1402) Wordle isSPATE. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Past Wordle answers can give you some excellent ideas for fun starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. They are also a good way to eliminate guesses for today's Wordle, as the answer is unlikely to be repeated. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and you'll need to work out which secret five-letter word is hiding inside them to keep up your winning streak. You shouldstart with a strong wordlike ARISE, or any other word that contains a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You'll also want to avoid starting words with repeating letters, as you're wasting the chance to potentially eliminate or confirm an extra letter. Once you hit Enter, you'll see which ones you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" word to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. With a bit of luck, you should have some coloured squares to work with and set you on the right path. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do. She's now PC Gamer's word game expert, taking on the dailyWordlepuzzle to give readers a hint each and every day. Her Wordle streak is truly mighty. Somehow Kerry managed to get away with writing regular features onold Japanese PC games, telling today's PC gamers about some of the most fascinating and influential games of the '80s and '90s.

    "article_text": "BFC? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Everyone hitting refresh on Bethesda's YouTube channel waiting for an Oblivion Remastered trailer got a surprise when a new trailer for Doom: The Dark Ages arrived auspiciously over the Easter weekend. It opens with a strong dose of story. A guy who looks like he stepped right out of Hellraiser is here to attack a divided humanity with a skyship that looks like it was designed by Warhammer 40,000's Imperium of Man and an army of demons. (I have not kept up with the fluff of the Doom series.) The humans, who have foolishly leashed the Doom Slayer, deploy him like a goshdanged nuke and the heavy metal kicks in. The rest of the trailer is interspersed with first-person footage showing off the various weapons, like the tossable shield and what is basically a BFG crossbow. The whole thing ends with the appearance of cybernetic Cthulhu. Yes, it is incredibly badass. The trailer release coincided with wrestlerDrew McIntyre making a Doom-themed entrance at Wrestlemania, which seems slightly less badass in comparison. Joshua Wolens wenthands-on with Doom: The Dark Ages, and came away impressed by its surprisingly parry-focused combat, though he did have some concerns. \"For all its newfound emphasis on whacking demons with your hands,\" he wrote, \"glory kills have taken a backseat. Enemies will still enter vulnerable stun states when you do enough damage, but your execution moves will more often than not be a plain-Jane canned kick or punch, rather than the brilliantly creative animations of old. It's such a strange misstep that I wondered if my build of the game was bugged, but it looks like true glory kills are now reserved for bigger boss demons rather than every hellish Tom, Dick and Harry. I miss them already.\" Still, it lets you pilot a mech and ride a dragon, so it's got that going for it. Doom: The Dark Ages will be out on May 15 and you can wishlist it onSteam.

    "title": "This 4K Blu-ray alternative could be the shot in the arm that 8K TVs desperately need",
    "article_text": "Kaleidescape joins the 8K Association When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Kaleidescape may not be a household name, but most home theater fans will have at least some familiarity with the company’s movie players and servers, which provide the highest-quality alternative to thebest 4K Blu-ray players. In case you’re not familiar with Kaleidescape, its systems let you download movies for purchase or rental from an online storefront with a comprehensive library, and in some cases, new titles not yet available from other online services likeAmazonorAppleTV. The picture quality of Kaleidescape downloads is equivalent to4KBlu-ray, with support for both Dolby Vision and HDR10high dynamic rangeformats, along with lossless Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks. A typical Kaleidescape system can be pricey, but over the past year, the company has expanded its product line with a lower-cost standalone 4K movie player, theKaleidescape Strato V, plus an even cheaper 2K model, theStrato M. Those releases demonstrate that the company is looking to expand its reach into new markets, and also to give existing Kaleidescape owners options for expanding their systems outside of a dedicated home theater driven by thebest projectors. The most recent news from Kaleidescape is an announcement of its membership in the8KAssociation, an industry group dedicated to accelerating the adoption of 8K content and8K TVs. In a company press release, Kaleidescape chairman and CEO Tayloe Stansbury characterized the alliance as one that “positions Kaleidescape alongside other industry leaders, committed to fostering a collaborative environment, and dedicated to the advancement and standardization of 8K technology.” Stansbury further stated, “As consumers demand larger screens, higher-fidelity and increasingly immersive experiences, Kaleidescape’s involvement in the 8KA will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of premium home cinema.” Looking at the current TV market, it’s impossible to ignore that set manufacturers have a lukewarm relationship with the 8K format. Until recently, new 8K TVs were a regular thing, but only one company,Samsung, has announced new 8K models for 2025 (theSamsung QN990FandSamsung QN900F). Projectors supporting 8K have also been slow to emerge, with only two consumer models, the JVC DLA-NZ9 andJVC DLA-NZ8, currently available. An 8K TV can be priced almost twice as high as an equivalent 4K model, but the main reason why the 8K TV market hasn’t really taken off is a lack of 8K content. You can find some 8K – mainly eye candy travelogues – onYouTube, but there isn’t a better online source for streamed 8K content such as documentaries, concert videos, or movies. An 8K disc format isn’t technically out of the question, but there’s been no commercial advancement on that front since 8K TVs first appeared. Also, physical disc sales, 4K Blu-ray included,have been steadily declining, falling below $1 billion for the first time in the US in 2024. Given that trend, the outlook for an 8K disc format is grim to nonexistent. That’s why Kaleidescape’s 8K Association announcement is intriguing – the company has the technical infrastructure to make 8K downloads possible, and its business model means that content can be delivered without the high compression levels that make thebest streaming servicesinferior to 4K Blu-ray Disc. Another good omen for 8K is Kaleidescape’s customer base, which is comprised of high-end home theater enthusiasts willing to pay for the highest quality presentation possible. Many of those customers also use either video projection systems or ultra-large screen TVs, and the added detail provided by 8K can be appreciated on such displays. Samsung’s new QN990F series 8K TVs are available in a 98-inch screen size. An 8K TV that large deserves actual 8K content, and with Kaleidescape’s announcement, there’s new hope that more and better 8K content could be coming.

    "title": "3 things we learned from this interview with Google Deepmind's CEO, and why Astra could be the key to great AI smart glasses",
    "article_text": "Stars in your eyes When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Googlehas been hyping up itsProject Astraas the next generation of AI for months. That set some high expectations when60 Minutessent Scott Pelley to experiment with Project Astra tools provided by Google DeepMind. He was impressed with how articulate, observant, and insightful the AI turned out to be throughout his testing, particularly when the AI not only recognized Edward Hopper’s moody painting \"Automat,\" but also read into the woman’s body language and spun a fictional vignette about her life. All this through a pair of smart glasses that barely seemed different from a pair without AI built in. The glasses serve as a delivery system for an AI that sees, hears, and can understand the world around you. That could set the stage for a new smart wearables race, but that's just one of many things we learned during the segment about Project Astra and Google's plans for AI. Of course, we have to begin with what we now know about Astra. Firstly, the AI assistant continuously processes video and audio from connected cameras and microphones in its surroundings. The AI doesn’t just identify objects or transcribe text; it also purports to spot and explain emotional tone, extrapolate context, and carry on a conversation about the topic, even when you pause for thought or talk to someone else. During the demo, Pelley asked Astra what he was looking at. It instantly identified Coal Drops Yard, a retail complex in King’s Cross, and offered background information without missing a beat. When shown a painting, it didn’t stop at \"that’s a woman in a cafe.\" It said she looked \"contemplative.\" And when nudged, it gave her a name and a backstory. According to DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, the assistant’s real-world understanding is advancing even faster than he expected, noting it is better at making sense of the physical world than the engineers thought it would be at this stage. But Astra isn’t just passively watching. DeepMind has also been busy teaching AI how to generate photorealistic imagery and video. The engineers described how two years ago, their video models struggled with understanding that legs are attached to dogs. Now, they showcased how Veo 2 can conjure a flying dog with flapping wings. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The implications for visual storytelling, filmmaking, advertising, and yes, augmented reality glasses, are profound. Imagine your glasses not only telling you what building you're looking at, but also visualizing what it looked like a century ago, rendered in high definition and seamlessly integrated into the present view. And then there’s Genie 2, DeepMind’s new world-modeling system. If Astra understands the world as it exists, Genie builds worlds that don’t. It takes a still image and turns it into an explorable environment visible through the smart glasses. Walk forward, and Genie invents what lies around the corner. Turn left, and it populates the unseen walls. During the demo, a waterfall photo turned into a playable video game level, dynamically generated as Pelley explored. DeepMind is already using Genie-generated spaces to train other AIs. Genie can help these navigate a world made up by another AI, and in real time, too. One system dreams, another learns. That kind of simulation loop has huge implications for robotics. In the real world, robots have to fumble their way through trial and error. But in a synthetic world, they can train endlessly without breaking furniture or risking lawsuits. Google is trying to get Astra-style perception into your hands (or onto your face) as fast as possible, even if it means giving it away. Just weeks after launchingGemini’s screen-sharing and live camera featuresas a premium perk, theyreversed course and made it free for all Android users. That wasn’t a random act of generosity. By getting as many people as possible to point their cameras at the world and chat with Gemini, Google gets a flood of training data and real-time user feedback. There is already a small group of people wearing Astra-powered glasses out in the world. The hardware reportedly uses micro-LED displays to project captions into one eye and delivers audio through tiny directional speakers near the temples. Compared to the awkward sci-fi visor of the original Glass, this feels like a step forward. Sure, there are issues with privacy, latency, battery life, and the not-so-small question of whether society is ready for people walking around with semi-omniscient glasses without mocking them mercilessly. Whether or not Google can make that magic feel ethical, non-invasive, and stylish enough to go mainstream is still up in the air. But that sense of 2025 as the year smart glasses go mainstream seems more accurate than ever.

    "title": "OpenAI continues to dominate AI landscape among developers - but things are changing fast",
    "article_text": "OpenAI leads developers' LLM choices for now, but the field is evolving fast When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OpenAIhas been dominating the LLM space for some time, and remains the leading choice for many developers, but market dynamics and loyalty seem to be shifting, new research has claimed. A survey by Vercel of 656 app builders found 87% use OpenAI’s models and 83% rely on its inference APIs. However, developers now use an average of two providers, and 60% have changed vendors within the last six months - raising questions about their loyalty. DeepSeek is now used by nearly a third of businesses (29%), whileMicrosoft's LLMs, by contrast, appears to be struggling, with only 10% of respondents report using the latter, and 9 out of 10 developers do not consider it a viable option. “AI is dissolving the boundaries between roles. We’re seeing new product designers blend UX, UI, and code in one creative flow - thanks to tools like Vercel, v0, Uizard, and Cursor. Whether junior or senior leader, anyone can now build, test, and ship ideas independently - and that’s not just efficient, it’s liberating,” said Nicolas Le Pallec, CTO, EMEA - AKQA. AI now builds around clear use cases, with developers prioritizing tools - not teams. Forty-five percent of respondents said they have no dedicated AI team, while 57% reported no specific AI leadership structure. Instead, success with AI depends on clear priorities and the right tools. “By embracing cutting-edge AI technologies, we’re empowering our teams to work smarter and faster,” said Dr. Jan Ittner of BCG X, echoing the sentiment that anAI writeror developer tool can be more valuable than another hire. Product AI features are now a priority for 75% of customer-facing apps, while only 39% still include traditional support chatbots. Website personalization remains underutilized at 27%, indicating room for future innovation. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Cost control is also a major priority. Over 70% of developers manually test their models, spending under $1,000 monthly - showing how much can be achieved on limited budgets. To cut costs, only 14% train their models, while 60% instead use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and vector databases. The focus on tools stems from a perceived \"overhype\" around AI, with an average rating of 6.4 out of 10. Yet developers gave a 7.7 out of 10 when asked if AI will transform their industries in the next 12 months. In a shifting field where speed, precision, and adaptability matter more than scale, thebest LLM for codingisn’t fixed - it’s the one that solves today’s problems while keeping tomorrow’s door open.

    "article_text": "Synology introduces controversial policy When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Taiwanese NAS-maker Synology has confirmed a new policy that requires Synology-branded hard drives to be used for full compatibility within its 2025 Plus series ofnetwork-attached storage (NAS) devices. From launch, the policy states Synology-branded hard drives will need to be used, but the company promises to “update the Product Compatibility List as additional drives can be thoroughly vetted in Synology systems,” a company spokesperson said(viaArs Technica). In the meantime, this could spell out reduced choice and increased cost for customers, with potential sustainability issues stemming from users’ inability to use hard drives they might already have, rendering them unusable. Synology has nine products in its Plus range, supporting all the way up to 24 hard drives, however users will be required to use approved storage drives only. The company said that “Synology systems are at less risk of drive failure and ongoing compatibility issues.” Chad Chiang, the Managing Director of Synology’s Germany and UK businesses,noted: “With our proprietary hard disk solution, we have already seen significant benefits for our customers in various deployment scenarios.” Despite the change for 2025-onward models, the company confirmed that older models sold up to and including 2024 (excluding XS Plus series and rack models) remain unchanged. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Interestingly, Synology doesn’t manufacture its own hard drives, instead choosing to rebrand models from popular brands like Toshiba andSeagate. This could be good news, indicating the possibility that further Toshiba and Seagate models might appear on the approved list of third-party drives at a later date, however it could also mean that drives from other brands might be less likely to appear on the list. Of course, this is speculation only, but we’ve contacted Synology for further details in the hope that we can get access to a list of pre-approved third-party drives.

    "title": "Bluesky unveils a verification system, but you still can't request a blue check",
    "article_text": "A check marks the spot When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Bluesky, the upstart, decentralized social network that's offered an island of blue calm for those departing the tumultuous, dark waters of X (formerly Twitter), is finally introducing an official form of account verification. It will look familiar to those who spent time on old-school Twitter, but it does feature a few notable caveats. Up until today (April 21, 2025), there was no Bluesky-supported system for verifying an account or visual indication of verified status, and the microblogging social media platform was suffering from an imposter problem. Bluesky addressed this, in a way, byencouraging people to set up and use their own domain namesto establish the veracity of an account. My account, for instance, is attached to lanceulanoff.com, a domain I've owned for years. Bluesky reports that some 270,000 accounts have linked their accounts to domains. Still, setting up a domain and connecting it to your Bluesky account is not a trivial matter. This new feature significantly simplifies the process. According to a newBluesky blog post, there are now three levels of identity on the platform: the basic Bluesky account, a Trusted Verifier, and a Verified Account. The Trusted Verifier is interesting because it's a verified account that, with Bluesky'sreview, can verify other accounts.The example given is The New York Times' Bluesky account, which can then verify its journalists' accounts. Years ago, Twitter had something similar, where an entity like TechRadar could ask Twitter directly to verify some of its journalist employee accounts. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. It was not a popular feature among, for instance, celebrities and officials, who wondered (often on Twitter) why journalists needed verification. The topic of Blue Checks and verification on Twitter became so fraught that, for a time, Twitter's then-CEO Jack Dorsey stopped verifying accounts. When Elon Musk took over,he removed verificationsfrom millions of accounts, only to return them some months later. Bluesky wrote that it is proactively verifying some \"authentic and notable accounts,\" which will now have a white check in a blue circle. Trusted Verifiers will have a scalloped blue check to indicate their vaunted status. A tap on someone's verified status can show you which Trusted Verifier granted verification. It's not necessarily a foolproof system, as I think media companies might seek to verify all journalists in their camp, and Bluesky could push back against that. Or maybe Bluesky says yes, but at some point, \"the notables\" grow irritated because there are suddenly so many non-famous people with checks. One thing Bluesky is not supporting is \"requests for verification.\" However, the social media platform is not ruling it out and has promised that as this system settles in and stabilizes, it will \"launch a request form for notable and authentic accounts interested in becoming verified or becoming trusted verifiers.\" If you're wondering about the other decentralized social media platform,Threads, it adopts verifications directly from Instagram, another Meta property. It'll be interesting to see what Bluesky asks for in its future verification process and if any part of it will involve some form of ID.

Cybercriminals are preying on victims of online fraud, using their state of emotional distress to cause even more harm, the FBI has said, revealing it received more than a hundred reports of such attacks in the last two years. In the campaign, cybercriminals would create fake social media profiles and join groups with other victims of online fraud. They would then claim to have recovered their money with the help of the FBI's Internet Complaint Center (IC3). This makes the ruse credible, since IC3 is an actual division of the FBI and serves as a central hub for reporting cybercrime. Those who believe the claim are then advised to contact a person named Jaime Quin on Telegram. This person, claiming to be the Chief Director of IC3, is actually just part of the scheme. Quin will tell people who reach out that he recovered their funds and would then ask for access to their financial information, to steal even more money.

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) This is just one example of how the scam works. The FBI says that initial contact from the scammers can vary. “Some individuals received an email or a phone call, while others were approached via social media or forums,\" it said. \"Almost all complainants indicated the scammers claimed to have recovered the victim's lost funds or offered to assist in recovering funds. However, the claim is a ruse to revictimize those who have already lost money to scams.\" To minimize the risk of falling victim to these scams, you should only reach out to law enforcement through official channels. Furthermore, you should keep in mind that law enforcement (especially those in executive positions) will never reach out to you this way, especially not to initiate contact.

    "article_text": "Popular file conversion sites are getting malicious clones When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cybercriminals are using fake PDF converters to install powerfulmalwareon victims' systems, experts have warned. Research fromCloudSEKfound attackers are cloning popular file conversion websites like pdfcandy.com - replicating its logo and brand elements - in order to trick users into downloading malicious software. CloudSEK says these fake sites look almost identical to the real ones. When someone tries to convert a file, the page shows a fake loading screen and then prompts for a CAPTCHA verification. Instead of just confirming the user is human, this step leads to an instruction to run a PowerShell command. Following the command downloads a zip file containing malware known as ArechClient2, part of the SectopRAT family of information stealers. The malware uses a number of hidden methods to infect the system. It spawns normal Windows processes to hide its activity and begins collecting browser passwords, crypto wallet information, and other sensitive data. Once the malware is active, it can quietly send stolen information back to the attackers, CloudSEK reports. The FBI has already warned that online file converters are becoming a popular way for criminals to spread their malware. CloudSEK’s research shows that attackers are improving their methods, cleverly blending realistic website designs with social engineering tricks in order to lower users' defenses. With online tools becoming part of everyday work and personal life, it’s important to know how to avoid these threats. The best way to protect yourself is to avoid clicking random search results for online file converters. Always visit known official websites directly.

For a good starting point, check out our round up of thebest PDF editors, and thebest free PDF editors. We also recommend the bestAdobe Acrobat alternatives. Staying cautious when uploading documents online can stop many of these attacks before they start. Keep your antivirus software up to date (you’re doing this anyway, right?) and scan any downloaded files before you open them. Installing browser extensions that block suspicious or dangerous sites can also help. If a website asks you to run PowerShell commands or download extra files after uploading a document, close the page immediately. Finally, if you think you’ve been tricked, disconnect the device from the internet right away, change all important passwords from a safe device, and let your bank or service providers know as soon as possible.

    "title": "New AI Chibi figure trend may be the cutest one yet, and we're all doomed to waste time and energy making these things",
    "article_text": "Hold them closer, tiny capsules When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. The best AI generation trends are the cute ones, especially those that transform us into our favorite characters orat least facsimiles of them.ChatGPT4o's ability to generate realistic-looking memes and figures is now almost unmatched, and it's hard to ignore fresh trends and miss out on all the fun. The latest one is based on a popular set of Anime-style toys called Chibi figures. Chibi, which is Japanese slang for small or short, describes tiny, pocketable figures with exaggerated features like compact bodies, big heads, and large eyes. They are adorable and quite popular online. Think of them as tiny cousins ofFunko Pop!. Real Chibi figures can run you anywhere from$9.99 to well over $100. Or, you can create one in ChatGPT. What's interesting about this prompt is that it relies heavily on the source image and doesn't force you to provide additional context. The goal is a realistic Chibi character that resembles the original photo, and to have it appear inside a plastic capsule. The prompt describes that container as a \"Gashapon,\" which is what they're called when they come from a Bandai vending machine. Bandai did not invent this kind of capsule, of course. Tiny toys in little plastic containers that open up into two halves have been on sale in coin-operated vending machines for over 50 years. If you want to create a Chibi figure, you just need a decent photo of yourself or someone else. It should be clear, sharp, in color, and at least show their whole face. The effect will be better if it also shows part of their outfit. Here's the prompt I used inChatGPT Plus4o: Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Generate a portrait-oriented image of a realistic, full-glass gashapon capsule being held between two fingers. Inside the capsule is a Chibi-style, full-figure miniature version of the person in the uploaded photo. The Chibi figure should: Since there's no recognizable background or accessories in the final ChatGPT Chibi figure image, the final result is all about how the character looks and dresses. I made a few characters. One based on a photo of me, another based on an image of Brad Pitt, and, finally, one based on one of my heroes, Mr. Rogers. These Chibi figures would do well on the Crunchyroll Mini and Chibi store, but I must admit that they lean heavily on cuteness and not so much on verisimilitude. Even though none of them look quite like the source, the Mr. Rogers one is my favorite. Remember that AI image generation is not without cost. First, you are uploading your photo toOpenAI's server, and there's no guarantee that the system is not learning from it and using it to train future models. AI image generation also consumes electricity on the server side to build models and to resolve prompts. Perhaps you can commit to planting a tree or two after you've generated a half dozen or more Chibi AI figures.

Researchers have discovered a clever and elaborate phishing scheme that abusedGoogle’s services to trick people into giving away theircredentialsfor the platform. Lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service, Nick Johnson, recently received an email that seemed to have come from no-reply@google.com. The email said that law enforcement subpoenaed Google for content found in his Google Account. He said that the email looked legitimate, and that it was very difficult to spot that it’s actually fake. He believes less technical users might very easily fall for the trick.

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) Apparently, the crooks would first create a Google account for me@domain. Then, they would create a Google OAuth app, and put the entire phishing message (about the fake subpoena) in the name field. Then, they would grant themselves access to the email address in Google Workspace. Google would then send a notification email to the me@domain account, but since the phishing message was in the name field, it would cover the entire screen.

The final step is to forward the email to the victim. “Since Google generated the email, it's signed with a valid DKIM key and passes all the checks,” Johnson explained how the emails landed in people’s inbox and not in spam. The attack is called a “DKIM replay phishing attack,” since it leans on the fact that in Google’s systems, DKIM checks only the message and the headers, not the envelope. Since the crooks first registered the me@domain address, Google will show it as if it was delivered to their email address. To hide their intentions even further, the crooks used sites.google.com to create the credential-harvesting landing page.

Windows administrators have been reporting mass account lockouts across various organizations following aMicrosoftEntra ID update. Many believe these were false positives triggered in Entra ID's new leaked credentials detection app (a new feature called MACE Credential Revocation), as affected accounts had unique and unused passwords. One user posted to aReddit threadthat around half a dozen accounts had been blocked after credentials were supposedly found on the dark web, however those users didn’t have much in common, suggesting that it wasn’t a targeted attack. “There are no risky signins, no other risk detections, everyone is MFA, it's literally the only thing that's appeared today, raising the risk on these people from zero to high,” the Reddit user explained. Beneath the original post is a series of comments from other system admins who also experienced similar issues, with one user sharing a response from Microsoft suggesting that the accounts had been erroneously flagged: “On Friday 4/18/25, Microsoft identified that it was internally logging a subset of short-lived user refresh tokens for a small percentage of users, whereas our standard logging process is to only log metadata about such tokens. The internal logging issue was immediately corrected, and the team performed a procedure to invalidate these tokens to protect customers.” The notice sees Microsoft admit to “inadvertently generat[ing] alerts in Entra ID Protection” of supposed compromised credentials between 4AM UTC and 9AM UTC on April 20.

What are the answers for today's NYT Connections groups? Right, the answers are below, so DO NOT SCROLL ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM. The answers to today's Connections, game #681, are… Today’s joke was, of course, GREASE and LIGHTNING. Although I’m sure I wasn’t alone in the words ICE and FIRE triggering a quick search for aGame of Thronesgroup (A Song of Ice and Fire being the title of the unfinished collection of books it is based on). My mistake today came as I was soaring towards a faultless round. Thinking there was a group that was about natural electricity creation I had EEL instead of VOLCANO in what became the purple quartet, NATURAL PRODUCERS OF HEAT. That they produce electricity is one of three things people know about eels, the others being they are slippery and some brave souls enjoy eating them boiled and served in jelly (I am not one of those people, the idea of eating something that is slimy, boney and stringy does not whet my appetite). How did you do today? Let me know in the comments below. NYT Connections is one of several increasingly popular word games made by the New York Times. It challenges you to find groups of four items that share something in common, and each group has a different difficulty level: green is easy, yellow a little harder, blue often quite tough and purple usually very difficult. On the plus side, you don't technically need to solve the final one, as you'll be able to answer that one by a process of elimination. What's more, you can make up to four mistakes, which gives you a little bit of breathing room. It's a little more involved than something like Wordle, however, and there are plenty of opportunities for the game to trip you up with tricks. For instance, watch out for homophones and other word games that could disguise the answers. It's playable for free via theNYT Games siteon desktop or mobile.

Cisco has patched a high-severity vulnerability in its Webexvideo conferencingplatform which allowed threat actors to mount remote code execution (RCE) attacks against exposed endpoints. The bug was discovered in the custom URL parser of a Cisco Webex app and is described as an “insufficient input validation” vulnerability. “An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a crafted meeting invite link and download arbitrary files,” the bug’s NVD page reads. “A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the targeted user.” Get Keeper Personal for just $1.67/month, Keeper Family for just $3.54/month, and Keeper Business for just $7/month ​Keeper is a cybersecurity platform primarily known for its password manager and digital vault, designed to help individuals, families, and businesses securely store and manage passwords, sensitive files, and other private data.

Preferred partner (What does this mean?) The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2024-20236, and was assigned a severity score of 8.8/10 (high). Cisco further explained that the vulnerability is present in all older versions of the product, regardless of the OS it’s running on, or system configurations. The networking giant also said there were no workarounds for the bug, so installing the update is the only way to mitigate the risk. While the most severe, it’s not the only vulnerability Cisco recently addressed. The company also fixed two more flaws, CVE-2025-20178 (6.0/10), and CVE-2025-20150 (5.3/10).

    "title": "5 things the Google Pixel 10 needs to do to beat the Apple iPhone 17 in 2025",
    "article_text": "It's Google vs Apple again When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We're now well into 2025, and two of the biggest flagship phone launches are still to come. I am of course talking about thePixel 10(due in August) and theiPhone 17(due in September) and as someone with extensive experience of handsets from bothGoogleandApple(blame the tech journalism), I've got some thoughts about how the Pixel can get the upper hand this year. When I say the upper hand, I'm not really talking about sales numbers: iPhones andSamsungGalaxy phones are going to win that battle for a good few years yet, at least as far as the US is concerned (globally, the market is a bit more competitive). Instead, I'm going to focus on what would resonate with me, and I suspect a lot of other consumers, too. You'll see we awarded 4 stars out of 5 to the Pixel 9 in ourGoogle Pixel 9 review, while in ourApple iPhone 16 review,we gave Apple's handset 4.5 stars out of 5. That means Apple currently has a slight edge when it comes to these flagship phones, so how can Google catch up this year? TheGoogle Pixel 9amight be easier to lie down on a flat surface, but at what cost? The removal of the iconic Pixel camera bar from the design means the mid-ranger looks rather ordinary and nondescript, lost in a crowd of similar smartphone slabs. In ourGoogle Pixel 9a review, we described it as \"dang ugly\", and so I'm hoping that the big camera bump makes a triumphant return with the Pixel 10. It provides more room for additional camera technology, on top of everything else. The iPhone 17, meanwhile, seems to be having something of an identity crisis – or at least the Pro models are, based onthe leaks we've seen so far. It seems like Apple isn't sure where to go next with the design, so Google could score a win here in terms of aesthetics. It's no secret that the rollout of Apple Intelligence has been badly bungled so far, so much so that Applehas had to go on recordto say it over-promised and under-delivered, which you can be sure was acutely embarrassing for a company of Apple's stature. Google Gemini, meanwhile, is rapidly improving – in the last month or so we've seennew AI modelsthat are smarter than ever, as well as Gemini Live screen and camera sharingroll out for all users– even those who are using Gemini for free. There's a clear winner here already, but Google can't be complacent. Apple engineers will be busy behind the scenes trying to get Siri up to the level of Gemini andChatGPT, and so it makes sense for the Pixel 10 to have yet more AI features baked right into it. Apple's lead in terms of raw processor performance is as clear as its failings in AI: if we're talking solely about CPU speed, the A18 and A18 Pro chips inside the iPhone 16 series beat the Tensor G4 chip you'll find inside the Pixel 9 phones. That doesn't mean the Pixel 9 is in any way slow or laggy, but it's something that Google needs to address if it wants to fully catch up with Apple. When it comes to gaming, video editing, or just jumping between apps, performance matters. Unfortunately for mobile enthusiasts,the leaks to datesuggest the Tensor G5 isn't going to be a huge leap forward from the Tensor G4 in terms of performance. I'm hoping that as Google gets better at designing its own chips, we'll see a bigger upgrade here. If you're of a certain age, you may remember handsets like theGoogle Nexus 5andGoogle Nexus 6, which managed to combine flagship specs with mid-range pricing. Google was essentially doing the OnePlus trick before OnePlus got started. As the Nexus series has given way to the Pixel series, that value-for-money aspect has disappeared – although the 'a' phones have taken up some of the slack. The Pixel 9 starts at $799 / £799 / AU$1,349, while the iPhone 16 starts at $799 / £799 / AU$1,399. You'll notice those prices for the 128GB models are identical, except for Australia, and if Google was able to shave off a little from the cost of the Pixel 10, it would help it stand up better against the iPhone 17 – and bring back memories of the Nexus phones. Smartphones seem stuck as far as battery life goes, with most handsets on the market lasting a full day of general use, so an overnight charge is always required to get through a substantial amount of a second day. Could Google change this with the Pixel 10? It depends on the efficiency improvements it manages with the Tensor G5 chip, and also on any power-saving features that arrive withAndroid 16(which should be out before the Pixel 10 phones). Comfortably managing two days of battery life between charges would set the Pixel 10 apart from the iPhone 17 and just about every other phone available right now.

ASUS has released a fix for a critical-severity vulnerability affectingrouterswith AiCloud enabled which could allow threat actors to execute functions on the exposed devices remotely and without authorization.

Users can then access, stream, sync, and share files stored on USB drives connected to the router from anywhere with an internet connection. The flaw was found in firmware versions released after February 2025, meaning: 3.0.0.4_382, 3.0.0.4_386, 3.0.0.4_388, and 3.0.0.6_102. According toCyberInsider, such features “often become attractive targets” for threat actors, since they are exposing sensitive data to the internet. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Therefore, it would be wise not to delay deploying the patch. Depending on the model, there are different firmware versions that can be downloaded directly from the ASUS website. The flaw also affects a few devices that reached end-of-life, which should now have AiCloud entirely disabled. Internet access for WAN should also be disabled, as well as port forwarding, DDNS, VPN server, DMZ, port triggering, and FTP services. The company did not say if the flaw is being abused in the wild or not, but at press time, it was not added to CISA’s KEV, which is usually a good litmus paper for actively exploited flaws. According toBleepingComputer, the critical CVSS rating “implies the exploitation could have a significant impact.” ASUS also told its users to use unique, strong passwords to secure their wireless networks and router administration pages. That means making passwords at least 10 characters long, and making them a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

    "article_text": "Pope Francis died from a stroke followed by heart failure, the Vatican has confirmed, outlining the health complications that led to the pontiff’s passing at age 88 on Easter Monday. The Holy See announced that Francis died at 7:35am on April 21 at his residence in Casa Santa Marta, Vatican City. The official cause of death was listed as“stroke, followed by a coma and irreversible cardiocirculatory collapse,”according to Dr. Andrea Arcangeli, Director of the Directorate of Health and Hygiene of the Vatican City State. “I hereby declare… that the causes of death, to the best of my knowledge and judgment, are as stated above,”Dr. Arcangeliwrotein the official death certificate released on Monday evening. The Vatican’s statement also noted that the Pope had been suffering from multiple chronic conditions, including bilateral pneumonia, bronchiectasis, arterial hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Francis had recently been hospitalized for 38 days due to double pneumonia, during which he faced a life-threatening health crisis that reportedly led doctors to consider palliative measures. Despite his declining health, Pope Francis made a final public appearance on Easter Sunday, April 20, greeting crowds during the Holy Mass at St. Peter’s Square. Although his traditional Easter address was delivered by a member of the clergy, the Pope rose from his wheelchair and waved to the cheering crowd from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica, saying:“Dear brothers and sisters, happy Easter.” “As I sense that the twilight of my earthly life is approaching, and with firm hope in Eternal Life, I wish to express my final wishes regarding my burial place,”the pontiff wrote in his final testament, which was released by the Vatican.“May the Lord grant the deserved reward to those who have wished me well and will continue to pray for me. The suffering that marked the final part of my life, I offer to the Lord, for peace in the world and brotherhood among peoples.” In accordance with his wishes, Francis will be buried in a modest tomb at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome, diverging from the traditional papal burial at St. Peter’s Basilica. His spiritual testament specified a simple burial“in the ground; simple, without particular ornamentation, and bearing only the inscription: Franciscus.” The Vatican has announced that the Pope’s body will lie in state at St. Peter’s Basilica beginning Wednesday, allowing the public to pay their respects. Cardinals are expected to convene on Tuesday to determine the date of the funeral, which traditionally takes place between four and six days after a pope’s death. Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, was elected in March 2013 as the first Jesuit and the first Latin American pope. His 12-year papacy was marked by a focus on humility, social justice, and interfaith dialogue. He was widely known for his advocacy for the poor, environmental stewardship, and efforts to reform the Catholic Church.",

    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump has stifled almost every channel of diplomatic outreach with China, aiming to deal directly with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, as the trade war between the two superpowers escalates, Politico has reported citing anonymous sources. The increasing tit-for-tat duties between the US and China is part of a broader US tariff campaign against more than 90 countries, said to be aimed at addressing unfair trade imbalances. While Trump has paused the hikes for most countries for 90 days, Beijing was excluded and faces a 145% tariff. China has retaliated with 125% tariffs on US goods and restricted certain key exports. The US president is adamant about direct negotiations with Xi, and has stifled other diplomatic avenues, Politico wrote on Saturday, citing anonymous former US State Department officials and an industry official. Trump has not authorized White House delegates to engage with Beijing, the outlet cited its sources as saying. In addition, the Senate has not confirmed a US ambassador to China, Trump has not nominated an official to lead a diplomatic effort, and Washington has thus far not reached out to the Chinese embassy, Politico reported. “The backchannels don’t work because President Trump doesn’t want them to,”Ryan Hass, former director for China, Taiwan, and Mongolia at the National Security Council during the Obama administration, told the outlet. “Trump wants to deal directly with President Xi in the same way he has with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin,”he said. Washington is waiting for Beijing to reach out and call first, CNN wrote earlier this month, citing anonymous officials. “China wants to make a deal. They just don’t know how quite to go about it,”Trump has said.“They’re proud people.” Additionally, Washington intends to use negotiations over potential tariff exemptions to pressure US trading partners to curb their ties with China and ramp up pressure on Beijing, the Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing unnamed sources. In a statement on Monday, the Chinese Commerce Ministry stressed that it would retaliate against any country that takes such a deal“at the expense of China’s interests.”",

    "title": "UK to boost explosives production – The Times",
    "article_text": "The UK will sharply boost explosives production to reduce dependence on the US, The Times reported on Sunday. The outlet cited a growing concern over the reliability of American military support. According to the report, shipping containers will be deployed across the UK to manufacture RDX, a key explosive used in 155mm artillery rounds and other British weapons. BAE Systems, Britain’s only producer of the rounds, also plans to build three new sites to improve the system’s resilience, according to Steve Cardew, business development director at BAE’s Maritime and Land Defence Solutions. “One large facility is clearly a big security threat. If you have dispersed facilities, it is much more secure,”Cardew told the outlet. Traditionally, RDX has been made in large, inefficient plants. Cardew said the container-based model would be faster, cheaper, and more efficient, with each unit capable of producing up to 100 tonnes annually. He said the ramp-up was essential“to effectively match Russia and other hostile nations,”adding that rising global demand had“forced”BAE to speed up production. The report noted the UK had supplied much of its 155mm ammunition to Ukraine as part of its multi-billion-pound military assistance. It also cited US President Donald Trump’s unpredictable foreign policy – including tariffs and a temporary halt to military and intelligence aid to Kiev – as a reason the UK and EU are increasingly wary of relying on American weapons. Tensions between Washington and European NATO members have been growing over Trump’s push for a swift resolution to the Ukraine conflict and plans to transfer more security responsibility to Europe once a truce is in place. He has repeatedly called on European NATO members to invest more in their militaries, arguing the US bears too much of the burden. Currently, 155mm rounds made with US-sourced explosives are subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulations (Itar), restricting their use and resale without US approval. Cardew said BAE, which previously imported RDX from the US and France, will be able to market its own ‘Itar-free’ products globally once local production ramps up. The company aims for a 16-fold increase in 155mm rounds when its new plant in south Wales opens this summer. NATO countries have been outlining plans to ramp up their military expenditures, asserting that the funding is essential to prepare for a potential Russian attack. Moscow has denied any aggressive intentions, with President Vladimir Putin describing the speculation as“complete nonsense.” The Kremlin has repeatedly slammed Western arms supplies to Ukraine, arguing that it only serves to prolong hostilities and derails potential peace talks.",

    "article_text": "The Sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, is planning a visit to Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. This visit carries particular significance against the backdrop of a new phase in nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States, in which Oman is once again playing the role of mediator. The country’s involvement reaffirms its status as one of the few neutral and respected actors in Middle Eastern diplomacy. Historically, Oman has repeatedly demonstrated a unique ability to serve as a reliable and impartial intermediary in international conflicts – especially in the complex and sensitive context of US-Iran relations. Thanks to its balanced foreign policy, non-interference doctrine, and ability to maintain the trust of adversarial parties, Muscat has become an indispensable channel for confidential diplomacy in the Persian Gulf region. Perhaps the most prominent example of this role came in 2013, when Oman hosted secret direct talks between the US and Iran. At the time, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, renowned for his personal commitment to peacebuilding, provided a discreet venue for initiating dialogue between the two sides. These meetings, conducted under strict confidentiality, proved to be a turning point and laid the groundwork for subsequent multilateral negotiations that ultimately led to the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA, colloquially known as the Iran Nuclear Deal) – widely regarded as one of the most significant achievements in international diplomacy in the past decade. Analysts atChristian Science MonitorandForeign Policyreferred to Sultan Qaboos as“the architect of backchannel diplomacy,”without whom the deal in its final form would likely have been impossible. Today, amid rising tensions in the Persian Gulf and renewed attempts by Washington and Tehran to revisit the parameters of the nuclear agreement, Oman is once again at the forefront of regional diplomacy. From 2023 to 2025, Muscat hosted a series of closed-door, indirect meetings between Iranian and American representatives, as confirmed by sources within Iran’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and unnamed US officials. These consultations, facilitated by Oman, allowed the parties to discuss mechanisms for limiting Iran’s nuclear program, the phased lifting of sanctions, and maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz. According to reports from WANA News Agency andMiddle East Eye, Oman has been actively advancing its own diplomatic proposals, including the establishment of a contact group and a neutral verification mechanism. It has also put forward the idea of a regional dialogue on security and energy stability. Through these efforts, Muscat is positioning itself not merely as a mediator, but as a key architect in shaping a new security framework for the Persian Gulf. What sets Oman’s approach apart is its lack of aggressive ambition, its consistent multi-vector diplomacy, and its ability to combine discreet backchannel efforts with open support for peaceful initiatives. Unlike most states in the region, Muscat maintains working relationships with both Washington and Tehran, avoids one-sided political alliances, and leverages its neutrality in favor of dialogue. This makes Oman an especially valuable partner in the eyes of the international community, which seeks to avert direct confrontation between two long-standing geopolitical rivals. Oman’s role in these negotiations goes beyond technical mediation – it is strategic in nature. Omani diplomacy aims not only to ease tensions but to establish a sustainable foundation for regional balance. Amid ongoing geopolitical turbulence, Muscat offers a model of“quiet strength,”grounded in dialogue, diplomatic flexibility, and strategic patience. Thus, Oman’s efforts to revive the US-Iran dialogue reaffirm its status as a unique and indispensable mediator in the Middle East. The Sultanate once again demonstrates that even a relatively small state can play a crucial role in global affairs – provided it possesses trust, a solid reputation, and the ability to listen to all sides of a conflict. Oman’s diplomatic activity strengthens its position not only as a regional moderator but also as a key international partner capable of playing a constructive role in addressing global challenges. Over the past two years, bilateral relations between the Sultanate of Oman and the Russian Federation have significantly deepened, reaching the level of strategic importance. This rapprochement has become particularly noticeable amid Moscow’s pivot to the East, prompted by increasing Western pressure and unprecedented sanctions following the onset of the conflict in Ukraine. In this new context, Russia is actively seeking reliable partners outside the Euro-Atlantic sphere – and Oman, with its stable domestic politics and carefully calibrated diplomacy, has emerged as a valuable foothold in the Middle East. For Moscow, the Sultanate represents not only a promising economic partner but also a key political asset that contributes to regional balance and security in the Persian Gulf. Oman’s stance is traditionally characterized by moderation and a refusal to engage in confrontational alliances – qualities that make Muscat a trusted and respected intermediary on both regional and international issues. For its part, Muscat views the strengthening of ties with Russia as an essential component of its multi-vector foreign policy, which emphasizes maximum flexibility and autonomy. This approach is particularly relevant in an era of growing instability in the Middle East and deepening polarization in international affairs. Despite its historically close ties with the US and the UK, Oman is increasingly charting an independent course. The influence of Western powers in the Sultanate has gradually waned – a trend that became especially apparent after the launch of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza in October 2023. Western support for those actions, particularly from the US and several European nations, sparked public outrage in Oman and intensified domestic calls for a reassessment of the country’s traditional foreign policy priorities. An additional factor driving Oman’s gradual shift away from its traditional dependence on the West is the country’s active expansion of cooperation with emerging global powers – particularly China and India. These nations are not only increasing their economic and energy footprint in the region but are also expanding military cooperation through joint exercises and security initiatives. This multipolar orientation enables Muscat to strengthen its bargaining position while minimizing the risks associated with alignment to a single geopolitical axis. Oman has long pursued an independent foreign policy, carefully balancing relations with leading regional and global powers. Muscat seeks to build relationships founded on mutual respect, non-interference, and shared benefit – qualities that make it a vital mediator and diplomatic platform in some of the world’s most complex international conflicts. Adhering to the principle of“friendly neutrality,”Oman remains open to dialogue with all sides: its territory hosts both British and Chinese military facilities, and in recent years, joint exercises have been conducted with the armed forces of the US, China, Iran, and Russia. Until recently, Oman also maintained discreet lines of communication with Israel, though Muscat refrains from publicizing such contacts – especially amid rising tensions in the region. At the same time, the Sultanate remains firmly committed to its policy of non-intervention and abstention from military coalitions. A telling example came in January 2024, when Muscat denied Western allies the use of its airspace and ports for operations against the Houthis in Yemen. Despite allegations of indirectly facilitating arms transfers, Omani authorities maintained a calm and measured stance, emphasizing that their priority remains regional peace and stability – not entanglement in geopolitical rivalries. Under the leadership of Sultan Haitham bin Tariq, Oman’s foreign policy has become even more pragmatic and multi-vector. The Sultanate’s leadership stresses the importance of developing diversified economic and diplomatic partnerships, especially with Eastern powers such as Russia, China, and Iran. This direction is complemented by efforts to strengthen ties with regional partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – particularly Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar. Such an approach enables Muscat to maintain resilience amid rising instability, competition, and polarization on the international stage. In the context of the war in Ukraine, Oman has maintained a position of restraint, advocating for a diplomatic resolution while refraining from public support for either side. In an interview withLe Figaro, Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad Al-Busaidi emphasized that Muscat avoids accusatory rhetoric, stating,“Accusations rarely contribute to peace.”Instead, Omani diplomacy focuses on mediation and dialogue. Demonstrating its independent stance, the Sultanate declined to participate in the 2024“peace summit”on Ukraine held in Switzerland, once again affirming its neutral yet active position. The growing importance of Russia-Oman relations became especially evident in 2023–2024, as political and economic contacts between the two countries reached unprecedented levels. In May 2023, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov visited Oman for the first time in seven years, holding talks on key issues of regional security and bilateral cooperation. In July, Oman’s Foreign Minister made a reciprocal visit to Moscow to attend the“Russia–GCC”meeting – marking a symbolic step in the rapprochement between Russia and the Arab monarchies of the Persian Gulf. In September, Muscat hosted a high-level Russian delegation led by Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, which included representatives from Rosatom, the Central Bank, and Russian security and energy agencies – signaling serious plans to deepen cooperation in critical sectors. In December 2023, Crown Prince and Minister of Sports Dhi Yazan bin Haitham Al Said visited Moscow, where he held talks with Putin and discussed youth and cultural exchange initiatives. In 2024, Russia also welcomed the Chairman of Oman’s State Council, Abdulmalik Al-Khalili, and the Speaker of the Consultative Council, Khalid bin Hilal Al-Maawali – underscoring Oman’s interest in institutionalizing inter-parliamentary dialogue and expanding political cooperation. Oman’s participation as a guest of honor at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, with one of the largest delegations, symbolized the growing strategic significance of the bilateral partnership. All of this reflects the shared ambition of Muscat and Moscow to build not merely ad hoc cooperation, but durable and stable relations based on mutual respect, pragmatism, and the joint pursuit of an alternative framework for international engagement in an era of global transformation. In recent years, economic cooperation between Russia and Oman has shown steady positive momentum, reaching a qualitatively new level and increasingly taking on the features of a strategic partnership. This collaboration aligns with the broader trend of Russia’s pivot to the East in its foreign economic policy and its effort to expand ties with key players in the Persian Gulf. Amid growing global instability and sanctions pressure, Moscow and Muscat are prioritizing a stable and mutually beneficial economic convergence, supported by practical initiatives and high-level engagement. Currently, around 300 companies with Russian participation are registered in the Sultanate, operating in sectors such as trade, construction, information technology, hospitality, and oil and gas services. Particularly notable is the rising interest from Russian small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) seeking new markets and alternative logistics routes. A significant milestone in 2023 was the visit of a delegation of 39 Russian companies, organized by the Russian Export Center. The visit resulted in the signing of several preliminary agreements in areas such as food supplies, mechanical engineering, and medical technologies, as well as the launch of joint investment project discussions in Oman’s free economic zones. By the end of 2024, Oman had secured its position as one of Russia’s fastest-growing trade partners in the Arab world. Bilateral trade reached $350 million, more than doubling compared to the previous three years. The trade portfolio includes Omani exports of fertilizers, petrochemical products, and aluminum, while Russia supplies food products, timber, metals, machinery, and chemical goods. Logistics cooperation is also gaining momentum – with new container shipping routes between Omani ports and southern Russia beginning to form alternative supply chains that bypass unstable transit regions. For the first time in 2023, official data on mutual investments was released. According to the Russian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, total investments amounted to $90 million – indicating the emergence of a stable financial and investment platform. Priority areas include agro-industrial development, green energy, digital technologies, infrastructure, and logistics. Plans are also underway to establish a joint investment fund and explore settlement mechanisms in national currencies using digital solutions, including cryptographically secured platforms – particularly relevant amid restrictions on dollar-based transactions. Tourism is developing particularly dynamically, as one of the most flexible and rapidly scalable sectors of cooperation. In 2024, approximately 11,000 Omani tourists visited Russia, while the number of Russian citizens choosing the Sultanate as a travel destination reached a record 44,000. Oman’s active promotion on the Russian market as a“premium Eastern destination”is supported by improved infrastructure, the introduction of electronic visas, and the launch of new Oman Air routes, including flights to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Sochi. Russia–Oman cooperation holds vast potential across several strategic areas. Trade and investment remain key sectors, with a focus on the complementarity of export and import profiles – ranging from food and seafood to chemical, medical, and pharmaceutical products. Cooperation in the oil and gas sector extends beyond raw material exchange: joint geological exploration projects, the localization of service operations, and the implementation of digital solutions in extraction and processing are actively under discussion. Further areas of development include energy efficiency, water purification, waste management, and environmental protection – particularly within the framework of a shared climate agenda. Education, science, and innovation also represent promising avenues of collaboration. Negotiations are underway to establish joint research centers and facilitate exchanges of students, faculty, and experts in petrochemicals, IT, medicine, and engineering. Topics under discussion include the mutual recognition of academic degrees, dual-degree programs, and joint startup incubators. The fields of digitalization and fintech deserve special attention. Oman has shown keen interest in Russian technologies related to cybersecurity, blockchain, digital identity, and cashless payment systems. At the same time, Russian banks and financial institutions view Oman as a promising platform for piloting and deploying new tools, thanks to the region’s favorable regulatory environment and geoeconomic flexibility. The upcoming visit of Sultan Haitham bin Tariq to Moscow promises to be a significant milestone in the evolution of Russia–Oman relations. It will reflect not only the high level of mutual trust and political understanding already achieved but also open new horizons for strategic convergence. Amid a profound transformation of the global order, Muscat and Moscow are demonstrating a shared commitment to building a sustainable, multidimensional partnership based on respect for sovereignty, pragmatism, and mutual benefit. In this context, Oman emerges not merely as an important regional player, but as a full-fledged ally in the shaping of a multipolar world – a country with which Russia envisions long-term political, economic, and humanitarian priorities.",

    "title": "California mayor proposes tackling homelessness with fentanyl – media",
    "article_text": "A mayor in Southern California is facing a backlash after suggesting the city of Lancaster could address homelessness by providing vagrants with“all the fentanyl they want,”according to the Los Angeles Times. The US has been grappling with a severe opioid crisis. Originally developed for severe pain management, fentanyl is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl has flooded the US drug market, and more than 74,000 Americans died in 2023 from drug mixtures containing the substance, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly double the total number of motor vehicle fatalities tallied that year and over three times the number of reported homicides. Mayor Rex Parris of Lancaster, California sparked controversy during a February city council meeting after a resident criticized the city’s plan to deal with homelessness by confining them to an abandoned golf course near a residential area, the outlet said on Sunday. According to footage from the meeting, Parris interrupted the woman’s remarks, saying,“what I want to do is give them free fentanyl.” “I mean, that’s what I want to do. I want to give them all the fentanyl they want.” The startled resident responded to the Republican mayor, saying his comment“was not kind.” Parris, who has served as mayor since 2008, told FOX LA on Friday that he has no“regrets”about his remarks. He clarified that he was referring specifically to unhoused individuals involved in criminal activity who“refuse”assistance, and reiterated his stance on providing them with the highly addictive and often deadly opioid. “I made it very clear I was talking about the criminal element that were let out of the prisons that have now become 40 to 45% of what’s referred to as the homeless population,”Parris told the outlet. “They are responsible for most of our robberies, most of our rapes, and at least half of our murders,”he added, without providing any evidence or data to support his claims. Parris went on to say he hadn’t thought anyone would take his comments“literally,”claiming that fentanyl is“so easy”to obtain on the streets that offering it for free wouldn’t make any difference. “Quite frankly, I wish that the president would give us a purge. Because we do need to purge these people,”Parris concluded. In 2013, the Lancaster mayor made headlines for proposing building a Buddhist temple to attract Chinese investment. In 2018, he drew attention again with a push to ban neckties from workplace, citing studies linking them to reduced blood flow to the brain.",

    "title": "Pentagon slams ‘Trump-hating’ NYT over Hegseth chat claim",
    "article_text": "The Pentagon has rejected a New York Times (NYT) report that US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth shared detailed information about American strikes on Houthi fighters in Yemen with his wife and brother via a secret chat on the Signal messaging app. Hegseth was among the key figures in the so-called ‘Signalgate’ scandal, which erupted in late March after the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine, Jeffrey Goldberg, accessed a group chat on Signal in which senior members of the administration of US President Donald Trump discussed the strikes in Yemen. The NYT reported on Sunday that the defense secretary had a second private chat group on the app, which included his wife, Jennifer Rauchet Hegseth, his brother, his lawyer, and a dozen other people from his inner circle. According to the paper's sources, Hegseth posted flight schedules for the F/A-18 Hornets targeting the Houthis in both groups on March 18. In a post on X on Monday, chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell accused the NYT of trying to bring the ‘Signalgate’ story“back from the dead.” “The Trump-hating media continues to be obsessed with destroying anyone committed to President Trump’s agenda,”he said. The spokesman insisted that“the New York Times – and all other Fake News that repeat their garbage – are enthusiastically taking the grievances of disgruntled former employees as the sole sources for their article.” “They relied only on the words of people who were fired this week and appear to have a motive to sabotage the Secretary and the President’s agenda,”Parnell added. He stressed that“there was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story.” Senior Democratic Party members demanded Hegseth’s resignation following the NYT report. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer wrote on X that“we keep learning how Pete Hegseth put lives at risk. Trump is still too weak to fire him. Pete Hegseth must be fired.” Senator Tammy Duckworth of Illinois asked:“How many times does Pete Hegseth need to leak classified intelligence before Donald Trump and Republicans understand that he is not only a f***ing liar, he is a threat to our national security?” The Democrats made similar calls when the ‘Signalgate’ scandal first broke, although Trump refused to dismiss Hegseth or National Security Adviser Mike Waltz, who had mistakenly added Goldberg to the Signal group chat.“I do not fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,”Trump stated.",

    "title": "Trump wants Europe’s largest nuclear plant – WSJ",
    "article_text": "The US intends to assert control over the Russian territory surrounding Europe’s largest nuclear power plant as part of a mediated agreement between Kiev and Moscow, according to the Wall Street Journal. The proposal is part of areportedpackage of options that the US expects Ukraine to respond to by the end of this week. Last Thursday, senior members of US President Donald Trump’s administration met with Ukrainian and European officials in Paris. One of their ideas aimed at facilitating a peace agreement between Kiev and Moscow involves designating the land around theZaporozhyenuclear power plant (NPP) as neutral territory under US control, the newspaper reported Sunday, citing anonymous sources. The former Ukrainian region hosting the facility voted to join Russia in 2022, though Kiev has dismissed the referendum as a sham. In March, Trump claimed that Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky had proposed that the US take ownership of his country’s nuclear power plants. Zelensky, however,refutedthis assertion, stating that he and Trump only discussed potential US investments in the Zaporozhye NPP. Additionally, Washington has suggested recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea, not opposing Russian control over four other former Ukrainian regions, including Zaporozhye, and rejecting Ukraine's bid for NATO membership, according to the WSJ. However, the list of proposals does not include any cap on the strength of the Ukrainian army or ban on troop deployments by European NATO members in Ukraine, the newspaper noted. If the US, its European allies, and Ukraine achieve a“convergence”this week, the package will be presented to Moscow, the WSJ reported. Moscow has firmly rejected any proposed NATO presence in Ukraine and has asserted that the Istanbul agreement — a truce proposal negotiated in 2022 that includes limitations on the Ukrainian military — should serve as the foundation for a future peace accord. This plan was rejected by Kiev following intervention from then-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Russia has accused the EU and the UK of attempting to undermine Trump’s mediation efforts in order to prolong the conflict in Ukraine. The US president has cautioned that his administration would“just take a pass”if the diplomatic effort becomes too challenging.",

    "title": "Chinese envoy calls Trump tariffs an ‘echo of Great Depression’",
    "article_text": "China’s envoy to the US has urged Washington to avoid the mistakes that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s and called for peaceful coexistence, while warning that Beijing is ready to retaliate amid the escalating trade war. The tariff standoff with Beijing comes amid a broader US campaign targeting dozens of countries. While most of the elevated tariffs were paused for 90 days, China was excluded from the reprieve. The total tariff on Chinese goods has been hiked to 145%. In response, Beijing imposed 125% tariffs on imports of American goods and restricted exports of minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing. Speaking at a Traditional Chinese Medicine event in Washington on Saturday, Ambassador Xie Feng warned that the import duties could upend the global economy, drawing a parallel to the US tariff policies of 1930 that contributed to the Great Depression, according to the Chinese embassy’s website. Referring to principles from traditional Chinese medicine, he said it’s important to tackle root causes rather than merely treating symptoms and called for joint efforts to expand the global economy instead of competing over existing resources. “You can’t just treat a headache by just focusing on the head, or foot pain by only targeting the feet,”Xie said.“And you certainly shouldn’t prescribe medicine to others when you’re the one who’s sick.” He cited US protectionist policies of the past – particularly the tariff-laden Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which is widely believed to have deepened the Great Depression. The act, aimed at protecting American agriculture and manufacturing with import duties of up to 75% on essentials such as car parts and wool, triggered a sharp decline in global trade that worsened the Great Depression. “I believe many of you are familiar with how the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act ultimately escalated the Great Depression,”the envoy said. Citing philosophy, he pointed to the need for balancing the opposing forces of yin and yang and said that harmony should be the guiding principle in relations between the world’s two largest economies. He said that the two nations should pursue“peaceful coexistence”rather than confrontation, and support each other’s success instead of falling into a lose-lose scenario. Xie stated that China opposes the trade war and will respond with retaliation against any country that imposes tariffs on it. Last week, US President Donald Trump said that talks were underway with Chinese officials, noting that Washington has“nice conversations going with China. It’s, like, really very good.”",

    "title": "Pope Francis dies",
    "article_text": "The head of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis, has died at the age of 88, the Vatican has announced. Francis began his papacy in March 2013 and was the first pontiff from Latin America. “At 7:35 this morning, the Bishop of Rome, Francis, returned to the home of the Father. His entire life was dedicated to the service of the Lord and of his Church,″Cardinal Kevin Farrell, the Vatican camerlengo, said in a statement on Monday morning. Pope Francis“taught us to live the values of the Gospel with faithfulness, courage, and universal love, especially for the poorest and most marginalized,”Farrell wrote. “With immense gratitude for his example as a true disciple of the Lord Jesus, we commend the soul of Pope Francis to the infinite, merciful love of God, One and Tribune,″the cardinal added. Pope Francis was last seen in public on Easter Sunday when he attended the Holy Mass at St. Peter’s Square in the Vatican. His traditional Easter address was delivered by a member of the clergy due to the pontiff’s poor health. Afterwards, the Pope got out of his wheelchair and waved to the cheering crowd from the balcony of St. Peter’s Basilica, saying:“Dear brothers and sisters, happy Easter.” Earlier on Sunday, the head of the Catholic Church held a meeting with US Vice President J.D. Vance during which he reportedly“lectured”Vance on compassion. Pope Francis had been discharged from hospital in March after five weeks of treatment for an infection that led to him contracting double pneumonia. The pontiff was born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, in 1936. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in the late 1960s, and became the archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998. He was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 2001. During his 12-year papacy, Francis positioned himself as a critic of capitalism and globalization and a defender of the poor and disadvantaged. He criticized extravagance and privilege within the Vatican, calling on cardinals and priests to show humility. The pontiff also repeatedly urged the international community to implement reforms to tackle climate change and labeled the possession of nuclear weapons“immoral.” His attempts to make the Catholic Church more inclusive caused controversy, with the Pope saying in 2023 that“being homosexual is not a crime.”Earlier this year, Francis allowed gay men to become priests in Italy. He also prompted women to more important, decision-making roles within the Сhurch. Pope Francis also attempted to address the issue of child sex abuse by Catholic clerics, although there are contradicting views on how successful his efforts were. He worked towards improving relations between the Catholic Church and other religious denominations, visiting the Arabian Peninsula and Iraq as well as meeting with Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill in 2016, in the first such event of its kind.",

    "title": "Israel cancels visas for pro-Palestine French MPs",
    "article_text": "Israel has revoked entry visas for left-wing French lawmakers who supported the recognition of a Palestinian state. The move comes shortly after French President Emmanuel Macron said recognition could take place at an international conference in June – a proposal condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a“huge reward for terrorism.” The group of 27 politicians included members of France’s Ecologist and Communist parties, along with local officials and mayors. Among them were National Assembly deputies Francois Ruffin, Alexis Corbiere, and Julie Ozenne from the Ecologist party, Communist deputy Soumya Bourouaha, and Communist Senator Marianne Margate. The politicians said on Sunday that they were invited by the French consulate in Jerusalem for a five-day trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories, described as a mission to“strengthen international cooperation and the culture of peace.” “For the first time, two days before our departure, the Israeli authorities canceled our entry visas that had been approved one month ago,”the lawmakers said in their statement, calling the decision“collective punishment.” They described the visa ban as a“major rupture in diplomatic ties”and urged Macron to respond. “Deliberately preventing elected officials and parliamentarians from traveling cannot be without consequences,”they added. The group said their parties had for decades called for recognition of a Palestinian state. Israel’s Interior Ministry defended the cancelation, citing a law that allows authorities to deny entry to individuals who“could act against the State of Israel.” Tensions with Western lawmakers have intensified in recent months amid mounting criticism of Israel’s military campaign against Hamas in Gaza. Earlier in April, two British MPs were blocked from entering the country after being accused of planning to“spread hate speech.”Israeli authorities claimed the pair had misrepresented their purpose, while the UK Foreign Office described the decision as“unacceptable.” Prior to that, an EU parliamentary delegation canceled a planned visit to Jerusalem and Ramallah after entry was denied to French MP Rima Hassan, Irish MP Lynn Boylan, and two EU staffers. Israeli officials said the individuals had“consistently worked to promote boycotts against Israel in addition to numerous public statements both on social media and in media interviews.” “The State of Israel is not obligated to allow the entry of any official from a foreign country, including members of parliament, if they work to boycott and undermine its legitimacy,”Diaspora Affairs Minister Amichai Chikli said at the time.",

    "article_text": "Thousands of transgender people and activists came out to protest in London after Britain’s top court ruled that biological sex defines a woman under the Equality Act. The verdict effectively excluded trans individuals, including those holding a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC), from the anti-discrimination legislation passed in 2010. On Saturday, the activists gathered in Parliament Square, holding signs that said“Trans women are women”and rejecting the ruling as“transphobic.” According to police, seven statues were vandalized, including a monument to feminist writer and women’s voting rights campaigner Millicent Fawcett.

A spokesperson for Women and Equalities Minister Bridget Phillipson said she“utterly condemns the appalling defacement”of the statue of Fawcett. London trans rights protest no arrestspic.twitter.com/j9fmqi0vnP On Wednesday, the UK Supreme Court ruled that the terms ‘woman’ and ‘sex’ in the Equality Act refer to“a biological woman and biological sex”instead of“certificated sex.” According to the BBC, the judges argued that interpreting sex as“certificated”rather than“biological”would“cut across the definitions of man and woman and thus the protected characteristic of sex in an incoherent way.” The conservative group For Women Scotland, which brought the case before the court, praised the decision.“Sex is real and women can now feel safe that services and spaces designated for women are for women,”said Susan Smith, the group’s co-founder. LGBTQ rights advocates condemned the ruling, with activist group Stonewall saying that it would have“widespread and harmful implications for our communities.”",

Its stretchy fabric helps to free your movements so you're able to get that good swing going, and the contrast color offers a pop of intrigue in an otherwise underwhelming show out at the green. Sunspel Sunspel This is James Bond's polo (seriously—it was designed for Daniel Craig's stint as 007), so if it's able to handle galavanting across Europe while under attack, it's surely enough to handle the back nine. The Riviera is made using extra-long staple Supima cotton, which is about as premium as you can get, making it super soft and luxurious. Its mesh construction means that despite its long-sleeve configuration, you won't overheat and you can feel the cool breeze of every gust of wind. Do note that this polo fits pretty slim, so size up so you're not restricted when you go for your swing. Metalwood Studio Metalwood Studio Golfing's not just for dads, grandpas, and elites who live in the suburbs. As a new wave of folks discover the love of the game, Metalwood's around to outfit the cool kids on the green. This jersey-inspired polo feels like it'd be a little more at place on the soccer field than on a golf cart. But hey, it has a collar so you shouldn't have any problems getting past the uppity course manager's desk, and you'll stick out on the course for all the right reasons. Lululemon Lululemon Golfing is a sweaty sport, and anyone who doesn't think that has never touched a golf club in their life. This Lululemon polo is the top you'll want to wear to avoid baking in the sun because of its ability to mask the presence of sweat while actually keeping you cool. Its moisture-wicking abilities help you avoid the feeling of having to exist in a damp top, and it's incredibly stretchy, because Lululemon knows how to utilize elastane to its utmost potential. Sun Day Red Sun Day Red If Tiger Woods wants to sell you a golf polo, then of course you'd buy it from the GOAT of the sport. Sun Day Red will have you dressing like Tiger (though not necessarily playing like him), especially if you opt for the Icon polo, which he designed from top (the button placement) to bottom (the range of colors). Devereux Devereux Everyone's incorporating a little bit of cowboy/western style into their fits, and apparently that's applying to golf attire. Devereux, which blends sportswear with streetwear, crafted this polo to have a few hints of western styling—like the front piping and pearl snap buttons—that makes us wonder ifcowboy bootsmake decentgolf shoes(probably not). Style bona fides aside, the shirt is made from moisture-wicking polyester pique so you can look cool and actuallybecool. Bogey Boys Bogey Boys Cigarettes, flat caps, and up-to-your-pecs trousers—bring back that era of golfing style and let's never deal with technical fabrics again. Bogey Boys, founded by Macklemore (of “Thrift Shop” fame), is all about bringing back an era of ‘70s sexed-up golfing style, which is encapsulated in this French terry number that gives it a slight velour feel without being overly stuffy or warming. A contrast color and piping around the shirt give it even more of a vibrant pop, all of which makes this a top you’d want to wear off the putting green as well. Malbon Malbon In the pastwe've saidthat Malbon Golf “feels like the independent golf brand most poised to become a future standby,” and years later we feel as if the brand has only solidified our stance. Its performance polo has all you'd want from a piece of athleticwear while looking stylish all thanks to thoughtful design flourishes and the help of a chic mascot. Radmor Radmor Radmor's Douglas polo is basically the quintessential golf polo: simple and stylish, while helping to improve your overall golf game. It has a UPF rating of 35 to protect you from the sun, and it's been designed for a greater range of motion to really help you nail your swing. Rhone Rhone Johnny collars are hot in polos right now, and Rhone took a cue from the style folks to design the Links golf polo, so you can spend less time fumbling with buttons and more time teeing up. Reigning Champ Reigning Champ Stretchy cooling is the name of the game for this Reigning Champ polo, which takes advantage of the brand's ability to design well-fitting tops while high-performing fabrics make sure you're performing at your peak. Material: Golf polos, like any tops, can be made from a wide array of materials. Cotton is a big one, and we like it for its softness and breathability, while something like polyester is great for durability and being quick to dry. There are some golf polos that are made from nylon, which add protection against the elements, but might be stuffy if you tend to overheat (especially if you're golfing in the summer). Merino wool is also another common golf polo material, lauded for its softness and natural temperature-regulating abilities. Style: Polos are a dime a dozen, but a great golf polo doesn't look like you got it from a bargain bin discount retailer. A new wave of indie golf brands are churning out sexy new takes on polos that lean more stylish than stuffy. Plus, there are only so many ways you can innovate on the polo style, so the best way to stand out is by focusing on fit, color, and patterns. Special Features: The humble polo is a simple garment, but performance brands can add special features like gusseted armpits, raglan sleeves, or four-way stretch. Combine that with the option to get something that's stink-proof or able to hide sweat, and you've got yourself a winner on the greens. With a solid crew of both new and lifelong golfers on staff, we’ve spent decades testing golf shirts, from actual early '90s polos we stole from our dads, '00s polos we copped in high school, and the modern performance shirts that dominated the scene throughout the 2010s. However, since we’re obsessive style vultures, we naturally dipped our toes into everything the last few years have brought to the scene, from soccer-inspired Blokecore polos to streetwear-inspired tees and tops to gorpcore crossovers from ACG and Adidas Adicross. We test them at the course, of course, but also at our local dive, on date night, and when we travel. In 2025, there’s no limit to where you can rock your golf gear. Who makes the best golf polos? Sure, legacy brands like Nike and Adidas make excellentclothing for golfers, but we've since seen a rise of independent golf apparel makers that are making some exceptional pieces, especially polos. Brands like Malbon Golf and Devereux are two brands that create high-performing golf polos that also happen to look pretty damn good on the green. What is the best golf polo shirt? We like theNike Tour Dri-FIT golf polothe best because of its affordability and how it's able to handle extreme weather while letting the golfer do their thing when it's time to start swinging. What is the best material for golf shirts? Golfing can be a sweaty sport, so opt for a breathable fabric like cotton or something designed to wick away moisture and keep you dry. Polyester is great for its ability to stay wrinkle-free, and a lightweight merino wool can help you stay cool while being soft on the skin.",

    "title": "15 Best Linen Suits for Men 2025, Tested and Reviewed by GQ",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. In 2025, the best linen suits for men are a year-round flex, but spring is still their true domain. In its most formal iteration, linen makes for a blessedly out-of-the-box alternative torun-of-the-mill cotton and wool suits. The fabric’s natural breathability means it's predisposed to keep you cool through sweltering spring days and slightly-more-tolerable spring nights—and imbue your fits with a jolt of rakish insouciance in the process. Finally headedto that weddingyour cousin's postponed three times since last year? Ditch the tuxedo and opt for a pure linen suit—and then proceed to get blissfully sloshed off the gratis bubbly while the rest of the guests shvitz through their super 110s. Looking for an office-friendly suit with just enough texture to help you stand out from the wool-wearing pack? Linen's got you covered there, too. Want a suit with a little more structure? Reach for one in a cotton-linenblendto avoid excess wrinkling. Point is, the right linen suit will take your fits from zero to sixty faster than the latest Koenigsegg. Here are 14 of our favorites—each tested, vetted, and driven by us—to help you hit the gas, stat. Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren Fabric: 100% Linen, with polyester sleeve lining |Color: Navy, Corsair blue, Armadillo, Spring beige |Sizes: 32-52 Here's a hot take for you: Linen, with its promise of laid-back revelry and sweat-free boogieing, might be the mostAmericanof summer suiting fabrics. (We see you, seersucker, and we regret nothing.) So it follows that the reigning master of American cool knows his way around the flaxy material better than most. When it comes to the perilously high pile of RSVPs in your inbox, Ralph Lauren's nubby linen number is like a wearable jolt of dress code confidence—sans the rigidity of a typical capital-S Suit. The jacket's half-canvassed construction and soft shoulders means it won't look out of place at a beachside ceremony in Nantucket, but the classic khaki color and cuffed trousers bring just the right amount of formality to swankier summer nuptials. To maximize your returns, pair with a gauzy dress shirt, silky knit tie, and loafers you wouldn't mind getting sandy. Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Todd Snyder Fabric: 100% Linen |Color: Black |Sizes: 36S-46L Todd Snyder is an alum of J.Crew, where the Iowan designer helped introduce the Ludlow, the most influential mass-market suit of its era. So when Snyder's eponymous label debuted the Wythe a couple of years ago, it was hard not to see a paradigm shift in the way men dress scrawled across its swooping peak lapels, languorous pleated trousers, and louche,‘80s-Armani-adjacent silhouette.The Wythe is now available inthree-season navy blueandslate gray, but the standout version remains this dark black number, in an elegant linen sourced from Italy’s Subalpino mill. As with all of Snyder's tailoring, the value proposition is second to none: for a little over a grand, you get a who's who of wonky tailoring flourishes, from the jacket's horn buttons to the trousers' set waistband. The Godfather of Italian menswearis alive and well, thank heavens, but in the Wythe, his suits have a worthy modern-day successor. Here's hoping it convinces the Ludlow crowd to level up accordingly. Alex Crane Alex Crane Alex Crane Alex Crane Fabric: European linen |Color: Varies |Sizes: XS-XXL Who says a linen suit has to look like, well,a suit? The team behind the American label Alex Crane doesn't just design top of the line linen wares—they live and breathe the material, crafting everything from jackets to tees out of the unbeatable summer fabric. This workwear-inspired take knocks the stuffiness straight out of the style, in the form of an easy set you don't need any special occasion to rock. (Rest assured, it'll look plenty righteous with a button-up and a tie, too.) The chore coat-adjacent jacket, trim silhouette, and short length give the whole shebang a casual vibe that takes the guesswork out of those “garden party” dress codes. Rock on, people. Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie Abercrombie & Fitch Abercrombie Fabric: 53% cotton, 37% linen, 10% lyocell |Color: Varies |Sizes: 36-48 Abercrombie’s ludicrously affordable linen-blend suit isn’t quite Savile Row-level quality—few suits are. But before our mates across the pond get their starched briefs in a twist, consider the context it was designed for. As GQ’s Tyler Chin noted when the brand introduced its debuttailoring line, it’s no coincidence that it landed just as those RSVPs started piling up in your inbox. “When the vows are exchanged and the bubbly starts flowing,” Chin said then, “I’ll be sequestered by the bar, not even remotely stressed about spilling Aperol down the front of my $300 suit.” Drake's Drake's Drake's Drake's Fabric: 55% Cotton, 45% linen |Color: Navy |Sizes: 34-48 The single downside to linen's unimpeachable summer bona fides, as any buttoned-up menswear snob will tell you, is its propensity to wrinkle. (Feels sort of ageist, TBH, but we'll let it slide.) So if you're gearing up for an anxiety-inducing work presentation—or just wearing a suit to the office because hey, you readGQ—invest in a two-piece like Drake's', which blends its Italian-sourced linen with a supermajority of crisp, classic cotton. The British haberdasher'ssignature Games suitsplits the difference with exquisite flair, yielding a less wrinkle-prone take on its purer flaxen counterparts. Factor in the hefty notch lapels and genteel3-roll-2 button stanceand you might as well promoteyourself. J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew Fabric: 100% Linen |Color: Beige white glen |Sizes: 34-50 A couple of years ago, J.Crew introduced the Kenmare suit, a major development in themall brand renaissanceand its latest bulwark in the tailoring arms race between its counterparts atBanana RepublicandAbercrombie & Fitch. The Kenmarewas expressly designedfor next-gen tailoring buffs—guys who suit up because they want to, not because occasion demands it—and it was looser, chiller, and generallybiggerin every way than the brand's flagship Ludlow silhouette. In 2025, though, it's not quite big enough. So this summer, J.Crew has again rolled out the bluntly-named Big-Fit suit, a worthy follow-up toits viral Giant chinosthat takes the Kenmare's relaxed proportions to their logical conclusion. The latest version comes rendered in a calming Italian linen, sourced from a century-old Italian mill. If J.Crew's track record is any indication, expect the Big-Fit suit to be just as ubiquitous as its others by this time next year—which means now's the moment to supersize your closet before the rest of the group chat catches up. J. Mueser Mr. Porter J. Mueser Mr. Porter Fabric: 100% Linen |Color: Dark brown |Sizes: IT 46-54 When New York City's best-compensated fellas are in the market for a custom suit—for their wedding, their promotion, their Friday night—they increasingly go to J. Mueser. For good reason, too. As we'vewritten about previously, founder Jake Mueser started the brand in 2008, and has since established “what might be the closest thing NYC has to a signature style of tailoring.” His suits are a “melting pot,” as he calls it, of influences: There's the American natural shoulder, the English ticket pocket, the generous Italian lapel. But for now, and for your purposes, all that really matters is that his note-perfect suits are also available to order online—in this case, in an exceptional, chocolatey brown. Evan Kinori CHCM Evan Kinori CHCM Evan Kinori's linen two-piece is the savvy sartorialist's answer to transitional weather. The jacket is cut loose and generous, guaranteed to keep you from sweating buckets come summer—but might look even better as amakeshift chore coatwith a threadbare tee underneath. Wear the pants instead of jeans on your next run to the bodega and even the surly dude behind the cashier will appreciate the flex. Percival Percival Percival Percival Too many men’s linen suits run the risk of looking overly casual (or overcompensate with a particularly structured fit). Butred carpet mainstayPercival manages to split the difference, thanks to crisp notch lapels and a duo of patch pockets that’ll help you’ll nail the dress code for brunch—and the slew of summer weddings on your docket. Brunello Cucinelli Mr Porter Brunello Cucinelli Mr Porter If you always wondered how Italian drip gods manage to look so fly in the summer, we've got the answer: a suit exactly like this one. Brunello Cucinelli's subtly-textured linen option may seem laissez-faire in vibe, but to reallycapitalize on its pedigree, we'd recommend going the whole nine yards—pale blue shirt, dark knit tie, dress shoes shined to a mirror-like gleam. Boglioli Mr. Porter Boglioli Mr. Porter The other essential name in fine Italian linen tailoring, Boglioli has been keeping the sweat off of European brows for decades—including George Clooney's. This suit is garment-dyed, double-breasted, and as ready to cover a button-up shirt as it is arollneck sweater. Sunspel Mr. Porter Sunspel Mr. Porter So vaunted are Sunspel's polos, T-shirts, and underwear that folks too easily forget that the brand also excels in the “Suits as separates” clothing class. This time, that means you can pick up an unstructured linen blazer—pre-washed for added softness, we might add—and step into the sun knowing you're shining in the same label asDaniel Craig's Bond. Corridor Mr. Porter Corridor Mr. Porter Ok, so you want your pattern to relax as much as your fabric? Enter: Corridor. This checked set is classic enough not to raise any eyebrows, but those close to you will take some joy in the faintly pink stripes running all the way down the check print. And while it's designed for the warm months, there's a touch of wool in it too, to keep the goosebumps away once the sun's gone down. Mr. P Mr. Porter Mr. P Mr. Porter The folks at Mr. Porter sift through a ton of product every day, and in many cases, their in-house line Mr. P represents the best of a category, something that can only be known after you've pored over the whole rest of the competition. And while the brand knows it may never be able to compete on suiting with the likes of a Cucinelli, in this case, it wisely decided to tackle the “casual linen suit” genre—with handsome, garment-dyed-for-softness results. Linen suits are tricky to test firsthand—it's not always reasonable to assume they'll fit you perfectly right out of the hanging bag, and it's damn-near impossible to land on one version that works for every body type. So before we began whittling down the list of our favorites, we thought back to all the linen suits we've known and loved recently, and what, exactly, differentiated one flaxen number from the other. The most important differentiator comes down tovibe. Are you looking for a linen suit you can reliably substitute for its wool counterparts when the subway is so swampy you're sweating before you hear “stand clear of the closing doors”? Or a linen suit you'll wear sporadically, to those frustratingly amorphous cocktail hours that demand more than a button-up and jeans? Or was your search for a linen suit catalyzed by the sheer number of RSVPs in your inbox—and your inability to weather a 2-hour beachside ceremony without shvitzing up a storm? Whatever motives brought you here, you're in good company. Over the course of our months-long testing process—and countless debates on button stance, fabric composition, and lapel width—the suits above helped us soldier through every type of event imaginable in impeccable style. Along the way, we made note of each suit's upsides and downsides, reassessing and reorganizing our top contenders accordingly. Based on those evaluations, we ran the numbers, collated the anecdotal evidence, and emerged with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best linen suits for men right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable go-tos to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "Why Is It So Hard to Dress Well on Vacation?",
    "article_text": "Before I left for a trip to Italy earlier this month, I spent a week stressing about what to pack. I combed through my wardrobe, window shopped on a dozen different websites, and checked the weather daily. (As it turns out, Venice in April is chiller than I expected—nolinen pantsfor this guy). I was stumped, despite the fact that I own plenty of perfect clothes for a short trip to Europe in the spring. The struggle was in figuring out if I wanted to go to Venice dressed “for Venice” or dressed like myself. Preparing for a chill, relaxing week overseas had become a headache-inducing sartorial Rubik’s cube. If you care about getting dressed in the morning, packing for a vacation adds a whole layer of stress to the planning process. It’s natural to want to dress like you think you’re supposed to when you step off the plane and into Wyoming, Paris, or the Amalfi Coast. Rolling up tocowboy countryin Sambas doesn’t feel like the vibe, and you do, in fact, probably need breathable fabrics like linen for Mediterranean climates. The problem is that this urge often gives way to an inclination we’ll call Vacation Cosplay. It’s hard to define but you’ll know it when you see it: sometimes it looks like matching shirt-short sets,linen shirtsin bold colors you likely won’t be wearing with confidence, and the sort of retro pool wear that’s so incredibly specific to its moment that it’s less a fit and more a costume (yes, I’m subtweeting theGoldfingertoweling onesie). Other times it’s falling into the trap of packing a collection of individual pieces rather than complete outfits, resulting in a bunch of mismatched fits and heightening the risk of actually running out of clothes to wear before you head home. “I think the biggest mistake people make when they’re traveling is that they pack things they would never wear normally,” says Albert Muzquiz, themenswear TikTokker better known as @EdgyAlbert. “And that’s high risk, high reward.” On a recent trip to Alaska, the Los Angeles native had the chance to try outcoatsandsweatershe often can’t wear at home—crucially, though, they were pieces that still felt very much in line with his day-to-day wardrobe and established aesthetic. Still, for every trip to Alaska there’s also one to a city like New York, where he admits he sometimes feels the pressure to show out in such a fashion-savvy city. “I never feel like I’m dressed as hip as everyone else,” he says, noting that his wardrobe largely consists ofteesandjeans. “I’ll always bring a fanciercollared shirtwith the assumption that I’ll put together some tasteful fit, and I almost never wear anything like that.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Onscreen, no show spotlights Vacation Cosplay quite likeThe White Lotus. The show is built on rich people jetting off to exotic locales and making an attempt to dress for the moment. Not every character totally beefs it (Walton Goggins’Rick, for one, mostly made his rumpled patterned button-ups and loose linen trousers work in season three) but—perhaps as an extension of the show’s core themes—most don’t look comfortable in their own skin, much less the gaudy fits they’ve put together. In the Sicily-set second season, Theo James’s scumbag philanderer Cameron puts on a masterclass in Vacation Cosplay. His luggage gets lost upon his arrival to Sicily, forcing him to buy an entire new wardrobe from the Italian tourist shops. He gallivants about the coast in loud matching sets, obnoxious swim shorts, and at one point even sports a floral-print linen suit. James is the sort of super handsome dude who makes even the most ridiculous of fits look decent (and costumer Alex Bovarid-Spouse clearly assembled the loud wardrobe as clearly an extension of Cameron’s aggressive personality), but make no mistake: Cameron’s wardrobe shouldn’t make it onto anyone’s vacation menswear mood board. Walton Goggins’s relaxed, rumpledWhite Lotusfits? Good. Theo James’s over-the-top matching sets? Bad. It’s easy to think of vacation wear as synonymous withresort wear, the tropical-friendly style of dressing popularized by Tommy Bahama and modernized by brands you’ll often see in Instagram ads. You know the ones–they boast toweling shirts, matching shirt/swimsuit sets, and the sort of linen threads and knit polos that look great on the models they hire for those ads and less great when they arrive at your door. Brands like these push the idea that you’resupposedto bring a vacation-specific wardrobe with you, that once you hit the sand you’ll look great in nautical embroidery and peacocked swim trunks. But the truth is if you wouldn’t feel comfortable in those clothes at home, you’re basically spending a lot of money on some pieces you’re only going to wear once or twice and never feel as good wearing as you’d think. Brandon Thompson,a content creator and style lead at SuitSupply, does vacation fashion better than just about anyone I know. The travel fits he posts on Instagram are the sort any guy packing for vacation should aspire to. The catch, much like with Muzquiz, is that what Thompson packs for a trip to Spain often isn’t too far off from what he wears to work every day in Los Angeles. “Adding resort wear to my regular wardrobe solved vacation packing issues for me,” he tellsGQ. “Pairing those out-of-comfort-zone pieces with something you wear regularly can change an item from ‘just finishedThe White Lotus’ to a staple piece in your summer closet.” Thompson’s vacation wardrobe staples are simple: asuitorblazerjust in case, knitwear for chilly days or evenings, andswimwear(even if you don’t think you’ll need it). Perhaps most importantly, he suggests always packing a pair ofloafers. Swap in some penny loafers for your Hokas, and suddenly a white tee and jeans suddenly goes from bland toTalented Mr. Ripley-adjacent. Thompson also advises against the pre-vacation shopping spree. “Don’t shop too much before vacation,” he says. “Always leave room in your suitcase to bring back something you pick up along the way.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. What I packed for Italy skewed much closer to Thompson’s checklist than my initial dream of looking like a Fellini movie background actor. I stuck with some dependable trousers, solid black tees, some nicer shirts for dinners, and azip-up sweaterto layer under adenim jacket. All of the items I’d added to my cart while shopping stayed there. Before leaving, though, I recalled a patterned silk scarf I’d been gifted from resort wear brand Dandy Del Mar a few years prior. I’d never quite figured out how to style it, but it survived countless wardrobe purges and a recent apartment move, my gut telling me I’d find the right moment for it one of these days. I was right. Without overthinking it, I threw it into my suitcase. Sure enough, once I touched down in Venice, I tossed it around my neck lackadaisically and hardly took it off until I landed back at LAX five days later. Travel has an inherent aspirational element to it. Consciously or not it’s often a practice in self-actualization. We think about the people we’d like to be, no matter how far removed they are from who we actually are, and aspire to be a little bit more like them while out in the world. Sometimes that means trying something new, like horseback riding or skydiving. Sometimes it’s consuming a local delicacy. And sometimes it’s just finally deciding that it’s the right time for that silk scarf.",

    "title": "The Economy Is Frightening. Law School Won’t Save You.",
    "article_text": "When it was reported last month thatlaw school applications are up 20%, some of us who graduated around the 2008 recession thought of that one friend, the liberal artist-activist who, after six months of financial uncertainty, became conveniently passionate about the law. He got busy. He got a haircut. He got a Big Law job he never spoke about except when brandishing his pro bono bona fides. Law student applications are a bearish indicator—thebearish indicator if you’re young and insufferably promising. Morgan Stanley is revising up the chance of a recession. Gen Z’ers are revising up the chances Aiden takes the LSAT. He should check in with my one friend before he does. Big Law attorneys’ wages, which stagnated decades ago, show no sign of recovery with AI encroaching on billable hours. And the prestige associated with both Big Law School and Big Law is under direct threat from the White House. The Trump administration issued anumber of executive orders targeting lawyers, including those that have investigated him: taking away the security clearance they need to do business, inquiring about their DEI practices, promising sanctions against those that sue the government. Already, the law firms Paul Weiss, Skadden Arps, and Perkins Coie have cut deals with the White House, promising to spend firm hours that would have once been devoted to pro bono work grooming the administration’s pet causes. For the lawyers at those firms—currently getting roasted by debt-burdened but resolutely upright public defenders on professional listservs—capitulation isn’t just an inconvenience or ideological affront. It’s a violation of the deal they struck with themselves when they went back to school. The deal that allowed them to fig leaf their personal ambition with the prestige of participating in the broader social project of supporting the Constitution of the United States (and the constitution of the state in which they passed the bar). Eight months ago, I launchedUpper Middle, a publication documenting the growing discomfort among “comfortable” millennials. Consultants at McKinsey—another tempting career for wayward achievers—had just dropped numbers reporting that middle managers were the target of roughly a third of job cuts in 2023 despite constituting 17% of the workforce. That spike arrived amid broader white-collar wage stagnation and a surge in living costs in metroplexes. Then there was the cultural assault: Trump railing against the deep state as post-woke Silicon Valley broligarchs depicted the “professional managerial class” as a conspiracy of feckless, self-righteous elites. The economy was booming, but cocktail parties were ending early. When I began advertisingUpper MiddleonInstagram—where the millennials hang out after the kids go down—I expected to reach (and monetize) plenty of overcompensated, overcompensating senior associates and junior partners. I didn’t. Instead, I found myself writing for doctors, many of whom emerged from the pandemic having lost conviction in the broader social project of public health. They were exhausted. They were just doing a job. They sounded like journalists—my defanged pack—when they bemoaned careers that had felt like a calling and become a persistent irritation. We shared an allergy to fig leaves. Over the last few weeks, during the Trump administration’s assault on Big Law, I’ve had the displeasure of watching and listening to lawyers go through a similar process of discovery. They’re coming to terms with the fact that prestige and purpose can be pried away by power. Several attorneys I’ve spoken with have asked a variation of the question I’ve heard so often from medical professionals: “Was I lying to myself?” Very few have the courage to spell the whole thing out. “Was I lying to myself thinking I was special?” Special. Elite. Prestigious. Americans have a whole vocabulary to avoid saying theotherc-word you’re allowed to say in England. But class anxiety is what drives American overachievers to accumulate all those diplomas, certificates, and letters of rec. We hope credentials will close the gap between us and the owners of the businesses who cut our six-figure checks. But that’s not how anything works. As sociologist C. Wright Mills put it all the way back in 1951: “White-collar workers are often closer in their economic fate and social reality to wage-workers than to the owners of the businesses they work for.” We just don’t like to admit this. We don’t like the idea that, as Wright pointed out a few pages later, our status rests upon “sharing the authority of those in charge of the enterprise.” There’s an upsetting truth in there: Power that can be un-shared isn’t really power at all. Does this mean that the highly paid attorneys who graduated in 2011 have been lying to themselves this whole time? Was the pro bono stuff just cover for a collective boner for money, status, and box seats to the US Open? Not entirely. Like the pediatricians who used to push (really push) MMR vaccines, lawyers are motivated, at least partly, by a higher calling. And that is special. But they are lying to themselves if they don’t admit something has changed. They are no longer being paid to be members of a professional priesthood working in service of the rule of law. They are being paid to do jobs they have less and less freedom to define. In the absence of that freedom, the money doesn’t seem so great. But it’s not nothing. One of the time-honored ways in which the upper middle class copes with this kind of precarity is by leaning into its refined tastes. We live in a consumer society and, oxymoronic as it may sound—it isn’t—buying stuff with money allows us to express a sophistication that can’t be bought. If fits matter more to us than our parents, it might be because, 50 years ago, life in America was affordable and luxuries were expensive. Now, life in America is expensive and luxuries are affordable. In the absence of true stability, we can microdose wealth one Beams+ sweater or CDMX vacation at a time. People with multiple degrees might identify as former singularly gifted kids, but there sure are a lot of them. Except maybe we can’t. Tariffs make it hard to predict whether email workers will be able to afford Japanese menswear, Italian Illy pods, and Delta Comfort+ going forward, and a glance at one’s portfolio can kill the shopping mood. The tariffs were implemented knowing they would likely hurt, as Fox News host Harris Faulkner put it last week, “the 401(k) people.” In other words, the risk-averse institutionalists who stick their salary in an index fund, betting (patriotically and narcissistically) on the information economy—their version of America’s future. Those people are largely outside the MAGA base of service business owners, big-business scions, day-trading degens, and “real Americans” without retirement plans. Arriving amid attacks on law firms and universities, the message was: You can wait this recession out in your nearest law library, but we’re not going to listen to your highly informed opinions when you get out. When there’s nowhere left to hide, safety is about numbers. People with multiple degrees might identify as former singularly gifted kids, but there sure are a lot of them. Just under 15% of Americans now hold a graduate or professional degree, and roughly 21% of Americans are members of households with at least double the median household income, the traditional financial qualification for being upper middle class. Our reluctance to think of ourselves as a class has led so-called elites to vastly underestimate our own power. We’re more comfortable interrogating our privilege than we are weaponizing it. We’ve chosen to negotiate from positions of weakness, cozying up to authority rather than, say, starting managerial unions. We’re coy about salaries, stock options, benefits, and beleaguered 401(k)s—all the things that we like to pretend don’t really matter—denying each other the data we need to renegotiate our relationship with true power. But that seems to be changing:Big Law associates are organizing onlineandmedical residents are unionizingin increasing number. If the fig leaf of prestige falls, the upper middle class will be exposed for what it is. A bit hypocritical? Sure. A bit precious? Absolutely. But also knowledge-bulked and economically well-endowed. When I talk to doctors or lawyers about their work, their lives, and the misalignment of their expectations and their circumstances, I hear anger in their voices. The upper middle class is spoiling for a fight. If the powers that be don’t want to share authority—if they’d rather oil up and wrestle—well…let’s fucking go.",

    "title": "Terron Armstead on His Legendary Career, Rapping for the Madden Soundtrack, and the Player Who Hit Him the Hardest",
    "article_text": "Terron Armstead played 12 years in theNFL, starting his decorated career in 2013 protecting the blind side for Drew Brees. In his time blocking for one of the greatest quarterbacks ever, the 6’5”, 305-pound left tackle was an anchor of the team’s offensive line, developing into an impenetrable force over nearly a decade inNew Orleans. Armstead made three Pro Bowls and one All-Pro team with the Saints, which he used to get himself paid in free agency. Before the 2022 season, theMiami Dolphinsdropped a five-year, $75-million contract on him, giving Armstead some bank statements that certified the former third-round pick as one of the best in the league at his position. But playing in the trenches guarantees a certain level of anonymity. Armstead—who was sneakily one of the funniest, most talented dudes in the league before announcing his retirement earlier this month—had other interests beyond putting pass rushers in the torture chamber. Underneath his football helmet, the big man was cooking up rhyme schemes. In 2020, under the name T Stead, he dropped a full-length album, announcing his presence with lyrics like “I connected the streets with the corporate world, I'm the catalyst. And you gon’ need way more thanESPNfor analysis.” The people atMaddentook notice, and whenMadden 24was released, the video game’s soundtrack featured five songs blessed by T Stead verses. Now living in Dallas, raising three kids, and exploring some post-retirement business ventures, Armstead made it clear that he has no desire to get back on the gridiron. With his legacy secure as both a top tackle of his era—and one of themostfashionableoffensivelinemento ever do it—Armstead is leaving the field with a palpable sense of accomplishment. Going from an HBCU (Armstead played college ball at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff) to a dozen years in the NFL is no small feat, and being recognized by his peers with three appearances on theNFL Top 100showed that the dudes he was lining up against respected him as well. Armstead spoke withGQabout all of this in a recent exit interview, sharing stories aboutSean Payton’s wardrobe, the scariest defense he’s ever seen, and whether he’s allowed himself to think about a gold jacket yet. Terron Armstead:I think it organically happened for me over the years. Coming into the league, I can't say that I was [into fashion], honestly. I didn't get into any designer clothes, didn't really care much aboutstyling. I just had a natural sense of matching, really. I know this goes with this and these shoes, that's it. But then just starting to see the guys pulling up to the games and putting it on, man, I'm like, I want to get into that! So, I got into suits more. Now, I do the suits and also I can do some other fashion. I like to do things that's a little risky for the big guys. But so what? Step with confidence! I see a lot more of my fellow O-line and D-linemen starting to do it. I love it. Man, that's a great question, because I really didn't know, honestly. I'm from a small town. I had no interaction with any NFL players. I go to college, I have no interaction with any NFL players. I really don't have any outline of what it looks like, or what's to be expected. When I get to the Saints and I see Drew Brees over there in his locker, I'm like a fan! I don't want to run up as a fan because now I'm his teammate. So I just started to watch, man. I started to pay attention to how Drew would go out there and warm up, or Jahri Evans, Ben Grubbs, just the extra things they did pre-practice. Early in my career, I didn't start, and that really, really bothered me. I would practice hard throughout the week, getting better, and Sunday would come and I'm inactive. I didn't even know that was a thing! It's like seven people that don't dress. They're inactive. That shit never sat well with me. I started to feed into that burning desire of,I have to get on the field. I'm doing overtime: pre-practice, post-practice, weight room, just waiting on my opportunity. I remember Sean Payton called me into the office. He said, \"It's yours. It's your time.\" We had a big game coming up, going againstCarolina, fighting to win our division. He's like, \"It's your time. I need you to be ready.\" I'll never forget it. When he told me, I was stone faced. I'm like, \"Yeah, I'm ready. I'm locked in.” But as soon as I walked out that office, I'm like, \"Let's go!\" I go back down to the locker room, process everything, and hit the ground running. My first half of that game wasn't too great! I had a couple mistakes. But from that point on, it was T. Stead. Yeah, I mean, the young guys. When I came to New Orleans, Drew had already won a Super Bowl, Jahri had already won a Super Bowl. They were already veterans. When I got there, I could pull up two minutes before practice, throw my pants on, and go out there. I didn't have to do all the warm-ups. But I saw their routine—from resistance bands to hot tubs—and I saw how much they put into every day. But yeah, it's a lot of guys that.Jalen Ramseydon't have to do nothing. Jaylen Waddle. We'll be playing cards—and I'm talking 20 seconds before practice—he steps on the field, buckles his helmet, and he's good to go. No stretch, nothing. We had to go to Philly, and we won the first-ever road playoff game in Saints history. A rookie Armstead walks off the field in Philly after beating the Eagles in the playoffs. For sure. Especially inPhilly, that was an insane environment. Trent Cole, he was the defensive end, he’s like an Eagles legend. During the week, he was talking so much smack. He's like, \"Man, they got a rookie in front of me? I'm going to kill him.\" He didn't kill me at all. I had a great game against the guy. He kind of jump-started my career. It was like,All right, maybe this Armstead, he might be on to something. He held Trent Cole in check. But then going next week to Seattle, who ended up winning the Super Bowl, that was a different beast. Listen, it was different.Different. That defense was insane, bro. Kam Chancellor almost broke my jaw through my helmet. He hit me so hard, bro,so hard. It was crazy. I went back to the sideline and told everybody, \"Hey, watch out for number 31. He is coming downhill. Watch out.\" That was the best of the best. And I loved it. I had a great game. The crowd was insane. Sean Payton had these specialized earplugs in. He had them custom-made for every player, to where we couldn't hear the crowd really. Everything was non-verbal, just off indicators. We had no communication. In the huddle, we had to read Drew's lips because we had the earplugs in. It was crazy. That definitely solidified that I belonged, like I can do it. Because I'm telling you, that defense is one of the best ever. I've had more moments throughout my career where it's like, I'm nice, I'm really like that. But that was really my,you're here for real now. This is the best of the best. You can compete on this level, you're good to go, you can do this. I think 2015, so my third year in the league, is where I became one of the notable tackles. I was a Pro Bowl alternate that year, and I was balling. I had my jump sets going. I had these different techniques going. Every week I was graded one of the highest tackles in the league. I probably was the highest graded tackle that year. I've seen players come in and be content with whatever the situation is: practice squad, being a backup. Every time, I urge them all, you cannot stay in that place. That is a very replaceable spot. It don't matter if it's your best friend in front of you, your objective is to take his job. Plain and simple. I tell all the guys that. Man, it's a lot. I was just trying to be a sponge. Dan Roushar, my old O-line coach, Frank Smith, another O-line coach. Drew Brees, Jahri Evans, Ben Grubbs. Sean Payton. Seriously, I learned what a standard is. I learned what your daily intention is. I learned how important the details are, the small things, being somewhere on time. You know what I mean? Don't be over this certain weight. I learned a lot throughout the way. Yeah, pretty much polar opposites as far as personalities go. But they still have a lot of similarities though, man. Both of them see the game like very few others. They're able to anticipate what the defense is going to do, what the response is going to be. They're able to draw up things that I feel like very few people on the planet can do. I would say two. I had one againstMyles Garrett, I think in 2019, elite battle. It was a toe-to-toe slugfest. Then the 2018 NFC Championship Game, I wasballingballing. It didn’t matter who was out there. I was balling. I'm most known for my Christmas game. It was the game that Alvin Kamara had six touchdowns. I had someviral blocksduring that. But those two games, I feel like I played better than even that Christmas game. I've seen everybody. I had battles with Everson Griffen, Chandler Jones, Robert Quinn. Those probably were the three guys I saw the most that were always super challenging. But the best guy to me is Von Miller. I think he's probably the best pass rusher, maybe one of the best ever. Von Miller and Myles Garrett, those two. I've seen some guys on film as I'm preparing that were spooky. WatchingMaxx Crosbyon film, insane. Watching Nick Bosa on film, insane. Joey [Bosa], too. Joey's a lot of hands, he's shifty. But Nick will run through your face and he'll also go around you too. This year presented me some challenges that were really, really steep. Getting the news that I needed a knee replacement—and just deciding to go play and do everything I possibly could to finish the year—that was definitely the moment. But after the season, I explored a couple options, talked to some doctors to see if there was anything possible. I just wanted to make sure there's no stone left unturned if I did ever have that itch to go back or whatever. But that's not the case. I'm done. I am so happy. I'm excited. I'm peaceful. It was about Week 3. Bum, for real. I had to make the decision right there if I was going to hang it up, protect the knee, ice it or whatever. But I'd already started the season, let's go, let's do it. And I played a lot this year! Played well, too, despite everything. I want to challenge that penalty, too. It wasn’t a hold. For linemen in general, it's the knees, it's the back, and it's the shoulders. Those are the three that linemen deal with the most. Everything else is actually feeling pretty good, especially now that I've lost weight and I'm continuing to drop weight. I’m at 270 right now. I'm going to try to get down to—not try, I'mgoingto get down to 250. That'll be my fighting weight. If you're able to mentally stay away from certain things, it starts coming off fast. It does. But that's the challenge, especially when you love food like myself. For sure, two of the great cities of our country. New Orleans is full of tradition and history and resilience. That city is crazy, it is. I love it. It's its own place, bro.No other place in this country gives you New Orleans. Earlier, we was outside a little bit. Then I got to about year four or five…not nearly as much. Miami, I went there going into year 10, so I was in a different space. I used to go to Miami on vacation and kick it with the homies. So, when I got there as a player, it was work and home. That was it. I really didn't go anywhere. It was just trying to lock in with a new city and new team. The Dolphins made the playoffs in two of Armstead's three years in Miami. You feel me? It’s different, bro. We getting old. That was my initial [thought] for sure. When I first came in, that was coming out of the lockout situation, and then Sean Payton and the Saints were coming out of the bounty situation. So when we got there, Sean had just went through a whole lifestyle change. He was doingCrossFit. He's wearing Lululemon and tracksuits. So, we had these travel suits. I got really comfortable just doing that all the time. But then as I started to get to probably year three or four, I remembered watchingDeion Sanderscoming to the games, Ray Lewis, the “look good, play good” type of mantra. I wanted to get into that, and I started getting more into suits. I met this guy Cortez Jackson in New Orleans who had his suit company, Lavoisier. I became the face of Lavoisier. I was on billboards in the city and all that, really just embraced the fashion one hundred percent. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Like I said, in New Orleans it wasn't many guys that was putting it together, because of the travel suits. But Mark Ingram, he's one that’s going to put it on for sure. Alvin Kamara has a unique style. He's different, but he's swaggy. Cam Jordan, he thinks he's the cleanest ever. Sometimes he did it right. Sometimes [I was] like,No, bro, I don't agree. But in New Orleans, those three guys were the most into fashion. I've been thinking, brainstorming. I have so many songs already done over the last two, three years. I might just drop what I have in my notes. I had been having little conversations with Interscope about the project that we did for theMaddensoundtrack, so maybe potentially collabing with Interscope if possible. But be on the lookout.Music, I love it. I do. It's a part of me. Music will be coming back. I wrote everything that day. One day, one session. I was on. I wrote seven verses, not full songs, but some hooks and all my verses for seven songs. We ended up using five. All lyrics. I can write, for sure. It’s some wizards out there. There's some guys that hear things—the smallest little tone and will just dive into that. Like,Oh, we need to use this part.Bro, how did you even hear that? Everything that was being said, all the instruments playing. How did you even hear that? Interscope, bro, they were using Dr. Dre’s original soundboard from back in the day. It is crazy how many gadgets [there were]. It was a great experience. Once I get into my creative bag and it's flowing, it starts to write itself. I just hear a beat and everything will start to pop up in my head. I sit, I write it, and I rap it. When I go in the actual booth, I like to be one take. I want to just go in, knock it out. I'm not a punch-in guy. Why are we stopping and starting? Let me ride it. I got it. I'm going in. Man, you asking the real questions! Listen, that would be the ultimate honor. I love my career. I have no regrets. I played the game at a very high level. Every single year I put the cleats on, I was always one of the top tackles, in an era of tackles too! That left tackle position was stacked throughout the years that I played. That is a fact. I mean, I have no idea what the voters will say when they go back in and analyze my career. But whatever is for me will be for me. You know? Alright, let me give you some insight right here. The 2018 NFC Championship Game. We had a play in. We ran it a few times throughout the year at practice. It was called 84 left tackle throwback. Drew takes the snap, rolls to the right, throws it back to me, boom, wide open touchdown. We were getting towards the end of the game, fourth quarter. We're in the red zone, probably like the 10-yard line. Sean Payton called the play, 84 left tackle throwback. After we break the huddle, time out. The play before, the sixth offensive lineman, Will Clapp, came in and reported eligible. So, he couldn't stay in the game. We couldn't do another lineman-eligible play because he just was in the play before. He would have to be eligible again, or we can't do that type of play. We didn’t really know that either. So we called time out, and the next play is theno-call. That could have been my touchdown, could have been my catch, could have been my ticket to theSuper Bowl. It would've been storybook, really. I lost my mind. I have hands. What? High-level, for sure. 4.71 [40-yard dash]. I was out there sliding. NFL Combine record, check me out.",

    "title": "‘Sinners’ Director Ryan Coogler on Michael B. Jordan, That Ending, and Kendrick Lamar",
    "article_text": "This story was featured in The Must Read, a newsletter in which our editors recommend one can’t-miss story every weekday.Sign up here to get it in your inbox. Ryan Coogleris the film darling of the moment right now, and for good reason. He’s got a good old-fashioned heater on his hands withSinners, which pulled in over $60 million globally this weekend—and he's been having a lot of fun, charming movie fans throughout a press run in which his love of movies has never been more evident. Simply put, this man knows ball. This shouldn't be surprising, since Coogler has previously given us three films within the Franchise IP Industrial Complex that still felt personal, distinctive, artful and exciting. ButSinnersstill feels like a new chapter. It's Coogler's first film based on an original concept—a genre mash-up led by Michael B. Jordan, who pulls double duty as a pair of calculating twins in the Jim Crow-era south whose dream of going legit runs afoul of evil creatures lurking in the night. GQ got an early look at a cut of the film last Christmas in the midst of reportingour Michael B. Jordan cover story, then pulled Coogler out of the editing room to talk all things Mike. But our conversation naturally expanded beyond his film's lead, to the themes he'd sought to explore inSinnersand the goals behind his big swing. In this edited transcript of our conversation—with the director'sYou know what I'm saying-s left in for emphasis—Coogler clears up some rumors (despite assumptions to the contrary, the movie was always going to feature identical twins), addresses Jordan's growth as a performer, and remarks on the crazy synchronicity betweenSinnersandKendrick Lamar'sGNX. Yeah, bro. It was very layered man, in terms of coming up with the idea. In some ways, I've been trying to make this movie forever, when I look back on it with perspective. But I think really it was about my relationship with my uncle who passed away while I was working onCreed. He’s from Mississippi and he was my introduction to blues music and it was all he listened to, you know what I'm saying? I also love genre movies and wanted to make one. Those were the type of movies that I first fell in love with before I knew I wanted to make movies. So this film is also the kind of movie that I always wanted to see, but me making a version of it that only I can make, you know what I'm saying? And I did want to make something original after having done a couple movies based on three movies based on IP back to back, you know what I'm saying? I've just been working with him forever, man. I think he was always an incredible actor, but I think that he's now so unique just because of how he became known to audiences. A lot of people that are famous as children, it's rare for them to continue to evolve and redefine themselves. And Mike was a working actor, and was proven before we met, but what his ceiling was going to be, that was very much something that people would talk about. I think we got to work together at a very unique time in his career, because he was still doing television at the time and had just been in two movies that had wide releases. I felt that he really popped in both those movies—inChronicleand inRed Tails. And I remember I told him, \"I think you’re a real movie star.\" And he almost kind of looked at me like, \"Man, for real?\" I really imagine that it was something that he knew internally, but it was very interesting to see first hand just how much even phenomenal actors can have questions about themselves, you know what I'm saying? And so even though he had been doing it for so much longer than I had been doing it professionally, in a way, we kind of got to grow up together. And because he was the lead in the stuff that we were working on together, I got to kind of see what he was capable of up close. And even though I do feel like I've had a real opportunity to push him quite a bit each time we worked together, I don't know that the gas pedal has ever hit the floor for him, even in the roles that we did together. So I thought this would be a really special opportunity for him as an actor, but even more so for us as an audience, right now, to see this guy that we think we know so well, pushing himself in a way that's different than maybe I could imagine. To me, that's exciting. When you see somebody who's a proven movie star, who you think you know, do something completely different from what you seen do before, I think that's always exciting for me. You know what I mean? I would, man. He's definitely closer to Stack than he is to Smoke, for sure. But people don't know that. You got to kind of know Mike to know that when you see him in a movie, that's not him. And working in this industry more, you realize that people who are really either skilled or gifted, experienced, or some combination of one of those three, they make being a different person look very easy. To the point where I'm numb to it now because it's my job. But the first time I met Stallone for instance, I was like, \"Yo, you nothing like Rocky.\" You almost can't believe it, how different he is from this character that he created. And with Mike, it's some Mike in his Oscar performance [from Coogler's debut filmFruitvale Station], some Mike in Adonis [fromCreed], it's some Mike in [Black Panther's]Killmonger, but he's very far from those guys. Man, Mike's very funny and mercurial and energetic. So the Stack performance is more who Mike is, all of a sudden, than any of his other characters. And to be honest with you, crazy enough, me knowing Mike, I was actually more disturbed by his Smoke performance. Yeah. I don't know what it'll be like for audiences. But as somebody who knows him, when he was in character as Smoke, there were a few times I was unnerved. For sure. I knew I would need an actor I was very close with. And the decision to make them identical—it’s a different movie if they’re fraternal [twins], but I thought that making them identical twins would be better. I was trying to play with archetypes and tropes a little bit. And you know how every neighborhood, if you say, \"Hey man, where are the twins at?\" There's going to be some twins. They're always local celebrities. And kind of always known to be a little nefarious. You see this character come up in different cultures, and I wanted to play with that. It's like a sports analogy. I can throw the pass and know that he's going to be there. But this role was challenging, bro. We had to talk more than ever just with all of the complications that came with it, the technical complications, obviously in delivering the image with two Mikes. And then we had a twin double who we would work with, and who would have to kind of be there for Mike, be where he's going to be once he's the character. That was a very interesting song and dance. And it was helpful that Mike had directed a movie. Because sometimes you would have to communicate with his double Percy in ways that was more intimate than even I could. It's funny—it's a genre movie, but his job just delivering these characters, bro, was his most challenging job. So we did have to talk quite a bit. Honestly, it makes him much more understanding, of everybody. I think it increases patience because I think he has a little more, I would recommend it for any actor who has the curiosity or the desire to go make something. It is the same way that they would make us in film school. They would make us act. It was a non-starter, you had to do it. If you're going to go talk to actors and convince them to do X, Y, Z, you got to go do that yourself, see what it feels like. So I think it expanded his patience, and I think he was always very empathetic towards me, but even more now with the process. I would say this is his first role where he's like a man. I don't know if it's for me, just as a filmmaker, but as a viewer, these feel like the oldest characters he's ever played, these are fully formed men there's nothing boyish about these guys. Yeah but what it really is too, bro, I think if somebody feels like their fate has been sealed, they are who they're going to be. Every other time I've worked with Mike on something, there’s a sense of,Hey, maybe this guy is going to change, and become something else than who he was at the top of this thing. And I felt that these characters—they kind of are hard-baked, they know what they are. And that contributed to the weight and made me see these characters as more mature. But also Mike has a maturity to him now, as a man of this age, than he ever has had on a movie before. And it just comes across, you feel me? I thought that was really interesting as well, with him coming off of a job like directing, when you are responsible for so many people. Directing kind of ages you a little bit. Man, that's such astute acknowledgement man. It's like my fifth movie as a writer/director. And I feel like I kind of made a deal with myself, man, that I wouldn't try to explain too much. And be a little looser just in terms of how I'm approaching the storytelling. So I would say, the film’s about a lot of things. I was feeling a lot of things when we were making it. And I think you hit the nail on the head, if that's what you saw in it. Who am I to say that's not what's there? My God, that's more beautiful than anything I can say. That's why you're writing for GQ and I'm over here in the editing room, you feel me? [laughs] But yeah, bro, I wanted to make a movie that was complicated but decidedly genre, but that still felt honest. And fun to watch. Did you have fun watching it, bro? Right on bro. Right on. Oh,the “Reincarnated” one! I heard that album when everybody else did. Actually a few days after. But bro, me and [Kendrick] don't talk often, but it's not the first time we've been on similar wavelengths. I'm not going to lie. When I heard that song I was like,Aw, shit![laughs] But [the coincidence] is something I find interesting. What was your favorite scene? That shit stuck with you. You wouldn't fuck with the movie as much if it didn't have that ending? Yeah, that's definitely good to hear, bro.",

    "title": "The Suit You Need to Crush Wedding Season Is Less Than $500",
    "article_text": "All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. When it comes to spring suits—or any suits, for that matter—you generally get what you pay for. “Generally,” though, is the operative word here, and in that word lies an entireworldof wiggle room—and no shortage of exceptions. Right this very moment, we’re pleased to report that at least five (5!) killer spring suits are available for under $500, all ready and raring forpeak wedding season. Variety? We got it. We're talking louche, eggshell-hued seersucker rigs (you can totally wear white to a wedding if you're cool about it, FYI); relaxed cotton riffs the same shade as your morning espresso; and slouchy navy joints that look terrific together, and even better when youseparate the jacketfrom their pants. So if the fear of spilling Aperol down the front of an expensive suit was the only thing holding you back from wearing one with reckless abandon, relax: the laid-back options below are designed to cut a rug, not ding your credit score. When J.Crew’ssuiting programtook off in the 2010s, it did so off the strength of one silhouette alone:the era-defining Ludlow. In the past few years, the Crew has added a whole host of new suits to its assortment, and one of the best—if notthebest—just touched down this month. Done up in a cotton poplin breezy enough for the summer heat but substantial enough to weather a mild spring drizzle, it'll crush with anOxford shirtandloafers—and look just as excellent split up. J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew J.Crew Stüssy—yes,seminal streetwear imprintStüssy—doesn’t boast what anybody would describe as a “deep” suiting assortment, but the sole model the brand offers is a knockout. The blazer skews classic and clean-cut, thanks to a single vent, notch lapels, and flapped welt pockets at the waist. The pants, though, skew rakish and not a little skate rat, courtesy of slash pockets at the side, and anextremelyeasy cut. They're both available in a beautifully-textured 100% linen fabric, which will stay cool(ish) on even the shvitziest days of the year. Stüssy Stüssy Stüssy Stüssy I own this suit;I wrote about this suit; I will be wearing this suit to pieces in both situations that demand it and situations that don’t. The fabric is insanely light, but somehow manages to retain its structure, and sure, the elastic waistband puts a hard(ish) ceiling on how formal it can go, but the entire set is also…under $150. (For all youtailoring nerds, yes, the single-button cuffs are functional.) Uniqlo: C Uniqlo Uniqlo: C Uniqlo If you’re looking for a pair of white cotton-linen pants, Madewell’s are some of the best I've seen in a minute—two deep pleats, one healthy rise, no notes. That you can also snag a matching double-breasted jacket would just be the icing here, except the jacket is entirely worthy of acknowledgment on its own. Soft shoulders, healthy lapels, contrasting buttons? At $228 it's already an excellent value—with its corresponding trousers, it's a no-brainer. Madewell Madewell Madewell Madewell OK, so this one isn'ttechnicallyunder $500, but it’s pretty damn close—and you can score a 20% discount on Percival's site, which does, indeed, drop it into our totally arbitrary price range. Even at full price, though, it’s a ton of suit for your buck, and we’d be terribly remiss not to include it. That extra dough gets you a preposterously lightweight cotton seersucker that manages to hold its shape better than the fabric has any right to. While we’re on the topic of shape—the jacket also happens to include a hint of low-profile padding to keep you sharp, which is just a bonus, really, but helpful to know.

    "title": "‘The Pitt’ Season 2: Every Unanswered Question We Have About the Next Shift",
    "article_text": "If you’re like me, you haven’t stopped thinking aboutThe Pitt. Ever since the Max medical dramawrapped upits wildly successful first season earlier this month, I’ve been mentally stuck inside the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center, wondering how Noah Wyle's Dr. Michael Robinavitch (akaDr. Robby) and his robust team of resident and student doctors, nurses, and social workers have been handling the aftermath of one of the craziest shifts of their lives. Yes, after spending 15 non-stop hours watching this razor-sharp, burnt-out, and mostly functional work family save lives with spontaneous diagnoses, countless intubations, and gnarly IV drills, the drop-off has hit me hard. I spent last Thursday night staring into the abyss (in the same way Dr. Abbott surveyed Pittsburgh from atop the hospital after another traumatic night), trying to cope with the fact that there was no new episode ofThe Pittto consume. Its absence left a void that not even a couple Iron City brews in the park could numb. Fortunately,The Pitt’s creator R. Scott Gemmill, executive producer John Wells, and Wyle are already cranking out scripts for Season 2, which is scheduled to drop in January and take place roughly 10 months after the trauma of Pitt Fest—on Fourth of July weekend, no less. That’s good news for fans eager to see TNT disasters,grillingmishaps, and severe sunburns around the emergency wing. Still, despite the accelerated turnaround, that leaves a whole nine months to speculate and ruminate—or if you’re a real sicko, produce social edits shipping romantic character arcs—about the trajectories and near futures of PTMC’s finest. Based on the way that “9:00 P.M.” ended, and the events that transpired throughout that exhaustive day, it’s only natural that we have some questions that need answers! The standard to which Robby holds himself in the ER is high—sometimes too high. One of his greatest attributes as a boss and lead doctor is his humanity, which often shows up when he pulls residents aside to compliment their workandwhen he struggles to contain his emotions. Still processing the loss of his mentor, Dr. Adamson, who died of complications from COVID-19, Robby fails to resuscitate his step-son’s girlfriend in the penultimate episode, which leads to a total breakdown in the midst of Pitt Fest chaos. When the smoke clears, Robby looks at this temporary abdication of duty as a choke job. But on the hospital roof, Abbott (Shawn Hatosy) gives him some perspective. “So, what? That is what happens when you’re in a war and nothing makes sense,” he says, before preaching: “You rocked that shit down there tonight.” Are his words enough to help Robby weather another year in the ER? The wreckage is still tender. The best case-scenario: Wyle’s scruffy day-shift leader will listen to Dana, give himself some grace, get the therapy he needs, and keep PTMC humming as best it can. “See you Monday,” Robby tells Dana (Katherine LaNasa) as they finish their shift and leave the hospital. She pauses for a beat, then exits quietly. The silence is deafening. After 33 years spent in the ER, Dana has seen and withstood just about everything, but getting clocked in the face by someone twice her size—someone whom she was trying to help!—seems like the final reason to hang up the scrubs. According to Robby, Dana is “the ringleader of our circus,” which is an apt description for her resume, but doesn’t quite capture the unequivocal value she brought to the emergency floor as a charge nurse. As the eyes and ears of the emergency wing, she has strong intuition—to check on a pregnant Dr. Collins, call out ambulance arrivals, stay out of drama, and huddle with Robby when something feelsoff. In other words, she is indispensable—a credit to Katherine LaNasa’s lived-in performance. She’s also justified in wanting a better life. That brief shot of her cleaning out her desk? That wasn’t an accident. This isn’t something a sabbatical can fix. Sadly, I think the answer to this question is “yes.” It’s going to take a lot for Dr. Langdon to earn back Robby’s trust. After discovering (thanks to Dr. Santos) that he’d been hoarding Librium in his locker, Robby immediately ordered Langdon (Patrick Ball) to leave the hospital—but that mandate was short-lived when the resident doctor returned to help the Pitt Fest victims. That made for some awkward interactions between Langdon and Santos, and then for an even tenser showdown between him and Robby once things slowed down. By next summer, it’s likely that Langdon will have completed a rehab stint for his benzo addiction. But even if he does get clean, that doesn’t mean Robby is going to welcome him back with open scrubs—especially not after Langdon accused him of “talking to animals” in the pediatric room in the middle of overseeing a mass casualty event. Is 10 months enough time to forgive that comment? I wouldn’t bet on it. We didn’t get much clarity onwhyMcKay has an ankle monitor. After she tampered with and disengaged the beeping bracelet during the Pitt Fest emergency event, she was promptly handcuffed by police—a spectacle that Robby eventually settles when he convinces the cops to let her stay in the hospital after her life-saving day. She’s promised to go to court to settle the issue before returning to work, but how did her relationship with her ex-partner Chad get here? McKay (Fiona Dourif) knows how to be a good mom, but this custody battle seems thorny. What else don’t we know about her? As a third-year student, Dr. Javadi (Shabana Azeez) looked like she was ready to quit the ER after a hellish first day on the job, but a potential fling with nurse Mateo, plus the fact that her mother works in the building, might be enough to keep her in the show’s periphery. Then there’s Dr. Santos (Isa Briones) and Dr. Whittaker, who will test out being roommates, at least if Whittaker (Gerran Howell) can stand to be called “Huckleberry” every day. The time jump will likely mean he will have graduated, though there’s a chance he starts his residency at PTMC should he not pursue taking care of the city’s unhoused population. As for Santos, she’s quickly made some friends and enemies, no thanks to her rough-edged bedside manner. There’s a reason she’s in the first year of her program, but she’ll have a lot of growing up to do if she hopes to stick around by next summer. There’s been some theorizing that next season might go dark mode and follow Dr. Abbott and the rest of his night-shift staff. We got just a small overlap of their personalities during the mass casualty event, and we certainly have plenty more questions about Abbott, who surprised at least a few doctors when he revealed his prosthetic leg in the park. It would be tough to sacrifice a full season of Robby, but we all know that most Fourth of July fireworks accidents occur at night. If Abbott’s therapist suggests he should be embracing the night, maybe we can spend our time off until January attempting to do the same.",

    "title": "Yes, ‘The Last Of Us’ Just Did That",
    "article_text": "This story contains major—major— spoilers for HBO’sThe Last of Us. Don’t say we didn’t warn you. Abby (Kaitlyn Dever)kept her promise. True to her word, Joel (Pedro Pascal) is now dead, in a horribly violent fashion—the victim of Abby having pulled her bestSignsand swung away just like Rory did at Augusta last week. (By the way, if I had a nickel for every time Pascal died viagnarly head wound on an HBO adaptation, I’d have two nickels—which isn’t that much, but it’s weird that it has happened twice.) Depending upon how online you are, Joel’s abrupt end was either a poorly-kept open secret or the most upsetting and surprising character death since theRed WeddingonGame of Thrones(or the night Ned Stark’s neck met the business end of a blade.) Gamers have had some time to process it: Joel also dies in the Naughty Dog gameThe Last of Us Part II.That news came in a few different waves ahead of the game’s release in June 2020, beginning with aninitial leak of screenshots and details that took place about a month and a half before the game’s release.Some folks wrote it off as speculation, but then, about five days before the game's release, the first three hours of the game made their way online, officially confirming Joel’s fate (thisReddit roundup does a good job of charting the timeline up to the game’s releaseif you’re curious for more). Given the peak-pandemic timing of the reveal, the news felt inescapable; I know I came across it at one point or another. Nevertheless, there’s undoubtedly a subsection of the audience for the series who just had their minds blown by this plot twist. Although the actual circumstances of Joel’s end—i.e., club, head— didn’t change, tonight’s episode “Through the Valley” (written by Craig Mazin and directed by HBO stalwart helmer Mark Mylod, whose work tonight adds another series-regular death episode to a resumé that already includes “Connor's Wedding”) switches up the game’s narrative by having Jackson overrun by Cordyceps, forcing Joel and Ellie apart from one another and trapping Abby and her crew in the midst of it. In the game, Joel and Tommy rescue the others from a sudden horde attack, while you’re playing as Abby, giving the whole sequence an extremely hefty weight. The fall of Jackson gives in the show ratchets the stakes higher, while likely giving Ellie (Bella Ramsey), Tommy (Gabriel Luna), and maybe even Dina (Isabela Merced) an excuse to leave town in pursuit of Abby. Either way, the song remains the same, and elements of the game-to-show adaptation are set in stone. Joel’s dead, and now Ellie will take center stage. It’s probablynotthe last time we’ll see Pedro Pascal onThe Last Of Us, however, as we’re still due a flashback to explain why he and Ellie were at odds with one another in the season premiere. But make no mistake: Joel’s death feels just as gut-wrenching now as it did when the game came out five years ago—magnitudes more if you had no idea it was coming. (Although we won’t blame game players for scrolling through social media in search of tear-jerking reaction clips to help ease the pain of an old wound being reopened.) In the wake of Abby’s bloody act,The Last of Usis now positioning Ellie to embark on an odyssey of vengeance that’ll makeUnforgivenorJohn Wicklook quaint in comparison. What will happen to her soul if she finally gets what she wants? We’ve got five more episodes to find out.",

    "title": "‘Sinners’ Star Jack O'Connell Explains the Whole Irish-Vampire Thing",
    "article_text": "The following article contains major spoilers forSinners. Fans of cult British dramedies will probably still best remember Jack O'Connell from his stretch on the original UK version ofSkins, a show that did grimy teen angst years beforeEuphoriamade it cool. He has since had his time on the big screen, cornering the market on loveable rogues, bad boys and war heroes, from Angelina Jolie's directorial debutUnbrokento Troubles drama‘71,parts that have made the 34-year-old BAFTA winner about as popular as cult screen figures get. And yet 2025 could be the actor's most consequential year to date, with major roles in two of its most hotly anticipated releases—not least28 Years Later, the latest installment in a zombie franchise that has become a beloved horror institution. But first comesSinners, another blood-splattered horror exercise that takes on an entirely different kind of ghoul: vampires, and in Jim Crow-era Mississippi. Helmed byCreedandBlack PantherdirectorRyan Coogler, it contains some of the most pulse-pumping, supercharged filmmaking in a studio blockbuster for years. To try and sum it up in a few sentences:Michael B. Jordanplays a notorious pair of gangster twins, the deliciously named Smoke and Stack, who return to their Deep South hometown after a stint helping out Capone in Chicago and open a juke joint in what they think is an old sawmill. The night begins with dance, revelry, and rip-roaring musical sequences that surge with confidence and stylistic verve. But soon evil arrives, lured there by the generational talents of up-and-coming bluesman Preacher Boy (Miles Caton), so staggeringly brilliant as to tear a hole in the divide between the real and spiritual realms. (Yeah, it's a wild movie.) Said evil is O'Connell's Remmick, a vampire from Ireland who now prowls the Southern states looking to share his gospel of “fellowship and love,” or in other words, to chow down on necks and spread his vampiric plague. He arrives at the juke joint with a pair of recent victims in tow; gloriously gory chaos promptly ensues. Remmick is menacing, duplicitous and devilishly alluring, and with every minute he is on screen, it's clear that O'Connell is having a ton of fun. “In order for him to get what he needs, in order for him to survive, he has to purport to be trustworthy,” O'Connell tellsGQover Zoom. “That's a fucking fantastic character to step into. Personally, I wanna see the prequel to this. So if Coogler's up for it, I am.” Here, O'Connell talksGQthrough Remmick's Irish origins, his gnarly prosthetics work, and the many skills he learned (or relearned), from banjo-plucking to Irish jigging. Plus, he offers a delicately-worded update on his secretive28 Years Laterrole. GQ: You sawSinnersfor the first time at the New York premiere. What was it like catching it with a crowd? Jack O'Connell:Man, it was great. I mean, you're always kind of reluctant to lean into the reaction too much when the audience has been slightly curated. This is one where it might be worth just going and getting a ticket and just sitting in the back row, and sussing it out a bit. Do you do that often? Never done it in me life. [Laughs] But I'd be interested to see what a neutral audience makes of this. How'dSinnerscome your way, and what appealed to you about playing Remmick? I was told I would be sent a script, and I had three, maybe four, hours to read it, before the meeting with Ryan [Coogler] was to be scheduled… I would argue that you definitely need three or four reads of this script before you can wrap your head around it properly. So I was just winging it, man. But I had my talking points, I had stuff that I wanted to ask, so the conversation was kind of dominated by that:What is “Rocky Road to Dublin” doing in this story? Will I really be singing it? Do you like Irish traditional music?I'll talk to anyone all day about Luke Kelly and the Dubliners. What did you make of Remmick's Irish origin story? I think it's beautifully handled. Obviously, by virtue of me dad [who was from Ballyheigue in County Kerry], the Irish story is something that is, and always has been, interesting to me. My understanding [is that Ireland's] biggest export is people. Just to understand the influence that had on the American south at this particular time, and how that found its way into the music there, was something I know that Ryan's savvy to, and I think part of the reason for Remmick being from Ireland. Are there any classic movie vampires that you returned to as a touchpoint? I'd be slightly remiss to not mentionGary Oldman's Dracula [fromBram Stoker's DraculabyFrancis Ford Coppola]. That was mainly down to watching somebody perform with that amount of prosthetic makeup on. It's not something that I'm particularly well-versed in. I once heard Gary Oldman say [that with] prosthetics, first you justhave to surrender to it. And it's totally true, man. You're in the chair for a long, long time... You do feel like, once this all goes on, and once this is attached to me, it's so convincing that it's going to offer a fair amount to the performance. In regards to surrendering to it, once you do that, things reveal themselves to you, and you can incorporate that in the character… Rather than just being like,What the fuck are these fingers doing? Going to the bathroom is obviously impossible. Contact lenses, no one likes being shoved onto their eyeballs. But once they're in, it can take you somewhere entirely different. As an artist, that's a fucking treat. And what's it like having half a guitar hanging out of your face? You just think, “This is demented.” That was all done with magnets, and… Obviously, [per] vampiric lore, vampires are quite reactive to silver. So that smoke you see coming out of Remmick's skull, that's not VFX. They rigged all of that up, and we shot that live. You've got a couple of accents to work with: the Southern twang, and occasionally Remmick drops into an Irish brogue. How do you find accent work? It helps when the accent is very definitely something. If it's generic, or hard to place, I often find that more difficult. So it was great that Remmick was at least pretending to be from North Carolina. And when it came down to his Irishness, I just wanted that to base that from the region my family are from—sort of Kerry, sort of Munster. It's a part of the job that I really enjoy... It's a great entry point for your characters. Had you ever played the banjo beforeSinners? Not really, man. I've got a couple of guitars, so I found it was translatable. But yeah, brilliant team around us, and plenty of time on your hands. I got in there early, and picked up one from Denmark Street. And you've got a couple of great music numbers. Were you apprehensive at all about singing on screen? I was massively apprehensive. I still am. But I think you just gotta fucking go for it, haven't you? I love the idea of doing a musical. This is the nearest thing I've got to it. [It's an] amazing arena to be doing that in, working with [composer] Ludwig Göransson, Serena Göransson—they'd get a tune out of anyone, them two. If we weren't shooting on set, more often than not we were in the recording studio, either trying to find it, or just laying it down. Maybe alittlebit of whiskey, just a touch. Did you work with a vocal coach to find the singing voice, or was that all natural? I was in a privileged enough position with this that the style of music, the traditional Irish stuff, it's kind of in my bones—through Irish dancing as a kid, and then developing a vast kind of appreciation for the great recording artists in this genre of music. Liam Clancy, Luke Kelly… Definitely just belting it out in pubs, and things. You know, it's a music that I have a strong connection to, and it's a bit of a gateway for me in terms of my heritage, and my relationship to my dad, who's passed away. It's all of that, and I guess that's music for you. Remmick gets stuck into an Irish dance late into the film. Did that come back naturally? I think last time I would've done that is probably five or six years ago, downO'Dwyer's Bar in Derby. Couldn't even tell you if it was a weekend or not. But obviously, I did it loads as a kid. And I suppose I did want to try and dust it off a little bit, and see where it's at, aside from this job. BookingSinnersgave me all the excuse I needed. I consulted a dance coach from around here, Angie… We just hooked up, hired a space, and out came the jig again. She was brilliant. The film's standout scene has to be that one-take in the middle. What are your memories of shooting it? It was such a great atmosphere to be around. It was a bit carnival-like… Credit to Ryan for cultivating that type of atmosphere, and the assistant directors for trying to strike that balance between getting shit done, and also getting it done too, and making it feel alive. It was phenomenal to watch, and I just think it's a brilliant cinematic feat. We go through this journey through time, and what blues music was the basis of… I just think it's fucking genius, y'know? To touch on28 Years Laterbriefly, your character is called Sir Jimmy Crystal. What can you say about him? Yes, Sir Lord Jimmy Crystal, [to give the] full moniker. He's a… [O'Connell hesitates] He is a gas cunt. That's going straight in the official bio. I don't know quite how to describe him yet. But thrilling to portray, that's for sure. He definitely exists in the darker pocket, certainly in contrast to anything I've ever played before. This story originally appeared inBritish GQ.",

    "article_text": "The inimitable Marie Brenner has been writing profiles and investigative stories forVanity Fairsince the 1980s, and herinterviewin this issue with Elissa Slotkin is an instant classic. Marie started spending time with the junior senator from Michigan back in early December, before Slotkin made headlines pushing back at Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and OMB director Russell Vought during their Senate confirmation hearings, before she gave the Democratic response to Trump’s joint address to Congress, but just in time to present this sharp portrait as a party searches for its new standard-bearers. Slotkin, a former CIA analyst, has all the ingredients for political success: a compelling personal story, a backbone, and a voice (and in her case, principles to boot). Above all, she radiates authenticity, the quality that by definition you can’t fake. “The thing I pride myself on the most is that I am independently minded,” she tells Marie. “I’m hard to put in a box. But on social issues, I don’t try to tell other people how to live. I don’t always agree with my party on fiscal issues, national security issues. But on who gets to be in the club? I have a pretty expansive view of who gets to see themselves as equal citizens. And I never liked the bullying that went on in certain Republican circles. It really bothers me.” Another instant classic: Anthony Breznican’scover storyon Sebastian Stan, who is fascinating as a leading man. His range is tremendous; who else could pivot fromGossip Girlto Captain America’s sidekick Bucky Barnes to a young Donald Trump? Stan comes to acting with an immigrant’s history, a kid who threw himself into stage roles because they offered him different ways to envision himself in his new world. His mother, Georgeta Orlovschi, a pianist, fled political upheaval in Romania, first for Vienna, where she established herself before sending for Sebastian to join her, then to the States. This winter, she accompanied her son to the Oscars, where he wasnominated for best actorfor his role inThe Apprentice,the film written byVF’s Gabriel Sherman, about Trump’s rise to power under the tutelage of Roy Cohn. Stan’s father had left Romania even earlier, going into exile after having worked to help other Romanians escape government persecution. “I have always made the argument that immigrants to some extent are more patriotic than even the people that are born here because they don’t take things for granted,” Sebastian tells Anthony in reference to his father—words that resonate deeply at this particular moment, when our own government is denying even legal immigrants their rights.

    "title": "How Sebastian Stan Survived Communism and Became Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter",
    "article_text": "The sun is going down fast, and Sebastian Stan is trying to get inside a locked Romanian church. This windblown Monday in late February would have been his late father’s 70th birthday, and before the day is gone, he is determined to light a candle and say a prayer in the old man’s memory at a place that had meaning for them both. Stan was born and raised in Romania, where faith and superstition became rooted together for him. “Whenever I’m in a church, I have to go likethisthree times,” he says, making the sign of the cross with his right hand. “Ihaveto do it. And I have to do it three times before I get on a plane.” Just before we arrived at this Southern California church in pursuit of the sacred, Stan was indulging the profane. Is there another way to describe an encounter with a remote-controlled talking penis? The actor is based in New York, so when he visits LA, as he’s doing now to attend the Academy Awards, he has a full to-do list. Today, that includes a visit to the makeup studio Autonomous FX, which won an Emmy for transforming Stan and Lily James into Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson for the Hulu seriesPam & Tommy.The whole day is a microcosm of what has established Stan as one of the more daring and endearing actors working today. He thinks deeply but has a wild side too. We’ll get back to the robo-penis later. It’s getting late, and Stan has to hurry through rush-hour traffic to get right with God for his father’s birthday. The Biserica Ortodoxă Română Sfânta Treime (or Holy Trinity Romanian Orthodox Church) that he wants to visit to light the tribute to his father is meaningful to the Romanian immigrants who founded it, but it’s no soaring cathedral. It’s tiny, a single-story white stucco structure with a squat steeple that’s hidden behind much taller trees. Across the street is the headquarters of the Bilt-Well Roofing company, which is a comparatively much bigger operation. Stan left Romania more than three decades ago, but it’s still a core part of him. So is the uncertainty of growing up in a place where the government dominated and demoralized its own citizens—which makes him especially attuned to authoritarianism in his adopted country of the United States. His old accent is gone, of course. Few who have seen him onscreen as the Winter Soldier in a decade and a half of Marvel movies—including the upcoming outcast team-up adventureThunderbolts*—could find a trace of it. Stan’s character of Bucky Barnes is as all-American as his closest friend, Captain America. The character was a Brooklyn native, but Stan took on a neighboring Queens inflection for another famous (or infamous) performance,playing young Donald Trumpin the scathing true-life dramaThe Apprentice.The role earned him both abest-actor Oscar nominationthis year and the enduring rage of a vengeful, unchecked president. New faces and new voices were exactly what drew Stan to acting in high school. He moved to the US in the 1990s, and—as an immigrant kid still struggling to adapt to the language and culture—it was a lot more fun to be Bum Number Two in a production ofLittle Shop of Horrorsthan it was to be himself. “I just remember how fun it was to try to change everything,” he says. Being onstage turned a shy kid into a scene-stealing extrovert—and he was good at it. His mother sent him to summer theater camp not far from their new home just outside New York City, and by the end of high school, he was being cast as the lead inCyrano de Bergerac.He was a good-looking kid, but he still loved hiding his face beneath Cyrano’s oversized nose. “You’re dressing up, you’re putting on fake beards, you’re walking differently, you’re changing,” he tells me. “You take big swings. You take bigger swings than you do when you’re a young actor coming to LA to go on pilot season auditions and they try to cast you as yourself—and you’re onlyallowedto play yourself.” “SEBASTIAN HAS ALWAYS BEEN REALLY FEARLESS,” SAYS CHRIS EVANS. “YOU CAN SEE THAT IN HIS CHOICES. HE TAKES BIG SWINGS.” Stan prefers to push himself to the background. He is not an oversharer. He’ll talk about characters or stunts or the meaning he sees in a particular movie or TV show, but while fans know every detail about the lives of other performers they adore, Stan has built a following while keeping the specifics of his own life somewhat obscure. The pilgrimage to light a candle for his dad is something he would ordinarily have done by himself. But Stan agreed to share something of himself for this story, in defiance of the actorly part of his personality that wishes when you looked at him, you’d see someone else. He pulls on the handle of Holy Trinity’s main doorway. It doesn’t budge. “Doesn’t look very open,” he says. He’s not ready to give up. He walks around the church’s property and finds an older man sweeping up outside the congregation’s neighboring all-purpose hall. Stan opens his arms and addresses him with a traditional Romanian greeting of respect: “Sărut mâna…” I kiss your hand. A week later, Stan is wearing a Prada tuxedo. It’s the night of the Academy Awards at theVanity FairOscar Party, and instead of trying to win over a skeptical church janitor, he’s trying to reassure his fellow actors and filmmakers that he is just fine, despite losing best actor toAdrien Brodyearlier in the evening. (TheVFOscar Party is off-the-record, but Stan gave us permission to set the scene.) Most well-wishers now come to him with condolences, but he didn’t expect to win, and in some ways he may have avoided a bigger headache. Trump has made political retribution a hallmark of his new term in the White House, and he was enraged by the sheer fact ofThe Apprentice’s existence. The movie, written by veteran journalist andVanity Fairspecial correspondentGabriel Sherman, depicts Trump in the 1970s as a needy wannabe mogul, eager to escape the shadow of his powerful father and being taught by Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong) that underhanded tactics are a shortcut to success. When the movie was released last October, a month before the election, the once and future presidentunloaded on itvia Truth Social, calling it “a cheap, defamatory, and politically disgusting hatchet job,” and adding: “So sad that HUMAN SCUM, like the people involved in this hopefully unsuccessful enterprise, are allowed to say and do whatever they want.” It’s unlikely that Trump had actually seen the movie at that point, but Stan has little doubt that he’s watched it since. “I would put money down he’s seen it 100 fucking times, of course, because he’s a narcissist,” Stan told me the previous week. “And I bet you there’s certain things he likes about it.” Such as? “How he looked,” Stan replies with a smile. He is too modest to say it directly, but he’s more handsome than Trump ever was, even with the prosthetic makeup that thickened the actor’s neck and dental devices called plumpers that pooched out his lips and jowls. Autonomous FX did those makeup effects too, allowing him to look more like the disco-era version of Trump. Capturing him physically, while also surfacing the scared and desperate young man beneath that exterior, is what earned Stan hisOscar nomination. “He loses his humanity. I guess that’s essentially what happens,” Stan said of the movie. “As an actor, all you’re trying to do is just look at these very human things and identify with them.” That doesn’t mean he wants Trump to put him at the top of his enemies list. Before the Academy Awards, Stan said he was trying not to worry about potential retribution and didn’t think it would happen, unless…“I don’t know, maybe if I win the Oscar, which is like 0.0000 percent.” “HE’S WILLING TO PLAY UNLIKABLE CHARACTERS,” SAYS JESSICA CHASTAIN. “HE’S NOT HAPPY TO JUST BE A CONVENTIONAL MOVIE STAR.” So yes, he’s feeling fine at the party. He took with him other honors from the backslapping season, like when Jane Fonda name-dropped him while accepting a lifetime achievement award at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. “While you may hate the behavior of your character, you have to understand and empathize with the traumatized person you’re playing. Thinking of Sebastian Stan inThe Apprentice,” she said. Stan said her shout-out was “maybe better than winning an Oscar.” “I wasn’t at the SAG Awards,” he continued. “I wasn’t nominated. I didn’t go. But somebody told me to turn on the TV because Jane Fonda mentioned my name. I would never have thought in my life that she would know who I am.” Jacket byPrada;vintage T-shirt and boots fromStock Vintage;pants byPrada;belt byArtemas Quibble;necklace and watch byCartier. Then there was the actual trophy he won, aGolden Globefor best actor in a musical or comedy, bestowed on him not forThe Apprenticebut forA Different Man,in which he plays a man with a disfiguring genetic condition who undergoes a radical medical procedure to look more “normal.” The back-to-back recognition caught the attention of Hollywood’s power brokers, including Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, who has been working with him for nearly 15 years now. “To see him winning a Golden Globe for one movie and then being nominated for an Academy Award for another movie in the same year is pretty darn impressive,” Feige says. The Golden Globe win stirred unexpected emotions in Stan. “You never really think that you’re going to be up there,” he’s told me. “I realized from that Golden Globe moment that when it happens, it’s massive. You can’t help but reflect on everything and everyone that contributed to you getting there.” One of them is Annabelle Wallis, Stan’s partner of several years. The couple had kept their relationship private before the Globes, when she accompanied him and got an “I love you” callout from him on the stage. Wallis joined Stan at the Oscars as well, wearing a forget-me-not blue Grecian-style gown, and he introduces her happily to me at the Oscar party. (She has heard all about our adventure trying to get into the Romanian church.) Wallis is an actor herself, best known forThe TudorsandPeaky Blinders,but their relationship is not something either of them discusses. “I feel like it’s really difficult nowadays to be able to have any privacy whatsoever,” he said. “It’s the one part of my life that I try to keep somewhat for myself, even though it sort of ends up being out there.” Stan gets that protective streak from another person who helped him get where he is—his mother, Georgeta Orlovschi, who also accompanied him to the Oscars. She raised him for many years as a single mom after she split from his father when Stan was young. “They were both very strong individuals with very strong personalities,” he says. “Neither wanted to be justified by the other. I think they both had a rebellious spirit.” His father later disappeared completely, going into exile in the States. Constantin Stan was a cargo-ship worker who helped fellow countrymen evade government persecution that pervaded Romania in the decades after World War II. “He was a bit of a hero in my town,” Stan says. “My parents were part of the youth that were standing up to Communism. My father was helping people escape the country illegally, to the point where he was a wanted man. And he himself had to flee.” Stan grew up not really knowing the man everyone else knew by the nickname “Tino,” apart from occasional telephone calls. But if his dad could vanish, it seemed plausible that his mother might too. Then one day she did. Stan was about eight years old when his mother fled Romania to set up a new life for them abroad. Throughout his childhood, government mismanagement and corruption had led to food scarcity, fuel shortages, and electricity blackouts. The eventual revolution culminated in the downfall and execution of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu in 1989. “I watched him get shot on television,” Stan says. “I remember that.” The aftermathwasn’t necessarily better. “It was chaos,” Stan says, noting “how many orphaned kids were in Bucharest after the revolution because everybody didn’t have money. Nobody knew how to live. They’d been so suppressed.” He spent a year with his grandparents before joining his mother in Austria. “She came and got me when she finally had a job and established herself enough there in Vienna,” he says. The anxiety he felt about losing her continued even after they were reunited. “She was working. She was playing piano at night when she could, and then she wasteachingpiano all day long. So at 9 or 10 years old, I was taking the trolley to school myself. I was taking the subway back myself,” Stan recalls. “Then I was coming home and I was alone, and I would have to make myself food and I’d do my homework and I’d wait for her to come home. That was a lot of alone time for a kid in a foreign country.” He learned independence, but it scarred him too. “I remember waiting for her to get home and worrying: What if shedoesn’tcome home? I can see how that’s worked against me in certain ways and how it’s totally benefited me in other ways. You have a lot of time with your imagination when you’re a kid like that alone. So I feel I’m very good at using my imagination to believe certain things, which helps me in a way. But then there are times where I’m feeling a degree of uncertainty and lack of control over my life that can be paralyzing.” “MY PARENTS WERE PART OF THE YOUTH STANDING UP TO COMMUNISM,” HE SAYS OF HIS ROMANIAN CHILDHOOD. “MY FATHER WAS HELPING PEOPLE ESCAPE THE COUNTRY ILLEGALLY—TO THE POINT HE HIMSELF HAD TO FLEE.” Stan was around 12 when his mother began dating a man named Anthony Fruhauf, who was the headmaster of a small private high school in central New York. When they got married, Stan’s mother made plans to move with her son once again, this time to the United States. “He was really kind. My stepdad was a real influence in a good way,” Stan says. “In those early years in America, speaking English with him at home I think probably led to how I lost my accent.” He was all right seeing it go. He wanted to belong. All this surfaced when Stan was onstage accepting his Golden Globe. “This is for my mom who left Romania in search of a better life, and for my stepfather, Tony, who took on a single mom and a grown-up kid,” he said, hoisting his award as his voice broke. Pointing heavenward, he added: “Thank you for being a real man.” Coat byBottega Veneta;belt byArtemas Quibble;necklace and watch byCartier;vintage T-shirt fromStock Vintage;vintage pants fromFront General Store. Despite craving stability, Stan learned the value of taking chances, which has earned him a daredevil reputation among his actor friends. “Sebastian has always been really fearless,” saysChris Evans, who first appeared opposite Stan in 2011’sCaptain America: The First Avengerand costarred with him repeatedly as the Marvel Cinematic Universe expanded. “You can see that in his choices. He takes big swings. When that Trump movie was kicking around, I remember thinking, I wonder who is going to takethisjob? It’s just got so many strings attached to it. And I was sounsurprised when I heard it was Sebastian.” The devil on Stan’s shoulder urging him forward wasJessica Chastain, who became a close friend after they worked together on 2015’sThe Martianand later the 2022 spy thrillerThe 355.“When we were on set forThe 355,that’s when he first told me he had had the offer to play Donald Trump. A thing about Sebastian that people might not realize is he’s very, very thoughtful, almost to a point where he overthinks things. It could cause a little bit of stress. He was like, ‘Well, what do you think? What would you do?’ I said, ‘Do it.’ I was like, ‘What do you have to lose? Take a risk.’ As long as it doesn’t cause you physical danger, if something scares you—do it.” Chastain saw Stan do that very thing in 2017’sI, Tonya,in which he played Tonya Harding’s then husband, who hatched the scheme to sabotage her rival, Nancy Kerrigan. “When so many people are trying to make you this conventional movie star, it’s a risk to do something that isn’t that,” Chastain says. “He’s willing to play unlikable characters. I find that executives have trouble with characters that may be complex and have dark sides to them. He really embraces that. He’s not happy to just be a conventional movie star.” Marvel Studios was looking for a dark side when they were casting the role of Bucky Barnes in the first Captain America movie in 2010. Stan was a relative unknown, though he’d had a recurring role onGossip Girlas a pathological liar of a rich kid. “You could see that he has so much inside him and so much behind his eyes. I’ll never forget that,” Feige says. “I said to Stephen Broussard, who was one of the producers onCaptain America,‘He’s going to be a good Bucky, but he’s going to be agreatWinter Soldier.’ ” Bucky evolves into that villainous alter ego in subsequent MCU stories, going from fearless soldier to shell-shocked prisoner of war and, eventually, mind-controlled assassin who struggles to break his programming and redeem himself. Getting the part was beyond game-changing for the actor. “I was actually struggling with work,” Stan says. “I had just gotten off the phone with my business manager, who told me I was saved by $65,000 that came in residuals fromHot Tub Time Machine.” He’d played the smarmy bully in that comedy a year before. Now it was his salvation. Since then, the Winter Soldier has become one of the most beloved and relatable characters in the MCU, even thoughhis storyis far from the traditional everyman narrative. Bucky resonates because he’s damaged goods—the patron saint of fuckups struggling to do right. The arc culminates in his new lead role inThunderbolts*,with Bucky leading a team of former troublemakers and outcasts. Feige says that, without Stan, the character’s strange journey wouldn’t have been the emotional gut punch it is. After lunch, Stan goes to his appointment at Autonomous FX. The headquarters is tucked near an ice warehouse and a scrapyard in an industrial neighborhood of Van Nuys. Stan is trying on a pair of fake teeth that slip over his perfect pearly whites. The goal is to give him a more regular-guy look forFjord,the movie he’s shooting in Norway with filmmaker Cristian Mungiu, a fellow native of Romania. There’s a story behind these teeth—dating back to before Stan got braces as an adult. “When I got Invisalign, I was so obsessed with them,” he says. “The more you wear them, the faster they work. So I actually wore them at the fuckingCaptain America: The Winter Soldierpremiere. I have them in and I’m smiling with them and people can tell. I was self-conscious because my teeth were always a little….” He splays his fingers into crooked angles. The prosthetic teeth are modeled on Stan’s own before he fixed them. Stan has another blast from his past waiting for him too. After the fitting, Jason Collins, the founder and lead creative force behind Autonomous FX, takes Stan through the workshops, where sculptors are making limbs, bodies, and demonic babies. On the shelves, busts of other actors like Christian Bale and Annette Bening, used for previous projects, stare down with vacant eyes. Collins and his company essentially provide the level-up version of the fake beards and noses that Stan first loved about acting in high school—except occasionally X-rated. As part of this nostalgia trip, Collins brings out a plastic tub with the remains of the robotic erection fromPam & Tommy.The latex has dried out and decayed away. This penis “character” was voiced by Jason Mantzoukas and had strong opinions about the Mötley Crüe drummer’s romance with theBaywatchstar. It was a risky creative choice by the showrunners but added levity to the series and was inspired by Lee’s own autobiography, in which he banters philosophically with his sex organ. The makeup team and the actor forged a bond along the way. “It really becomes a partnership,” Collins says. “We stare at him for weeks and months at a time. So we know the physical structure. We know what the span of his legs is and all that other stuff.” “You get to know the actorverywell,” says Stan. Their earliest meeting involved figuring out how to fit a prosthetic over his actual privates and snake cables for the controls down his backside. “When I first came here, they made a replica to work on. So they had to castthis,” Stan says, gesturing to his crotch. “I remember you’re like, ’All right buddy, well, I guess it’s good to meet you.’” Jacket byBottega Veneta;vintage T-shirt and boots fromStock Vintage;belt byArtemas Quibble;necklace and watch byCartier. After the makeup shop, Stan heads for the last stop of the day, the Orthodox church. After a persuasive conversation in Romanian, the custodian agrees to unlock the chapel for him. “Vezi ca pana,” Stan says.You’ll see it’s only for a moment. As the doors swing open, the faces of saints stare down at us from rows of miniature shrines, not unlike the busts of the famous actors in the prosthetics lab. Both places represent things Stan believes in—the ability to transform into something new and a yearning to connect with something beyond yourself. Stan doesn’t claim to be especially religious, but the Holy Trinity chapel takes him back to that fearful time living under Communist dictatorship, when he put his faith in higher powers and prayed for the best. “We would go to church a lot when I was little,” he says. “It’s still tied into certain things for me, because I felt such a degree of powerlessness over decisions being made early on.” STAN IS NOT AN OVERSHARER. BUT HE AGREED TO SHARE SOMETHING OF HIMSELF HERE, IN DEFIANCE OF THE ACTORLY PART OF HIM THAT WISHES WHEN YOU LOOKED AT HIM, YOU’D SEE SOMEONE ELSE. Stan and the man he wants to commemorate with a candle were estranged for years. He and his father finally reconnected when Stan was around 18 and began visiting Los Angeles for auditions. The New York kid would save money by staying with his father, who had settled in the San Fernando Valley (not far from the makeup shop, actually) and worked, once again, in shipping. The periodic visits brought them closer, and the relationship stayed tight until his dad died unexpectedly from COVID on a trip back to Romania in 2021. Stan sometimes thinks his father’s story might make a good movie. In Romania, Tino was legendary for sneaking contraband Western goods like blue jeans and bananas into the country while smuggling dissidents out aboard the same vessels. “He worked hard and he loved America and he believed in being free,” Stan says. “I have always made the argument that immigrants to some extent are more patriotic than even the people that are born here because they don’t take things for granted. At least that’s what I saw in my father.” The janitor guides us to the back of the church, where there’s a small side room with a votive stand arrayed with unlit candles. “Can you give me one second? I’ll be right back,” Stan says. He disappears into the shadowy alcove and strikes a light. Later, driving away from the chapel, Stan tries to explain why he felt so compelled to go there. “I think it’s just the acknowledgment of how fragile we all are. Sometimes you go somewhere where it’s really not about you. It’s a moment to let go. Turn off for a while,” he says. “You don’t have to be anything in there. You don’t have to think any which way.” He says something similar via text two weeks later, when he’s in Norway, starting work on his new role inFjord—with his new teeth that resemble his old teeth. “The feeling is always the same. Like it’s the first time,” Stan writes. “It’s always a mix of fear and hope. It’s losing yourself. It’s a free fall. Every time.” GROOMING, JAMIE TAYLOR; TAILOR, HASMIK KOURINIAN; SET DESIGN, LIZZIE LANG. PRODUCED ON LOCATION BY PORTFOLIO ONE. FOR DETAILS, GO TO VF.COM/CREDITS.

    "title": "JD Vance and King Charles, Among the Pope's Final Visitors, Express Condolences",
    "article_text": "King Charles IIIsaid he andQueen Camilla“were deeply saddened” by the death of Pope Francis in a statement released on Monday morning. The king and queen, who undertook a royal tour to Italy earlier this month,were among the pope’s final visitors at the Vatican. On April 9, as the couple celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary, they had a short meeting with the pope where they shared “best wishes” for his recovery from a bout with double pneumonia. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. The pope had been recovering from his five-week hospitalization sincehis release on March 23, but he continued to visit with worshippers. On Easter Sunday, he made an appearance on the St. Peter Square balcony following a short meeting with Vice PresidentJD Vance. In his message, King Charles referenced the pope’s annual Easter remarks, which were delivered Sunday. “Our heavy hearts have been somewhat eased, however, to know that his Holiness was able to share an Easter Greeting with the Church and the world he served with such devotion throughout his ministry,” the statement continued. “The Queen and I remember with particular affection our meetings with His Holiness over the years and we were greatly moved to have been able to visit him earlier in the month.” Pope Francis meets with Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall during the Royal couple's visit to the Vatican on April 4, 2017 in Vatican City, Vatican. The king and queen first met the pontiff whenthey visited Italy in April 2017, and in 2019, Charles met him again whenhe visited the Vaticanto attend a St. Peter’s Square ceremony canonizing five new saints. However, April’s visit was their first since Charles ascended to the throne and became the head of the Church of England. Pope Francis also met Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip duringtheir 2014 visit to the Vatican. On Monday morning, Vance also shareda messageabout the pope’s death. Vance, who converted to Catholicism six years ago, met with the pope on Sunday morning as a part of a larger visit to the Vatican. “I just learned of the passing of Pope Francis. My heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him,” he said on his X (formerly Twitter) account. “I was happy to see him yesterday, though he was obviously very ill.” He added the link to a homily that Francis shared in 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic. Vance’s trip began with a Saturday meeting with two of the pope’s top deputies,Cardinal Pietro ParolinandArchbishop Paul Gallagher.According to the Vatican, the meeting included “an exchange of opinions” regarding international conflicts and “difficult humanitarian situations, with particular attention to migrants, refugees, and prisoners.” Pope Francis meets with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and delegation during an audience at Casa Santa Marta on April 20, 2025 in Vatican City, Vatican. On Sunday, Vance returned for a 15-minute meeting with Pope Francis in the papal residence, Casa Santa Marta, as Easter Mass took place at St. Paul’s Basilica.  In a video released afterward, the pope thanked Vance for his visit through an interpreter. “I know you’ve not been feeling great, but it’s good to see you in better health,”Vance said. “I pray for you every day.” Following the encounter,Vance met his family for Easter Massat St. Paul’s, before later boarding a plane to India. Francis went to the balcony over St. Peter’s Square, where his Easter message was read by ArchbishopDiego Ravelli.It included a few pointed comments about migrants, which has becomeone of Vance’s signature issuesas a member of the Trump administration. “How much contempt is stirred up at times towards the vulnerable, the marginalized, and migrants,”the pope’s message read. “On this day, I would like all of us to hope anew and to revive our trust in others, including those who are different than ourselves, or who come from distant lands, bringing unfamiliar customs, ways of life and ideas.” RememberingPope Francis Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis CanThe Last of UsSurvive theGruesome Deathof Its Main Character?

    "title": "‘Sinners’ Breakout Miles Caton Didn’t Know He’d Signed On for a Vampire Movie",
    "article_text": "Miles Catonhas a “once-in-a-lifetime voice.” So it’s no wonder thatRyan Cooglercast the 20-year-old inSinners,his new thriller that’s much more than just a vampire movie. It also dabbles in mysticism, explores ancestral histories, and is a love letter to the power of blues music. The latter is where Caton comes in. The first-time actor, who stars in the film as musician Sammie, is the son of gospel singerTiminey Figueroaand a musical prodigy himself. At the age of 12, he appeared on NBC’s talent competitionLittle Big Shots,and he’s been touring with Grammy winnerH.E.R.since he was 16 years old. “I grew up in church, in a family full of musicians, so that’s something that has been ingrained into my life and everything that I do since I was a kid,” he tellsVanity Fair.“The culture of it means a lot to me. To be able to have this experience—to do research and learn about the blues and the story behind it, was really special for me.” Set in 1932 in Mississippi, the film follows twins Smoke and Stack (both played byMichael B. Jordan) who open a juke joint with their cousin Sammie, a musician whose talents attract the attention of bloodthirsty vampires. When Caton was first tapped to audition for a top-secret new movie, he had no idea it was a film that Coogler wrote and would direct. After acing the audition process—on his first tape, he sang Sam Cooke’s “Bring It On Home to Me”—Caton had to learn blues guitar and how to hold his own opposite Jordan. In the film, Caton makes this all look easy. Now thatSinnersis both a critical and box office hit (it landed number one at the box office this weekend with $48 million domestically), Caton spoke toVanity Fairabout what he learned from working with Coogler and Jordan. Vanity Fair:How do you relate to Sammie? Miles Caton:In a lot of ways, we were kind of in the same place in life. We were both 19, both come from a religious background. So those were things that clicked for me immediately. And then just seeing his ambition, and his determination to pursue his music, was something that resonated for me. After your audition tapes, what happened next? I was brought in for a chemistry read with Michael B. Jordan and Ryan. I worked with [composer]Ludwig Göransson.He played me “Death Letter Blues” by Son House. That was one of the songs that I started learning to get a feel for what the process would be like for learning the blues. And I felt like the chemistry read went pretty well. I was nervous, but I was excited to be in that room and just to get to meet those people. I went back home, and I think it was a week that went by. I was at the mall when got a call from Ryan Coogler telling me he wanted me to be a part of it. I lost it. And then after I got the role, they sent the whole script. That’s where I found out everything that the role entailed. You didn’t even know there were vampires in it when you were auditioning? No, it was a surprise. So my initial thought was, Whoa, what’s going on? And then as you read the story, and as you see how he blends all of those things together with the 1930s and Jim Crow and Prohibition, and you see how he ties all of those elements in the music, I thought it was going to be something that was really different. It was risky, but something that would be really impactful. Was acting something you had always hoped to pursue? When this opportunity presented itself, it wasn’t. I was on tour. I was really submerging myself in the music side, working, producing my stuff, and working on building my sound. That was the main focus and still is today. But when this opportunity came, I just took it as a chance to really further myself in everything. As a kid, I was always the family clown—just always doing stuff to try to make people laugh. So I felt like eventually that was something I would branch off to. When this opportunity came, it was something I had to do. How much time did you have to learn to play the blues guitar? Definitely not much time. We had two months for me to prepare. I started working withRandy Bowland,who’s a great touring guitarist, and we got him to help me learn the fundamentals. And Ryan sent me an essential blues playlist of different artists. I would travel out to Philly to practice guitar with Randy, and they sent us a resonated guitar, which I hadn’t really messed with before. So that was something new. And the whole slide aspect was something that was a challenge. I felt like the more time went on, I kind of got the grasp of it enough to get out there and start playing. Since this was your first movie, were you nervous? I remember it was really the table reading—that was the moment where I was like, “Wow, okay, I’m here now. I’ve got to deliver.” And it was nerve-racking. But at the same time, I just felt like I was supposed to be there. I felt like I was meant to be there, and meant to soak up and learn from the incredible people around me. The first scene we shot was actually the car scene with Smoke and Stack and Sammie, and they’re performing “Traveling.” I remember waking up that day and just practicing and getting ready. We were at a sugar cane plantation, and it was like 100-something degrees. We were in wool suits. But it was incredible. The energy and the adrenaline was running that day for sure. How would you describe working with Michael B. Jordan as he’s playing twins? His dedication is really something that inspired me throughout. I think that inspired everybody else too—just to see how he broke down those characters, how he would map out their different personalities and the reasons why they do things. When he walked in the room, you knew which twin it was. There was no question about it. There’s an incredible scene in the film where Sammie is playing, and performers from different times and cultures appear as an exploration of the way storytelling and music has been tied together through time and space. What was it like to shoot that? It was dope. It was definitely one of the highlights of filming for me. I remember reading it on the script and thinking, Yo, this is incredible, but how is this going to work on the screen? They made an animated video of how it would look, and how they would go through the camera changes, and how they would pan to show the different ancestors and the different culture and genres of the music. So to get there and see all of that come together was dope. Being there on the day, you have the whole cast there, and everybody's dancing and just being in the moment. So that made it special for me, just to be there and to be able to perform. It felt like a real performance. And I think that was something that was important for Ryan: for it not to feel like a musical, but for it to feel like a real performance. When did you know you were working on something special? On one of the final days on set, they played a 10-minute clip just kind of throwing together everything we had shot so far. Just to see everybody in the room and how they reacted to it, all the work we had put in during that time—I think from then we knew that this film would be something special. It meant a lot to us regardless of what the outcome would be. To see that people are receiving it, and it is meaningful to people now, it is really special. What’s next? Do you want to do more acting? I definitely want to do more acting. I am working on some things, but I’m also excited for music. I have a song that I’m dropping really soon, and so I’m just expecting the people to rock with me and stay tuned for what's next. But I’m so excited. This is an incredible moment right now, and I’m just soaking it all in.

    "title": "Jane Holzer Thought Andy Warhol Could Make Her a Star. Instead, She Helped Him Reach a New Level of Fame.",
    "article_text": "In June 1964, the pop artist Andy Warhol attended a party at the home of Jane and Leonard Holzer who lived in a twelve-room apartment at 955 Park Avenue with a maid, a butler, a Yorkshire terrier, and a toy poodle. Warhol had always been intrigued by female fashion, and twenty-three-year-oldJane Holzerwore designer clothes and had a distinctive style that was all her own. With a long, abrupt face that, at unguarded moments, looked haunted, Holzer possessed a distinctive, arresting look. Holzer was attractive, yes, but her glory was her magnificent hair — an enveloping golden mane reminiscent of the MGM lion’s, a splendid statement that announced her presence to the world. Holzer was much more than simply pretty. She hadpresence. ‘Warhol's Muses’ by Laurence Leamer Penguin Random House Three or four days after the dinner party, Holzer was walking along Madison Avenue with the photographerDavid Baileywhen he waved at Warhol on the other side of the street. The pop artist came sprinting over. Warhol had been intrigued by Holzer, and he would not miss this opportunity to develop a relationship. After spending several years devoted to making pop art, Warhol had started spending much of his time creating underground movies. When Warhol asked Holzer, after chatting for a few minutes, if she would like to be in one of his films, she immediately said, “Sure, anything’s better than [being] a Park Avenue housewife.” She was hardly a housewife, but she was canny enough to know that a little self-deprecation goes a long way. The two sized each other up right away. Warhol saw a dynamic, charismatic woman with money and connections. Holzer, for her part, wanted to be a star and thought Warhol could get her there. The sight of a camera sent shivers through her. “My chin goes up,” she said. “My tummy goes in.” Jane Holzer in 1966. A plan was quickly hatched: Warhol would feature Holzer in his underground movies and accompany her to parties and dinners around Manhattan. He would give her a bit of his downtown cool and avant-garde excitement, and she would give him entrée to elite circles he could not move in alone. “I think he saw somebody just made for his purposes,” reflected Isabel Eberstadt, who at that time was writing a profile of Warhol and his scene. “She [Holzer] was very narcissistic, very ostentatious. She was packageable.” Holzer had a new patina of glamour about her. Now, when she went out on her evening rounds to both the exclusive uptown parties and seedier art-world hangouts farther downtown, people were beginning to recognize her. And while she had the newfound prestige of a movie actress, she did not have to be embarrassed by having her East Side friends see the films. Overnight success rarely happens overnight. In Holzer’s case, her celebrity percolated for more than a year, until it exploded into the heavens and beyond in the fall of 1964. Suddenly, her face was everywhere. And she even had a new name—Carol Bjorkman, aWomen’s Wear Dailycolumnist, named Holzer “Baby Jane,” after the 1962 horror thrillerWhat Ever Happened to Baby Jane?(in which Bette Davis plays a demented woman who tortures her disabled sister, played by Joan Crawford). Baby Jane hardly seemed a flattering title, but the name stuck. Jane Holzer in October 1966. As Baby Jane Holzer traveled from the upscale world of fashion and society to the deepest regions of the hip and the new and culturally dangerous, she appeared as comfortable in one world as the other. She never wore the same thing twice. How could she when the paparazzi constantly shot her? Baby Jane was there whenGlamourmagazine hosted a splendid party at the Palladium dance hall. When Coco Chanel showed her new collection the next month, Baby Jane flew to Paris to be in the front row, perfectly attired for a day of haute couture. She was everywhere. She knew everyone. And she wasfabulous, darling. The society reporters decided that Baby Jane Holzer was someone their readers wanted to know about. If she attended an event, they almost always mentioned her. If she wore a designer gown, the designer’s name was often in the paper, too. But they didn’t squander their words on Warhol. As notorious as he might be to some in the art world, to the public he was still an obscure artist of no consequence. No matter how close Warhol hung on to Baby Jane, the columnists treated him like he did not exist. Baby Jane took Warhol to the Rolling Stones’ first New York performance in October 1964 at the Academy of Music theater on East 14th Street. The event occurred in the afternoon, when most rock and rollers have barely woken up. Baby Jane arrived early and had the credentials to go backstage to meet the band. Mick greeted her, “Koom on, love, give us a kiss!” Warhol arrived in a limousine alongside his assistant,Gerard Malanga, dressed in a pin-striped black suit. Malanga had sultry good looks and nearly shoulder-length blond hair. Warhol had hired the college student in June 1963 for the $1.25 minimum wage. Since Malanga had already had a summer job silk-screening fabric with antique designs cut up into ties, he had the necessary skills to jump right in and create alongside the artist himself. Warhol and his assistant had worked together on these silk-screened images for more than a year at this point. Malanga’s first job was working on a portrait of Elizabeth Taylor. He was not simply a technician but a collaborator, suggesting innovative ways to transform some pictures. He even signed some of the paintings when Warhol was not rubberstamping them with his name. As the vehicle reached the front of the theater, the reams of teenage girls outside started screaming, pounding their hands on the car. They weren’t going crazy for Warhol. They had mistaken the lean, handsome Malanga for Mick Jagger. When the Stones hit the stage, it could have been midnight by the way they played. “Oh, God, Andy, aren’t they divine!” Baby Jane said. Warhol was not into superlatives. He observed quietly, his usual taciturn self. Jane Jolzer and fashion model China Machado at the Shakespeare Ball at the Plaza Hotel to benefit New York Shakespeare Festival, New York, June 13, 1966. As Baby Jane looked up onstage, she saw a new kind of star emerging and felt the atmosphere of fame and celebrity shifting, almost in real time. She tried her best to put this feeling into words. “It’s like a whole revolution,” she said. “I mean it’sexciting, they’re all from the lower classes. . . . There’s nobody exciting from the upper classes anymore. There is noclassanymore. Everyone is equal.” Her maid and butler might have disagreed. But Baby Jane was picking up on the spirit of the times—change was coming, and social order was already being disrupted. Suddenly, everyone knew Baby Jane’s name. They didn’t knowwhythey knew it, but they did. Perhaps it was because she was on the cover of the November issue ofShow, a classy new magazine. And it wasn’t just any cover, but an image not easily forgotten. Baby Jane wore a red captain’s hat and strange blue, dark glasses with circles around them. Her only clothing seemingly was an American flag on a stick, whose end stuck in her open mouth in a gesture beyond provocative. If you had not readShowor had the cover jump out at you on the newsstand, perhapsyou had seen that month’sVogue, where David Bailey had another photo of his favorite subject. This time, she was wearing a black bodysuit, open in the back down to a body part usually not openly discussed. If you saw that picture, you surely read the words ofVogue’s celebrated editor Diana Vreeland, christening Baby Jane as “the most contemporary girl I know.” But many people wondered: Why Baby Jane? There was no question that she could kiss, dance, pose, and know enough to direct her limousine driver to the party of the moment. But her accomplishments ended there. And her comments were often vapid. In a strange way, though, her very blankness was what made her a perfect avatar for whatever someone wanted to project on her. That’s part of what Tom Wolfe, a writer for theNew York Herald Tribune’s Sunday magazine, set out to examine when he made her the subject of a piece in late 1964. Wolfe had the unerring ability to write about people that no serious journalist would have chosen and turn them into provocative stories that elucidated the times. He and several of his colleagues including Norman Mailer andGay Talesewere developing what came to be called New Journalism, employing many of the techniques of fiction and sometimes making themselves part of the narrative. Wolfe named Baby Jane Holzer “the Girl of the Year” and set out to chronicle her life, times, and world. As long as there had been “society” there had been a so-called Girl of the Year—usually a debutante from a good family who accepted the honor graciously with a proper picture in the society pages. These young women came from families who lived by the axiom that other than for a debut, a person of merit appeared three times in the newspaper: birth, wedding, and death. But that was changing. By the 1960s, even old money Yalies brought up to despise the mindless seeking of public attention sought celebrity. Andy Warhol and Jane Holzer in 1986. To write his piece, Wolfe did not just sit down in Baby Jane’s Park Avenue apartment to interview her like a traditional reporter would. He followed her around, sitting with her at the Stones’ con- cert and attending her birthday party, re-creating the moments in a piece that read almost like a short story. Wolfe’s story, “The Girl of the Year,” which ran in theHerald Tribunein December 1964, was a sensation among Manhattan’s trend- setters. That was nothing compared to its impact the following year when the piece was published in Wolfe’s bookThe-Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby. In November 1965, the first-time author flew to Austin to give a talk at the University of Texas. The garish flamboyance of Wolfe’s style—over-the-top metaphors and monumental attention to seemingly trivial detail—disguised a writer who was a subtle satirist of American life. He called his talk “Why Baby Jane Holzer Is More Important than Viet Nam.”No way did Wolfe believe Baby Jane’s life was of more consequence than a war that would take over fifty-eight thousand American lives. But with this provocative title, Wolfe chronicled the growing trivialization of American life. Baby Jane’s importance lay in the fact that she was as interchangeable as a spark plug. But to Warhol, that very interchangeability offered something different: opportunity. Warhol saw precisely what was going on with the evolution of celebrity, and he applauded it. He almost certainly did not say the line famously attributed to him: “In the future, everyone will be world-famous for fifteen minutes.” But he believed it. In saying everyone would have their moment of stardom, he was saying nobody was a star. He democratized the idea of celebrity while diminishing it. Most people have part of them that is calculating, checking out all the angles, looking for an advantage. But Warhol calculated even the tiniest nuances of life, never missing an opportunity to further his goal of fame and riches.

Fame is everything he’s about.\" FromWARHOL'S MUSES: The Artists, Misfits, and Superstars Destroyed by the Factory Fame Machineby Laurence Leamer, to be published on May 6th, 2025 by Putnam, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.

    "title": "Fox News’ Jacqui Heinrich Says Trump’s Attacks Don’t “Keep Me Up at Night”",
    "article_text": "Just over a month intoDonald Trump’s second term, press secretaryKaroline Leavittstood behind the podium in the briefing room and triumphantlyannouncedthat the administration was “going to give the power back to the people” by taking over the White House Correspondents’ Association’s traditional role of determining thedaily press pool, the small group of journalists who cover the president’s words and actions in more intimate settings for the larger press corps. Jacqui Heinrichrejects the premise that the WHCA is restrictive in regard to expanding membership, tellingVanity Fair,“At the end of the day, an independent press should be able to organize its own coverage without any interference or involvement from the government.” Heinrich, 36, not only covers the administration on a daily basis as Fox News’ senior White House correspondent, but also currently serves on the board of the WHCA, the specific target of Trump’s attacks. Given her role on the board, to which she was elected for a three-year term, Heinrich felt as though she had to speak out against the attempts to take power away from the journalist-led organization, which has been advocating for media access to the presidency since 1914. “This move does not give the power back to the people - it gives power to the White House,” Heinrich wrote in anX post, responding to the White House’s unprecedented takeover. “Our job is to advocate for the MOST access possible.” Heinrich’s job requires daily interaction with White House officials, so before publicly criticizing the move—a relatively rare showing of a Fox News personality taking issue with the Trump administration—Heinrich made sure to give a heads-up to the White House press shop to ensure that no bridges were burned in the process. “I am going to make these statements, and I just want you to know that it has nothing to do with any one of you people individually,” Heinrich recalls warning administration press officials. “It’s just about this being a very significant choice that’s been made, and in my role on the board, I need to speak up for that.” So far, she says, there hasn’t been “any negative impact on my working relationship with them at all.” Since then, however, Trump has personally attacked Heinrich onTruth Social, calling her “absolutely terrible” after watching her anchor a weekend Fox News program. “Not surprisingly, I later found out that she’s a fan of the White House Correspondents Association!” Trump wrote. (Heinrich’s work hasalso rankledsome Trump allies, including former Fox News starTucker Carlson.) The president’s barb “didn’t keep me up at night,” Heinrich says, but the reporter did request a meeting with Trump to “figure out what it was” that irked him so deeply. “I still don’t really know what that was about,” she adds. Looking ahead to Saturday’s annual WHCA dinner in Washington, Heinrich says that even without Trump at the Hilton, the event will still be valuable, as the “importance of journalism” should be celebrated regardless of whether he’s present. Still, she notes that “it’s not too late for him to change his mind.” This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Vanity Fair:The pace at which this administration has churned out news has been very rapid. How are you handling coverage of an administration that’s been moving so quickly? Jacqui Heinrich:One way I approach things is just to take the 30,000-foot view. There are common threads that go through everything that he’s doing. If you can hold on to that, it helps to not be battered by the volume of information that’s coming your way. For the first 100 days, the three takeaways that I have are that this administration is trying to, early on, determine the scope of the president's power by driving a lot of these Supreme Court cases, whether it has to do with deportations or something else. They want to have an early nod from the Supreme Court on what it is that they can do, so that can inform the rest of these four years. Then also reorganizing the world in a way that prioritizes America, whether that be with alliances and partnerships or the global economy. Then also undoing everything, every mark that[Joe] Bidenleft, if the president can do it. One of the most consistent things that I hear from my sources is that if one of the president's advisers will say, “Well, this is how Biden did it,” President Trump will immediately want to veer in the other direction. Can you speak to your approach in the briefing room and to coverage from the ground in the White House? I’m not a bomb thrower or a gotcha-question person. I never have been, not even with Biden. I think that is why I’m able to develop sourcing and build relationships, because I’m just trying to do an honest job. I’m asking honest, fair questions, and I do think that there is a lot of trust that I’ve been able to establish. I’m not a particularly performative person in the chair compared to some other people. Trump recently attacked your performance onTruth Social. How do you respond to something like that? I still don’t really know what that was about. It doesn’t keep me up at night. I requested to meet with him and talk to him about it, figure out what it was—not because it would change the nature of my reporting, but I think that it’s always important to understand how people are receiving you and to know if there was something that I left out. I always want feedback, no matter where it’s coming from, because I think part of doing a good job is representing the thing that you are covering and representing their voice in the way that they mean it. I was a little bit puzzled by it, but it didn’t keep me up at night. You can’t read the comments. You wouldn’t be a good reporter if you were trying to guard against a negative reaction. The White House has leveled significant attacks against the WHCA, taking over a majority of the organization’s daily duties. You were pretty adamant onsocial mediaabout the fact that this isn’t a good thing for press freedom and gives more influence to the White House. Can you expand on that? It’s specifically the taking over the organization of pools from the WHCA, that particular change. I’m not sure the administration was thinking about the long run when they made it, and I wanted to make sure that was heard—not just by them, but also the people who follow me, who watch Fox. Many of them who support the president and his administration really need to think about that critically. While the president feels that the media is too liberal—and I think he does have some legitimate grievances there—the same voices that he was trying to prop up with this change could be cut down by a Democratic administration who would weaponize their newfound control to their benefit. Imagine President AOC [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] kicking Fox out of the briefing room. The same people that are cheering this on right now would be apoplectic. At the end of the day, an independent press should be able to organize its own coverage without any interference or involvement from the government, because the pendulum always swings both ways. You don’t want access to the leader of the free world to be dependent on favorable coverage. That’s the whole reason why the WHCA self-organized, beginning back in the early 1900s. It’s just not what America stands for. While I understand where they were coming from in making this change, I wanted to make sure that they understood the significance of it and the ramifications that could come from it. I, at the same time, have a very good working relationship with the press shop and gave them a heads-up, like, “Hey, you guys know where I stand on this. This isn’t personal. But I am going to make these statements, and I just want you to know that it has nothing to do with any one of you people individually. It’s just about this being a very significant choice that’s been made, and in my role on theboard, I need to speak up for that.” We have continued to work closely after that and through that, and I don’t think there’s been any negative impact on my working relationship with them at all. That’s not reflective of the overall working relationship that I have with them. Would it be accurate for the White House to characterize the WHCA as restrictive or limiting on who can join? It wouldn’t be. We have always welcomed anyone that they wanted to add to the pool. We just opposed a formula that involved subtraction because we do have a very, very diverse membership. Some people would be surprised to see that a lot of the outlets who have sat in the “new media” seat—which, by the way, I thought was a great creative solution for them to make additions to the briefing room by giving up staff seats. Great, wonderful. But a lot of people who have sat in that “new media” seat are, in fact, our WHCA members. What a pool is and how it works is very inside baseball, and it’s very unexciting. It’s not as sexy or interesting as I think Twitter would have you believe, or X, excuse me. Trying to explain that to the layman is not a winning thing to do because it is so logistical. I think that the White House is able to seize on some of the coverage that had come Trump’s way under his first administration and say, “Look, the Washington media has been unfair to me, and we want to shake things up.” I think that the public can understand why you would want to do that. We’re heading into WHCA Dinner weekend. From your end, what is the mood among the DC political reporting class, just given the tension between the administration and the organization? This is a celebration of the work that we do and the scholarships that we’re awarding and the importance of journalism. That’s something that you celebrate, no matter if the president is attending or not. Obviously, we invited him, hoped that he would come. It wasn’t a huge shock that he decided not to. It’s not too late for him to change his mind. Does that diminish the value at all? No, I don’t think that it diminishes the value per se. What we’re really there to do is to celebrate our scholars who are embarking on a career in journalism, and celebrating the First Amendment, the importance of it, the work that we have done and will continue to do. That is valuable no matter who’s in attendance. But of course we would welcome him to join us, and maybe he’ll come next year. You never know. You occupy an interesting position at Fox News given that you’re providing straight news reporting to a network that can veer into opinion content. How do you view your role? It’s actually really black and white. To me, my job doesn’t change no matter what hour I’m reporting on, and breaking news can happen in opinion hours. I’ve been onSean Hannity,Laura Ingraham,andJesse Watters,doing straight news reports—period. That’s just the role that I’m in. I don’t think that it’s uncomfortable or hard at all. I kind of take solace in the fact that I really just have one job to do, and it’s not impacted no matter what hour I’m on. How do other reporters, anchors, or executives at Fox support your efforts given that sometimes your reporting can contradict an opinion narrative that is being aired? I’ve had nothing but support from this network. I’ve been promoted three times since the last election. I must be doing something right. My key card still works.

    "title": "Who Is Pete Hegseth’s Wife and Signal Chat Buddy, Jennifer Rauchet?",
    "article_text": "As any Hallmark anniversary card worth its salt can tell you, a wife is often many things to her spouse: Lover, friend, teammate, etc. In the case ofJennifer Rauchet, Secretary of DefensePete Hegseth’s third wife, we can add “former producer, former coworker, meeting-with-heads-of-state buddy, andreported recipient of classified military information via Signal chat” to the list, too. You can never reallyknowanother person’s marriage, right? Hegseth has reportedly found a way to combine his status as a serial Wife Guy with hispassion for group chats, including Rauchet as well as his brother, podcast producerPhilip Hegseth, in another Signal chat accessible on personal devices and discussing military attack plans. He has also toted Rauchet and Baby Bro (now a Pentagon employee!) along to high-level national security meetings at the Pentagon and abroad,theWall Street Journalreported. Hegseth is a real family man. (Hegseth’s personal lawyer was also part of the latest Signal chat revelation,according to theNew York Times. When you’ve beenaccused of as much wrongdoing as Hegseth has, however, it makes sense that your lawyer would fall into the Dom Toretto “I don’t got friends, I got family” category.) Despite popping up in rather high-profile meetings, Rauchet, 45, has kept a relatively low profile on the public stage. She met Hegseth in the hallowed halls of Fox News, where she was employed from 2006, an executive producer for the network until recently, and Hegseth was aFox & Friendsweekend anchor from 2017 to 2024 after time as a contributor and guest. They became more than just colleagues, however, when Hegseth wasstill married to his second wife,Samantha Deering, with whom he shares three sons. In August 2017 Rauchet gave birth to a baby girl fathered by Hegseth. In September 2017, Deering filed for divorce. Rauchet, too, wasmarried at the time. According to previous reports, Rauchet was reassigned fromFox & FriendstoWatters’ Worldafter they disclosed their relationship. Rauchet and Hegsethgot married in August 2019 at Trump National Golf Clubin Colts Neck, New Jersey, a ceremony attended byDonald Trumpand featuring custom “Make Marriage Great Again” ballcaps. (It also served assomething of a soft launch for fellow Fox News coupleSean HannityandAinsley Earhardt, who arrived at the event together in a helicopter.) Rauchet also has three children from previous relationships, bringing the couple’s combined brood to seven. Thewhole crew was presentfor Hegseth’s swearing-in ceremony in January after acontentious confirmation hearingand atie-breaking vote cast byJD Vance, Rauchet pink-clad and smiling as she held the Bible for her husband. While the two were still at Fox, rumors circulated that Rauchet lavished Hegseth with more airtime than other contributors, and Hegseth inApril 2023 angrily shot down rumorson social media that his “amazing wife” had had anything to do with the ouster of fellow Fox famTucker Carlson. “Fakest news I’ve ever heard,” he wrote. Rauchet frequently appears onHegseth’s Instagram grid, where he has referred to her more than once as his “rock.” Per Rauchet’s own Instagram,Hegseth is her “cowboy.”Oh. Rauchet has also scored afew extra-special IMDb creditsout of the union: She has multiple listings in Fox archival footage as “Pete’s wife.” She does not appear to hold any official position in the government, nor has any security clearance she holds been disclosed. Hegseth’s little brother Phil, however, has beenhired as an advisorin the Department of Homeland Security at the Pentagon. Peskyanti-nepotism lawbars public officials from hiring close relations, with brothers appearing as one of the specifically named family members, likely making a gig in Defense itself off-limits.  But consider: Without that role, how else is Phil supposed tohang out withConor McGregor? Contacted for comment byVanity Fair, Pentagon spokesmanSean Parnellshared a statement that healso posted on X(formerly Twitter), reading in part, “There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story. What is true is that the Office of the Secretary of Defense is continuing to become stronger and more efficient in executing President Trump's agenda.” Perhaps Signalgate 2.0 is an example of Hegseth having a unique take on those Republican “family values,” the same ones that have led him to repeated infidelity and two divorces. It could be that he’s so used to being prepped and produced by Rauchet for TV that he can’t hang in his new position without someone to keep track of his schedule, background reading, and pressed anti-shine powder. Or maybe he just wanted to give Rauchet some Cap Hill water cooler chat fodder—she and SLOTUSUsha Vancecan bond over their husbandstexting them for their thoughts on foreign policyand matters of national importance.

    "title": "Will the Search for a New Pope Be Just Like Conclave, or What?",
    "article_text": "What happens now thatPope Francis has diedat the age of 88? If you’ve seenConclave,you know the answer—sort of. TheOscar-winning 2024 film, which heads back to streaming onPrime Videothis week, focuses on the titular process by which a new pope is elected. And shortly after news of the actual pope’s death broke on Monday morning, social media was filled with as manymemesreferencingConclaveas there were actual updates from Vatican City. “This is gonna be the most closely watched conclave yet,”wroteone X user, “mainly because we now all know what a conclave actually is.” Jokedanother: “It’s amazing thatConclavewill get watched like a Christmas movie every time a pope dies now forever.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. For those who need a refresher: The film is based onRobert Harris’s 2016 novel about the search for a new pope. It’s led by Cardinal Lawrence (Ralph Fiennes), whose crisis of faith bleeds into his belief about who should rule next. Lawrence initially throws his support behind progressive American candidate Cardinal Bellini (Stanley Tucci), who faces off against more conservative opponents like Italian prospect Cardinal Tedesco (Sergio Castellitto), as well as more moderate contenders like Cardinal Tremblay of Canada (John Lithgow) and Cardinal Adeyemi of Nigeria (Lucian Msamati). Intense politicking for the top job is intensified byIsabella Rossellini’s Sister Agnes, who provides key intel about which candidates have skeletons in their closets. In the end, it is dark horse pick Cardinal Benitez (Carlos Diehz) of Kabul—who was secretly appointed to his position by the late pope shortly before his death—that secures the position, despite holding the biggest secret of them all. Benitez was born intersex. Conclavemade more than$100 million worldwideand earned screenwriterPeter Straughanan Oscar for best adapted screenplay. But the movie “has very little to do”with the actual centuries-old ritual of selecting a new pope, directorEdward Bergerhas said. “It’s also not a takedown of the church,” Berger previouslytoldVanity Fair.“It really looks at the people of that faith with honesty—trying to understand and serve everyone’s story.” When the filmmakers were contacted byVFfor comment regarding Pope Francis’s death, a rep replied: “Both Peter and Edward are sad about the passing of the pope. They don’t have anything to add to the discussion at this time.” But as a real-life conclave looms, their movie’s ability to capture “both the seriousness of this process and the campy ridiculousness of it,”asVF’sRichard Lawsonput it, has lent itself to some spirited online discourse. Even actorBrían F. O’Byrne,who played Cardinal Lawrence’s entrusted assistant, O’Malley, inConclave, got into the action, writing, “Here we go. We ready,” next toa photo of him in costumeon set.

A social media account named@ClubConcrave—a nod to both celeb-news account Pop Crave andTimothée Chalamet’s foremost fan,Club Chalamet—has been providing colorful commentary on what to expect next, from flagging top pope contenders to providing helpful graphics about the papal voting process. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Because the last pope, Benedict, resigned from his post in 2013—an act that served as creative inspiration for2019’s Oscar-nominatedThe Two Popes—before his death in 2022, funeral ceremonies for Francis will more closely resemble those of John Paul II, who died in 2005 and was buried six days later. As reported byNBC News, a 20-page document called the “Universi Dominici Gregis”—Latin for “the Shepherd of the Lord’s Whole Flock”—will serve as a guidebook for the “papal interregnum,” or the period between the death of one pope and the election of another. The first papal conclave, a termderivedfrom “con clave”—Latin for “with key”—took place in 1276 with the passing of Pope Gregory X, after he decreed, in 1274, that electors should be locked away from the outside world when making their selection for a new pope. As shown in the film, up to 120 Roman Catholic cardinals (all under the age of 80) from around the world are expected to descend upon the Sistine Chapel within 15 to 20 days of the pope’s death. After taking an oath of secrecy, the collective will be sequestered from all media, voting multiple times per day until a two-thirds majority is reached. After each day of deliberation, cardinals retire to the Casa Santa Marta, dormitory-style dwellings on Vatican soil.Conclave’s screenwriter said that these relatively modest digs inspired him to include shots of fictional cardinals smoking from vapes and fussing over instant coffee makers between votes. “Visually you get this strange mix of absolute ancient beauty and tremendous scale, contrasting with this almost business conference center feel,” Straughan toldUSA Todaylast fall. Two stoves sit near the chapel entrance. One emits black smoke, which means no decision has been made. The other releases the white smoke that indicates the election of a new pope.Steven P. Millies,a professor of theology at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, previously toldCNNthatConclaveaccurately depicts the “careful coalition-building” present during the actual pope-selection process. “A conclave is a political event in the best sense of politics—it is a thoughtful, even prayerful consideration of a community’s future,” he continued. “The ‘politicking’ does not deny the involvement of the Holy Spirit (it doesn’t guarantee it either, of course). Whether the Spirit is heeded is up to the cardinals. But the Spirit is present, and the vote-counting is a necessary part of the process.” The presence of the Holy Spirit may not be guaranteed. But early social media sentiment suggests that more eyes than ever before will be trained on the upcoming conclave—and any characters who emerge once the smoke has settled.

    "article_text": "The men who surround President Trump these days sure have a lot of kids. Transportation SecretarySean Duffyhas nine. Defense SecretaryPete Hegsethhas seven. AndElon Muskhas…well,who’s to say really? Trump himself is the father of five, and while Vice PresidentJD Vancehas a fairly standard three, his distaste for “childless cat ladies” is by now,well-documented. Now, Trump and his pronatalist posse are reportedly weighing a series of actions to boost the US birthrate.AccordingtoThe New York Times, Trump administration officials have been meeting with activists and conservative groups to discuss proposals designed to spur a baby boom, including offering $5,000 “baby bonuses” to new parents. If that sounds like an oddly progressive policy for this administration, it’s not: The bonuses—which theTimesreported could take the form of a child tax credit and would require an act of Congress—would only apply to parents who are married, a staggeringly unequal benefitconsideringsingle parents are more likely to be Black and Hispanic. “Our ultimate goal is not just more babies but more families formed,”Emma Waters, a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation told theTimes. Heritage, which is among the groups conferring with the administration on this issue, is also proposing more research funding on “natural fertility” to encourage women to chart their menstrual cycles to get pregnant. Another pronatalist activist,Simone Collins, told theTimesshe has sent draft executive orders to the White House proposing, among other things, a National Medal of Motherhood for mothers with more than six children. All of this is a response to the fact that fertility rates in the US have been falling precipitously, dropping to a historic low,accordingto the Centers for Disease Control. But the White House’s apparent interest in more prolific procreation is undercut entirely by the decimation of women’s health initiatives under Trump's watch. As theTimesnotes, the CDC recentlyshutteredits Division of Reproductive Health, which focused on maternal health. This, following years ofincreasesto maternal mortality rates in America. At the same time, health agencies havereportedlybeen warned off of funding research that so much as mentions the word “women” in light of the president's diversity, equity, and inclusion purge. This has caused deep cuts to research into women’s health issues, even for conditions asuncontroversialas uterine fibroids. Now, the Trump administration expects women to repopulate the country while the country delivers nothing in return—well, nothing except maybe a pretty medal. Ladies, you're welcome.

    "title": "Sinners’ End Credits Explained: A Vampire’s Shocking Return, and a Little Light",
    "article_text": "Perhaps inspired by his time in the Marvel Cinematic Universe,Black Pantherwriter-directorRyan Cooglersaved a surprise or two for those who stayed through the credits of his new film,Sinners. Set in 1932 Clarksdale, Mississippi, thesupernatural horror thrillerstarsMichael B. Jordanin the dual roles of twins Smoke and Stack—who, after sharpening their criminal skills in Chicago, return home to open a juke joint. Its debut night is immediately successful, reuniting Stack with his former flame, Mary (Hailee Steinfeld), and giving their talented cousin, young musician Sammie (Miles Caton), a chance to perform. But the night of drinking, dancing and romance is interrupted by the arrival of Remmick (Jack O’Connell), a charismatic vampire. Mary is the first person bitten and transformed by Remmick. Soon enough, she’s turned Stack into a vampire as well. As the film rolls on, the vampires eventually kill everyone but Smoke and Sammie—the one human Remmick hopes to target most. The final showdown ends with Smoke apparently killing Stack, then stabbing Remmick from behind just before he can turn Sammie into a vampire. “Go home,” Smoke instructs Sammie. “Bury that fucking guitar”—which Sammie had smashed on Remmick’s head, leaving him with only a broken handle. Sammie winds up as the only living survivor that night. Smoke stays behind to gun down the Klu Klux Klan members who sold the club to the twins with the intention of coming back to kill them. Smoke is fatally wounded in the process; as he’s dying, he has a vision of his partner Annie (Wunmi Mosaku), a spiritual healer, and their late child appearing in front of him. Sinnersthen returns to its opening scene, in which a bloodied Sammie, still gripping the guitar handle, drives to his father’s church and interrupts its Sunday service. “Drop the guitar, Samuel,” orders Jedidiah (Saul Williams). The action next cuts to Sammie back in Smoke and Stack’s car, guitar in hand, on his way to start a new life. But Sammie’s story doesn’t end there. A mid-credits scene picks up 60 years later, in 1992 Chicago. Sammie, now an old man (played byBuddy Guy, a legendary blues artist and 8-time Grammy winner), is a famous musician with his own club. Though the place is closed, a bouncer comes to Sammie and says that a couple has offered a few hundred dollars to be let in. Sammie allows it, only to instantly think he’s seen a pair of ghosts. Looking like they just walked off the set of a Salt-N-Pepa video, Stack and Mary stroll in, sporting elite ‘90s hip-hop gear and having not aged a day. Stack has a hi-top fade and a colorful sweater; she’s rocking her hair up and sucking on a lollipop. Shocked, Sammie asks, “How?” It turns out that Smoke let his brother go, and he and Mary ran off before the sun came up. “I guess I was the one person he just couldn’t kill,” Stack says. “He made me promise to stay away from you, let you live out your life.” In a chilling moment, Stack then leans in and smells Sammie. “Won’t be long before you’re gone. I can make it so you can stick around. Keep touring, keep living, no pain.” Sammie passes on the offer, saying, “I think I’ve seen enough of this place.” Stack reveals that he and Mary own all of Sammie’s records, though they don’t love them all equally. “I don’t like that electric shit as much as the real. I miss thereal. Sammie, you still got the real in you?” asks Stack. Sammie plays for them on a guitar that appears to be a replica of his guitar from that fateful night. Hearing it brings Stack back to the first time that Sammie performed for him earlier in the film. Stack and Sammie hug goodbye, and as Stack and Mary begin to leave, Sammie says, “You know something? Maybe once a week, I wake up paralyzed reliving that night. But before the sun went down, I think that was the best day of my life. Was it like that for you?” “No doubt about it,” Stack fondly replies. “The last time I’ve seen my brother. Last time I’ve seen the sun. For a few hours, we was free.” The five-minute scene is much more substantial than most quick tags added to films these days. Considering that two of Coogler’s first three pictures have spawned sequels (CreedandBlack Panther), it might also set up further adventures for Stack and Mary. Just imagine how much trouble they caused in the ‘70s! But then Coogler adds in one more small, intimate sequence. Once all of the credits are done,Sinnersreturns to Jedidiah’s church, where young Sammie is alone, ahead of the horrific events that will soon unfold—performing a blues-flavored rendition of the classic, powerful anthem “This Little Light of Mine.” In a movie full of darkness, Coogler chooses to sign off with a little bit of light.

    "title": "Andor Season Two Is the Best Television of the Year So Far",
    "article_text": "In the years since the Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel andStar Wars, its strategy has been to flood the market with as much Marvel andStar Warsstuff as possible until audiences are begging for more. That onslaught has, shockingly, proven less than effective; interest in Marvel andStar Warsprojects has waned, both in theaters and at home. A saturation point was reached, and viewers began to move on to other things. In Disney’s defense, they at least had the prudence to stop makingStar Warsmovies for a while after 2019’s disastrously incoherentRise of Skywalker.But the studio has kept plugging away with TV shows, releasing six new live-actionStar Warsseries since 2021. It’s entirely too much, this desperate effort to capitalize on every square inch of unclaimed narrative property adjacent to the original trilogy of films. Little can breathe when packed in so close to everything else. Yet one of those series,Andor, somehow manages to be good television. And not just good for a latter dayStar Warsshow.Andor, which returns for a second season on Disney+ April 22, stands toe-to-toe with any of the great series currently airing. It’s a sophisticated epic, a feat of both expansive and granular imagination. The series is rushing toward a foregone conclusion—we’ve already seen its lead character, smuggler turned rebel captain Cassian Andor (Diego Luna), die in the 2016 filmRogue One—but finds endless suspense in the journey toward that fixed point. CreatorTony Gilroygoes for highbrow political intrigue in a way that is complementary to the space-opera fun ofStar Wars, rather than disdainful of it. He gives a long cherished galaxy a respectful weight;Andortakes this all very seriously. Maybe there issomehaughty avoidance inAndor;the series never mentions Darth Vader, nor Yoda nor Jabba the Hutt nor anyone named Skywalker. It keeps the wicked Emperor Palpatine safely off screen, though his presence nonetheless looms over the show. Many fantastical elements ofStar Warshave to be eschewed for this grave and grownup take on the material to work, a putting away of childish things that may rankle some viewers. Plenty ofStar Warsfans do want goofy aliens and mystical heros’ journeys toward cosmic greatness—butAndordenies them that in favor of grim ruminations on fascism and resistance. Andor’s second season begins a few years before the destruction of the Death Star, which ends the original 1977 film. Andor and his cohort are as yet unaware that such a killing machine even exists. Instead, they are busy furtively amassing the allies and materials that might give them a fighting chance against a force as widespread and well-armed as the Empire. Echoing the first season,Andorbreaks the new run of episodes into several mini arcs, while one grander narrative binds them together. We watch as Andor does his increasingly risky and high-stakes guerilla missions, while on the gleaming capital planet of Coruscant, Senator Mon Mothma (Genevieve O’Reilly) keeps up outward appearances as a mask for her clandestine efforts to funnel funds to the rebellion. Existing between them is a host of spies and opportunists all playing a role in the fomenting of war—many of them orbiting around shifty operator Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsgård), who works in the light and in the shadows. Andorgives ample attention to the other side, Empire officials who are ruthlessly devoted to their cause. Cunning secret police officer Dedra Meero (Denise Gough) is handed a high-security assignment involving a resource-rich planet, Ghorman, whose people are French-coded artisans and aesthetes and, true to our own WWII history, dogged underground resistance fighters. Syril Karn (Kyle Soller) has been kicked down the career ladder for his failures last season, but his ambition has found a new foothold. Andorseason one ended with a rousing call to action against despotism, but that spirit has ebbed some at the start of season two. Characters are mired in the frustrating and dangerous process of praxis, their opponents gaining ever more power and ever more willingness to flamboyantly wield it. Gilroy and his writers carefully, patiently spend season two building their way back to righteous fire. What begins as a murmur of dread gradually crescendos into a poignant and stirring vision of revolution’s cost, its noble sacrifices and bitter losses. It’s high drama that stretches across multiple years, and yet is done with a delicate, intimate touch. We peek into so many inner lives throughout the season, even those of seemingly small and ultimately insignificant characters. In so doing,Andordraws a line between the faraway fantasy ofStar Warsand our own sorry, deteriorating world. Corny as it may be to say, the series feels wholly responsive to the here and now, admirably firm in its messaging, its allusion, its allegory. Gilroy is tracing a hard but perhaps necessary path toward better, all housed within an IP television series playing on a streaming service owned by Disney.Andoris a remarkable anomaly, an aberration in the system that challenges everything around it to be smarter, more principled—and, frankly, better made. Or that’s all insidiously convincing window dressing for what is just another exercise in corporate dominance—Andormay simply one of many assets on Disney’s balance sheet, chiefly notable for the way it uses antifascist politics to placate viewers into submission. But I think Gilroy, at least, is entirely sincere in his intent—that he does want to make a series that is not just reactive to our political times, but prescriptive for them. Listening to Cassian and Luthen and Mon and the rest debate the methods and effectiveness of the fight against cruel authority does actually have an instructive value. At least it did for me, as I toggled between screeners and the exponentially worsening news of the nation. The show’s argument is supported by breathtaking craft. The series is beautifully rendered, each episode rich with precise visual detail and evocative music. The performances are sharp and flinty, pitched somewhere between realism and modest melodrama. There are dazzling action set-pieces—some giddily thrilling, others bleak and harrowing. While Cassian’s constant wrestling with his calling grows a bit repetitive, and a digression involvingForest Whitaker’s Saw Gerrera is confusing, the season is otherwise tight and compelling, weaving many fascinating threads into a vast tapestry of an endgame’s beginning. And don’t worry: it’s not all political paranoia and horror. Gilroy graciously allows for moments of levity, most of them involving either a sardonic droid orKathryn Hunter’s delightfully awful mother from hell. They’re a welcome diversion. After all, even during the darkest days of the Empire, the Mos Eisley Cantina band played on.

    "title": "Hegseth’s Second Signal Chat Scandal Adds to a Mounting Security Disaster for Trump",
    "article_text": "It has been less than a month—if you can honestly believe that—sinceThe Atlanticreported that Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethaccidentallytexted sensitive military strike plans to one of its editors in a Signal group chat. As it turns out, there was more where that came from. AccordingtoThe New York Times, Hegseth shared the same details about the March 15 strike in Yemen with another Signal chat entirely. This one reportedly included roughly a dozen people, including Hegseth’s brother and personal lawyer, who are both Pentagon employees, as well as Hegseth’s wife, who is…well, not. Unlike the group chat in the first Signalgate scandal, which was created by National Security AdvisorMichael Waltz, theTimesreports that Hegseth created the second chat. And, also unlike the original Signalgate—which included top White House and cabinet officials like Vice PresidentJD Vanceand Secretary of StateMarco Rubio—it is unclear why many of the people on Hegseth’s separate chat would need to be briefed on the strike plans. Hegseth’s wife, for one, is a former Fox News producer. In a statementpostedto X, chief Pentagon spokespersonSean Parnellwrote, “There was no classified information in any Signal chat, no matter how many ways they try to write the story.” Parnell tried to dismiss theTimes’ reporting as the work of disgruntled former staffers who were laid off from the Department of Defense last week. But that isn’t quite the salve Parnell seems to think it is. Signalgate 2.0 comes in the midst of a growing chorus of reports of pandemonium within the Pentagon, including from some of Hegseth’s closest advisors. Mere hours after theTimes’ story published, the Department of Defense’s former chief spokesperson and a top cheerleader of Hegseth’s,John Ullyot,published a stunningop-edin Politico, which described a “month of total chaos” inside the Pentagon. “In short, the building is in disarray under Hegseth’s leadership,” Ullyot wrote. Ullyot, whoresignedfrom the Department of Defense last week,pointedto the recent purge of top Pentagon officials, who werereportedlyfired as part of aninvestigationinto department leaks. “Yet none of this is true,” Ullyot wrote, explaining that none of the officials had been given polygraph tests, as the Department indicated they might. “Unfortunately, Hegseth’s team has developed a habit of spreading flat-out, easily debunked falsehoods anonymously about their colleagues on their way out the door,” Ullyot wrote. The three officials who were fired Friday alsodefendedtheir innocence in a post on X over the weekend. “At this time, we still have not been told what exactly we were investigated for, if there is still an active investigation, or if there was even a real investigation of ‘leaks’ to begin with,” their statement read. The timing of these firings is particularly curious at a moment when Hegseth's own Signal account appears to be the leakiest of all. In his op-ed, Ullyot described the “Month from Hell” inside the office, during which the Pentagon public affairs team flubbed Hegseth’s response to the first Signalgate, encouraging Hegseth to engage in a tedious battle of semantics,insisting“nobody was texting war plans.” Then came reporting that Hegseth hadbroughthis wife to meetings with foreign military officials andtriedto set up a briefing forElon Muskon the United States’ plans in the event of a war with China. While Ullyot said he’s grateful for Hegseth’s friendship, he wrote that President Trump “deserves better,” and that if he were to fire Hegseth, like so many cabinet members before him, “many in the secretary’s own inner circle will applaud quietly.” RememberingPope Francis CanThe Last of UsSurvive theGruesome Deathof Its Main Character?

    "title": "Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-Fueled MAGA-morphosis: “What the F--k Is Wrong With Your Boss?”",
    "article_text": "The Tesla executive was beside himself on his call to Steven Cliff, administrator at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “Why are we being excluded?” he asked, perhaps rightfully incredulous that Tesla would be left out of a White House event promoting electric vehicles in August 2021, according to a person familiar with the matter. Tesla, he noted, was an “American company making all electric vehicles,” the poster child for the type of renewable energy success story President Joe Biden was trying to tell months after taking office and making EVs a priority. The White House electric vehicle summit featured General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler parent Stellantis, the big three automakers whose EV sales paled in comparison to Tesla’s. It also included a Tesla foe in the form of the United Auto Workers (UAW), who had tried to unionize Tesla’s Fremont factory, which became the site of unfair labor practice allegations. Was the snub intentional, the Tesla official asked, “or is this just a union thing?” Numerous Biden officials ran interference in the meantime, according to a person familiar with the matter, trying to placate Rohan Patel, Tesla’s liaison to Washington, while explaining that the decision was above their pay grade. “The president made a decision that he wanted to make sure that the UAW knew that he was there for them,” one said. Musk could only sigh. This retelling of Tesla’s exclusion from the Biden electric vehicle summit is based on the recollection of two individuals with direct knowledge of the events. Two things could be true at once: Biden was trying to generate excitement for his plans among those who had not already embraced EVs, and space was limited at the White House South Lawn event at a time when many in attendance were still wearing masks to protect against COVID-19. Regardless, Biden officials seemingly underestimated the fallout and went out of their way to include Musk in future events. But for Musk, the snub seemed to confirm a growing suspicion—raised years earlier when the National Transportation Safety Board investigated a fatal Tesla Autopilot crash—that powerful government forces were mobilizing against him. It would cement Musk’s metamorphosis from political opportunist to full-fledged supporter of the Republican Party, even if he’d go on to weaponize perceived personal slights to justify far more radical behavior in the political arena. ‘Hubris Maximus: The Shattering of Elon Musk’ by Faiz Siddiqui Amazon Bookshop More than a year earlier, Musk had sat in the Oval Office opposite President Trump, who was desperate to secure a victory for the domestic manufacturing industry he had promised to revive. Far from snubbing a top automaker, Trump was appealing to Musk directly, proclaiming himself a Tesla owner and emphasizing the importance of Musk’s company to the crucial domestic manufacturing aspect of his agenda. Still, Trump was far from the EV booster that his successor, who made electric cars a key component of his green energy domestic agenda, would become. “Look, I don’t know about all this electric vehicle stuff,” Trump said, according to one source. “I have two Teslas,” but there was nowhere to charge them. Musk turned to a Tesla executive in the room. “Can you take out your phone?” he asked. The executive showed Trump a sea of red dots on his screen, demonstrating the extent of Tesla’s vast network of Superchargers, stations where drivers of the electric vehicles could quickly top up their cars’ batteries, before an incredulous president. This retelling is based on the recollection of a person familiar with the matter. For all his skepticism, Trump needed Musk and Tesla. The electric vehicle manufacturer was deciding on a location for its next gigafactory where it would build such vehicles as the Cybertruck and the Model Y crossover. While Tesla was strongly leaning toward Austin, Texas, or another location in the right-to-work states of the South, or a Plains state like Oklahoma—Tulsa, for example, made a strong push—the company informed administration officials that Mexico and Canada were also on the table. That prompted an intervention from the Trump administration that led to Musk sitting across from the forty-fifth president, a person familiar with the matter told me. “You’ve gotta build here in the United States,” Trump said. Was there anything the administration could do? For Musk, nothing immediately came to mind. But here was the Trump administration giving Tesla the power to make a direct ask—in this case, working on an arcane federal emissions rule that had been languishing, correcting what Tesla regarded as an Obama-era mistake—as the administration negotiated for Tesla to locate its next factory in its home country. “What the hell are we waiting for?” Trump asked, setting the matter into motion. In a post taking aim at Musk on Truth Social two years later, Trump revised history: “When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it’s electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he’d be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, ‘drop to your knees and beg,’ and he would have done it . . .” In reality, it was Trump who was asking for the favor, and Musk was happy to give the appearance of obliging. By the end of 2020, Musk had officially moved to Texas, thereby cementing his breakup with the state where he’d made his fortune. Soon, Musk was showing off a belt buckle and cowboy hat, adopting the faux cowboy persona to match his new digs. Contrary to the combative, unappreciative progressives on the Left, Texas’s right-wing politicians like Senator Ted Cruz and Governor Greg Abbott embraced him with open arms. Musk was entering a new phase of his public life, one where he defined the limits of acceptable behavior and where it seems the only thing worse than being crass and rude was being inauthentic, dishonest—an NPC (a video game term short for “non-player character,” i.e., generic and unimportant). “Individuals should always wonder who wrote the software running in their head,” he’d later remark. “Don’t be an NPC.” He had tried obeying the rules, and where had that gotten him? It was, after all, Musk’s defiance of government authority that had gotten the Tesla factory reopened only months earlier. And the SEC had tried to bring Musk to heel—in the tech mogul’s view—for a tweet that wasn’t even entirely inaccurate. (Musk, as his blog post had made clear, was saying he really had been negotiating with the Saudis about an investment at the time of the “Funding secured” tweet.) Now, two years after the settlement, Musk was beginning to make clear—in the strongest possible terms—that he saw the SEC’s enforcement as unjust. “He just basically has a complete disdain for any authority period, and he doesn’t believe that he should have to answer to any authority,” said investor Ross Gerber in an April 2023 interview with me. “I have a completely different opinion about the hubris of thumbing your nose at the people that could really hurt you.” To Musk, the authority that had emerged was the liberal establishment—the one that powered the mainstream media and regarded him with increasing scrutiny, that dominated the political culture wars seeping into movies and TV shows, and that was reshaping the limits of acceptable speech and humor. Musk had already essentially told the SEC to fellate him. But it was another tweet sent later in July 2020 that would finally pierce his inner circle. “Pronouns suck,” Musk posted on July 24, a shot at the transgender community and wider society’s adoption of gender-inclusive identifiers. Musk’s girlfriend, the singer Grimes, was appalled. “I love you but please turn off ur phone,” she wrote in a since-deleted reply. “I cannot support hate. Please stop this. I know this isn’t your heart.” Musk was in the middle of an ideological transformation. Politically, he had identified as a Democrat for years. He was, after all, the most visible response to climate change the business world could have produced: someone who had not only popularized electric cars but made themcoolas well. He hastened green technology’s transformation from a pipe dream to an inevitability. Musk was hardly a devotee to the Republican causes of the moment: he had made repeated overtures to the Chinese government—increasingly the United States’ top competitor on the global stage and the subject of a Trump trade war—in conjunction with his effort to make the world’s most populous country a key hub for Tesla manufacturing. Tesla was eyeing Mexico, too, for a new manufacturing plant. For all of Musk’s criticisms of censorship and political overreach, it was rare to see him utter a negative word about China. Meanwhile, he was exerting control over not only the future of car manufacturing but also the United States’ space ambitions, often with the help of government contracts and subsidies. On top of that, his start-up Neuralink sought to implant computer chips into people’s brains. As such, it would have been hard to imagine a bigger candidate for right-wing bogeyman than Elon Musk. His climate advocacy wasn’t merely passive—in fact, he was such a climate hawk that he had left two of President Trump’s advisory councils over the administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords. (Musk had faced pressure to leave earlier over Trump’s travel ban but had opted to stay on then.) But as was the case for Trump, conservatives seemed willing to trade ideological purity and notions of relatability for the refreshing sight of a person willing to thumb their nose at the establishment. Musk was hardly a blue-collar guy. He was a celebrity dating a famous singer, a tech nerd who had hung out with Kanye West and Joe Rogan, and he commuted between offices via private jet. Something about his frenetic online posting, however, gave people the impression that Musk was one of them. He lifted memes. He slung impulsive insults. He wasn’t afraid to float conspiracy theories, no matter how irresponsible, merely because he’d stumbled on them and found them compelling. His impulse to shitpost was apolitical (“69 days after 4/20 again ha-ha,” Musk wrote on June 28, 2020), but suddenly it was brushing up against his increasing frustration with the Left. Musk said he had voted Democrat in the 2016 election, casting his ballot for Hillary Clinton. In 2020, he’d do the same for Biden, he said. But on the heels of COVID-19 restrictions and California officials’ decision to shut down his factory, his frustration was evident. “The left is losing the middle,” he said that summer. Musk seemed to see himself as a common-sense voter, a man above partisan politics—similar to a populist presidential candidate who urged the parties to simply work out their differences. He didn’t hesitate to align himself with government officials who could help him advance his companies and ambitions, regardless of party. Politics itself was an inconvenience. “I’m neither anti-conservative nor anti-liberal. Just don’t like group think. Ideas should be considered on their own merits,” he wrote once. But of course, by 2020, it was difficult to remain apolitical. On May 25, George Floyd, a forty-six-year-old Black man and father who lived in Minneapolis was murdered by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck and back for more than nine minutes as Floyd gasped for breath. The country erupted in protests and riots, as the anger over Floyd’s death spilled into the nation’s largest cities. Musk weighed in, writing “#JusticeForGeorge” and urging that the other officers at the scene be charged. As the protests raged on, so did a sweeping movement for racial justice, heightening public awareness of policing’s disproportionate impact on Black communities. The movement soon reached Tesla’s front door. That year, companies across the United States decided to honor Juneteenth, the holiday marking the end of slavery. The morning of the holiday, the same day as a planned protest for racial justice, Tesla’s human resources chief Valerie Capers Workman sent an email to the company. “Tesla fully supports Juneteenth for any US employee that wants to take the day off to celebrate, reflect or participate in events that are meaningful to you.” It was the next line that struck workers as unusual. “This is an unpaid PTO and excused absence,” read the email. To Tesla workers who had lobbied for better treatment at a company accused of a pattern of racial discrimination and harassment in the past, the message was an insult, in the recollection of a person familiar with their reaction. Workman, a Black woman, was surprised to have been appointed to the role in the first place. Jerome Guillen, Tesla’s former president, had lobbied for her hiring. She had seen Tesla’s shortcomings in dealing with workers, particularly workers of color, and challenged Musk to do things differently. She served as an example of how speaking out could earn Musk’s respect and how he didn’t simply surround himself with so-called yes-men. Even so, when she was called into a meeting to be told about her promotion, she thought she was being fired. In mid-2020, however, Workman’s name was being signed to a litany of controversial decisions made by upper management, from COVID-19 to racial justice. Some employees had already arrived at Tesla’s facilities that day for work as they read the update, which started off fairly standard. Once they saw how Tesla was treating the holiday—as a concession, almost a favor to workers—it was hard to look at the company the same way. Nathan Murthy, a software engineer who was working for Tesla at the time, said the period—with the combined effect of the pandemic and Floyd protests—laid bare Musk’s feelings on the issues important to his workers; matters they regarded as life-or-death propositions appeared to strike the CEO as mere business inconveniences. “We saw with definitive proof his true colors,” Murthy said. “I don’t know if he doesn’t want to empathize or if he feels he’s just too busy to empathize.” By January 2021, the country was once again in turmoil. As if the pandemic response and racial justice protests hadn’t done enough to inject politics into every facet of American life—a climate in which simply the decision to wear a protective facemask or not became a divisive political statement—the outgoing president had refused to acknowledge he’d lost the election. When thousands of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol grounds on his behalf, Silicon Valley was suddenly faced with pivotal decisions. Trump had practically fomented an insurrection with social media posts. In the eyes of tech leaders, there wasn’t much of a choice. Twitter and Facebook booted Trump off their platforms. Musk, no Trump supporter at the time, had made no secret of how he felt about these interventions. A year earlier, during the COVID-19 shutdowns, he had derided Silicon Valley as “Sanctimonious Valley. . . . Too much the moral arbiter of the world.” Now he hinted at the massive backlash coming against Silicon Valley’s seemingly arbitrary content moderation decisions, on the heels of the Trump ban as well as Twitter and Facebook’s decisions to censor an explosiveNew York Poststory about the contents of Hunter Biden’s laptop. “A lot of people are going to be super unhappy with West Coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech,” Musk wrote. Musk’s profile, meanwhile, was exploding. He was now the richest person on earth, making him a much easier and more convenient target for left-wing activists that railed against the excesses of billionaires and the massive wealth disparities in American society, people who were keenly aware of concepts such as greenwashing and who would gladly trade a Mars mission for solving homelessness or, say, ending world hunger. (Musk, for his part, said he would give up Tesla stock to solve world hunger, if the United Nations World Food Programme could outline a clear path for doing so.) He seemed to take much of the criticism personally. Musk, all the while, demonstrated little self-awareness of his potential to become the type of concentrated center of power he’d previously condemned. He was still operating as if he were the little guy. How could the world’s richest person—who’d made his fortune on tech investments, benefiting from years of Wall Street hype and cozy government relationships—credibly argue that it was the tech demigods who had been exerting excessive control? Not him, butthose other guys. In a securities filing that year, Tesla announced that Musk and Tesla’s chief financial officer Zach Kirkhorn had been granted new titles, as Musk thumbed his nose at the stuffy, straight-laced establishment-rooted culture he sought to dismantle. Musk would henceforth be officially known as “Technoking of Tesla.” His deputy also received an arcane new title: “Master of Coin.” “Elon and Zach will also maintain their respective positions as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,” the filing said. The new titles were said to be “Effective as of March 15, 2021.” Elon Musk was crowned Technoking on the Ides of March. Tesla’s August 2021 omission from the Biden White House’s South Lawn event illustrated how Musk’s political relationships could turn on a dime. At the time, Musk was dealing with problems on multiple fronts: inflation was rising, the pandemic-related supply chain woes that had hobbled other automakers were finally catching up to Tesla, and a prounion president suddenly seemed intent on freezing out Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla’s stock declined in the months following Biden’s inauguration, as these pressures continued and the Trump administration’s historically lax regulatory regime came to an end. Biden’s Transportation Department already showed early signs that it would increase scrutiny on Tesla and Autopilot. That year, some vocal Tesla fans had begun to notice a peculiar trend: the most electric vehicle–friendly administration in history wasn’t capitalizing on the most popular EV automaker—and its celebrity CEO—to meet its ambitious goal of making half of US passenger vehicle sales electric, plug-in hybrid, or fuel cell by 2030. Now Musk was taking notice. “Is this just because you guys don’t like Elon?” a Tesla executive asked when the company wasn’t included in the electric vehicle summit on the White House lawn. That apparent slight, in August 2021, kicked off an increasingly bitter barrage of criticisms of the president. Biden, said Musk, was “biased” against Tesla. The man who had neglected to include his company was “a UAW [sock] puppet” (Musk used the emoji for socks). But his most biting criticism was reserved for another apparent oversight—this time regarding SpaceX. After the company sent four civilian astronauts into orbit as a charity fundraiser for St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, Musk floated a theory as to why Biden hadn’t yet offered his congratulations. “He’s still sleeping,” Musk wrote, a riff on the “sleepy Joe” meme popular with the Right. The Biden administration, wanting to tout its union-friendly reputation and keep its distance from a man who was increasingly a political lightning rod, did little to dispel the notion that it was hostile to Musk. Biden, unlike Trump, never hosted Musk one-on-one at the White House, though administration officials did meet with him in downtown Washington—so close to the White House as to make it seem obvious they were trying to avoid a spectacle—to discuss a Biden charging initiative. Though he unleashed on Biden frequently, Musk was much more reserved in his criticism of Republicans, if he jabbed at them at all. Earlier that month, Tesla faced pressure to protect its employees after a Texas law banning abortion after six weeks took effect. Musk held his tongue. But when Governor Abbott took to CNBC and said Musk “consistently tells me that he likes the social policies in the state of Texas,” Musk had to respond. “In general, I believe government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness,” Musk wrote. “That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.” A diplomatic—and safe—statement that reflected Musk’s ability to reasonably disagree and strike a tone of civility. Weeks later, Rohan Patel was placing a call to the top aide of Senator Ron Wyden. At a time when Tesla was at the height of its valuation, Patel was in the unenviable position of putting out a four-alarm fire of his boss’s making. Musk had just tweeted a US senator—not just any senator, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee—a vulgar comment about his Twitter display photo, or profile picture, in response to a post calling for a billionaires’ tax. “Why does ur pp look like u just came?” Musk wrote on November 7, 2021. At Tesla, employees had increasingly begun to arrive at a new conclusion: their boss was a nutcase, according to a person familiar with the matter, who detailed the fallout from the Wyden tweet. They had scrambled to respond to one too many episodes like this. In this instance, Musk’s offensive tweet had struck during crucial discussions about the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden’s signature climate bill that was still being written and which Tesla had been actively engaged in discussions about. If ever there was a time to fire off the lewdest possible joke about a powerful senator, this was not it. Tesla’s policy team in DC was aghast and began lighting up Patel’s phone. This was an emergency. “Can you help us?” Patel placed the call to Wyden’s top aide soon after. He tried to explain, but there wasn’t a script for this kind of thing. “I’m super sorry about this,” he said. The Wyden aide was understanding. “What the fuck is wrong with your boss?” she asked. “I don’t even know,” he replied. A Wyden spokesperson denied such an exchange took place. On April 18, 2022, Musk faced a new rejection he blamed on the Left, this time a personal one. That day, Musk’s eighteen-year-old daughter Vivian Jenna Wilson, a trans woman, filed paperwork with California Superior Court. She had adopted her mother’s maiden name and wanted to have her name change officially recognized. In the section asking the reason for the name change, Wilson wrote: “Gender Identity and the fact that I no longer live with or wish to be related to my biological father in any way, shape or form.” The Daily Beast captured Musk’s public reaction. “She does not want to be a public figure,” he told the outlet. “I think it is important to defend her right to privacy. Please don’t out someone against their will—it’s not right.” The statement read as that of a supportive father. But over the preceding two years, Musk had publicly railed against measures aimed at building inclusive environments for trans individuals. In 2020, a few months after his “pronouns suck” tweet, he wrote: “I absolutely support trans, but all these pronouns are an esthetic [sic] nightmare.” When some questioned his commitment to LGBTQ rights, Musk pointed to Tesla’s 100/100 score on LGBTQ equality in a Human Rights Campaign index. Behind the scenes, a person in Musk’s orbit said, the matter weighed heavily on him. Being disowned as a father turned what Musk had previously regarded as a political crusade into a personal issue. Years later, in a 2024 interview with psychologist Jordan Peterson, Musk removed any doubt as to whether he’d supported Wilson, alleging he’d been duped into signing paperwork for gender-affirming care and arguing that Wilson was “killed by the woke mind virus.” He said, “So I vowed to destroy the woke mind virus after that.” Wilson had her say soon after in comments on Threads, Meta’s social media site that emerged after Musk’s Twitter takeover. She lit into her father as few could have after Musk described her as “not a girl” and described apparent aspects of her childhood that included an early preference for theater and a propensity to describe clothes as “fabulous!” Wilson dismissed these statements as “entirely fake” and an assortment of “gay stereotypes.” “This entire thing is completely made up and there’s a reason for this,” Wilson wrote. “He doesn’t know what I was like as a child because he quite simply wasn’t there, and in the little time that he was I was relentlessly harassed for my femininity and queerness.” She continued: “As for if I’m not a woman . . . sure, Jan. Whatever you say. I’m legally recognized as a woman in the state of California and I don’t concern myself with the opinions of those below me.” Wilson’s Threads posts caught fire, and she was suddenly swarmed with thousands of new followers, many of whom expressed support and applauded her bravery for speaking up. It was her final word on the Peterson interview that she pinned to the top of her profile, visible to more than one hundred thousand followers: “I look pretty good for a dead bitch.” With the approach of the 2024 presidential election, Musk would make a break with the Democratic Party. He believed it was an activist-fueled party, and it wasDemocrats—not him—who had shifted, leaving him and people like him behind. For someone who felt increasingly targeted by the Left, who was exhausted by the perceived infiltration of speech, humor, and corporate governance, there was one clear choice: Florida governor Ron DeSantis , the antiwoke crusader who, unlike Trump, demonstrated a commitment to seeing his agenda through. Musk was soon all in. He privately mobilized behind DeSantis for 2024. “In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party,” Musk wrote months before the 2022 midterms. “But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.” Musk declared he had cast his first Republican vote for Mayra Flores, the Texas Republican who won an upset bid for US House in a special election in a Democratic-leaning district. In June 2022, he tweeted that he was leaning toward DeSantis in the 2024 presidential race. Trump, he said, was simply too old, as was Biden. “Trump would be 82 at end of term, which is too old to be chief executive of anything, let alone the United States of America,” he said, after having earlier noted “it’s time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.” He was effusive in his praise for the Florida governor, however, as he pushed his favorite candidate as almost a shoo-in for the job. “If DeSantis runs against Biden in 2024, then DeSantis will easily win—he doesn’t even need to campaign,” he said. Earlier in the year, Musk explained his political transformation with a Twitter post showing a cartoon meme created by writer and evolutionary biologist Colin Wright. It depicted three stick figures standing in a line representing the political spectrum. In 2008, the stick figure representing Musk, labeled “me,” stood slightly to the left of center. By 2012, the figure representing Musk remained in the same spot, but the center and left had shifted beneath his feet. Musk was edged closer to the center, and the figure termed “my fellow liberal?” raced leftward, extending the left wing farther out in that direction. By 2021, the center had again shifted beneath Musk, placing him on the right of the spectrum, as the “woke-progressive” called him a “Bigot!” “I strongly supported Obama for President, but today’s Democratic Party has been hijacked by extremists,” he wrote. Musk, meanwhile, had also soured on Biden, the president who was pushing major infrastructure and social spending bills as inflation was wreaking havoc on the economy. “Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama,” Musk wrote. There were plenty of Americans in 2024 who felt alienated by the nation’s politics. Musk, though, had money, fame, and power—and other wealthy friends who encouraged him to do something about it. The Left, they said, had gone too far and needed to be reined in. The latest outrage came when Starlink, Musk’s satellite-based internet service that had been launched in Ukraine after Russia’s brutal invasion, was allegedly told “by some governments” to block Russian news sources, according to Musk. Musk was defiant, saying it would not do so. “We will not do so unless at gunpoint. Sorry to be a free speech absolutist,” he wrote. It was hardly an unreasonable stance. But to members of Musk’s circle, the tech mogul had latched onto the central issue of the times—one that the future of humanity depended on, to put it in terms he could appreciate. Musk’s close friend and confidant, former Tesla board member Antonio Gracias, texted Musk at the time, in March 2022, that he was 100 percent in the right. “To the fucking mattresses no matter what,” he wrote in a text message. This “is a principle we need to fucking defend with our lives or we are lost to the darkness.” Musk “loved” the text, appending a heart to it in reply. It was only later that month that matters truly came to a head. Musk’s favorite social media platform—the one that had booted Trump a year earlier—made another controversial content moderation decision, one that may have altered the course of history: banning Musk’s favorite satire site. Twitter suspended the Babylon Bee, a conservative, self-described Christian satire site, after it referred to a transgender woman in the Biden administration, a health official, as “Man of the Year.” The site refused to delete the tweet, effectively making the suspension permanent. Musk’s partner, Grimes, had urged him to rethink his tweet about trans-inclusive pronouns. But this time, it was his ex-wife Talulah Riley who seemed to have his ear. Riley, an English actress whose two marriages to Musk had ended in divorce, had kept in contact. “America is going INSANE,” she wrote on March 24, according to text messages revealed in court records. “The Babylon Bee . . . suspension is crazy . . . It was a fucking joke. Why has everyone become so puritanical?” Then she asked: “can you buy Twitter and make it radically free-speech?” “Maybe buy it and change it to properly support free speech,” Musk wrote back seven minutes later. Then Musk tapped the “like” button, attaching a thumbs-up to Riley’s text asking him to buy the most influential social media website in the world.

    "title": "Pope Francis, 88, Is Dead",
    "article_text": "With hope as a key theological virtue, Catholics are not allowed to despair. Not of ourselves nor of our Church nor of the unfolding of history. But for a young American Catholic coming of age at the turn of the millennium, I found that a tall order. A ghastly sex abuse crisis had shattered the Church’s moral authority, Pope John Paul II’s health left him unable to effectively lead, and the US Conference of Bishops seemed so fixated on sexual morality and abortion that the broader revolutionary message of Christianity—about the poor and the outcast—became less of a voice crying out in the wilderness than a bare whisper in an empty room. The Church felt too reactionary, too calcified, too comfortable, crouching defensively rather than leading a charge against the spiritual and moral ills of our time.Pope Benedict XVI, an admittedly brilliant theological mind elevated to the papacy in 2005, didn’t offer much change. But then, on the 13th of May, 2013, Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected pope, and from the moment he took the name Francis (“The man who gives us this spirit of peace, the poor man,” he explained to reporters, for he “would like a poor Church, and for the poor.”), I felt startling, unexpected hope. And I wasn’t alone. “I never thought I’d have a pope like this in my lifetime,” a priest I know told me. “It must be divine providence, I can’t think of any other explanation.” This pope—who died at age 88 this week after prolonged respiratory complications—allowed theological dissent, spoke forcefully about environmentalism, emphasized the brutal effects of globalism, all with a wide, welcoming, and slightly impish smile. There weren’t major doctrinal shifts during his pontificate, but there was a long-needed breath of fresh air. “I’m not that religious,” an elderly relative once told me. “But I do believe in Mother Teresa. And Pope Francis.” Part of the shock of his papacy was how out of character it was from his earlier history. Born in Buenos Aires in 1936, the young Bergoglio studied in technical schools and worked as a janitor, a bouncer, and a lab technician. After becoming a Jesuit priest at 32, he rapidly rose through the clergy, serving as superior of the Jesuit province of Argentina until 1979, only four years after taking final vows. Three years later, a military dictatorship took over the country and violently suppressed the population, kidnapping and killing up to 30,000 alleged leftists, including two Jesuits jailed for their work in poor neighborhoods. One of them, Father Orlando Yurio, would accuse Bergoglio of allowing their abduction, albeit with little evidence, and supporters of Francis point to his work helping other dissidents flee the regime. Undoubtedly, though, he was at odds with the Jesuit community he led. Some Jesuits, a famously intellectual and progressive order of priests, chafed under his discipline and his conservative theology. “He seemed unaware of any teachings of Vatican II,” one of his students later complained. “It was all Saint Thomas Aquinas and the old Church fathers.” Bergoglio was also, intriguingly, committed to popular piety. One critic complained that he encouraged students to go to the chapel at night and touch images: “This was something the poor did, the people of the pueblo, something that the society of Jesus worldwide just doesn’tdo.I mean,touching images…What is that?” He’d eventually be sent into exile in Córdoba before being named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, where he was still enough of a toxic presence among the Jesuits that he was asked not to reside in Jesuit houses. Upon his ascension to the papacy, the news agency Reuters described him as a “theological conservative,” and progressive Catholics braced themselves. A Jesuit and family friend told me that the day after his election the mood among the Jesuits in Rome was like being “at a wake.” But this was not the same man who’d been a scourge to the progressive priests of 1970s Argentina. As an archbishop and then cardinal, he’d adopted a modest lifestyle, traveling by bus and declining to live in the archbishop’s palace. He’d adopted a newfound humility as a spiritual discipline imposed, as one biographer put it, “on a personality which has its share of pride and a propensity to dogmatic and domineering behavior.” The first pope from the Americas, he became what many referred to asthe People’s Pontiff.He declined to take up residence in the Apostolic Palace. He carried his own bags. He ritually washed the feet of prisoners. He created a retreat for homeless Romans just steps from the Vatican. He declared a theme for his papacy—misericordia, meaning: mercy. At key moments, he would not shy from taking sides, as he did when likening the atrocities of Russian troops in Ukraine to acts of “genocide,” comparing them to the war crimes committed under Stalin—or when objecting to the “cruelty” of Israeli air strikes that killed Palestinian civilians, including children, in Gaza. In February,he roundly criticizedthe Trump administration’s “program of mass deportations,” noting that Jesus himself had been displaced to Egypt, and warned people of faith not to “give in to narratives that discriminate against and cause unnecessary suffering to our migrant and refugee brothers and sisters.” One area where he offered less dogmatism and greater flexibility was sexual ethics. “Who am I to judge?” Pope Francis famously answered in response to a reporter’s questions about gay priests early in his pontificate. Years later he’d support American JesuitFather James Martin’s outreach to LGBTQ+ Catholics. And his openness to relaxing the Church’s treatment of divorced and remarried Catholics enraged conservatives who felt he was undermining a critical sacrament. But fights over doctrine underplayed what was perhaps a more pivotal shift—a decentralization of Church governance in which the former “authoritarian” committed himself to ceding authority. And here we saw glimpses of the younger Bergoglio, who wanted his intellectual, often upper-class Jesuit students, to go into the chapel and touch icons, connecting their faith to the people of the pueblo. Francis has pushed for a “synodal church.” A synod (or a gathering to decide doctrine), demands the faithful first listen “attentively to each other’s lived experiences” before deliberation, and during the 2023 Synod on Synodality, Pope Francis insisted that for the first time in the church’s history lay men and women participate as full voting members. Archbishop Victor Manuel Fernàndez, the head of the Vatican’s doctrinal office, said that when he was appointed, “Francis wrote to me that the best way to care for the doctrine of the faith is to grow our understanding of it, because ‘this harmonious growth will preserve Christian doctrine more effectively than any control mechanism,’ especially if we know how to present a God who loves, who frees, who lifts up, who empowers people.” It’s this promise I held on to, throughout his papacy. The notion that, rather than tamp down discussions, the Church could be a place for harmonious growth. The fullness of time will reveal whether or not he was successful. But Pope Francis gave me hope. Inside Elon Musk’s Grievance-FueledMAGA-morphosis CanThe Last of UsSurvive theGruesome Deathof Its Main Character?

    "article_text": "The first season ofThe Last of Ushad it easy. Which is not to diminish the pitch-perfect adaptation from cocreatorsCraig MazinandNeil Druckmann;it’s just that the show’s 2013 source material is pretty straightforward. With a road trip story at its heart,The Last of Us(the game) had a very conventional narrative spine that translated well to television. ButThe Last of Us Part II,on which both this season and the show’s forthcoming third installment are based, is a much messier affair. In tonight’s shocking episode, “Through the Valley,” we learn the first reason why: The sequelstartsby blowing up the thing people loved about the first game, specifically by killing Joel, played in the show byPedro Pascal.Now, in just the second episode of its second season, the TV adaptation ofThe Last of Ushas followed suit. Joel is dead, at the hands ofKaitlyn Dever’s steely militia member, Abby. This is daring,Game of Thrones–esque stuff, involving an actor who alsodied very memorablyon that show. The relationship between Joel and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) is the heart ofThe Last of Us.By killing Joel, especially so soon, the show has abandoned safety in favor of plunging into the unknown. At the same time, Joel’s death feels fated. Much likethis season’s premieredid, “Through the Valley” opens with a flashback. This time, we’re thrust back into season one’s gruesome finale as seen through the eyes of Abby, who is mourning someone whom Joel murdered during his massacre at the Firefly base. Abby and her crew of Firefly remnants—we’re later told they’re members of a militia that calls itself the WLF, but what those letters mean isn’t made clear just yet—are scoping out Jackson, trying to figure out their next move. They don’t seem to have one. Then destiny intervenes. Back in Jackson, members of the community have found evidence of a large number of infected hiding in the snow, and the fact that the monsters are getting smarter is particularly unsettling. So Ellie, Jesse, Dina, and Joel all go out on patrol, setting Jackson’s residents, Abby’s team, and the infected all on a violent collision course—one that is going to end in tragedy. Their effort is interrupted by a huge snowstorm. When it subsides, the first person to stumble upon the infected horde is not one of Jackson’s patrols, but Abby. While tailing Joel—who is, as far as she knows, just some guy from Jackson she hopes to torture for information—Abby falls victim to the icy mountain slopes, tumbling down to the surface of a frozen lake. This scene is one lifted directly from the game, but Mazin and directorMark Mylodtake the opportunity to play up the horror of the moment, creating a frigid nightmare that makes a meal out of the kind of special effects an HBO budget can afford. Abby is nearly overcome by the infected until she’s saved by Joel himself. She can’t believe her luck—she’s run into the actual man she was looking for, so far from the safety of his community. With the horde bearing down on them, it’s extremely easy for Abby to convince Joel and Dina to go to a nearby lodge where her team is holed up, luring Joel to his doom. Once there, things escalate swiftly. Jesse and Ellie get word that Joel and Dina have not checked in with the home base at Jackson after the snowstorm, splitting up to find them. Back in Jackson, workers find the cordyceps growth hiding in the pipes that we first glimpsed in the premiere, and infected hordes suddenly appear on the landscape. Jackson has five minutes to prepare. What follows is one of the biggest action sequences thus far onThe Last of Us(they even bring the Big Boy Infected back!)—another expansion from the game, in which Jackson’s residents don’t have to deal with this horde at all. But unfortunately for Joel, the final moments of “Through the Valley” are extremely faithful to the opening hours ofThe Last of Us Part II—and even more excruciatingly detailed. Upon arriving at the lodge, Joel and Dina are held at gunpoint. Dina is drugged unconscious, and Abby shoots Joel in the leg, revealing the reason for her vendetta: Her father was the doctor who was supposed to operate on Ellie at the end of last season. Joel killed him in cold blood. As a militia soldier, Abby sees herself as a person with a code, while Joel seems to just be “a lawless piece of shit.” Joel doesn’t care for her speech, so Abby settles for beating him with a golf club. At this point, Ellie has managed to find tracks leading to the lodge and sneaks in. But she’s outgunned and restrained, able to see but not help as Joel is beaten to a pulp. Much like the scene it adapts, it’s all awful, with Ellie pleading for Joel to get up and Abby paying her no mind. Abby finishes the job by stabbing Joel in the neck with the broken golf club. Ellie vows revenge, promising to kill them all. But Abby and her crew don’t care what Ellie has to say. Having accomplished their grim mission, they leave Ellie there with Joel’s corpse. Jesse, too late, finds Ellie and brings her home to Jackson—with Joel’s body in tow. For a moment, it seemed likeThe Last of Usmight delay the inevitability of Joel’s death in season two. Its second-season premiere set up the possibility of spending more time with Joel and Ellie, which would have only made his death hurt more. More scenes of them together still might be coming; the continued mentions of Gene, a character we haven’t yet seen but knowwill be played this seasonbyJoe Pantoliano,strongly imply a pending flashback episode. But like the game it’s based on,The Last of Usis severing Ellie and Joel’s connection hard and fast. Again, it’s a ballsy move that requires the story to quickly find something else to build its drama around, and the efficacy of this adaptation might not even be clear until the show’s third season. But for now, like cover version of theShawn Jamessong that plays over the credits and gives “Through the Valley” its biblical title,The Last of Ushas plunged us into darkness.

    "article_text": "Green Earth says investigation suggests plastic bags, bin liners and pet waste bags labelled as ‘oxo-degradable’ had been sold by retailers About 70 shops in Hong Kong have allegedly sold banned oxo-degradable plastic products, including waste bags for pets, according to an environmental charity. The Green Earth said its investigation suggested that plastic bags, bin liners and waste bags for pets labelled as “oxo-degradable” were still being sold by large retail shops and online stores, prompting lawmakers to accuse the government of not adequately educating the public on the ban. Hong Kong implemented legislation to reduce the use of plastic products starting in April last year. As part of the law, the city has banned the production, supply and sale of all oxo-degradable plastic products, regardless of whether they are disposable. The Environmental Protection Department said oxo-degradable plastics were less environmentally friendly than other materials because they broke down into microplastics, exacerbating their harmful effects on ecologies and hindering recycling efforts. Steven Chan Wing-kit, an assistant environmental affairs manager at The Green Earth, said the group’s investigation suggested that about 70 shops were still selling products containing the material as of earlier this month.",

    "title": "Smoke-free floors in Hong Kong public housing ‘infeasible’, ‘unfair’: lawmakers",
    "article_text": "‘We have to protect the health of non-smokers but cannot deny grass-roots residents the right to smoke,’ lawmaker says The designation of smoke-free floors at public estates to reduce Hong Kong’s smoking rate is technically infeasible and unfair to low-income tenants, lawmakers have said, following a statutory body’s proposal. They also said on Monday that implementing the measure proposed by the Hong Kong Council on Smoking and Health could potentially prolong the already lengthy wait time for public housing due to the shortage of flats. It could deny residents the right to choose to smoke. “It’s definitely only possible in new housing estates before people moved in, because in the existing ones, there is no way we could distinguish between residents who smoke and those who do not,” Scott Leung Man-kwong, a member of the legislature’s housing panel, told a radio programme. “Let’s say we were to implement this in existing housing estates, how do we relocate those who do not wish to live next to residents who smoke elsewhere? This could bring about practical difficulties in putting it into practice.” He added that there could be further issues, such as residents’ preferences for higher or lower floors and the direction the flats faced, noting that he had “strong reservations” about the measure that could not be solved in a short period of time. According to him, residents frequently complain about smokers leaving their front doors open, exposing children and the elderly in flats along the same corridor to second-hand smoke.",

    "article_text": "Expert says the disease is still rare in Hong Kong but travellers heading overseas should consider vaccination Hong Kong has recorded a surge in cases of a life-threatening bacterial infection in the first four months of this year, prompting a leading infectious disease expert to call on the public to consider vaccination when travelling. Asian Society for Paediatric Infectious Diseases president Dr Mike Kwan Yat-wah said Hong Kong had reported five invasive meningococcal infections so far in 2025, matching last year’s annual figure. The five cases included a fatality, a 73-year-old man with chronic diseases. “If the city has an asymptomatic patient, the disease can spread in the community easily,” Kwan warned. “Apart from the government, healthcare professionals and doctors should proactively provide more information for residents to understand more about the disease and undertake precautionary measures.” The infection, caused by the meningococcus bacterium, can result in a high fever, a severe headache, a stiff neck, vomiting, rashes or even death.",

    "title": "Weather tracker: Unseasonable warmth continues in eastern Europe",
    "article_text": "After a spell of record-breaking heat last week, easternEuropeand western parts of Russia will experience further unseasonable warmth in the next few days. The burst of mid-spring warmth began during the middle of last week, when temperatures climbed to the high 20s celsius in eastern Germany and Poland. By Friday, the northern coastal town of Łeba in Poland recorded a maximum temperature of 29.6C (84.2F), nearly 20C above the town’s April average. By the end of the week, the heat had spread eastwards into the Baltics and western Russia, bringing record-breaking temperatures there during the day and overnight. InLithuania, four stations climbed to above 29C on Friday, smashing the country’s April maximum temperature record of 23.1C, set 66 years ago in 1959. Neighbouring Latvia and Estonia also set new national April temperature records late last week, registering maximum temperatures of 28.4C and 28.8C respectively. While there was a slight cooling trend at the weekend, a broad area of high pressure centred over Russia is likely to sustain well above average temperatures during much of this week.Belarusand western Russia, including Moscow, are expected to have temperatures 10-15C above the seasonal average through to the middle part of this week. However, a reversal of fortunes is likely by the weekend. As high pressure builds over north-west Europe, colder air from the north is forecast to sweep into the region. Some forecast models suggest daytime temperatures in Moscow could struggle to reach double digits, with values potentially running 5-10C below average. After a brief reprieve in some parts from heatwave conditions that northern and centralIndiaexperienced earlier in the month, sweltering conditions are expected to return to parts of north-west and central India as thunderstorms and rainfall ease in the coming days. Temperatures of up to about 45C – 5-10C above the seasonal average – are expected across states such as Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Uttar Pradesh later this week, with the India Meteorological Department issuing fresh heatwave warnings. While recent thunderstorms brought temporary relief to areas including Delhi, Punjab and Haryana, the effect is expected to fade quickly as hot, dry winds intensify. During the pre-monsoon season in India, which typically spans March to May, the development of thunderstorms helps to mitigate rises in temperatures. However, when thunderstorm activity is reduced, as has occurred during much of this April in parts of India, temperatures are able to rise gradually day by day, bringing heatwave conditions. Health officials have advised precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses, particularly during peak afternoon hours, as conditions are expected to worsen in the days ahead.",

    "title": "China warns countries not to align with US in trade",
    "article_text": "Beijing has issued a warning to countries considering limiting their trade with China in hopes of gaining tariff relief from the US, saying it will retaliate against any such moves. The administration of US President Donald Trump plans to pressure other countries into limiting trade with China, including imposing monetary sanctions, in return for better trade terms, according to media reports. China“firmly opposes any party reaching a deal at the expense of China’s interests,”the Commerce Ministry said in a statement on Monday, adding that Beijing would“resolutely take countermeasures.” Washington’s tariff standoff with Beijing comes amid a broader US campaign targeting dozens of countries. While most of the elevated tariffs were paused for 90 days, allowing for trade negotiations, China was excluded from the reprieve. The total tariff on Chinese goods has been hiked to 145%. “Appeasement will not bring peace, and compromise will not earn respect,”the ministry said.“Seeking so-called exemptions by harming the interests of others for one’s own selfish and shortsighted gains is like negotiating with a tiger for its skin. In the end, it will only lead to a lose-lose situation.” The Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing unnamed sources, that the Trump administration aims to use tariff negotiations to pressure US trading partners to limit ties with China. The plan reportedly involves blocking Chinese goods from transiting through their countries, preventing Chinese firms from relocating to avoid US duties, and rejecting cheap Chinese industrial imports. Trump has not officially stated he would pressure countries to curb trade with China, but the president has suggested openness to the idea. “Maybe, yeah, maybe,”Trump told Fox News last week, when he was asked whether Latin American countries should be forced to choose between Chinese and US investment.“They should do that.” Since the escalation of trade tensions with the US, China has been actively strengthening its ties with other countries, engaging with officials from the EU, Japan, and South Korea. Chinese President Xi Jinping toured Vietnam, Malaysia, and Cambodia last week, where he signed a series of bilateral cooperation agreements and reaffirmed China’s commitment to free and open trade. “The fact is, nobody wants to pick a side,”Bo Zhengyuan, partner at China-based policy consultancy Plenum told NBC News. “If countries have high reliance on China in terms of investment, industrial infrastructure, technology know-how and consumption, I don’t think they’ll be buying into US demands. Many Southeast Asian countries belong to this category,”he added.",
