    "article_text": "Massachusetts' Medford City Democratic Committee wants to make sure immigrants are aware of their rights when approached by authorities. (WFXT) Democrats in oneMassachusetts cityhave purchased thousands of red cards intended to remind immigrants of their constitutional rights if approached by ICE or related agencies. The Medford City Democratic Committee, based about six miles northwest of Boston, has already bought 4,000 cards, intended for use by citizens and noncitizens alike. The cards list theirFourth and Fifth Amendment rights: protecting them from warrantless searches, seizures, and having to speak to authorities without legal counsel. They are printed in English on one side, with translations in Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Haitian on the other, Medford City Councilor Matthew Leming notes on the committee's website. REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS SEEK TO STRIP DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA OF ITS SANCTUARY CITY POLICIES Democrats in Medford, Massachusetts, have 4,000 red cards in various languages ready to distribute. Four-thousand more are reportedly on the way.(WFXT) Four-thousand more cards have also been approved for purchase, he said, writing, \"Red cards are like helpful business cards that a holder can hand to an officer if they approach in public.\" The cost of the initiative was $826, according to WFXT, a Boston FOX affiliate. Leming told Fox News Digital that taxpayer funds are not being used to subsidize the program. Rather, he said, theDemocratic City Committeefooted the bill. \"We’re just trying to find things we can do that are feasible to resist what’s happening at the federal level,\" Leming told WFXT. \"It’s a way to protect our immigrant communities from the actions of the current administration.\" TRUMP SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER CRACKING DOWN ON ‘SANCTUARY’ CITIES, THREATENS THEIR FEDERAL FUNDING \"The cards list basic constitutional protections that apply to everybody, and everybody in the U.S. should be aware of their constitutional rights,\" he further noted when asked by Fox News Digital. The legal complexities of such an initiative are apparent — and whether constitutional rights apply to illegal immigrants can be a hot point of debate among legal scholars. Medford City Councilor Matt Leming, a proponent of the red card initiative, asserts that it's reminding people of \"basic constitutional protections that apply to everybody.\"(WFXT) Leming hopes to take the initiative even further. \"What we’re trying to do is find nonprofits who would be willing to sign up and give us a receipt for finance purposes so we can mail them out,\" he said. \"A lot of our actions are restricted by campaign finance laws.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Medford \"red card\" initiative comes amid widespread pushback by blue-state officials regarding theTrump administration'simmigration crackdown — including visits by members of Congress to El Salvador to protest the detention of suspected MS-13 gang member Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and recent court rulings attempting to restrict Border Patrol agents' ability to detain suspected illegal immigrants.

    "article_text": "Comedian Rachel Bloom spoke to Fox News about what its like to be a comedian in 2025 amid contemporary pressures around political correctness. (Nicholas Ballasy) Comedian and actress Rachel Bloom told Fox News Digital that she doesn't find it hard to be funny, despite concerns from other comedians that political correctness has taken over the industry. Bloom acknowledged that \"culturally\" comedy changes over time, but she said that – in her opinion – the fear of being \"canceled\" does not impact her jokes. \"For me, the way I approachwriting and comedyis, 'What can I say about the world that I haven't seen another person say. Or what's a show I want to see – what's a joke I want to see that I haven't seen, and usually servicing that – there are things to navigate – but as long as I'm servicing that, that's my North Star,\" Bloom told Fox News during an event over the weekend focused on preserving funding for the arts.

What's a need I can fill?' Which is why I went into musical comedy in the first place.\" While Bloom seems less fazed by the thought of being canceled over her jokes, other comedians like Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais, Bill Burr, Chris Rock and others have been outspoken with their complaints about the current environment for comedians. \"It started off with something everyone could agree on, and then quickly it just spun out of control. I remember whenever that cancel culture got to the point of where it was, ‘I don’t like some of the topics in your stand up act,’ right? That’s when it got weird,\" Burr told fellow comedian Bill Maher on an episode of his \"Club Random\" podcast.

I've always – I always really – I don't know I'm candid with my own journey.

    "title": "Vance breaks key tie after Senate fails to reject Trump's national emergency on tariffs",
    "article_text": "O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the Trump administration's trade tactics and efforts to take on China. The Senate failed Wednesday to pass a resolution rejecting PresidentDonald Trump's\"Liberation Day\"tariff agenda, as several Republicans signaled beforehand they favored halting the relatively new levies, and Vice President JD Vance was called in to break an ensuing procedural tie. The disapproval resolution failed 49-49, with three Republicans joining all Democrats present in attempting to throw a wrench in Trump's tariff plans. After that, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., put forward a motion to reconsider the resolution, then moved to table – or kill – the initial motion, which procedurally would prevent Democrats from forcing such a vote again. That vote also deadlocked, but after about 80 minutes, Vice President Vance cast a tie-breaking vote in his dual role as president of the Senate. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., had introduced the resolution to end Trump's \"national emergency\" as a \"privileged\" one – meaning it would require a vote regardless of the upper chamber being in Republican hands. The House, however, has signaled it is not inclined to pursue the same. Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., split from the rest of the GOP and sought to end the national emergency that backs the tariffs. Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., did not vote. CHINA IS ‘CAVING’ TO TRUMP'S TRADE WAR STRATEGY, EXPERT SIGNALS A New York Times columnist grilled the Democratic Party for not mounting an aggressive enough attack on President Trump's tariff policy.(BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images) Whitehouse was reportedly on a plane back from South Korea and wouldn't make the gavel, according toProvidence's CBS affiliate. Before the vote, there was chatter about key absences that could swing the vote one way or another, as key tallies are all about the math. One tariff critic told reporters earlier Wednesday that the disapproval motion sent \"the message I want to send\" that tariffs must be more \"discriminatory.\" \"It's not perfect, I think it's too broad,\" Collins said,according to Politico. In remarks on the Senate floor earlier in the day, Paul, – one of the most vocal opponents to tariffs and proponents of free trade – who suggested conservatives may want to reconsider their support for the tariffs. \"You know, there was an old-fashioned conservative principle that believed that less taxes were better than more taxes,\" Paul said. \"That if you tax something, you got less of it. So that if you place a new tax on trade, you'll get less trade.\" TRUMP WAGERS US ECONOMY IN HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBLE AT 100-DAY MARK \"There was also this idea that you didn't do taxation without representation. That idea goes not only back to our American Revolution, it goes back to the English Civil War as well. It goes back probably to Magna Carta,\" he said of the phrase, which for some time was the District of Columbia's official slogan, given its lack of full-vote representation in Congress. Paul said the Constitution forbids taxation being implemented in a way that circumvents Congress and laid out why he thought that was the case today. \"An emergency has been declared, as the Senator from Virginia remarked,\" he said. \"Everywhere, there's an emergency everywhere. Sounds like an emergency everywhere is really an emergency nowhere.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., had previously balked at Trump's tariffs on Canada, saying that while fentanyl proliferation is an emergency as the president declared, it is not one that is germane to Canada. Reached for comment, the office of Sen. Mitch McConnell – Paul's fellow Kentucky Republican – did not offer any further remarks after reports suggested he too is uncomfortable with Trump's tariff agenda. Fox News Digital also reached out to Murkowski for comment in that regard. Schumer commented on the ultimate result, saying Republicans \"voted to keep the Trump tariff-tax in place. They own the Trump tariffs and higher costs on America’s middle-class families.\" Fox News' Tyler Olson contributed to this report. Charles Creitz is a reporter for Fox News Digital.

(Credit: Sky News) The trial of anAustralian womanaccused of serving her ex-husband’s family poisonous mushrooms began this week, nearly a year after the suspect pleaded not guilty to her charges. Erin Patterson, 50, was charged with three counts of murder and one count of attempted murder. She was originally charged with two counts of attempted murder, though the charge was dropped earlier this week. Patterson appeared in the Victoria state Supreme Court on Wednesday, where prosecutor Nanette Rogers told jurors the accused had served a meal of beef Wellington, mashed potatoes and green beans at her home in the rural town of Leongartha on July 29, 2023.

The body of Viktoria Roshchyna, 27, was one of 757 bodies of mostlyUkrainian soldiersreturned to Kyiv on Feb. 14, 2025, and reportedly bore unmistakable signs of torture after more than a year in Russian captivity. Roshchyna, who was described as a determined journalist, was captured by Russian forces while reporting behind the front lines in aRussian-occupiedarea of Ukraine in August 2023. While her body was returned with hundreds of others, she was reportedly one of the few whose name was not provided, instead a tag attached to her shin read \"unidentified male.\" Journalist Viktoria Roshchyna was reportedly held in occupied Ukraine and tortured by Russian forces before dying in captivity in October 2024.(Image provided by East2West) RUSSIAN ATTACKS ON UKRAINE INTENSIFY IN MAKE-OR-BREAK WEEK FOR PEACE TALKS According to areportby the Washington Post, her head had been shaved, burn marks were evident on her feet, a rib was found to have been broken, and there were possible traces of electric shock. An investigation into her detention and death confirmed that some of her organs were missing in what some reports suggested was a move to conceal the extent of her torture, including her brain, eyes and part of the trachea. Yurii Bielousov, head of the Ukrainian Prosecutor General’s Office war crimes department, whichled the investigation into her death, told Ukrainian media outlet Ukrainska Pravda that there were signs she had also been strangled. Russia did not confirm until April 2024 that it had detained the journalist, and in October 2024 it sent a letter to her father, Volodymyr Roshchyna, telling him she haddied in captivity. Her body was marked by Russian officials with an abbreviation \"SPAS,\" which reportedly means \"total failure of the arteries of the heart,\" a designation that Russian authorities may have used to fabricate an official cause of death.

After her capture, Roshchyna was held at a police station in the city of Energodar near theZaporizhzhi nuclear power plant, where, according to the investigation, Russian forces set up a \"torture chamber\" and subjected captives to severe beatings and electric shock. It is believed Roshchyna endured electric shock applied to her ears. Roshchyna was thentransferred to Melitopoldays later where she was held until the end of 2023 and is also believed to have endured significant torture. By the beginning of 2024, she was reportedly transferred along with other prisoners to a pre-trial detention center known as \"No. 2\" in Taganrog, a city in southwest Russia near the Ukrainian border and which has been likened to a concentration camp.

    "article_text": "Former State Department deputy special envoy Ellie Cohanim discusses the Trump administrations efforts to secure a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine on Fox News @ Night. The United States and Ukraine are on the verge of signing a mineral deal after months of fraught and chaotic negotiations, although a last-minute snag still needs to be ironed out. Ukraine's prime minister said First Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko was flying to Washington on Wednesday to sign the deal, which is central to Kyiv's efforts to mend ties with President Donald Trump and the White House as the U.S. president tries to secure a peace settlement inRussia's warin Ukraine. The latest version of the minerals agreement was reached after Kyiv secured a significant concession from the Trump administration that only future military aid would count as the US contribution to the deal, according to theFinancial Times. President Donald Trump gestures as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy looks on at the White House in Washington, D.C., Feb. 28, 2025.(REUTERS/Nathan Howard) HERE'S THE REAL REASON TRUMP AND ZELENSKYY'S DEAL BLEW UP IN THE OVAL OFFICE Trump had indicated in February that he wanted access to Ukraine’s rare earth materials as a condition for continued U.S. support in the war, describing it as reimbursement for the billions of dollars in aid the U.S. has given to Kyiv. But a famous Oval Office spat with Ukrainian PresidentVolodymr Zelenskyyset negotiations back. However, the pair met face-to-face in Rome on Saturday at the Pope's funeral. According to a draft of the new agreement seen by Reuters, the two countries would create a joint reconstruction fund funded by 50% of profits from Ukraine’s new mineral licenses. The draft agreement gives the U.S. preferential access to new Ukrainian natural resources deals but does not automatically hand Washington a share of Ukraine's mineral wealth or any of its gas infrastructure, the draft showed. Ukraine would not be required to pay back previous aid provided to the war-torn country by the U.S., with only future aid being counted as America’s contribution to the fund.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s team told her she should \"be ready to sign all agreements, or go back home,\" the Financial Times reports, citing three people familiar with the matter.

Among them are Ukraine’s deposits of titanium, which is used for making aircraft wings and other aerospace manufacturing, and uranium, which is used for nuclear power, medical equipment and weapons. Ukraine also has lithium, graphite and manganese, which are used in electric vehicle batteries. Unlike an earlier draft, the deal would not conflict with Ukraine’s path towards European Union membership — a key provision for Kyiv. The two sides signed a memorandum, published on April 18, as an initial step towards clinching an accord on developing mineral resourcesin Ukraine. In the memorandum, they said they aimed to complete talks by April 26 and to sign the deal as soon as possible. Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

    "article_text": "UN Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer believes the U.S. government should move to sanction Albanese over claims of misconduct, including the alleged spreading of antisemitism. EXCLUSIVE —A United Nations watchdog organization is calling on Secretary of StateMarco Rubioto take action against an appointee of the international body whose second term is set to begin on May 1. In a letter to Rubio, U.N. Watch Executive Director Hillel Neuer argues that the U.S. government should sanction and deny entry and visas toFrancesca Albanese, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Additionally, he called for Albanese to be stripped of diplomatic immunity. Neuer describes Albanese in his letter as being \"pro-Hamas\" and says her reappointment was done \"illegally.\" UN Special Rapporteur for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Francesca Albanese, gives a press conference at the UN City in Copenhagen, Denmark on February 5, 2025.(Ritzau Scanpix/Ida Marie Odgaard via REUTERS ) UN OFFICIAL REAPPOINTED DESPITE ACCUSATIONS OF ANTISEMITISM \"Her purported reappointment this month was illegally carried out in violation of express U.N. rules requiring investigation of her misconduct, rendering her term renewal null and void,\" Neuer wrote. When speaking with Fox News Digital, Neuer pointed to the DOJ’s recent decision to allow lawsuits against the UNRWA (United NationsRelief and Works Agency for Palestine) as evidence that Rubio has the ability to act against Albanese. Neuer argued that the U.S. should act using a similar principle to the one used in cases against anti-Israel agitators, such as Mahmoud Khalil. He also wrote that \"Albanese’s abuse of a global platform to spread hatred and legitimize terrorism demands an unequivocal response.\" \"Legally, it's very clear to me — I used to be an attorney in Manhattan for one of the major law firms in the United States — it's clear to be in any proper court of law this kind of procedural malpractice fraud would result in her not being a U.N. appointee,\" Neuer told Fox News Digital.

Watch’s letter, Pascal Sim, Spokesperson, UN Human Rights Council, told Fox News Digital that, \"Francesca Albanese, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967 (a country mandate), was appointed by the Human Rights Council on 1 April 2022, which was the last day of the 49th session of the Human Rights Council. She took up her function on 1 May 2022. Therefore, according to the \"no longer than six years\" principle, she can serve as Special Rapporteur until 30 April 2028.\" Sim also asserted that \"at no time has the Human Rights Council, in any formal or informal way, been called to 'reappoint' or 'renew' any Special Procedures mandate-holder. Whenever the Human Rights Council nominates any Special Procedures mandate-holder, it does so with the knowledge that the mandate-holder may serve up to six years in this function.\" Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese, speaks during a press conference at the European headquarters of the UN in Geneva, Switzerland, on Dec. 11, 2024.(REUTERS/Pierre Albouy) Earlier this month, when the U.N. was set to consider Albanese’s reappointment, House Foreign Affairs Committee (HFAC) Chair Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., urged the U.N. not to allow it to go through. Mast argued in a letter to U.N. Human Rights Council (UNHRC) President Jürg Lauber that Albanese \"unapologetically\" used her role in the international body to \"attempt to legitimizeantisemitic tropes, while serving as a Hamas apologist.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In the past, multiple countries, including the U.S., have condemned Albanese for her remarks. In fact, theAnti-Defamation League(ADL) has compiled a list of antisemitic and anti-Israel statements made by Albanese throughout the years. In October 2024, while serving as a U.N. appointee, she shared a post on X, calling it a \"must-read for the ages.\" In the post, journalist Chris Hedges asserted that the \"Israel lobby has bought and paid for Congress and the two ruling parties,\" making campaign donations by Zionists \"a formidable barrier to peace.\" Albanese also compared Israel’s war in Gaza to the Holocaust and, in August 2024, called the Gaza Strip a \"concentration camp of the 21st century.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Francesca Albanese and the State Department for comment on this report but did not receive a response in time for publication.

More than 33,000 of thedeported immigrantswere Mexican nationals, Sheinbaum said on Tuesday during her regular morning press conference. \"Since President Trump's administration began, 38,757 have been deported [from the U.S. to Mexico], of which 33,311 are Mexicans and 5,446 are foreigners,\" Sheinbaum said. \"The majority of people who are returning to Mexico are Mexicans, because the U.S. government, through the Department of State, has agreements for them to return directly to their countries,\" Sheinbaum continued.

Fewer deportees of other nationalities were arriving in Mexico because the U.S. government has agreements with \"practically all of those countries, and so they send the planes directly to the countries where they are citizens,\" Sheinbaum said. The Mexican president said most of the Mexicans were flown from the U.S. and that the majority of the foreigners accepted back into Mexico have since \"voluntarily\" chosen to return to their home countries. ‘PROMPT REMOVAL’: TRUMP DHS EXPANDS EXPEDITED DEPORTATION POWERS AS OPERATIONS RAMP UP Mexico's president, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, speaks during a briefing conference.

    "article_text": "Fox News senior strategic analyst Gen. Jack Keane details an Iranian nuclear power program and how long it would take to be weapons-ready on 'Life, Liberty & Levin.' FIRST ON FOX – Experts on the Islamic Republic of Iran’smanipulative atomic weapons bargaining strategyissued a dire warning to team Trump negotiators on how to avoid falling into the trap of former President Barack Obama’s flawed nuclear deal with Iran. President Trump issued a scathing indictment of Obama’s agreement when he withdrew from the atomic accord in 2018, declaring, \"This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made.\" Trump asserted that Obama’s 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the formal name for the Iran nuclear deal, did not stop Tehran from building an atomic bomb. Experts from United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI)published a reportthat outlines the 10 negotiating tactics Iran exploits to secure major concessions while retaining its capability to construct a nuclear weapon. IRAN RAMPS UP STATE EXECUTIONS AMID NUCLEAR TALKS WITH US Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei in Tehran on March 21, 2025.(Iranian Leader Press Office/Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) The report, in an ode to President Trump’s famous 1987 book \"The Art of the Deal,\" is called: \"Iran’s Version of the ‘Art of the Deal'\" and was authored by Saeid Golkar, Jason M. Brodsky and Kasra Aarabi. The 10 tactics Iran uses in nuclear negotiations to outorganize the U.S. government and its allies, according to UANI, are: The Grass Can Be Greener Promises vague future rewards to keep talks alive without offering anything concrete. Exploit the illusion of political pluralism – use \"moderates\" vs. \"hardliners\" to extract concessions, even though all power lies with the supreme leader. Dangle phantom investment deals to lure Western governments and companies – then pull the rug out. Issue exaggerated threats to stir anti-war sentiment and paralyze tough policymaking in the U.S. Resist clear commitments; rely on vague language to allow deniability while still benefiting from deals. NUCLEAR WATCHDOG URGES ‘TRUST BUT VERIFY’ THAT IRAN ENGAGES IN GOOD-FAITH NEGOTIATIONS Members of the Iranian revolutionary guard march during a parade to commemorate the anniversary of the Iran-Iraq war in Tehran, Sept. 22, 2011.(Reuters) Engage in endless, exhausting talks to delay action, offering superficial gestures to avoid real consequences Invoke historical grievances to justify current behavior and shift blame onto the West. Exploit rifts within Western alliances – between the U.S. and Europe, or even within U.S. administrations Use bazaar-style haggling tactics – start high, concede slow, cloak intentions in false politeness. Leak selectively and spin the media narrative to present Iran as the reasonable actor driving diplomacy. The UANI experts explained in greater detail in their report how Iran’s regime maximizes gains with minimum concessions via its 10 deceptive bargaining tactics.

No formal decision has been taken. Iran has reached out to Britain, France and Germany ahead of the next negotiating session. This suggests Tehran is keeping its options open, but also wants to assess where the Europeans stand on the possiblere-imposition of U.N. sanctionsbefore October, when a resolution ratifying the 2015 accord expires.

The experts wrote that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali \"Ayatollah Khamenei’s overarching strategy has been rooted in his so-called ‘West without the U.S.’ method. Grounded in Khamenei’s and the Islamic Republic’s vehement anti-Americanism, this strategy has sought to divide the Europeans from the U.S. to undercut U.S. national interests.\" UANI argued that the Iranian regime's \"gimmicks are meant to try to mask the fact that the Iranians are offering nothing more than the concessions it made to President Obama under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) of 2015.\" Iran seeks to manipulate nuclear talks to diminish the \"ideal conditions for Israel and/or the U.S. to take military action against Tehran,\" noted UANI. Trump’s military threats to target Iran’s nuclear facilities have forced Tehran to engage in negotiations, according to the experts.

On Tuesday, the death toll reported from Tehran after the explosion had risen to 70, with another 1,200 said to have been injured from the blast. But, according to information from eyewitnesses and the impacts of the blast radius, those figures are expected to be drastically underreported amid concerns ofescalating internal unrest,sources have told Fox News Digital. According to information provided by the National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), the actual death toll from the catastrophic explosion is suspected to be closer to 250, with an estimated 1,500 injured.

Footage of the blast showed the substantial damage caused to shipping containers, nearby offices and a massive crater left by the explosion. Anyone within 200 feet of the blast is believed to have been killed, according to sources. One witness told the NCRI, \"The security situation is very severe.

Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni said \"shortcomings, including noncompliance with safety precautions and negligence\" led to the blast. The officials also said \"some individuals deemed responsible\" had been summoned, but the regime has yet to admit that any cargo units were holding missile propellant at the civilian shipping center, which is also Iran's largest port.

    "article_text": "Former FBI special agent Nicole Parker discusses the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case, President Donald Trump’s illegal immigration policy and his contentious ABC News interview on ‘America Reports.’ House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is privately signaling tofellow Democratsthat it’s time to hit pause on trips to El Salvador aimed at spotlighting the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a move reflecting growing internal tensions over how the party is handling border security and immigration enforcement optics in the 2026 cycle. Though Jeffries has publicly said Democrats are committed to securing Abrego Garcia’s return from a notorious Salvadoran prison, sources told The Bulwark that the New York Democrat has discouraged more lawmakers from traveling to the country. One seniorHouse stafferdescribed the leadership’s position bluntly: \"They want to let the El Salvador stuff slow down.\" \"This is patently false, and thinly sourced innuendo,\" said Jeffries staffer Christie Stephenson. \"When Leader Jeffries says ‘more is more’ pushback on this lawless administration, he means it. As Leader Jeffries has repeatedly said, House Democrats will never stop fighting for the release of Mr. Abrego Garcia.\" DEM SENATOR SAYS ABREGO GARCIA SITUATION 'NOT GOING TO END WELL' FOR TRUMP, ARGUES HE'S 'UNDERMINING' FREEDOM House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries speaks during a press conference at the Capitol on April 28, 2025.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images) The issue has divided Democrats. Progressives have embraced Abrego Garcia’s case as a symbol of what they say are unconstitutional deportations under President Donald Trump’srenewed immigration crackdown. But moderates are increasingly uneasy, pointing to the political risk of rallying around a figure with a checkered past. Jeffries, who once demanded that Abrego Garcia be returned \"immediately before he is killed,\" has not publicly addressed whether he supports the strategy of sending congressional delegations to El Salvador.

Van Hollen's Office via Getty Images) His spokesperson recently dismissed reports that he is pulling back from the issue as \"thinly sourced\" but did not deny the substance when initially contacted by The Bulwark. The stakes are high. As Fox News Digital previously reported, Abrego Garcia, who was deported alongside more than 200 others, reportedly has ties to the violent MS-13 gang and was named in a 2022Homeland Securityinvestigation into human smuggling.

Maxine Dexter, D-Ore., speaks at a press conference on the issue of Kilmar Abrego Garcia in San Salvador, El Salvadore, on April 21, 2025.(MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images) Though never charged, he was stopped while transporting eight undocumented passengers, and court documents in Maryland show a history of alleged domestic violence, including a judge labeling him a \"violent repeat offender.\" Despite this, Democrat lawmakers like Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Reps. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., and Robert Garcia, D-Calif., have flown to El Salvador in recent weeks to draw attention to Abrego Garcia’s detention. Van Hollen's visit particularly sparked memes online with the now-infamous \"margarita-gate\" incident. Critics within the party now worry that continued focus on the case and trips perceived as sympathetic to a deported gang suspect could backfire.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"There’s a moral argument to be made,\" one Democrat aide told The Bulwark, \"but it’s not clear this is the right poster case, and it’s definitely not the right political moment.\" Jasmine is a writer at Fox News Digital and a military spouse based in New Orleans.

Secretary of StateMarco Rubiorevealed during a Cabinet meeting that the Biden administration's State Department kept dossiers on Americans accused of serving as \"vectors of disinformation,\" including a file on an unidentified Trump administration official. \"We had an office in the Department of State whose job it was to censor Americans,\" Rubio said during Wednesday's Cabinet meeting withPresident Donald Trump. \"And, by the way, I'm not going to say who it is.

Former President Barack Obama established the small Global Engagement Center office in 2016 through an executive order aimed at coordinating counterterrorism messaging to foreign nations.(Getty Images) When announcing a massive reorganization of the State Department, the Global Engagement Center engaged with media outlets and platforms to censor speech it disagreed with, Rubio said. The center has been accused by conservatives of censoring them. Journalist Matt Taibbi, for example, previously reported that the center \"funded a secret list of subcontractors and helped pioneer an insidious — and idiotic — new form of blacklisting\" during the pandemic, Fox Digital reported in 2024. He added that the Global Engagement Center \"flagged accounts as ‘Russian personas and proxies’ based on criteria like, ‘Describing the Coronavirus as an engineered bioweapon,’ blaming ‘research conducted at the Wuhan institute,’ and ‘attributing the appearance of the virus to the CIA.’\" TWITTER BOSS ELON MUSK ACCUSES GOVERNMENT AGENCY OF BEING ‘WORST OFFENDER IN US GOVERNMENT CENSORSHIP’ Though Rubio did not identify which Trump official the Biden administration kept a dossier on, Elon Musk has previously railed against the Global Engagement Center.

    "article_text": "Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the ‘Gutfeld!’ panel break down what’s behind Democrats' poor polling. A Native American attorney is challenging David Hogg's vice chair position at theDemocratic National Committee(DNC) amid intra-party tensions ignited by the 25-year-old activist's $20 million investment through his political action group to primary older incumbent Democrats. \"While we are confident that the DNC Officer election was conducted fairly, transparently, and in alignment with the rules that were approved by the DNC Membership in advance of the election, the Party provides an opportunity for any candidate or member to raise concerns for further discussion,\" a DNC spokesperson told Fox News Digital. The DNC Credentials Committeewill meet virtually on May 12to consider longtime Democratic Party activist Kalyn Free's challenge, a decision made before the fallout of Hogg's plan to primary incumbents, according to a source familiar. Freesubmitted a complaintfollowing the DNC's Feb. 1 officer elections, in which Hogg, Malcolm Kenyatta and Artie Blanco secured the vice chair positions. Free alleged in the complaint that the DNC \"discriminated against three women of color candidates,\" during officer elections earlier this year. The news wasfirst reported by Semafor. DEMOCRATS' VICE CHAIR GETS ULTIMATUM: STAY NEUTRAL IN PRIMARIES OR STEP DOWN FROM PARTY LEADERSHIP David Hogg, gun control advocate and survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School tragedy, at the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 22, 2024.(AFP via Getty Images) Hogg claimed his vice chair position with 214.5 votes, while Kenyetta had 298. According to the network pool producer at the leadership election, 205 votes were needed to win. Free secured 96. Jeanna Repass had 112, and Shasti Conrad had just 91.5 votes. DEMOCRATS’ VICE CHAIR IGNITES CIVIL WAR, TARGETING 'ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL' INCUMBENTS IN PRIMARIES \"This is about fairness and making sure that three women and the members of the DNC are not disenfranchised. I’ve spent my whole life fighting for fairness in, and through, the Democratic party and we should expect nothing less this time. The DNC needs to correct this flawed election and then we all need to get back to the work of electing Democrats both incumbents and picking up new seats because the real priority is stopping Donald Trump and his dangerous agenda for our country,\" Free told Fox News Digital in a statement. A source familiar shut down Free's allegation, emphasizing to Fox News Digital that the election results weren't even close. But Free accused the DNC of a \"fatally flawed election that violated the DNC Charter\" in her complaint and requested \"two new vice chair elections,\" Free confirmed. \"By aggregating votes across ballots and failing to distinguish between gender categories in a meaningful way, the DNC’s process violated its own Charter and Bylaws, undermining both fairness and gender diversity,\" Free wrote. While Free's complaint was filed before Hogg made headlines this month for his brutal plan to primary incumbent Democrats in deep blue districts, the fallout is the latest blow to the young Democratic leader. Hogg pledged to donate $20 million through his political action committee, Leaders We Deserve, to primary-challenge some older Democrats in blue districts. Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin speaks after winning the vote at the Democratic National Committee Winter Meeting at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Md., on Feb. 1, 2025.(Rod Lamkey, Jr./AP Photo) DNC chairKen Martinaffirmed last week that the DNC will stay neutral in intra-party primaries, giving Hogg the ultimatum to either rescind his vice chair position or forego his political influence via his PAC. \"No DNC officer should ever attempt to influence the outcome of a primary election, whether on behalf of an incumbent or a challenger,\" Martin said last week, adding, \"If you want to challenge incumbents, you're more than free to do that, but just not as an officer of the DNC, because our job is to be neutral arbiters. We can't be both the referee and also the player at the same time.\" Following Hogg's primary fallout, Martin announced new investments for the state parties and a strengthened neutrality pledge for DNC officials. The proposal, which would require DNC officials to pledge neutrality in primaries, is expected to be voted on by the party's Rules and Bylaws committee next month. If the panel approves the proposal, the full DNC membership would take a final vote during the party's annual summer meeting in August. Gun violence survivor and activist David Hogg speaks at the March for our Lives rally against gun violence at the National Mall in Washington on June 11, 2022.(Getty Images) Hoggreplied to the news on social medialater that day, accusing the DNC of \"trying to change the rules because I'm not currently breaking them. As we’re seeing law firms, tech companies, and so many others bowing to Trump, we all must use whatever position of power we have to fight back. And that’s exactly what I'm doing.\" \"This moment requires us to have the strongest opposition party possible to stop Trump from destroying people’s retirement savings, disappearing people, plunging our economy into oblivion—and to provide a real alternative to the Republican Party for voters that we simply do not have right now,\" Hogg added. The move by Hogg comes as Democrats disagree about how to respond to PresidentDonald Trump'sfirst 100 days back in the White House. During an interview with CNN last week, longtime Democratic strategistJames Carvilleripped Hogg for challenging those within his own party when he could be investing those same funds to \"take on a Republican.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The most insane thing I ever heard is the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee is spending $20 million running against other Democrats.

EXCLUSIVE:The American Parents Coalition (APC) is weighing in on a lawsuit against a Florida middle school accused ofsecretly socially transitioninga 13-year-old girl behind her family’s back. The group, which advocates for the rights of parents and families across the country, filed a brief in support of the Littlejohn family with the 11th Circuit Court on Wednesday. APC is arguing that so-called social transitioning is a type of medical treatment and that \"parents have a substantive due process right to be informed about the treatments a school administers to their minor child and to refuse those treatments.\" The girl’s parents, January and Jeffrey Littlejohn,filed the suitagainst the school board of Leon County, Florida. In aninterview earlier this year, January Littlejohn, who was one of President Donald Trump’s guests at his address to a joint session of Congress, shared how the school’s actions had an extreme, \"destructive\" effect on her daughter and entire family. Littlejohn said that despite the school’s behavior, her daughter has worked through her gender confusion. But she said the school’s actions created a \"huge wedge between us and our daughter\" that \"took many years to repair.\" TRUMP GUEST WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS TRANSITIONED BEHIND HER BACK SPEAKS OUT The American Parents Coalition, which advocates for the rights of parents and families across the country, filed a brief in support of January Littlejohn's lawsuit in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday.(Becket) She explained that the school \"took it upon themselves to intervene and socially transition my child\" when the girl and her friends became fixated on theirgender identity. Though some consider social transitioning virtually harmless, Littlejohn explained that it \"goes way beyond name and pronouns.\" \"They sit the child down, and, in our case, it was behind closed doors with three adults that consisted of the school counselor, the assistant principal and a social worker I had never met, and they did an official ‘gender support plan,’\" she explained. In this session, Littlejohn said, the school staff asked her daughter what bathroom and locker rooms she wanted to use, which sex she wanted to room with during overnight trips and whether she wanted her parents to be notified. PARENTS TELL SCOTUS: LGBTQ STORYBOOKS IN CLASSROOMS CLASH WITH OUR FAITH A new wrinkle has been added to the ongoing battle regarding gender transitions for minors. A group \"dedicated to the health of all children\" declared anyone under 18 doesn’t have the agency to decide they want a tattoo but approves of \"gender-affirming care.\"(iStock) \"They put the burden on her as to whether or not my parental rights would be honored by deciding she was the sole decision-maker as to whether or not my husband and I would be notified of the meeting,\" she explained. Littlejohn said that when she made inquiries about the session to the school, she was told \"they could not give me any information about that meeting\" and \"that my daughter was now protected by a nondiscrimination law.\" Despite this, a three-judge panel from the 11th Circuit Court ruled 2-1 against the Littlejohns, saying the incident did not violate the parents’ due process rights. COLORADO'S 'TOTALITARIAN' TRANSGENDERISM BILL SPARKS CONCERNS FROM PARENTS After this ruling, the Littlejohns appealed to have their case heard by the entire 11th Circuit Court. The American Parents Coalition joined in support of the Littlejohns’ lawsuit Wednesday.

Sanctuary cities are local jurisdictions that restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities, including refusing to comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests. As a result, the District of Columbia Federal Immigration Compliance Act would eliminate sanctuary city laws in the District of Columbia and bar Washington, D.C., from implementing any policy that allows it to circumvent complying with Homeland Security and ICE on detainer requests for illegal immigrants.

Other jurisdictions with sanctuary city policies include Chicago, New York City, Boston and Los Angeles, according to the Center for Immigration Studies. Meanwhile, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration in April from restricting federal funds for sanctuary cities, claiming it violates the Constitution’s separation of powers principles and the spending clause, in addition to the Fifth and 10th Amendments. Rep.

    "title": "Supreme Court weighs religious liberty dispute over public funding for Catholic charter school",
    "article_text": "Supreme Court, School choice, Democrats The Supreme Court offered clear divisions Wednesday in a religious liberty case involving public education and whether religious charter schools can receive taxpayer funding. At issue is whether providing public money to a faith-based educational institution violates the First Amendment's separation of church and state mandate. In more than two hours of wide-ranging oral arguments, thehigh courtappeared divided along ideological lines, with a majority prepared to allow St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in Oklahoma City to become the first such religious charter school in the country. LIBERAL SUPREME COURT JUSTICES GRILL RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION IN LANDMARK SCHOOL CHOICE CASE At issue is whether providing public money to a faith-based educational institution violates the First Amendment's separation of church and state.(iStock) The appeal comes amid a renewed pitch in some Republican-led states to bring a greater religious presence to public education. The conservative high court in recent years has, in select cases, allowed taxpayer funds to be spent on religious organizations to provide \"non-sectarian services\" like adoption or food banks. In the courtroom public session, the justices debated what limits on curriculum supervision and control would be placed on the religious charter school, if its contract with the state was allowed to move forward. \"Our [prior] cases have made very clear,\" said Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \"You can't treat religious people and religious institutions and religious speech as second class in the United States. And when you have a program that's open to all comers except religion, no, we can't do that. We can do everything else. That seems like rank discrimination against religion. And that's the concern.\" BIDEN-APPOINTED FEDERAL JUDGE KEEPS BLOCKING TURMP ADMIN FROM NIXING FUNDING FOR LAWYERS FOR MIGRANT CHILDREN Oklahoma has more than 30 public charter schools serving about 50,000 students.(iStock video/Getty Images) \"All the religious school is saying is don’t exclude us on account of our religion,\" Kavanaugh added. But others on the bench worried about government entanglement in approving some religious charter schools, and not others, potentially favoring one faith over another. \"What you're saying is the free exercise clause trumps the essence of the establishment clause,\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor told the attorney for the state’s charter school board. \"The essence of the establishment clause was, 'We're not going to pay religious leaders to teach their religion.'\" The Constitution's First Amendment says, \"Congressshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\" Justice Amy Coney Barrett was not on the bench and is recused in the case. She offered no public explanation of why. If the court divides 4-4, the ruling below holds, with the charter school losing its appeal. Justice Amy Coney Barrett was not on the bench and is recused in the case.(Getty Images) The vote of Chief Justice John Roberts may be key. He asked tough questions of both sides. At one point, Roberts noted of the current dispute: \"This does strike me as a much more comprehensive involvement,\" by the state than prior cases dealing with \"fairly discrete\" public money going to religious groups, such as tax breaks and private school tuition credits. In an unusual split within the Oklahoma government, the state's governor, head of public education, and the statewide charter school board are all backing St. Isidore. But Attorney General Gentner Drummond sued to block the approval of the school's state charter, calling it an \"unlawful sponsorship\" of a sectarian institution, and \"a serious threat to the religious liberty of all four-million Oklahomans.\" He has the backing of some GOP state lawmakers and parents' groups, who argue that funding parochial charter schools would drain resources from public education – especially in rural areas already struggling with limited funding. When it signed a contract with the state charter school board in 2023, St. Isidore – formed as a nonprofit corporation by the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa – agreed it would be free and open to all students \"as a traditional public school,\" and would comply with local, state and federal education laws. Teachers are voicing concerns over the current educational level of students in America.(Interim Archives/Getty Images/iStock) But in its application to the charter board, it also indicated, \"the School fully embraces the teachings\" of the Catholic Church and participates \"in the evangelizing mission of the church.\" Shortly after Oklahoma's highest court ruled against it, the school said it remained \"steadfast in our belief that St. Isidore would have and could still be a valuable asset to students, regardless of socioeconomic, race or faith backgrounds.\" The Trump administrationis supporting the school. Some Catholic sources note the namesake seventh-century archbishop and scholar is now known as the patron saint of the internet, given the title by Pope John Paul II in 1997. Much of the high court oral arguments turned on whether St. Isidore – a K-12 online school – is public or private in nature. The U.S. Supreme Court, Nov. 15, 2023, in Washington, D.C.(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File) The distinction is important, since charter schools in Oklahoma are considered public, free and openly accessible to all. That is true in the 46 states – plus the District of Columbia – where charter schools operate. TheSupreme Courthas previously said states may require public schools be secular, but also cannot prevent private religious institutions from public benefits and contracts. The issue now is whether those precedents apply to charter schools. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said charter schools are \"a creation and creature of the state.\" Justice Elena Kagan said contracts signed by schools like St. Isidore have basic requirements to meet state classroom standards, with state oversight. \"I've just got to think that there are religions that are going to have no problems dealing with all the various curricular requirements and religions that are going to have very severe problems dealing with all the curricular requirement,\" she said. \"I'm suggesting to you is this notion that the state can do this while still maintaining all its various curricular requirements. I mean, either that sort of fantasy land, given the state of religious belief and religious practice in this world or if it's not, it's only because what's going to result is treating, shall we call them majoritarian, religions very differently from minority religions,\" said Kagan. But Justice Clarence Thomas noted: \"The argument that St. Isidore and the board are making is that it's a private entity that is participating in a state [charter] program. It was not created by the state program.\" Justice Clarence Thomas(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post via Getty Images) Justice Samuel Alito was more pointed, telling Gregory Garre, lawyer for the state, \"This whole position that you're defending seems to be motivated by hostility toward particular religions.\" Department of Educationfigures show about 4m illion schoolchildren – or 8% of the total – are enrolled in an estimated 7,800 charter schools, which operate with greater independence and autonomy than traditional public schools. Oklahoma has more than 30 public charter schools serving about 50,000 students. Last June, Oklahoma's top education official separately mandated the Bible be incorporated into lesson plans for grades 5-12, and the Holy Scripture be placed in every classroom. And in Louisiana, there is a requirement that the Ten Commandments be posted on public school property. Both policies are facing legal challenges. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Six members of the current Supreme Court attended Catholic schools in their youth, and many of their own children attend or attended private schools, including religious-based institutions of learning. The consolidated cases are Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board v. Drummond (AG OK) (24-394) and St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School v. Drummond (AG OK) (24-396). A ruling is expected by early summer. Shannon Bream currently serves as anchor ofFOX News Sunday.She joined the network in 2007 as a Washington D.C- based correspondent covering the Supreme Court.",

It's what's happening on the national security side. \"And obviously, because I'm the vice president, I have a more global view of this, but it's really an amazing thing to see, because there's just a lot of good synergies that, you know, I don't know if the president had the first administration — I don't know if any president has had in prior administrations — where there was such great confidence in the team.\" President-elect Donald Trump greets Vice President-elect JD Vance as they attend a service at St. John's Church on Inauguration Day in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 20.(Carlos Barria/Reuters) \"You read stories about, you know, Kamala Harris' portfolio, or you read stories about other vice presidents, about even Dick Cheney's portfolio, where there was this dynamic of, there were turf battles, and one person was trying to say, ‘This is what I work on, and this is what you work on, and don't step on my territory,’\" Vance explained. \"There's just none of that.\" He added: \"Because our territory is what the president has told us that we have to get done, and we don't mind sharing that territory if it's in service of a common vision, which it is.\" PROMISES MADE, PROMISES KEPT: HOW TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS STACK UP AGAINST INAUGURATION DAY PLEDGES Meanwhile, when asked for highlights of the first 100 days of the Trump administration, Vance pointed to his first foreign trip in February to France to discuss artificial intelligence.

The Senate Finance Committee hearing to considerRodney Scott’snomination to be commissioner ofCustoms and Border Protectionbegan with fireworks from the panel’s top Democrat. Scott was lambasted by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon over a controversy involving a person who died in CBP custody in 2010. The criticisms prompted a Tuesday letter from Homeland SecuritySecretary Kristi Noem. \"The Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection is like the point guard for everything the U.S. government does at our borders,\" Wyden said at the start of the hearing on Wednesday. \"A person who holds this job should have deep experience with both customs and with protecting our borders, along with unimpeachable judgment.

Wyden claimed Scott’s office \"taped over the only video copy\" of the man’s death and tampered with evidence, citing court documents.

FIRST ON FOX:A 2020 protective order case filed against deported \"Maryland man\" Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the suspected MS-13 gang member being held in El Salvador, sheds even more light on his violent past, a Fox News Digital review of the document found. Abrego Garcia, 29, is a Salvadoranillegal immigrantand suspected MS-13 gang member who was living in Maryland until he was deported to the high-security Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT) in his home country during the first 100 days of the Trump administration. Though many Democrats, including Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, claim that Abrego Garcia is an innocent man who was \"wrongly deported,\" the administration has pointed to considerable evidence that he is a member of the infamous MS-13 gang. In April, theSupreme Courtupheld a lower court's decision ordering the Trump administration to arrange Abrego Garcia’s return.

That's not up to us.\" This has caused significant outrage among Democrats, several of whom, despite mounting evidence against Abrego Garcia, have flown to El Salvador to advocate for his release. The latest document, which was obtained and reviewed by Fox News Digital, adds to the mounting evidence against Abrego Garcia and alleges that his wife accused him of verbal and physical abuse against her and mental abuse against her children. The petition for protection form filed in Maryland by Jennifer Vasquez Sura has boxes checked for \"acts of abuse,\" including kicking, slapping, shoving, mental injury of a child and detaining against will. On Aug. 11, 2020, Vasquez Sura asked for the petition to be rescinded, saying her family wanted to take part in their son's birthday, and Abrego Garcia \"also agreed to continue counseling and if not [he's] willing to sign divorce papers.\" The original petition form lists their son andAbrego Garcia’sstepchildren needing protection.

He then got angry. I went upstairs to make food for my kids but he turned off the stove.\" In addition, the form said Abrego Garcia had threatened her and wrote that she has a recording in which he \"told [her] ex-mother-in-law that even if he kills me no one can do anything to him.\" The document also alleges that his wife accused him of verbal and physical abuse against her and mental abuse against her children.

Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., left, at a hotel in San Salvador, El Salvador, April 21.(AP/Salvador Melendez) The form goes on to describe an incident in November 2019 when he grabbed her \"by the hair in the car.\" In December 2019, he allegedly grabbed her hair in the car and \"dragged\" her \"out of car leaving [her] in the street.\" She wrote that he also \"broke\" her son’s tablet, \"broke doors\" in the house, pushed her against a wall, broke a phone and a television and damaged the walls that spring. This comes after Fox News Digital reported on written domestic violence allegations filed in court against Abrego Garcia by Vasquez Sura in 2021, but the case was dismissed because she did not make it to a court appearance,CBS Newsreported. In the filing, written in Vasquez’s handwriting, she alleges Abrego Garcia repeatedly beat her, writing, \"At this point, I am afraid to be close to him. I have multiple photos/videos of how violent he can be and all the bruises he [has] left me.\" Vasquez alleged that Abrego Garcia punched and scratched her eye, leaving her bleeding. He also allegedly threw her laptop on the floor. She wrote that, on another day, Abrego Garcia got angry again, started yelling and ripped her shirt and shorts off before grabbing her arm and leaving marks. In addition to this, according to police and court records shared with Fox News Digital, Abrego Garcia was arrested in Hyattsville, Maryland, in October 2019, at which point he was identified by the Prince George's County Police Gang Unit as anMS-13 gang member. FEDERAL JUDGE ALLEGES 'WILLFUL AND BAD FAITH REFUSAL' TO COMPLY IN ABREGO GARCIA DEPORTATION CASE Justice Department attorneys said they were unaware of Maryland immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia's whereabouts after he was deported to a Salvadoran prison last month.(Fox News) A federal immigration court in Baltimore further determined Abrego Garcia was not eligible for release because he \"failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that his release from custody would not pose a danger to others, as the evidence shows that he is a verified member of MS-13.\" The court held that \"the fact that a ‘past, proven, and reliable source of information' verified the Respondent's gang membership, rank, and gang name is sufficient to support that the Respondent is a gang member\" and that Abrego Garcia had \"failed to present evidence to rebut that assertion.\" Several DHS sources have confirmed to Fox News Digital records indicating that Abrego Garcia was previously pulled over by a Tennessee highway patrol trooper while driving an SUV belonging to Jose Ramon Hernandez Reyes, another illegal alien who in 2020 confessed to human smuggling across the U.S.-Mexico border. The trooper noticed eight individuals in the car with Abrego Garcia, who said he began driving three days prior from Houston, Texas, to Temple Hills, Maryland, via St. Louis, Missouri, to \"perform construction work.\" The report on the stop states that the trooper suspected it was a human trafficking incident because there was no luggage in the vehicle. Additionally, the individuals in the car reportedly gave the same address as Abrego Garcia's home address. DEMOCRAT FAULTS HIS OWN PARTY FOR PICKING WRONG BATTLE WITH CASE OF DEPORTED MS-13 SUSPECT Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., holds a news conference Friday at Dulles International Airport in Virginia after his visit to El Salvador to meet with deported Maryland illegal immigrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia.(Pool) When speaking with the trooper, Abrego Garcia allegedly \"pretended to speak less English than he was capable of and attempted to put encountering officer off-track by responding to questions with questions.\" After the incident,the officerdecided not to issue Abrego Garcia a citation for the driving infractions. Instead, he gave him a warning for driving with an expired license. The new document further reveals that Abrego Garcia was driving a black 2001 Chevrolet Suburban that he said belonged to his \"boss.\" The Suburban was identified by DHS as belonging to Hernandez Reyes, who pleaded guilty to human smuggling after being caught in Mississippi in a car with passengers from Mexico, El Salvador and Honduras. According to another document also confirmed by DHS sources, theHomeland SecurityInvestigations Baltimore field office further flagged the vehicle being driven by Abrego Garcia as belonging to a target they suspected of human trafficking or smuggling. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The office said the \"vehicle is used by HSI Baltimore target in human smuggling/trafficking operation.

Trump joked during a meeting of hisCabinet secretarieson Wednesday that perhaps Ratcliffe was the only one \"who's not allowed to talk about the great job he's done,\" given the classified nature of the Central Intelligence Agency's work. \"At your direction, the CIA has deployed our unique covert action, authorities in various places and continents, to successfully advance your national security and foreign policy priorities, to advance peace, to end wars, to take terrorists off the battlefield, and to keep illicit drugs from coming into this country and harming Americans,\" Ratcliffe reported to Trump, in front of news cameras. \"Unfortunately, as much as I would love to detail your accomplishments in that regard, we can't do so with this crowd.

We've revoked, at your direction, 67 security clearances, and we continue the work of declassifying documents.\" The U.S. government has already declassified documents surrounding the assassination of President John F.

Rep. Greg Casar, D-Texas, one of several Democrats hosting town halls inRepublican-held congressional districts, traveled to Colorado for a Democrat-run town hall in Evans' home district last week. The town hall was derailed by questions about the Democratic Party, undercutting theDemocratic National Committee's(DNC) plan to provide a \"platform to fight back against Republicans’ dangerous agenda.\" Town hall attendees asked question after question about the party's future and expressed concerns that Democrats aren't doing enough to resist Trump's second term, according to a report byThe New York Times.

Makary also mentioned a \"public trust problem\" surrounding COVID boosters, noting that many healthcare workers opted out of receiving them last season. FLU VACCINE LINKED TO HIGHER INFECTIONS, SAYS EARLY RESEARCH The FDA chief has also expressed concerns about the lack of data supporting Novavax’s COVID vaccine, calling for more studies into its effectiveness before approving it. \"The big Novavax 2020-2021 study excluded people withnatural immunity to COVID. Today, there is broad population immunity, and the big question is, does it provide a benefit?\" he said in an interview with Inside Medicine on Tuesday.

    "title": "Sitting still for this amount of time is related to high risk of neck pain, study says",
    "article_text": "David Scott, an Army veteran from New Hampshire, details his lifelong fitness journey and how he benefits from his weekly gym workouts. We've all heard the adage \"sitting is the new smoking\" — but new research shows that being still for too long can have effects that go beyond the lungs and heart. Just six hours of sedentary behavior is associated with an increased risk ofneck pain, according to a new study published in BMC Public Health. Researchers in Beijing, China, examined 25 cohort and case-control studies on neck pain and sedentary behavior among more than 43,000 participants. ‘I’M A SPINAL SURGEON – HERE'S HOW YOUR POSTURE IS KILLING YOUR BACK' The analysis revealed a \"significant relationship\" between the two factors. Women are at a higher risk of neck pain from sedentary behavior than men, researchers found.(iStock) The risk was found to be greateramong femalesthan males — and more among employees, such as office workers, than among students. Screen-based sedentary behaviors, like mobile phone and computer use, led to the greatest risk of neck pain. Watching TV did not pose a significant risk, according to the study. \"As sedentary time increases, so does the risk of developing neck pain.\" Just over one hour of screen-based sedentary behaviorincreased neck pain risk. More than four hours of sedentary behavior per day saw a greater risk, with the highest occurrence noted at six hours. Mobile phone use while sedentary contributes the most to neck pain, according to the study.(iStock) The researchers concluded that sedentary behavior is a \"notable risk factor\" for neck pain, while risk escalates with longer duration. \"Targeted preventative measures, particularly for high-risk groups like females and employees, are necessary,\" the study stated. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER \"Public health initiatives should encourage the reduction of sedentary behaviors and the promotion ofphysical activityto enhance neck health and alleviate the global prevalence of neck pain.\" The researchers recommended that high-risk groups take preventative measures toward managing neck pain.(iStock) Dr. Arthur Jenkins, a spinal surgeon in New York, commented on the findings. \"It doesn't surprise me to say that six hours of sedentary activity has a strong correlation with neck pain, since most of the activities that people do when they're sedentary involve sitting,\" the expert, who did not work on the study, told Fox News Digital. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"During sitting activities, people are either watching TV,looking at their phonesor working at a desk, and most of these involve the head being in a looking-down position,\" he said. This position puts excess strain on the back of the neck as well as on the front of the disc space, he added. In an interview with Fox News Digital,multi-specialist physicianDr. Azza Halim, who was also not involved in the study, agreed that prolonged sitting can be a risk factor for musculoskeletal issues. A doctor emphasized the importance of practicing regular movement, stretching and ergonomic adjustments in daily routines to \"mitigate the negative health effects of prolonged sitting.\"(iStock) \"We do know that being seated for extended periods, especially with poor posture or inadequate ergonomic support, definitely places sustained strain on the cervical spine and associated muscles, which eventually will lead to stiffness, muscle imbalances and chronic discomfort,\" she said. \"Research shows a clear dose-response relationship — as sedentary time increases, so does the risk of developing neck pain,\" Halim noted. For more Health articles, visitwww.foxnews.com/health \"As shown, sitting for more than six hours per day has been linked to an 88% greater risk compared to those with minimal sedentary behavior.\" Halim emphasized the importance of practicing regular movement, stretching and ergonomic adjustments in daily routines to \"mitigate the negativehealth effectsof prolonged sitting.\" Angelica Stabile is a lifestyle reporter for Fox News Digital.",

AsAlzheimer’s diseasenow affects seven million Americans — the largest number ever — there is a growing demand for new treatments. Scientists at the University of California, Irvine, have discovered a \"groundbreaking\" new therapy to fight the disease. The treatment involves using stem cells to \"program\" human immune cells, called microglia, to counteract signs ofdementia in the brain, according to a press release from UCI. ALZHEIMER'S RATES HAVE REACHED STAGGERING NUMBER AS EXPERTS CALL FOR CHANGE Microglia are immune cells found in the central nervous system that act as the brain’s \"primary line of defense against infection and injury,\" according to the reseachers.

Pro wrestlinggreats Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff teamed up with legendary coach Izzy Martinez to launch Real American Freestyle in hopes of bringing the sport to a mainstream audience as its popularity continues to grow in the United States. Hogan and Bischoff are longtime friends who helped set the sports entertainment world on fire when they created the New World Order inWorld Championship Wrestlingand overtook the then-World Wrestling Federation in the ratings war for more than 80 weeks. The two are bringing their storytelling approach to the center of the mat for this one-of-a-kind opportunity. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Hulk Hogan attends the NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment Upfront at The Jacob Javits Center on May 14, 2015, in New York.(Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File) \"The Hulkster\" explained to Fox News Digital that as he and his business partner Chad Bronstein began to explore the idea of creating a bigger venue for freestyle wrestling, they realized there was \"more meat on the bone\" and the broadcast landscape was hungry for more live sports. \"As we started digging around, we found the athletes (were) very interested. We found a partner that really had influence in that arena of NCAA champions, a gold medalist who has trained almost everybody in the world that is somebody and we decided to start moving forward with that idea,\" Hogan said. \"And once Chad and I started to get into really deep water, I said, ‘Boy, we need to call Eric Bischoff' because production and television stuff and him knowing the amateur wrestling world himself, he just became the perfect partner to jump in there with us.\" Bischoff, though known for his work in sports entertainment, wrestled in high school in freestyle and Greco-Roman disciplines. He earned his black belt in martial arts as well. He said when he first sat down with Hogan and Bronstein about the idea for a mainstream freestyle wrestling league, the \"light bulbs\" began to go off in his head. \"We’ve had a lot of success together. We’ve learned a lot together. We’ve had a lot of successes. We’ve had some challenges.

    "title": "Maine lawmaker Laurel Libby reflects on trans athlete post that thrust her into potential Supreme Court battle",
    "article_text": "Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby spoke to Fox News Digital about her appeal to the Supreme Court, and the social media post that identified a trans athlete. A Feb. 17 Facebook post has become a catalyst for political history in Maine. And it could soon be the topic ofSupreme Courttestimony. That day, state Rep.Laurel Libbyused the social media site to identify an athlete who had just rocked a high school track meet. The athlete took first place in girls' pole vault Maine State Class B Championship, propelling Greely High School to a girls' state title. It was already big local news, as the Portland Press Herald published a recap the same day Libby made the post, which also identified the athlete by name. But Libby's post pointed out that the athlete finished fifth in a boys' competition, just two years earlier. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"I had been talking with a mom, friend of mine, who has had a child in track in Maine for a long, long time,\" Libby told Fox News Digital. \"She told me there was a biological male who was probably going to win the girls' state-wide pole vault championship, and sure enough, he did… I looked at the image of the second-place girls, and that's who should have been in first place.\" The post went viral and thrust Maine, Greely High School and the athlete into the bull's-eye of the national trans athlete debate. Libby said no one from the school or the athlete's family ever reached out to her about the post. \"I never heard from them or the school,\" Libby said. Fox News Digital has reached out to Greely High School for comment. The first person Libby says she heard from that took issue with her post was Maine House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, who she is now suing for censuring her over the post. \"He found it objectionable and asked me to take it down, at the same time I asked him if he would support Maine girls, and support policy that stopped discrimination against Maine young women in sports and he declined to answer,\" Libby said. MAINE GIRL INVOLVED IN TRANS ATHLETE BATTLE REVEALS HOW STATE'S POLICIES HURT HER CHILDHOOD AND SPORTS CAREER \"The main criticism all along from the Democrats is that it was a picture of a minor.\" Fecteau's office has provided documents to Fox News Digital confirming the conversation took place. \"I am asking you to take the post down,\" Fecteau wrote in a letter to Libby on Feb. 18. \"In addition to risking the young person's safety, your post violates one of the long held political traditions of ‘leaving kids out of it’ — a tradition that has even been observed by political pundits with regard to the treatment of kids who are in the White House, the most scrutinized office in the nation.\" Libby said families of other students at Greely High School have reached out to her as the issue has progressed. \"[They] have encouraged me because they don't agree with biological males participating in girls' sports, and given their relationship with the school, they can't say that publicly,\" Libby said. \"We've seen this become a big talking point in the Greely, Cumberland area.\" Asurvey bythe American Parents Coalition found that about 63% of Maine voters said school sports participation should be based on biological sex, and 66% agreed it’s \"only fair to restrict women’s sports to biological women.\" Greely's District, MSAD #51, has previously provided a statement in support of its eligibility policies. \"The MSAD #51 Board of Directors is guided by the Mission, Vision, and Core Values of our district. This includes promoting a safe, caring and ethical learning environment where each person will be treated with respect and fairness; and individuals are recognized, valued and supported,\" the district said in a statement. Libby's post came during a holiday week off. When students returned the following week, they were greeted by police protection in response to the national scrutiny Libby's posts drew to the school. \"I think law enforcement exorcised an abundance of caution, and thankfully there was no risk to the students,\" Libby said. MAINE 'MAGA' PARENT SILENCED AT SCHOOL BOARD MEETING DURING SPEECH OPPOSING TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS Now, two and a half months later, the state is in a conflict with the federal government over the issue of trans athletes in girls' sports, while Libby is making a case for Supreme Court intervention in her lawsuit against Fecteau. Fecteau and Maine's Democrat majority censured Libby for the post on Feb. 25, and originally offered to restore her voting and speaking rights if she apologized for the post. But Libby told them right away she wouldn't apologize. \"The real reason I was censured is in political retaliation for pointing out a policy that most Mainers do not agree with,\" Libby said. Instead, she filed her lawsuit against Fecteau on March 11. But Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Melissa DuBose ruledagainst Libbyin her case on April 22. DuBose, appointed by former President Joe Biden in January, ended up presiding over the case after every district judge in Maine refused to take it. Judges John C. Nivison, John A. Woodcock, Lance E. Walker, Karen F. Wolf, Stacey D. Neumann and Nancy Torresen signed recusal orders shortly after the case was initially filed. No reason was given. DuBose ended up with the case, and ruled in favor of Fecteau. Then, the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals also ruled against Libby. This past Monday, Libby announced she would appeal to the Supreme Court for emergency intervention. \"We haven't fully had our day in court yet, I look forward to continuing that process,\" Libby said when asked if she believes she's had a fair trial. Libby says she expects to hear if the Supreme Court will hear the case by Monday, May 5. MAINE DEMOCRATS TRYING TO AMEND STATE CONSTITUTION TO CODIFY ALLOWING TRANS ATHLETES IN GIRLS' SPORTS So far, the state representative has visibly had the federal government on her side, especially President Donald Trump's administration. The U.S. Justice Department announced a lawsuit against the state of Maine for its continued defiance ofTrump’sexecutive order to keep biological males out of girls’ and women’s sports and violations of Title IX. Libby attended the press conference alongside Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon. The Department of Agriculture cut federal funding to the state, which then sued the administration. A federal judge has already ruled the funding must be unfrozen. Internally, many Mainers have already taken steps to align themselves with Libby and Trump's side on the issue. There have been two large-scale protests in the state's capital of Augusta, and one school district in the state, MSAD #70, is alreadymoving to instituteits own policy to ban trans athletes from girls' sports. Now, Libby's SCOTUS appeal will come as the tension between the state and Trump intensifies. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt referenced \"prosecutions\" as a consequence for violating federal law while discussing the administration's intentions on the issue. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"When Maine decided not to follow [Trump's executive order], the Department of Justice sued them. So anyone who disobeys federal law will be prosecuted, sued, or say ‘goodbye’ to your federal funding,\" Leavitt told reporters at a press conference Monday. Libby did not rule out prosecution as a warranted response if her state continues to defy Trump on the issue. \"We've seen so much occur in the last two months, that we certainly can't rule anything out,\" Libby said when asked about potential prosecution to officials in her state. \"I hope that it wouldn't come to that. I would hope we can all agree that our young women shouldn't be discriminated against.\" Follow Fox News Digital’ssports coverage on X, and subscribe tothe Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter.

Belichick attempted to quash it all in his statement. \"I agreed to speak with ‘CBS Sunday Morning’ to promote my new book, ‘The Art of Winning — Lessons from My Life in Football.’ Prior to this interview, I clearly communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book,\" he said. Belichick said he was \"surprised\" about getting the questions about his relationship and when Hudson stepped in, she was doing her job. He went on to accuse CBS of creating a \"false narrative\" with so-called \"selectively edited clips.\" Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson enter the field before the football game between the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Navy Midshipmen at MetLife Stadium on Oct. 26, 2024.(Vincent Carchietta-Imagn Images) JORDON HUDSON RELEASES FIERY BILL BELICHICK EMAIL ON MEDIA'S BOOK COVERAGE AFTER SCRUTINIZED TV INTERVIEW \"Unfortunately, that expectation was not honored during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced, and I repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Dokoupil, and the producers that I preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book,\" he said. \"After this occurred several times, Jordon, with whom I share both a personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point to help focus the discussion. She was not deflecting any specific question or topic but simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. Some of the clips make it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, but we have been open about the fact that Jordon and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021. \"The final eight-minute segment does not reflect the productive 35-minute conversation we had, which covered a wide range of topics related to my career. Instead, it presents selectively edited clips and stills from just a few minutes of the interview to suggest a false narrative — that Jordon was attempting to control the conversation — which is simply not true.\" CBS responded to Belichick's statement later Wednesday. \"When we agreed to speak with Mr. Belichick, it was for a wide-ranging interview,\" the company said. \"There were no preconditions or limitations to this conversation. This was confirmed repeatedly with his publisher before the interview took place and after it was completed.\" Belichick, 73, and Hudson, 24, have been linked since last year.

Ebenhack, File) Sanders' post echoes a consistently Christian theme that the family has exuded throughout the situation. Shedeur himself thanked God in social media posts several times, from Thursday to Saturday, including two X posts that went live just minutes apart – before and after he was chosen by the Browns. Deion Sanders Jr. made five X posts citing Bible verses dating back to Thursday, and was frequently re-sharing them as his brother fell in the draft. Meanwhile, the father has turned to religion in previous difficult chapters in his life. Deion has said hedevoted himself to Christianityshortly after his first divorce from ex-wife Carolyn Chambers in 1998. Sanders opened up about the experience during an interview on \"Running Wild\" with Bear Grylls in November 2023. SHEDEUR SANDERS DRAFT SLIDE TIMELINE: NFL EXECUTIVES CAUSE MEDIA MELTDOWN BY REJECTING POLARIZING PROSPECT \"That's when I went through my first divorce in which the only things that I knew that truly loved me were my two kids. Now they're gone, now they've been taken away. It was devastating, and I went through suicidal thoughts, a suicidal period,\" Sanders said. \"I ran this car off the side of the highway, and, at the bottom, I thought this car would just flip, and it didn't flip. And I was still there. Shortly after that, I just had to come to the Lord with my hands up and say, 'I'm done. I can't do it anymore. You got me. I give up. God, you take me.'\" During an introductory press conference last year commemorating his position as new head at UC, Sanders praised God. \"Out of all the persons in the world, God chose me,\" Sanders said. \"For that, I thank Him; for that, I love Him; for that, I magnify Him; for that, I glorify Him; for that, I praise Him; for that, I owe Him. Each and every day, I'm trying to please Him,\" Sanders has maintained his family's devotion to faith even amid pushback from external sources. He came under fire by an anti-religion group, the Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF), over his use of a team chaplain for Colorado this past season. Sanders had Pastor Dewey Smith pray over the football team after its win against Baylor University on Sept. 22. SHEDEUR SANDERS OPENS UP ON HISTORICA NFL DRAFT SLIDE, PRANK CALL AND BECOMING A BROWN Colorado head coach Deion Sanders before the North Dakota State game, Aug. 29, 2024, in Boulder.(AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) The FFRF released a scathingfour-page lettercondemning Sanders, claiming that having Smith do the prayer counted as \"unconstitutional religious activities,\" as he leads a football team at a public university. When Sanders became the head coach at Colorado in 2023, the FFRF raised concerns about his previous open display of faith with his team. This resulted in the university giving him additional training on the boundaries of religious expression in public institutions. The university revealed in a statement that Sanders had received training on nondiscrimination policies and establishment clause requirements after his hiring. But that hasn't changed him.

    "article_text": "Kurt \"Cyberguy\" Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" and discusses the creation of a robot in China that can reportedly build cars and do everyday tasks. The FBIwarns that scammers are impersonating doctors, police and banks using spoofed numbers, while \"smishing\" texts impersonating toll agencies and delivery services surge nationwide. In one elaborate scheme, fraudsters posing as hospital staff claim victims' identities are linked to Chinese crime rings, then transfer calls to fake police demanding wire transfers, complete with fake IDs and encrypted app requests. These consoften target previous fraud victims through social media groups, where fake profiles like \"Jaime Quin\" promise fund recovery to steal more data. With AI and deepfakes making scams harder to spot, here's how to fight back.

FBI building in Washington, D.C.(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) The FBI says thatthese scamsoften target people who have already been victims of fraud, which makes them especially cruel. Scammers reach out through phone calls, emails or even social media, pretending they can help you recover money you’ve lost. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? One common trick involves someone posing as an official from the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, using fake names like \"Jaime Quin,\" who asks for sensitive information such as your Social Security number or bank details. In other cases, scammers create fake female profiles to join online support groups for fraud victims, gaining trust before directing people to contact their \"recovery experts.\" While the details may change, the goal is always the same: tosteal your personal informationor money all over again. A woman working on her laptop(Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson) THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE DOING WRONG WHEN SCAMMERS CALL Protecting yourself from scams starts with these critical defenses; each is designed to shut down fraudsters before they gain a foothold on your personal information or money. 1. Stay calm:If you think a scammer is calling you, it's important to stay calm and not let yourself get emotional. It's very easy to get worked up when you're in the middle of this situation. If it happens, you can always say you will get back to them and hang up the phone. If they become aggressive and try to exploit you, tell them you will report them and hang up. 2. Avoid unknown contact numbers:Never call phone numbers that appear in pop-ups, unsolicited texts or emails. These numbers often belong to scammers trying to trick you into sharing personal information or making payments. Instead, always verify contact details through official websites or trusted sources before reaching out. 3. Download warning:Do not download software at the request of unknown individuals who contact you. Installing unknown programs can introduce malware or give scammers a way to steal your personal information. 4. Security precaution:Do not allow unknown individuals access to your computer. Granting remote access can give scammers control over your files and personal information, putting your security at serious risk. 5. Don't click that link and have strong antivirus software:Do not click on unsolicited pop-ups on your computer, links sent via text messages or email links and attachments. As scammers weaponize AI and deepfake technologies, strong antivirus software becomes your first line of defense. The best way to protect yourself from clicking on malicious links that install malware that may access your private information is to have strong antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you to any phishing emails or ransomware scams.Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. 6. Remove your personal information from the web:Your personal information is out on the web. If you want to make your personal information inaccessible, you might want to look into removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.Check out my top picks for data removal services here. 7. Never send money or valuables to strangers:Avoid wiring cash, sending gift cards, cryptocurrency or any other assets to people you’ve only met online or over the phone. Scammers often pressure victims for these untraceable payments, so always be cautious and verify who you’re dealing with before sending anything. 8. Consider identity theft protection services:These services monitor your personal information across credit reports, the dark web and public records, alerting you quickly if your data is exposed or misused. These services offer valuable early warnings and access to experts who can help recover your identity if fraud occurs. Choose a reputable provider that offers comprehensive monitoring, timely alerts and support for resolving identity theft issues.See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.

    "title": "Amazon takes on Elon Musk, launching 27 internet satellites",
    "article_text": "Amazon has begun its journey to deliver fast, affordable internet to underserved communities and remote regions worldwide. Imagine being able to access the internet from anywhere in the world, whether you're in a city or a remote area. For many of us, reliable internet is a given, but for millions, it remains a luxury. That's whyAmazon's Project Kuiperis making headlines with its ambitious plan to bridge the digital divide. On April 28, 2025, the project took a monumental step forward by successfully launching its first full batch of satellites into orbit. This mission, named \"KA-01\" (Kuiper Atlas 1), marked the beginning of Amazon’s journey to deliver fast, affordable internet to underserved communities and remote regions worldwide. Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\":Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to myfree \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\"when you sign up! Advanced satellite(Amazon) The KA-01 mission deployed 27 advanced satellites into low Earth orbit at an altitude of 280 miles (450 kilometers). This launch transitionedProject Kuiperfrom prototype testing to full-scale deployment. Each satellite was equipped with state-of-the-art technology, including phased array antennas for high-speed data transmission, advanced processors, electric propulsion systems for orbit adjustments and optical inter-satellite links to enable seamless communication between satellites. In addition to their technical sophistication, the satellites featured a unique dielectric mirror coating designed to scatter sunlight and reduce their visibilityfrom Earth, a thoughtful innovation aimed at addressing concerns by astronomers about light pollution. Advanced satellite launch(Amazon) HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT To carry out this historic mission, United Launch Alliance (ULA) launched its Atlas V rocket in its most powerful configuration. The KA-01 payload was the heaviest ever flown on anAtlas V rocket. The launch vehicle included five solid rocket boosters alongside its main booster and a massive payload fairing measuring 77 feet in height and 16.4 feet in width. The successful deployment of these satellites was just the first of many planned launches. Over the coming years, ULA will conduct additional missions using both Atlas V and Vulcan Centaur rockets. Amazon has also partnered with other launch providers, including SpaceX, Blue Origin and Arianespace, to deploy more than 3,200 satellites as part of its first-generation constellation. Advanced satellite(Amazon) HOW TO GET A CHEAP AMAZON PRIME MEMBERSHIP Following the recent launch, ULA managed the initial deployment sequence from its Advanced Spaceflight Operations Center at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Once the satellites separated from the rocket, control was transferred to Project Kuiper’s mission operations center in Redmond, Washington. Each satellite underwent a series of automated steps to activate onboard systems and began using electric propulsion to ascend to its final orbital altitude of 392 miles. Traveling at speeds exceeding 17,000 miles per hour, these satellites now circle Earth approximately every 90 minutes. The ultimate goal of KA-01 was not just deployment but to establish end-to-end network connectivity. This involves transmitting data through ground stations to satellites and back to customer antennas, a process that will enable high-speed internet service across even the most remote locations on Earth. WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)? Advanced satellite launch(Amazon) 9 BEST FEATURES OF AMAZON PRIME YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT The successful KA-01 mission was just the beginning for Project Kuiper. With more than 80 launches secured across multiple providers, Amazon is ramping up satellite production and deployment rates in preparation for delivering service later this year. The next mission, KA-02, is already in progress and will also use a ULA Atlas V rocket launched from Cape Canaveral. By deploying advanced satellite technology at scale, Project Kuiper aims to provide reliable internet access to millions of people who currently lack connectivity, empowering individuals and transforming communities worldwide.

While both systems share similarities, such as using low Earth orbit satellites for reduced latency, they differ in key aspects like satellite design, pricing and service goals. Starlink:With over 7,000 satellites already in orbit and plans for a constellation of up to 42,000, Starlink currently leads in deployment. Its satellites orbit at approximately 248 miles, allowing for lower latency but requiring more satellites for global coverage. Project Kuiper:Kuiper plans to deploy over 3,200 satellites orbiting at 311 miles. This higher altitude provides broader coverage per satellite but results in a 40% reduction in signal strength compared to Starlink due to increased distance. To compensate, Kuiper’s satellites use larger antennas to maintain performance. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE Starlink:Offers speeds ranging from 50 Mbps to 250 Mbps for standard plans and up to 1 Gbps for premium users. Latency is typically 20 to 40 milliseconds. Kuiper:Plans to offer three tiers of service: Starlink:It currently charges $599 for its standard receiver and $2,500 for its high-performance model. Monthly service costs range from$80 to $120. Kuiper:Amazon’s standard receiver is expected to cost less than $400 to produce, significantly undercutting Starlink’s hardware prices. While service pricing has not been announced, Amazon’s cost-efficient production suggests it could offer more affordable options. Starlink:Already operational with millions of subscribers worldwide and a head start in deployment. See if it is available in your area byclicking here. Kuiper:Amazon began satellite launches in early 2025 with its first batch of satellites on April 9, 2025. It plans to start customer service later this year. Under FCC requirements, it must deploy half its constellation by mid 2026. IPHONE'S SATELLITE MESSAGING: A CRUCIAL LIFELINE DURING A STORM It’s still early days for Project Kuiper, but Amazon’s first full-scale satellite launch shows just how serious the company is about closing the connectivity gap. While Starlink may have a head start, Kuiper is bringing fresh competition and innovation to the table. If all goes according to plan, millions more people around the world could soon have access to fast, affordable internet, no matter where they live.

    "title": "SEN CHRIS MURPHY: In Trump's first 100 days, he has normalized corruption. It must stop",
    "article_text": "People in Tennessee, Texas, Michigan and Washington D.C. judge President Donald Trump's first 100 days in office. A Tesla showroom on the White House Lawn. $5 million for 1-on-1 meetings with the president. Illegally firing Inspectors General. Special tariff exemptions for friendly corporations. The first 100 days of the Trump administration have been filled with non-stop acts of brazen corruption, bribery, and favors for PresidentDonald Trump’sbillionaire friends. When you think of corrupt politicians, you might imagine smoke-filled rooms where secret deals are brokered and bribes are exchanged. But what makes Trump’s corruption unique is that he isn’t trying to hide what he’s doing. He brags about it. After he posted on Truth Social, \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!!,\" and then paused his across-the-board tariffs, he brought Charles Schwab — yes, the same Charles Schwab (net worth $12.9 billion) of the bank Charles Schwab — into theOval Officeon April 9th and announced Schwab had made $2.5 billion that day thanks to some suspiciously well-timed stock purchases. Why is Trump doing all of this out in the open? It’s not because he believes in transparency. No, it’s because Trump thinks that if he publicly engages in enough corruption and grift, it will start to feel normal to people. Asthe mediafails to keep up with the sheer pace and volume of corruption, most of it flies under the radar. He will try to convince us this is normal. But it’s not. ANDREW BATES: Trump killed our economy in just 100 days. Democrats must act now Let’s take one example, which may be the most corrupt of them all: the Trump meme coin. For most people, the crypto industry is an enigma. That’s what makes it a perfect vehicle for corruption. Right before the inauguration, Trump launched a meme coin called $TRUMP. It has no actual value -- its value is simply related to how much demand exists, and as president of the most powerful country in the world, Trump is in a position to use his enormous official power to generate demand for the coin, and in turn, profits for himself and his family. TRUMP'S MEME COIN SOARS AS PRESIDENT OFFERS DINNER TO TOP HOLDERS Last week, the crypto coin scandal went nuclear. Trump posted on the coin’s website: \"HAVE DINNER WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. The most EXCLUSIVE INVITATION in the World. Only for the TOP 220 $TRUMP Meme Coin Holders.\" The price of the coin jumped more than 50%. Its market value soared to $2.7 billion. To juice the price even more, they announced the top 25 coin holders would also be invited to \"an Exclusive Reception\" before dinner with Trump complete with a \"Special VIP Tour\" of the White House. In just two days following the announcement of the dinner, Trump and his allies made nearly $900,000 in trading fees alone. It’s so brazen as to be hard to believe -- the president selling access to the White House as a mechanism to enrich himself personally. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The get-rich-quick scheme isn’t even the worst part. The biggest scam is that we will never know who exactly is buying the Trump coin and putting cash directly into his pocket. It is as if Trump has posted his Venmo or CashApp online for every corporate interest and foreign government to funnel money directly to his bank account. Tech billionaires, Russian oligarchs,Saudi princes, CEOs of oil companies, or executives looking for exemptions fromthe tariffs— they can all purchase Trump’s meme coin and curry favor with the president by making him even richer. There is even a leaderboard tracking who buys the most coin but the usernames are completely anonymous. Trump’s meme coin is just one of the dozens of examples proving that Trump has no interest in keeping the promises he made to the American people about lowering costs. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP It’s no wonder he’s done nothing to tackle prices -- he is spending every day trying to figure out how to use the power of the presidency to make himself and his friends richer. In fact, Trump has done more to enrich himself and his ultra-wealthy friends in the first 100 days of this presidency than he did in his entire last term. America doesn’t need to accept this level of corruption. It’s up to us whether we allow him to make all of this feel normal. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

    "article_text": "Yarden Gonen, whose sister Romi Gonen was freed from Hamas captivity, joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss her reaction to President Donald Trump's warning to Hamas and the need for urgency in securing the release of the rest of the hostages. There are moments when I still wake up in terror, my heart pounding, convinced I'm back in those dark tunnels beneath Gaza. Then reality slowly breaks through—I am free. After 471 days held hostage by Hamas, I have returned to the world of light, of family, of possibility. But my heart remains heavy, knowing that others still endure the nightmare from which I've awakened. My story begins onOctober 7, a day that tore my life in two. I went to the Nova festival with my best friend Gaya Halifa, looking forward to a day of music and celebration. When the terror attack began, we tried desperately to escape. After hiding in the bushes, Ben Shimoni arrived in his car to rescue me, Gaya and Ofir Tzarfati. For a brief moment, we thought we were safe. But that hope shattered when the terrorists opened fire on our car. I was wounded. Gaya did not survive. I remember her last words to me: \"Romi, they shot me.\" We shared one final look, her eyes meeting mine before they rolled back as she took her last breath. In the end, I was the only survivor from our car. Since returning home, I've learned that Ben managed to save twelve other people at the festival that day before coming back to rescue us—a heroic act for which I am eternally grateful. YARDEN GONEN: THANK YOU, PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR RESCUING MY SISTER FROM HAMAS President Donald Trump arrives at an election night watch party at the Palm Beach Convention Center on Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024 in West Palm Beach, Florida.(Evan Vucci/AP) Every day in captivity tested every fiber of my being. I lost 22 pounds as food and water became luxuries rather than necessities. The bullet wound in my hand, untreated and without pain medication, led to complete disability in my right hand. Yet somehow, I endured. In captivity, I found an unexpected lifeline—Emily Damari. We first met after undergoing horrific surgeries in Gaza, waking up in a hospital after anesthesia. Thirty-nine days later, we reunited in the tunnels and remained inseparable. Two injured girls, two functioning hands between us, two bleeding souls becoming one. She was my light when hope abandoned me. When I collapsed to the floor, she lifted me with a smile. When I cried so hard I couldn't breathe, she wiped away my tears. When I yearned for my mother, she held me tightly and didn't let go. We fought together to survive, and on January 19, we were both released. I am incredibly grateful for getting my life back. I owe so much to you, PresidentTrump, for your decisive leadership in advancing a deal that many thought impossible. When I returned, I learned how you promised from your first day in office that you would bring all the hostages back. Your commitment created the breakthrough that led to my release along with 37 other hostages. You achieved what many diplomats and leaders deemed impossible. Your intervention made this possible, and I look forward to meeting you face-to-face to express my profound gratitude. I believe you will finish what you've started. Romi Gonen is warmly embraced by her family following her release from Gaza by Hamas terrorists as part of the ceasefire deal.(Ma'ayan Toaf (GPO)) I also thank the brave soldiers of the Israel Defense Forces who risked their lives. I thank my family who, like the families of all the hostages, fought tirelessly, traveled across continents and refused to let the world forget me and all the hostages. Their unwavering advocacy and determination to bring me home sustained them through their darkest hours, just as thoughts of them sustained me through mine. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Since my return, the journey has been far from over. I've been hospitalized, undergoing a 13-hour surgery. I never imagined my condition would be so severe. I didn't anticipate that my leg would lose function as they harvested everything possible to repair my hand. I never expected to need rehabilitation for months ahead or that I would face multiple surgeries instead of just one. The rehabilitation is incredibly difficult, both physically and mentally. But I will face it all—this is what I waited for during those endless days of captivity. As I navigate this new chapter of healing and hope, I carry with me the memory of those dark days and the people who sustained me through them. I carry the responsibility to speak for those who cannot yet speak for themselves—the hostages still waiting for their freedom. The three released Israeli hostages, Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher, who had been abducted during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Palestinian terrorists, exit a van before boarding an Israeli Air Force military transport helicopter near Re'im in southern Israel on Jan. 19, 2025 after a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange deal in the war between Israel and Hamas was implemented.(GIL COHEN-MAGEN/AFP via Getty Images) It feels especially meaningful to mark the first100 days of Trump’s presidencynear Israel's Independence Day. But true independence cannot exist when our people are still held captive. Every living hostage deserves the chance to breathe free air and reunite with loved ones, while those who have perished deserve to be returned to their families for proper burial and remembrance. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP My story is not just one of survival but of the enduring human capacity for resilience. It is about finding light in the darkest places and strength when all seems lost. It is about the bonds that save us and the hope that sustains us.

    "title": "This agency that targets Republicans while shielding Democrats must be dismantled",
    "article_text": "Fox News contributors Tomi Lahren and Leslie Marshall discuss DOGE head Elon Musk opposing President Donald Trump's tariffs and his public spat with White House senior counselor Peter Navarro on 'MediaBuzz.' Elon Muskhas claimed that one of the most common errors of a smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist. But it doesn’t take aSpaceX-level engineerto understand that the Office of Government Ethics — an agency few Americans know by name, but whose unchecked power casts a long shadow over our democracy — simply has no purpose in its current form. The OGE is a partisan, bureaucratic thicket that should be fully dismantled. It selectively enforces hazy rules around the financial arrangements of incoming candidates and officials — often in a heavy-handed manner against Republicans. Commonly, the two winners in a battle with OGE are (1) Democrats and (2) lawyers. As a practicing attorney in the field of political law, I have a first-hand look at this frequently-partisan battle waged by OGE against nominees and candidates. The taxpayer-funded monument topost-Watergate paranoiais a relic of a bygone era. On behalf of my clients, I have navigated its labyrinthine requirements for years, and I can attest: OGE is not a guardian of integrity, but a sanctimonious bureaucratic machine, burdening public servants with meaningless red tape while undermining the will of the electorate. It’s time to dismantle this sham and restore accountability where it belongs: with the voters. Created in 1978 amid the hysteria following Watergate, OGE operates on a flawed premise: that every public official is a latent crook, requiring constant oversight by unelected mandarins. This assumption insults the intelligence of the American people, who are perfectly capable of judging their leaders at the ballot box. Ethics in government is not preserved by faceless desk jockeys wielding stacks of financial disclosure, recusal and divestiture forms; it is enforced by citizens casting votes. Outsourcing this sacred responsibility to a bloated agency like OGE diminishes democracy itself while costing taxpayers more than $20 million annually. DOGE SLASHES ‘WASTEFUL’ ‘PROBLEM-SOLVING’ CONTRACT WORTH $50K IN LATEST ROUND OF ELIMINATIONS Even worse than the real cost to American taxpayers is the inherent tax this imposes on those looking to serve their country in the federal government. OGE’s bureaucrats personally involve themselves in a probing, uncomfortable, subjective examination of the finances of nearly anyone in a middle or senior position in the federal government, along with that person’s immediate family members. They consider themselves the prosecutor, judge and jury for whether someone who has had financial success in the real world must give it all away in order to enter the government. What’s worse, OGE often changes its own measurement standards, leading to limited predictability as to what a nominee can keep and what he or she must offload. As an attorney who represents clients through this process, I take no delight in this outcome, but it results in hours of needless work for lawyers and financial advisors, the costs of which must often be borne by the individual seeking to serve. Consider its practical and public failures. In recent months, OGE’s obsession with nitpicking financial disclosures delayed the confirmation ofPresident Donald Trump’snominees during an already protracted transition. These reviews — often redundant and always laborious — added no discernible value to the public’s understanding of nominees’ fitness, and cannot possibly be in the public’s interest. By inserting itself as an unelected gatekeeper, OGE slows governance and frustrates the mandate of elections. Worse, OGE has become a weapon of partisan warfare, selectively enforcing its vague standards to target Republicans while giving Democrats a free pass. Take the case of Biden’s Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, who held millions in stock in an electric bus manufacturer championed by the administration. In 2021, President Joe Biden visited the company, praising it as a cornerstone of America’s green future. The company later went bankrupt, but not before the secretary cashed out with $1.6 million in capital gains after Biden’s visit. OGE’s response? Silence. Contrast this with the agency’s relentless hounding of Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in 2017 over private jet travel, fueling a media firestorm that ultimately led to his resignation. The pattern is clear: OGE plays favorites, acting as a blocker to create controversies for one side while ignoring the other. This double standard extends to OGE’s handling of high-profile figures. When FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr contributed to the authorship of Project 2025, Democrats cried \"conflict of interest.\" OGE dragged out its review, allowing the left to smear Trump’s agenda unchecked, only to clear Carr after the damage was done, just two weeks before the 2024 election. Compare this to Hunter Biden’s lucrative Burisma dealings during the Obama years — OGE didn’t utter a peep. Similarly, Biden’s Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack faced no scrutiny for cozy private jet trips in 2022, while OGE amplified outrage over far less egregious Republican travel. Such selective amnesia betrays OGE’s impartiality and exposes its role as a partisan cudgel of the deep state. The agency’s redundancy compounds its flaws. Every federal department already has internal ethics offices, rendering OGE’s $24 million annual budget a wasteful duplication. If an official breaks the law, the Department of Justice can prosecute. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION OGE’s sister agency, the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which polices Hatch Act violations, is cut from the same cloth. In 2024, Biden’s budget director Neera Tanden flirted with Hatch Act violations, fundraising brazenly on X, while FTC Chair Lina Khan appeared at Democratic campaign events, prompting a House Oversight inquiry. OSC’s response? Nothing. Yet in 2017, it aggressively pursuedKellyanne Conwayfor a fleeting comment about Ivanka Trump’s brand, demanding probes and decrying the \"death of democracy.\" The hypocrisy is stark: Democrats skate, while Trump’s allies face the guillotine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump’s decision to fire OGE chief David Huitema in February was a bold step in the right direction toward dismantling this deep-state agency with crosshairs on Republicans. The public’s resounding re-election of Trump in 2024 was a mandate to sweep away such bureaucratic obstructions, not a call for more oversight by unelected elites. Trump’s broader dismissal of 17 inspectors general alongside Huitema sparked predictable outrage, but it underscored a truth: officials elected by the voters–not agencies–hold the power to punish misconduct. Abolishing OGE would not leave ethics unpoliced. Internal agency offices, the Justice Department, and — most crucially — the electorate provide ample checks. OGE’s existence only fuels conflict, delays the president’s administration from being filled with his chosen advisors and erodes trust in public institutions, the very opposite of its stated mission. It’s time to end this bureaucratic charade. Let’s trust the American people to hold their leaders accountable, as democracy demands.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. In 2017, Congress passed one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in the last quarter-century. When President Donald Trump signed theTax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA),the law spurred economic growth the United States hadn’t seen in a generation. Wages increased, and unemployment decreased. Americans were able to cash their paychecks and go home to their families with more money in their pockets. Now, eight years later, major TCJA provisions are up for renewal. Among them:Opportunity Zones,a successful, bipartisan piece of legislation that is transforming underserved communities in real time.  Opportunity Zones have made an incredible impact across our nation. The Opportunity Zone (OZ) initiative allows investors from all over the United States toinvest their capital gains earningsin economically distressed communities where new investments can be eligible for preferential capital gains tax treatment. Instead of sitting idle in a brokerage or bank account, this money is put to work in communities that have not seen significant private investment for some time. GOP PUSH TO MAKE TRUMP’S 2017 TAX CUTS PERMANENT, SAY GOING BACK WOULD BE A ‘DRAMATIC’ CHANGE FOR MANY This pro-growth tax policy offers crucial incentives that do not cost American taxpayers a single cent. In 2017, this kind of policy may have seemed unbelievable to some within the Beltway. Despite the skepticism, OZs are actively transforming communities and creating economic opportunities for families in the poorest zip codes. President Donald Trump's Tax Cuts & Jobs Act spurred economic growth.(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) Erie, Pennsylvania may best exemplify the economic benefits and the tangible changes Opportunity Zones can create in a relatively short period of time. In 2018, the city’s downtown ZIP code, 16501, was named the poorest in Pennsylvania and among the poorest nationwide.  However, through the potential of OZs, the stigma of Pennsylvania’s poorest ZIP code served as a springboard for investment in the area. Shortly after TCJA was signed into law, a group of local residents recognized how Opportunity Zones could revitalize the city. Major employers, local universities and other organizations partnered to provide initial financial backing to form the Erie Downtown Development Corporation (EDDC). To date, EDDC has leveraged more than $115 million in private investment into downtown Erie, which has built 108 new fully occupied residences, revitalized and created more than 100,000 square feet of new commercial space, and established space for 25 new businesses. Overall, $400 million of long-term capital investment is at work, breathing new life into Downtown Erie. These investments have a proven track record of revitalizing small businesses and residential areas while fostering innovation in technology and manufacturing — an industry where South Carolina excels. Projects like the South Carolina Technology & Aviation Center (SCTAC) have generated over $6.1 billion in investments and created more than 18,000 new jobs in the local community. This further underscores the significance of Opportunity Zones, which have been and will continue to be impactful. Additionally, Opportunity Zones have played a significant role in assisting the revitalization of previously overlooked communities, transforming them into economic powerhouses. In Oconee County, South Carolina, investors transformed a textile mill built in 1875 along Lake Hartwell into 197 new residential apartments. The project also incorporated retail and recreational amenities, including the restoration of the historic dam and the creation of public green spaces and trails. Nationally, Opportunity Zones have generated$89 billionin private investment across more than 5,600 designated communities, and this investment spurred the creation of over 500,000 jobs in the first two years alone. According to a report released in March by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), a bipartisan public policy organization based in Washington, D.C. The legislation also has a far-reaching impact — approximately one in 10 Americans live in an Opportunity Zone. That number could soon grow. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION The EIG report also indicates that OZs \"caused an increase of 313,000 new residential addresses (not counting units currently under construction) in designated communities from Q3 2019 to Q3 2024 – roughly doubling the total amount of new housing added to these communities over that period.\" Moreover, the Council of Economic Advisors found that the Opportunity Zone designation alone caused a 3.4% increase in home values in these areas, which translated to an estimated tens of billions of dollars in new wealth for the Opportunity Zone residents who own their homes. In 2018, the city’s downtown ZIP code, 16501, was named the poorest in Pennsylvania and among the poorest nationwide.  However, through the potential of OZs, the stigma of Pennsylvania’s poorest ZIP code served as a springboard for investment in the area. By empowering the private sector and cutting red tape, Opportunity Zones enable projects to move more efficiently and at a lower cost while simultaneously addressing one of the most pressing needs in low-income communities – quality affordable housing. From the very start of the 2017 tax law, we knew the Opportunity Zones initiative would be a gamechanger. It was made for shovel-ready projects in neighborhoods that needed the help the most. As we look ahead to 2025, the future is bright in places like Erie and Oconee County. The EDDC is preparing to break ground on another $22 million project, which includes 37,000 square-feet for commercial office and retail space. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP However, if Congress fails to extend TCJA and Opportunity Zones provisions expire, we could see projects years in the making completely upended overnight, along with the largest tax hike in modern history. It’s critical that Congress extend, expand and make the 2017 tax cuts permanent so working families, small businesses, and communities nationwide can continue to receive the benefits of this legislation – and tax cuts at large – for years to come.

    "article_text": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Politicians across the nation claim they want aworld-class education systemthat ensures every child receives the education they deserve. How we get there is the source of debate. Despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars in recent decades on our public education system, we have very little to show. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the U.S. hovers near the middle of the pack internationally in standardized test scores even as other countries have advanced. One report said, \"The U.S. struggled the most in math, where 15-year-olds in 29 other countries had higher average scores than Americans.\" This is unacceptable. And while there are a variety of reasons for our education stagnation, we believe that one answer is to provide families more choice, including private, religious schools. AHEAD OF KEY SUPREME COURT ARGUMENTS, HERE’S WHICH STATES HAVE PASSED SCHOOL CHOICE MEASURES Parents in Oklahomahave been fighting for more education freedom for decades. One way Oklahoma responded was by expanding access for new and innovative charter schools as alternatives for parents seeking a better education for their children, including offerings such as a French-immersion school. The U.S. Supreme Court will decide if Oklahoma can let a Catholic school join its charter program. What will the court have to say? FILE: The court is seen on Nov. 15, 2023, in Washington.(AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File) But Oklahoma’s choice is under attack once again at theUnited States Supreme Court. In Oklahoma, we have been battling two different lawsuits trying to destroy faith-based options for parents to choose. The ACLU, Freedom from Religion Foundation and others filed the first suit. Shockingly, the attorney general of Oklahoma, Gentner Drummond, filed the second. The aim of both suits is to prevent the Statewide Charter School Board and our Oklahoma Department of Education from treating St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School the same as every other applicant who applies to be a charter school simply because it is faith-based. The U.S. Supreme Court will soon hear arguments in the case. Oklahoma is rural. To ensure parents in rural areas have expanded choices, virtual options are available. We believe in Oklahoma that parents are best positioned to determine the educational needs of their own children and that the Oklahoma Department of Education should give parents as many options as possible to meet a diverse array of needs. Some parents may choose their local school, some parents may choose a brick-and-mortar charter school in their area, some parents may prefer a virtual approach. St. Isidore applied to be one of those options. They met all the academic criteria we require in Oklahoma to be a qualified option for parents. However, the ACLU and Attorney General Drummond objected, claiming that the state must discriminate against St. Isidore because it is Catholic. Supporters of school choice responded that we are simply trying to expand options for parents, and we are not allowed to violate the Free Exercise Clause of the United States Constitution. In fact, we felt bound by prior U.S. Supreme Court decisions prohibiting this kind of religious bigotry in educational choices, including Carson v. Makin, a recent case won by the Institute for Justice and First Liberty Institute against the state of Maine for doing precisely what Drummond is demanding be done here – engaging in religious bigotry against a faith-based educational option. The argument, advanced by the ACLU and Drummond, is that religious bigotry is enshrined in the Oklahoma Constitution because it has two provisions that work together to prohibit government resources from aiding a faith-based educational program. These provisions are sometimes called \"little Blaine Amendments,\" because they harken back to efforts by Senator James Blaine from Maine in the late 19th Century to ensure that no public funds would go to Catholic schools but rather would be reserved to the more Protestant-friendly public schools. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION This effort to ban Catholic schools from receiving any aid is a \"doctrine, born of bigotry,\" according to Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. It is this bigotry that the ACLU and Drummond are attempting to continue, and it is this bigotry that we intend to end in Oklahoma. For decades, politicians and activists pointed fingers at each other, each trying to blame another for the educational ills of our home state. Almost every solution offered sounds different and promising, but they usually have the same thing in common – they are government-led solutions. We are trying to do something different in Oklahoma. We are trying to empower parents to decide for their families and force schools to compete for parents in an open market system. Some parents would like a faith-based option. St. Isidore applied to be one of those options. They met all the academic criteria we require in Oklahoma to be a qualified option for parents. However, the ACLU and Attorney General Drummond objected, claiming that the state must discriminate against St. Isidore because it is Catholic. Excluding that option in the name of 19th century religious bigotry is just another political agenda driving education policy. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Instead of fighting against parents and telling them that government officials know what is best for their children, we should instead listen to them. There is hope that the Supreme Court will give us this chance, a chance to take power away from government bureaucrats and give it back to the people.

    "title": "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Trump’s first 100 days Make America Safe Again",
    "article_text": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt shared a video showing posters of illegal immigrants arrested for sexual and drug-related crimes, as well as other violent offenses. (@PressSec/X) Today, April 30, 2025, marks the end of the first 100 days of Donald J. Trump’s second term. In 100 days, Trump has achieved more than most presidents accomplish in their entire presidency. A key part of the president’s agenda to unleash the Golden Age of America is to make our country safe again. That starts withdeporting criminal illegal aliensand securing our borders. Starting on January 20, Trump immediately got to work signing countless executive actions to reverse the previous administration’s policies that put illegal aliens above the safety of American citizens. GOP LAWMAKERS RALLY AROUND TRUMP ADMIN FOR MASSIVE NIGHTCLUB RAID TARGETING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS The president’s executive actions have allowed theDepartment of Homeland Securityto go after the worst first. In the past 100 days, we’ve arrested and deported criminal illegal aliens, including gang members, pedophiles, suspected terrorists and murderers. We’ve empowered our law enforcement officers to use their common sense to make arrests. DHS Secretary Noem joined ICE and other agents on operations in Phoenix, Arizona on April 8, 2025.(Secretary Noem/X) I believe it is of paramount importance to show up on the ground and know what our law enforcement deals with day in and day out, so I’ve joined several ICE enforcement operations. On an operation I went on in New York City, we arrested a ringleader of Tren de Aragua. The ringleader, Anderson Zambrano-Pacheco, was caught on a viral video last year showing heavily armed men kicking down an apartment door in Aurora, Colorado. He had recently purchased more guns and was trying to buy grenades. Adding to his rap sheet were charges for kidnapping, assault and burglary. As he was taken off in cuffs, his neighbors cheered and thanked us for removing him from their community. This isn’t an outlier incident either. Polls show eight in ten Americans support deporting criminal illegal aliens. Under Trump, we have arrested over 150,000 aliens — including more than 600 members of the vicious Tren de Aragua gang. We are going after the worst of the worst to make America safe again. Since Trump’s inauguration,Immigration and Customs Enforcementofficers have arrested more than 200 known or alleged terrorists, marking a 655% increase from the same period last year. This includes one of India’s most wanted men, Harpeet Singh, who is wanted for recruiting and planning a grenade attack on an Indian Police Station. Thanks to Trump, we are getting these criminals and terrorists off our streets and out of our country. While the media and far left lionize illegal alien gang members, Trump and I have stood with the victims of illegal alien crime. Earlier in April, I met with several Angel families whose children were killed because of illegal aliens who should have never been in this country. I heard from Tammy Nobles, whose daughter Kayla was brutally raped and murdered by an MS-13 gang member who was released into the country by the previous administration. Alexis Nungaray shared her daughter Jocelyn’s story. Her 12-year-old daughter was assaulted for two hours by Tren De Aragua gang members before they strangled her. These family’s courage to speak out and share their tragic stories inspires Trump and I to keep fighting for the victims of illegal alien crime. Thanks to Trump we’ve re-opened the VOICE office to give victims of illegal alien crime access to resources and support services. Federal agents in New Jersey arrested a Turkish citizen wanted for murder in his home country on March 6, 2025.(FBI) Additionally, thanks to legislation signed by Trump, illegal aliens accused of theft, burglary, assaulting a law enforcement officer, or any crime that causes death or serious bodily injury are now required to be detained. These commonsense policies to fix the country’s broken immigration system are why it’s so concerning to hear certain politicians and legacy media criticize the administration for arresting and deporting so-called \"non-criminals.\" Let’s be crystal clear: so-called \"non-criminals\" who haven’t been charged with crimes other than crossing the border illegally, are often human rights abusers, gang members, wanted by INTERPOL for committing crimes in other countries, or suspected terrorists. They may not have criminal records in the U.S., but these aliens are far from innocent. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Since Trump’s inauguration, we have arrested several suspected terrorists in our country illegally, including one with ties to ISIS. By the standard the press is using today, the ISIS-tied illegal would be considered a \"non-criminal\" because he hasn’t been convicted or charged with a crime other than lying on his visa application. Do our critics really think ICE shouldn’t arrest illegal alien gang members and suspected terrorists? President Donald Trump thinks we should, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. Not only are we removing violent criminal illegal aliens and supporting their victims, but we’ve also secured our borders to keep criminals out of the country. In the past hundred days, Trump has made it clear there is a new sheriff in town. This administration has stopped the use of catch and release. If we catch you at the border, we’re either detaining you or taking you back to Mexico. We have deputized federal and local officials, including the National Guard and even IRS agents in this whole-of-government effort. We’ve also partnered with the Pentagon to bolster Border Patrol’s work to secure the border. These actions have been noticed by the rest of the world as migrants have turned back at our border. We now have the most secure border in American history. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP These commonsense policies to fix the country’s broken immigration system are why it’s so concerning to hear certain politicians and legacy media criticize the administration for arresting and deporting so-called \"non-criminals.\" Trump campaigned on border security and immigration enforcement, the American people voted for it, and he is delivering beyond anyone’s expectations. Keeping America safe is his No. 1 priority. I will continue fighting every day alongside President Donald Trump to secure our border and keep American communities safe. This is just the beginning of the Golden Age of America.

Microsoft’s EVP and CFO Amy Hood said during the company’s fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings call that the company may face AI capacity constraints as early as June. “We had hoped to be in balance by the end of Q4 but we did see some increased demand, as you saw through the quarter,” Hood said. “So we are going to be a little short, a little tight as we exit the year.” The timing of Hood’s statement is interesting because Microsoft has reportedly canceled multiple data center leases this year. In February, investment bank TD Cowen published a memo that Microsoftcanceled multiple data center leasesthat equated to a “couple hundred megawatts” or the equivalent of two data centers. In the two months since, there have beenmultiplereportsof additional data center lease cancellations. Microsoft says these two instances are not necessarily related. Thecompany reiterated todaythat it is still committed to investing$80 billion into data centers this year— as it originally earmarked at the beginning of this year. Half of that figure is for U.S.-based data centers. Hood also added that demand today and demand tomorrow are not the same thing. “Just a reminder, these are very long lead time decisions; from land to build out, it can be, you know, lead times of five to seven years, two to three years,” Hood said. “So we’re constantly in a balancing position as we watch demand curves.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said at the top of the earnings call that the company opened data centers across 10 new countries and four new continents during this past quarter.

Native image editing in Gemini will start rolling out gradually today, expanding to more people in over 45 languages and most countries in the coming weeks. The launch follows on the heels of the AI image-editing model Google piloted in its AI Studio platform in March, which went viral for its controversial ability toremove watermarks from any image. Similar toChatGPT’s recently upgraded image-editing tool, Gemini’s newfangled native image editor can in theory achieve better results than stand-alone AI image generators. Gemini now offers a “multi-step” editing flow that delivers what Google describes as “richer, more contextual” responses to each prompt with text and images integrated. You can change the background in images, replace objects, add elements, and more within the Gemini platform flow. “For example, you can upload a personal photo and prompt Gemini to generate an image of what you’d look like with different hair colors,” explains Google in a blog post. “[Or] you could ask Gemini to create a first draft of a bedtime story about dragons and provide images to go along with the story.” If this sounds like a deepfake risk, well, that’s reasonable. To allay fears, images created or edited with Gemini’s native image generation will include an invisible watermark, according to Google. The company is also “experimenting” with visible watermarks on all Gemini-generated images.

Now credit card giants Visa and Mastercard are getting into the AI game. Visa announced on Wednesday “Intelligent Commerce,” which it says enables AI “to find and buy.” AI agents will be able to shop and make purchases on behalf of consumers, based on preselected preferences. In a statement, Visa chief product and strategy officer Jack Forestell said: “Each consumer sets the limits, and Visa helps manage the rest.” Visa says that it is collaborating with a mix of tech giants and startups to develop AI-powered shopping experiences that are “more personal, more secure, and more convenient.” Those companies include Anthropic, IBM, Microsoft, Mistral AI, OpenAI, Perplexity, Samsung, and Stripe, among others. The move follows Mastercard’sannouncementon Tuesday that it would give AI agents the ability to shop online for consumers. Mastercard said its new Agent Pay offering “will enhance generative AI conversations for people and businesses alike” by integrating payments into tailored recommendations and insights already provided on conversational platforms. In a statement, it said: “This means that for a soon-to-be-30-year-old planning her milestone birthday party, she can now chat with an AI agent to proactively curate a selection of outfits and accessories from local boutiques and online retailers based on her style, the venue’s ambience, and weather forecasts. Based on her preferences and feedback, the intelligent agent can make the purchase, and also recommend the best way to pay, for example, using Mastercard One Credential.” Mastercard said it will work with Microsoft on new use cases to scale “agentic commerce,” as well as with IBM, Braintree, and Checkout.com on other aspects of AI-powered shopping. Visa and Mastercard aren’t the only ones allowing for AI-powered shopping. On Tuesday, PayPal announced its ownagentic commerce offering.

That’s an increase of 30 million users since the prior quarter, where Meta reported that Threads had320 million users. The new figure represents increased growth, as Threads added 30 million in the first quarter of this year, compared with 20 million in Q4 2024. It’s also worth noting that in a single quarter, Threads added nearly the same number of users to its network as one of its newer competitors, Bluesky. The latter, a decentralized social app, today has roughly 35 million users. X, meanwhile, now has north of 600 million monthly active users,accordingto statements made by its CEO, Linda Yaccarino, on Wednesday. While Threads is still small in comparison to Meta’s other social apps — Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp — its growth is helping to cement its place in the microblogging app ecosystem. In total, Meta says that more than 3.4 billion people now use at least one of Meta’s apps daily. On Wednesday’s call, Zuckerberg told investors that the growth indicates that Threads “continues to be on track to become our next major social app.” Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Pinterest says it’s finally going to do something about the AI slop that’s taken over its platform. After an increasing volume of complaints, the social networking and image pinboarding site announced Wednesday a plan to begin labeling AI-generated and AI-modified images. It will also introduce a new option that allows users to reduce the number of generative AI Pins they see. The new features are an indication of how serious a threat generative AI is to platforms built on top of user-generated content, crowdsourcing, and social sharing. AI technology has made it possible for bad actors to flood these platforms with fake images that drown out the human-made content people came to see, devaluing the overall experience. AI-generated Pins and other low-quality AI content — often referred to as “AI slop” — have created a backlash among Pinterest’s loyal customer base. Now Pinterest says it will help users more easily identify what’s AI and what’s not. When users click on an image Pin in closeup, they’ll see an “AI modified” label in the bottom left corner. The company says it will analyze the image’s metadata to help determine what’s AI, but has also developed its own system of classifiers that will automatically detect AI content that “doesn’t have obvious markers.” Creators will be able to appeal to Pinterest if their content gets labeled incorrectly, according to the company. More importantly, Pinterest says it will give users more control over how much AI content they see in an upcoming feature. When launched, users will be able to select a “see fewer” option on GenAI Pins in certain categories — like beauty and art — that are prone to being overrun with AI content. Over time, it will expand this option to other categories, as well. When available, the option will be found in the three-dot menu on the bottom right of a Pin. Clicking this will send a signal to Pinterest’s systems to recommend less AI content to the users, the company explains ina blog post. Pinterest didn’t say when the new control setting was launching — only that it was arriving “soon.” For a site like Pinterest, which attracted users to browse and save aspirational images in areas like fashion, home decor, travel, art, recipes, DIY, beauty, parenting tips, and more, a deluge of AI content could actually kill the site. Some users have alreadydeclared the site deaddue to the AI imagery that’s taken over. On Reddit, for instance, users have beenprotestingtheencroachmentof AI slop on Pinterest for months, noting a huge uptick in this low-value content. They say that AI images found their way across the site, whether they were browsing content, searching, or viewing board suggestions. The media alsodocumentedthedeclinein articlespondering if AI has already ruinedthe platform or if it can be fixed. Pinterest says it plans to introduce more tools in the months ahead to build upon its AI work, adding that it still believes GenAI can be inspirational, when thoughtfully implemented. “As people encounter AI-generated content on Pinterest, we are empowering our users to make more informed choices about the content they see,” CTO Matt Madrigal said in a statement. “Gen AI content on Pinterest should enhance users’ ability to discover and act on their inspiration, and we are intentionally approaching this new landscape in a thoughtful way that benefits everyone on Pinterest.” Topics Consumer News Editor Sarah has worked as a reporter for TechCrunch since August 2011.

The company apparently bought an undisclosed number of lithium iron phosphate batteries from Chinese firm Gotion before the election. The batteries were for Rivian’s delivery vans, the bulk of which are made for Amazon. After the election (although it’s not clear exactly when) Rivian worked with Samsung SDI “to move a large amount of battery inventory to the U.S. from South Korea,” Bloomberg reports. The stockpiles should help reduce the pricing pressure caused by Trump’s auto tariffs, which are applied to components that car companies bring into the U.S. to use in vehicles. Trump altered those tariffs this week, providing some relief compared to his original plan of applying an across-the-board 25% tax on imported parts; Trump’s revised tariff plan willstill likely lead to price hikes on new cars.

The company emailed Ray-Ban Meta owners on Tuesday with a notice that AI features will now be enabled on the glasses by default, according toThe Verge. This means Meta’s AI will analyze photos and videos taken with the glasses while certain AI features are switched on. Meta will also store customers’ voice recordings to improve its products, without an option to opt out. To be clear, Ray-Ban Meta glasses are not constantly recording and storing everything around the wearer. The device only stores speech that the user says after the “Hey Meta” wake word. Meta’sprivacy notice on voice servicesfor wearables says that voice transcripts and recordings can be stored for “up to one year to help improve Meta’s products.” If a customer doesn’t want Meta to train its AI on their voice, they will have to manually delete each recording from the Ray-Ban Meta companion app. The change in terms is along the lines of Amazon’srecent policy changeaffecting Echo users. As of last month, Amazon will run all Echo commands through the cloud, removing the more privacy-friendly option to process voice data locally. Companies like Meta and Amazon are eager to hoard these heaps of voice recordings because they are useful training data for their generative AI products. With a wider range of audio recordings, Meta’s AI can possibly do a better job at processing different accents, dialects, and patterns of speech. But improving its AI comes at the expense of user privacy. A user may not understand that if they use their Ray-Ban Meta glasses out of the box to photograph a loved one, that person’s face may find its way into Meta’s training data, for example. The AI models behind these products require obscene amounts of content, and it benefits companies to train their AI on the data that their users are already producing. Meta’s hoarding of user data is not new. Already, the company trains its Llama AI models onpublic poststhat American users share on Facebook and Instagram.

In the past, Applehas sent similar notificationsto targets and victims of spyware,and directed them to contact a nonprofit that specializes in investigating such cyberattacks. Other tech companies, like Google and WhatsApp, have in recent years also periodically sent such notifications to their users. As of Wednesday, only two people appear to have come forward to reveal they were among those who received the notifications from Apple this week. One is Ciro Pellegrino, an Italian journalist who works for online news outletFanpage. Pellegrinowrote in an articlethat he received an email and a text message from Apple on Tuesday notifying him that he was targeted with spyware. The message, according to Pellegrino, also said he wasn’t the only person targeted. “Today’s notification is being sent to affected users in 100 countries,” the message read, according to Pellegrino’s article. “Did this really happen? Yes, it is not a joke,” Pellegrino wrote. The second person to receive an Apple notification is Eva Vlaardingerbroek, a Dutch right-wing activist, who posted on X on Wednesday. “Apple detected a targeted mercenary spyware attack against your iPhone,” the Apple alert said, according toa screenshot shown in a videothat Vlaardingerbroek posted on X. “This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do. Although it’s never possible to achieve absolute certainty when detecting such attacks, Apple has high confidence in this warning — please take it seriously.” Reacting to the notification, Vlaardingerbroek said that this was an “attempt to intimidate me, an attempt to silence me, obviously.” Neither Pellegrino nor Vlaardingerbroek responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

It’s not yet clear what spyware campaign, if known, the Apple notifications relate to. Apple has notifiedusers across dozens of countrieson two occasions last year that they were targeted by unspecified spyware. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pellegrino is the second Italian journalist this year to have been notified of being a target of this type of spyware, which is sometimes also referred to as “mercenary” spyware, given that it is often developed by companies who then sell the technology to governments. In February,WhatsApp notified Pellegrino’s Fanpage colleague Francesco Cancellatothat the company “interrupted the activities of a spyware company which we believe attacked your device.” In Cancellato’s case,according to WhatsApp, the spyware was made by Paragon Solutions, an Israeli company. Citizen Lab, a digital rights organization that has investigated spyware for more than a decade, confirmed they were investigating these attacks targeted at WhatsApp users. After Cancellato came forward, anothertwoItalians, who work forMediterranea Saving Humans, a non-government organization that helps rescue immigrants, also said they were targets of Paragon.

Despite the excitement about the new technology, most of their pilot projectsdon’t make it into production. Gruve.ai, a startup founded by the team behind Rahi Systems aims to help enterprises get AI solutions out of testing phase and into real-world application by using AI to deliver its services. Rahi Systems is an IT solutions company acquired by Wesco for$225 million in 2022. IT services firms, including major players like Accenture, have long been the go-to consultants to implement new tech projects for companies when they don’t have the skilled staff in-house. However, given that their work relies on humans, their expertise often comes with a steep price tag. “Technology services industry hasn’t been disrupted in the last 25 to 30 years,” Tarun Raisoni, CEO of Gruve, told TechCrunch. “AI truly changes that dynamic.” Gruve hopes to change the traditional IT consultancy model in two key ways: first, by reducing the need to hire a large staff of consultants by using AI agents for repetitive tasks. Second, by charging clients based on usage rather than on an hourly basis. In the past, VCs were generally not interested in investing in IT services in large part because their reliance on human labor made these businesses hard to scale. But by using AI agents instead of human consultants, Gruve can deliver software-like gross margins of 70% to 80%, which is significantly higher than the margins of traditional tech consultancies, said Navin Chaddha, managing partner at Mayfield. Gruve’s innovative model and its team’s experience building Rahi Systems has helped it raise a $20 million Series A round led by Mayfield, with participation from Cisco Investments and other investors. The fresh capital brings Gruve’s total funding to $37.5 million. Raisoni said that his team first meets with the client to determine their AI needs and prepares their data to support AI applications before recommending and implementing AI solutions. “You must understand your customer’s business before you can implement because their business processes are different, their workflows are different. How they service their clients is different,” he said. But once Gruve is ready to deploy, AI agents will handle tasks such as security breach detection and the transition from on-premises to cloud CRM. Similar to traditional IT consultancies, the company partners with select trusted tech vendors to implement their solutions for clients. Gruve’s current partners include large companies like Cisco, IBM’s Red Hat, and Google, as well as about a dozen AI-native startups like Glean and Supervity. But unlike most tech consultancies, Gruve won’t bill its clients when the solution is first implemented. Their “services are available on demand, the same way electricity is provided or the same way cloud computing is provided,” Chaddha said. For example, if Gruve has implemented AI for security, the company will only charge the client upon a security breach detected and analyzed by the installed AI.

On Wednesday, JetBrains madeMellum, a code-generating model the company released for its various software development suites last year, openly available on the AI dev platform Hugging Face. Mellum, trained on more than 4 trillion tokens, weighs in at 4 billion parameters and is designed specifically for code completion (i.e., completing code snippets based on the surrounding context). Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, while tokens are the raw bits of data that a model processes. A million tokens is equivalent to ~30,000 lines of code. “Designed for integration into professional developer tooling (e.g., intelligent code suggestions in integrated developer environments), AI-powered coding assistants, and research on code understanding and generation, Mellum is also well-suited for educational applications and fine-tuning experiments,”explains JetBrains in a technical report. JetBrains says that it trained Mellum, which is Apache 2.0 licensed, on a collection of datasets, including permissively licensed code from GitHub and English-language Wikipedia articles. Training took around 20 days on a cluster of 256 H200 Nvidia GPUs. Mellum takes some work to get up and running. The base model can’t be used out of the box; it has to be fine-tuned first. While JetBrians has provided a few Mellum models fine-tuned for Python, the company cautions that they’re meant for “estimation about potential capabilities” — not deploying into a production environment. AI-generated code is no doubt changing how software is built, but it’s also introducing new security challenges. More than 50% of organizations encounter security issues with AI-produced code sometimes or frequently, according to a late 2023survey by developer security platform Snyk. Indeed, JetBrains notes that Mellum may “reflect biases present in public codebases” (e.g., generating code similar in style to open source repositories) and that its code suggestions won’t necessarily be “secure or free of vulnerabilities.” “This is just the beginning,” JetBrains wrote in ablog post. “We’re not chasing generality — we’re building focus. If Mellum sparks even one meaningful experiment, contribution, or collaboration, we would consider it a win.” Topics AI Editor Get inside access to Europe’s top investment minds — with leaders from Monzo, Accel, Paladin Group, and more — plus top-tier networking at StrictlyVC London.

    "article_text": "Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Since it launched nearly 20 years ago, Speedtest.net has been one of the most popular tools used to measure internet speeds. However, Doug Suttles, the founder and former CEO of Ookla, the network testing company behind Speedtest, felt that just measuring speed was not enough to tell people all they wanted to know about their internet connections. That’s why Suttles is now launching a new tool calledOrbthat measures latency, packet loss, jitter, and speed to give you a measure of how stable your internet connection is. Suttles, who started Orb with Ookla exec Jamie Steven in 2023, said Speedtest.net was the right tool for its time, but as internet speeds became less of an issue around the world, he felt people needed new, more holistic ways to assess their internet connections. “Speed tests are like the dipstick in your car, which will tell you that you ran out of oil once your car breaks down. We wanted to build a dashboard to tell you that you are low on oil, so you can fix that problem,” Suttles told TechCrunch over a call. Orb checks network connections for three key variables: responsiveness, which is measured by a combination of lag, jitter, latency, and packet loss; reliability, which measures responsiveness over time and packet loss over time; and speed, which is your usual download and upload speeds. All these variables can be measured over different time intervals — one minute, five minutes, one hour, and 24 hours. Combining all three variables, the tool gives you a score to indicate how stable your network connection is. An Orb score above 80 indicates a good connection; 70-80 means you have an okay connection; and if you get anything below that, you may have noticeable problems. If your score is under 80, the app suggests steps you can take to improve the performance of the network. The startup says it uses LLMs to show descriptions of key issues and the suggestions related to solving those. Orb has apps for various platforms, including iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Linux. The company also provides a guide for installing the tool on Raspberry Pi, Onewrt, Docker, Steam Deck, Prox Max, WLAN Pi, older smartphones, and other platforms for those who would want to monitor their connections more frequently. The startup is also working on a feature that would let users set up an Orb and share it with someone else to have them monitor your connection. Both users will receive notifications if the connection quality wavers. Orb is currently free to use, and the company wants to keep it that way. Suttles said he’d like to license the technology to enterprises and ISPs so they can monitor and identify network issues with advanced alerts and analytics. The startup has so far raised $3.8 million in funding from Sidekick Ventures, as well as individual investors, including Fastly senior director Edward Bender; Netflix engineer Jana Iyengar; Big Network CEO Tom Daly; Fastly’s former head of streaming, Lee Chen; the head of strategy and operations of Oculus Studios, Jason Kay; former president of THQ and founder of Naughty Dog, Jason Rubin; and Vetro’s head of strategic initiatives, Will Cooper. Steven, who also worked on creating Down Detector, said Orb also aims to create recipes for different services that help you detect if you can access a particular site, like Zoom, Netflix, X, or Google Drive, to check if the services are working.

    "title": "'We don't care': A defiant China looks beyond Trump's America",
    "article_text": "\"We don't care about sales to the United States,\" says Hu Tianqiang as one of his toy fighter jets flies past our heads. It's hard to hear him above the buzzing toy planes and miniature drones, an almost rhythmic backdrop to the cacophony of toys that surround him, all clamouring for the attention of buyers. Hu's stall, Zhongxiang Toys, sits inside the world's biggest wholesale market in the small Chinese city of Yiwu. It's a huge showroom of more than 75,000 shops where buyers come seeking just about everything, from twinkling Christmas lights and kitchenware to umbrellas and massage guns. It can take most of the day just to get around one department given each of them has an airport hangar's worth of goods on show. Yiwu is in the province of Zhejiang, along China's eastern coast. The manufacturing and export hub, home to more than 30 ports, accounted for 17% of all Chinese sales to the US last year. That puts Yiwu, and this region, at the frontline of the US-China trade war. Mr Hu, too, is on the frontline. He sits among rows of snazzy toy jets, squeaking dogs, fluffy stuffed animals, barbies and motorcycle-riding spidermen – a sliver of the $34bn (£25bn) worth of toys China exported in 2024. About $10bn of it went to the US. But now, these Chinese exports to America face up to 245% tariffs. And US President Donald Trump has made it clear that he blames Beijing in particular for cornering too much of the global market. But things have changed here since Trump's first trade war against China, which kicked off in 2018. It taught Yiwu a lesson, summed up by Mr Hu: \"Other countries have money too!\" That defiance has become a familiar theme in the world's second-biggest economy, which is bracing itself for another turbulent Trump presidency. Beijing, which has been repeatedly telling the world that the US was bullying countries into trade negotiations, has not backed down yet from the trade war. The propaganda online has ratcheted up, applauding Chinese innovation and diplomacy in contrast to the uncertainty unleashed by Trump. On the country's highly controlled social media, there are plenty of posts echoing the leadership's promise that China will keep fighting. And in factories and markets, businessmen and exporters now say they have other alternatives, beyond Trump's America. Mr Hu, for instance, says around 20%-30% of his business came from US buyers. But not anymore. \"We don't care about that 20-30%,\" Mr Hu says. \"We now sell mostly to South America and the Middle East. We are not lacking money, we are rich.\" When we ask about Trump, his colleague Chen Lang jumps in, rolling his eyes: \"He's cracking international jokes like no other. One day, one joke. Adding tariffs for him is like cracking a joke.\" Nearby, one of the thousands of buyers that flock to this market every day is negotiating a price to buy more than 100 robots that turn into cars in a series of beeps and buzzes. After tapping various numbers into a calculator, the final price is written in chalk on the floor. The buyer, we are told, is from Dubai. The BBC met many others from across Africa and South America. Lin Xiupeng says he has noticed the shift away from American buyers in his last 10 years in the toy business. \"A few days ago, the shop next to us had an order from a US client. It's worth more than one million yuan. But because of tariffs, the shop owner decided to cancel it,\" he says, offering us cups of tea. \"They must need China,\" he says, adding that the country supplies most of America's toys. \"I think there are a lot of businesses in the US protesting these days.\" Mr Lin is correct. Some toy shop owners in the US have written to the White House describing the tariffs as \"disastrous\" for their business. \"The tariffs are taking a hatchet to small businesses across America,\" Jonathan Cathey, who owns a toy company in Los Angeles, told the BBC over the phone. He invested his last $500 in his company, Loyal Subjects, in 2009, which he ran from his two-bedroom bungalow in West Hollywood. He says it's now a multi-million-dollar business, but the tariffs could derail his plans. \"The entire toy industry could go under. We are looking at the total implosion of the supply chain. It's going to get really ugly,\" he warns. He says swapping suppliers is a huge task: \"You need a lot of resources on the ground to produce a toy and many of these Chinese businesses have spent 40 years perfecting their craft.\" China has been a big part of Donald Trump's first 100 days in office, with his administration going head-to-head with Beijing. \"He seems to be launching a crusade against the whole world,\" says former Senior Colonel Zhou Bo, who served in the People's Liberation Army. \"But of course he's trying to bash China the hardest.\" Trumpaccused China of operating the Panama Canal, which is run by a Hong Kong-based firm, and vowed to take it back. He has been on the hunt for ways to mine rare earth minerals, which China effectively has a monopoly over, making this a key part of any deal with Ukraine. His threats to take Greenland are also likely aimed at curbing China's ambitions in the Arctic. And, of course, he initiated another trade war, which takes special aim at China's neighbours,such as Vietnamand Cambodia, that have been crucial to its evolving supply chain. In the last week, he suggested the levies on Chinese goods could be halved and spoke of \"a fair deal with China\" that his administration was \"actively\" negotiating. But China's Commerce Ministry rebuffed this as \"groundless with no factual basis\". The headlines in state media haven't spared him either:  \"Trump is probably the worst president in American history,\" read one on state TV. It seems the US president is waiting for his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to pick up the phone. \"We in China say – we have to let the bullet fly for a moment,\" Col Zhou says. \"That means in the fog of war, we do not know what will come next. I believe this kind of tit-for-tat would last for maybe one or two months – hopefully not more than three months.\" It cannot go on, he adds, because that would not be good. It's certainly not good for China.Trump's tariffs are not even the biggest challengefacing the country, which is also grappling with domestic economic pain, from low consumption to a housing crisis that has dented people's savings and confidence in the future. The terrible timing aside, the tariffs are biting Chinese businesses. Goldman Sachs has forecast that China's economy will grow by 4.5% this year,short of the government's target: 5%. TheBBC reported from the trading hub of Guangzhouin mid-April that US-China trade was grinding to a halt, with exports to American households piling up on factory floors. That is borne out by this month's economic data, which show that activity in factories has sharply slowed. When the BBC rang suppliers to see if shipments to the US had resumed, what emerged was a messy picture. One supplier said he had half-a-million pieces of clothing waiting to ship to Walmart, and a few others echoed his uncertainty. But two exporters we spoke to said some shipments from US retailers had indeed restarted. The range and complexity of the trade between the two economies, which includes cargo cranes, umbrellas and everything in between, means that it's often down to different businesses and supply chains as to how they deal with the tariffs. Whatever the business, there is no doubt the American consumer will feel the absence, or potentially higher prices, of Chinese goods. The US still relies heavily on Chinese manufacturing to meet its own domestic demand – think phones, computers, semiconductors, furniture, clothes and, of course, toys. Electronics and machinery alone account for more than 50% of US imports. Walmart and Target reportedly told Mr Trump in a meeting last week that shoppers are likely to see empty shelves and higher prices from next month. They also warned that supply shocks could carry on until Christmas. Some 90% of all Christmas decorations hung around American homes come from Yiwu in China, where sellers, surrounded by signs wishing the world \"Feliz Navidad\" told us they're now trying to focus on sales to South America. And that effort is very evident in Yiwu. In the early morning, before the shutters even open, the cavernous lobby of the wholesale market echoes with voices reciting key phrases. \"Shukran,\" says the teacher in Arabic. The students repeat it several times to perfect the pronunciation before learning that it means \"thank you\". \"Aafwan\" comes the reply, or \"you're welcome\". These are free lessons offered by a local government association. Most of the students are women, dressed in their best to also impress their customers. \"These women are the backbone of trade across China,\" says one stall holder, who is originally from Iran and is giving private lessons to an eager student. \"They're doing these lessons to stay ahead of one another, to stay in competition.\" Most of the traders can already speak a few words of English. Now they say they need to greet their new buyers in Spanish and Arabic – a small but crucial sign of China's shifting trade relationships. Oscar, a Columbian who would only give us his first name, was wandering the halls of the market with bags filled with fluffy bunnies and bears. He says the US-China trade war offers \"many opportunities\" for traders from other parts of the world. \"Doing business with China is very important,\" he insists. \"[Doing business with] the US these days, less so.\" The deal sets up an investment fund to search for minerals, and set outs how revenues would be split. The White House has been pushing for the agreement as a prerequisite for further military assistance. The US president blames the first quarterly GDP decline in three years on his Democratic predecessor. Mahdawi was arrested in mid-April when he attended an American citizenship interview in Vermont. A prosecutor says one of the alleged victims was blindfolded and thrown into the back of a car at gunpoint.",

    "article_text": "Voters are set to head to the polls for local and mayoral elections being held in some parts of England on Thursday. There are local elections to 24 of England's 317 councils and six mayoral authorities on 1 May. A by-election in Runcorn and Helsby will also decide who becomes the new MP for the constituency in Cheshire. Polling stations will open at 07:00 BST and close at 22:00 on Thursday, with results to be declared through the night and on Friday. It is the first big set of polls since Labour's landslide victory in last year's general election. About 1,650 seats will be contested on 14 county councils, eight unitary authorities, one metropolitan district and in the Isles of Scilly. The six mayoral elections are taking place in the West of England, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Doncaster, North Tyneside and - for the first time - in Hull and East Yorkshire, and Greater Lincolnshire. The by-election in Runcorn and Helsby was triggered by the resignation of former Labour MP Mike Amesbury following his conviction for assaulting a constituent. Elections to all 21 county councils in England had been due to take place. But the government announced elections would be postponed in nine areas, where local authorities are being reorganised. The areas where there are elections to county councils include: Cambridgeshire, Derbyshire, Devon, Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire, Kent, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire. The other elections are to the unitary authorities of Buckinghamshire, Cornwall, Durham, North Northamptonshire, Northumberland, Shropshire, West Northamptonshire and Wiltshire, plus Doncaster Metropolitan Council and the Isles of Scilly, which has a unique governance structure. Most of the results are expected to be declared by Friday evening. There are no local elections scheduled in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. People who want to vote in person will be asked to show photo ID to do so. There are more than 20 acceptable forms of ID, including passports, driving licences and - from 1 May - Armed Forces Veteran Cards. The BBC has published detailedelection guidelinesoutlining its approach to covering polling day. Like other broadcasters, the BBC is not allowed to report details of campaigning or local election issues on TV, radio or online on polling day until 22:00, when voting closes.",

    "title": "Meta warns of 'worse' experience for European users",
    "article_text": "Meta warned on Wednesday that European users could face a \"materially worse\" experience following a key regulatory decision by the European Commission. Meta recently introduced a \"consent or pay\" model which leaves users to choose between paying for a monthly subscription or letting Meta combine data it has collected on Facebook and Instagram. Last week, the European Commision - the EU's executive - announced it had decided that the model does not comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and fined Meta €200m (£171m). \"Based on feedback from the EC in connection with the DMA, we expect we will need to make some modifications to our model,\" Meta said in its quarterly earnings statement. Meta said it expected those modifications \"could result in a materially worse user experience for European users and a significant impact\" to its European business and revenue. The company said those impacts could kick in as soon as the third quarter of this year, and may be in effect while it appeals the decision. Eric Seufert, analyst at Mobile Dev Memo, said Meta may be trying to strategically turn European users into \"vocal cheerleaders\" for its products amid a regulatory clampdown. \"What they ultimately want to do is turn public opinion against this regulatory regime which will demonstrably degrade the product offerings that are available to EU residents,\" Seufert told the BBC in a phone interview after the announcement. Meta, formerly known as Facebook, includes the social media network in addition to the photo sharing app Instagram and the messaging service WhatsApp. The Commission has said that Meta's consent-or-pay model does not allow users to freely consent to how their data is used. The body is currently assessing another option Meta introduced last year, which the company says uses less personal data to display advertisements. Meta was given 60 days to comply with the DMA's recent decision, or risk further fines. Apple was also issued a €500m (£428m) fine over its App Store practices last week. Meta's announcement comes as it released quarterly earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. The results showed Meta continues to bring in significant advertising revenue. The company touted its AI tools on Wednesday. \"We're making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1 billion monthly actives,\" Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. \"Our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,\" he said. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the results showed that Meta has gone \"full throttle on investments in AI\" and notes Britzman also noted the 6% jump in daily active users. \"There had been some concerns that we might see a slowdown in new users this year, but this was a very strong start and a signal to investors that Meta's family of apps has a grip on users that's hard to displace,\" Britzman said. The EC fine comes amid what Meta called \"an active regulatory landscape\" in its earnings report. The company is currently defending itself at trial in a case brought by the US Federal Trade Commission which alleges that Meta runs a social media monopoly. The FTC, the top antitrust watchdog in the US, says Meta cemented its monopoly by purchasing Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The tech giant had been ordered in 2021 to allow greater competition and open the App Store up to outside payment options.

    "title": "King sends heartfelt message to fellow cancer patients",
    "article_text": "King Charles has sent a personal message to fellow cancer patients, speaking of the \"daunting and at times frightening experience\" for cancer sufferers and their loved ones. In a heartfelt message to guests at a Buckingham Palace reception for cancer charities, the King spoke about becoming a cancer \"statistic\" - referencing the more than 1,000 new cases recorded in the UK every day. He said his experience of living with cancer had shown that \"the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion\". The message doesn't provide an update on the progress of the King's own cancer treatment, but royal sources say he is continuing in a positive direction. The King was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February 2024 and continues to receive regular treatment, which is said to be successful and that he is getting better. There was a brief hospital stay for the King in March after he suffered side effects, but he was well enough in April for a state visit to Italy with a busy schedule and is said to have plans for further overseas trips. There has been an attempt to be more open about his health problems - and this latest message reflects his sense of a shared experience with the many other families affected by cancer. The King's statement continued: \"But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.\" He praised the \"community of care\" of those who helped cancer patients, for their humanity as well as their expertise. The King highlighted \"the profound impact of human connection - whether in the careful explanation from a specialist nurse, the hand held by a hospice volunteer, or the shared experience in a support group\". \"While every patient's journey may be different, together you are ensuring that a cancer diagnosis need never mean facing the future without hope and support,\" said the King. He quoted Dame Deborah James,who died of bowel cancer in 2022and whose parents are guests at the reception, who said: \"Have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope.\" The reception at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening, attended by the King and Queen Camilla, is in honour of community projects helping people who are living with cancer and for health groups trying to prevent cancer. Among the guests will be representatives of cancer charities including Macmillan Cancer Support, Breast Cancer Now, Maggie's and Children's Hospice South West. The reception includes displays showing the work of groups helping people affected by cancer, including Wigs for Heroes and Move Dance Feel, which uses dance to support women with cancer. At the Palace there are also champions of cancer charities, people living with cancer and people who lost relatives, including radio presenter Adele Roberts, former footballer Ashley Cain and actor Richard E Grant. \"Every day we see the impact that cancer is having on people's lives and that experience is even worse for some people because of who they are or where they live, which is entirely unacceptable. We are on a mission to transform cancer care, but we cannot do it on our own,\" said Gemma Peters, chief executive officer at Macmillan Cancer Support.

    "title": "Will UK break heat records for start of May and will it last?",
    "article_text": "Thursday 1 May is likely to be the hottest start to May on record for the United Kingdom with a peak temperature of 29C expected in south-east England. This would exceed the previous record of 27.4C on 1 May 1990 at Lossiemouth. Temperatures will widely be around 7C to 11C higher than the average at this time of year. After a peak in heat on Thursday, temperatures will start to gradually fall over the bank holiday weekend to around average by Monday. Wednesday could become Wales' hottest April day on record with 26C forecast in south Wales, close to the current record of 26.2C Very warm, even hot weather has been felt right across the UK on Wednesday with temperatures widely in the low to mid-twenties. The hottest weather was in south-east England where the thermometer hit 26.7C (80.1F) in Wisley (Surrey), making it the warmest spell of April weather for seven years. Scotland had its highest April temperature since 2019, reaching 24.4C (75.9F) at Aboyne (Aberdeenshire). In Wales, Wednesday was the second-hottest April day on record, behind 2003 when the national record of 26.2C was set at Gogerddan (Ceredigion). It was also the second-hottest April day on record in Northern Ireland, reaching 24.1C Castlederg, behind the previous high of 24.5C set in1984. UV levels were high for most of the UK, though moderate in the far north of Scotland. What are UV levels and how can you protect yourself? The heat builds even further on Thursday across England and Wales with temperatures in the mid to high twenties forecast, and 29C possible. If that is the case, the record for the warmest start to May would be exceeded by a good few degrees. However, for Scotland and Northern Ireland, it will turn cooler with some cloud and showers. Temperatures will actually fall to around the early May average of 13 to 17C. With increasing humidity on Thursday, there will also be a risk of heavy and thundery showers in parts of Wales, the Midlands and eastern England. Over the last week there has been a large area of high pressure situated across the UK which essentially has not moved â it hasbecome blocked. This means rain-bearing areas of low pressure that we would normally see come in off the mid-Atlantic have been diverted elsewhere leading to the settled and dry weather in the UK. The area of high pressure is also situated in a position where the wind direction is from a south or south-easterly. This has been drawing in very warm air from north Africa and the Mediterranean. It has also helped that with lots of strong sunshine, the ground and air have been progressively getting warmer over the last few days. This is why we have seen temperatures gradually creeping up this week. Gradual cooling is expected over the bank holiday weekend Temperatures will start to gradually fall after the peak on Thursday. On Friday, temperatures will drop into the high teens to low twenties for most but with some sunshine and 24C forecast in south-east England, it will still feel warm. As for the rest of the weekendâ¦ Saturdayâ dry for most with some sunny spells, with a threat of showers in the far south.  Cloudier for northern Scotland where it'll be around 11-13C.   Temperatures elsewhere mostly 16-22C. Sunday- cloudier along eastern coast areas of the UK. Sunny spells elsewhere with highs of 13-17C. Bank holiday Mondayâ cloud in eastern and south-east England but sunny spells elsewhere. Highs of 14-17C. While temperatures are between 7C to 11C above average across the UK for the time of year, getting very warm weather in spring is not that unusual. With the Mediterranean and northern Africa starting to get much hotter during this time of year, any time we have a south or south-easterly wind that gets transported to our shores we see temperatures rise. However, what is becoming clearer with a changing climate is that the blocking patterns â resulting in this wind direction â are becoming more frequent. Data from the independent climate research group Climate Central suggests that temperatures this week have been made atleast five times more likely,externalby human-induced climate change. It's during blocked weather patterns when we tend to see more extreme weather such as heatwaves and droughts in the spring and summer. But a blocked weather pattern can also go the other way so that we could get more rainfall and potentially very cold air in the winter when the block is positioned in a certain way; similar to the 'Beast from the East'.

    "title": "Endangered axolotl release raises hopes for rare amphibian",
    "article_text": "One of the world's most endangered amphibians - the strange, perpetually smiling Mexican axolotl - has thrived after being released in artificial wetlands, scientists have discovered. In a study that provides hope for the long-term future of a creature that was pushed to the brink of extinction, scientists released 18 captive-bred axolotls in restored and artificial wetland close to Mexico City. The researchers fitted the animals with radio trackers and found that they \"survived and foraged successfully at both sites\" - even gaining weight. Lead researcher Dr Alejandra Ramos from the Autonomous University of Baja California said this was an \"amazing result\". The findings are publishedin the journal PLoS Oneand they suggest, the researchers say, that the axoltol can be brought back to its native habitat. The waters of Xochimilco - shaped by traditional farming practices and flushed with spring water from the mountains - used to teem with these amphibians. But as Mexico City grew, urbanisation, pollution and other pressures pushed  axolotls to the brink of extinction, with some estimates suggesting that there were as few as 50 left in the wild. \"If we lose this species, we lose part of our Mexican identity,\" said co-lead researcher Dr Luis Zambrano from the National University of Mexico. It is no exaggeration to call the axoltol an icon. Aztec legend has it that the creature is a god in salamander form - the Aztec god of fire and lightning, Xolotl, disguised as a salamander. \"If we can restore this [wetland] habitat and restore the axolotl's population in a city of more than 20 million people,\" Dr Zambrano continued, \"I feel that we have hope for humanity.\" To lay the foundations for releasing the animals, the researchers worked with local farmers and a team of volunteers to create wetland \"refuges\" for the axolotls. They installed natural filtering systems to clean the water, The scientists released their captive-bred animals at two sites - one in Xochimilco and one at a disused quarry that, over decades, has turned into what they called an \"artificial wetland\". Every animal was tagged with a radio tracking device. \"The amazing news is that they all survived,\" Dr Ramos told BBC News. \"And not only that, but the ones that we recaptured had gained weight - so they're hunting.\" The monitoring also revealed intriguing insights into axolotl behaviour. \"We found that some spend most of their time with one other individual -  like they make these little friendships,\" Dr Ramos explained. Somewhat ironically, these charismatic salamanders are found in the world's laboratories and pet aquariums in their hundreds of thousands. The species is biologically fascinating - it has the remarkable ability to regrow any part of its body that is damaged or lost. So there is research underway to understand whether that ability could be harnessed medically. But in the murky wetlands of Mexico City, there is still a great deal of work to do to clean up and restore the habitat, and to give the wild axolotl a chance to recover. \"Many animals are losing their habitat around the world,\" said Dr Ramos. \"And restoration projects are not easy, but they can be done -  they just need a lot of people. \"You don't need to be a scientist to get involved - everybody in the world can help out.\" Eighty years after the end of World War Two, blasted trees and rubble forests tell a hidden story of wartime bombardment and Nazi terror. The spiders of the \"near-threatened\" breed can camouflage themselves on branches to wait for prey. Wales faces \"unrecognisable future\" without urgent action, future generations commissioner says. A decade of conservation was wiped out in days when a wildfire ripped across the Glen Rosa valley.",

    "article_text": "Voters in some parts of England will elect councillors and mayors on Thursday 1 May. These are the first local elections since the general election was held in July 2024. Everyone voting in person will need to show photo ID. Elections are taking place in 23 councils across England. All seats will be contested in: Six mayoral elections are also happening: in the West of England, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, North Tyneside, Doncaster and – for the first time – in Greater Lincolnshire and Hull and East Yorkshire. In addition, council elections are taking place in the Isles of Scilly. Voters in the Runcorn and Helsby constituencywill also elect their new MPon 1 May. The former Labour MP Mike Amesbury announced he was standing down after his conviction for assaulting a constituent. No routine elections are taking place in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. There are three ways to vote if you are on the electoral roll: To vote in local elections you must be: Voters in some areas may have several ballot papers for the different elections taking place. In council elections, voters generally have one vote for each available seat in an election area - known as a ward or division. However, some large wards have several seats. As in general elections, whoever receives the most votes wins. If, for example, there are three seats available, then the top three candidates win. Mayors are also elected under this system, known as first-past-the-post. EU citizens cannot vote inthe Runcorn and Helsby parliamentary by-election. The deadlines to register to vote, request a postal vote or apply for a proxy vote have all passed. However, if you are already on the electoral roll and realise at the last minute that you will not be able to vote in person as planned, you can apply foran emergency proxy vote upuntil 17:00 on polling day. Your proxy - the person nominated to vote on your behalf - must also already be registered to vote. You must show photo ID in order to vote in person. You do not need your polling card. There aremore than 20 acceptable forms of ID, including passports, driving licences and - from 1 May -Armed Forces Veteran Cards. You can use out-of-date ID as long as you are still recognisable. Anyone who is already registered to vote but doesn't have the correct ID - or who no longer looks like their photo - canuse a free document known as a voter authority certificate. The deadline to apply for a certificate to use in the May elections has passed. You must not take selfies or any other photographs inside a polling station. With the exception of assistance dogs, animals are not usually allowed in polling stations, but can be admitted at the discretion of the local authority. You are welcome to bring your children but they must not mark your vote on the ballot paper. Writing implements are provided but you can bring your own pen or pencil. You can wear political clothing but you must not discuss any of the candidates inside the polling station. Different types of councils are responsible for a variety of local services. These include: Matt Chorley: Local elections might lack glamour - but they matter What is council tax and how much is it going up? Six mayors will be elected on 1 May: A single authority mayor is the political leader of the council. They are responsible for delivering local council services. Metro mayors are regional leaders who chair combined authorities, which are groups of several local councils. They set out plans to boost their local economy, and have some powers over housing and transport. Northumberland is the only council expected to declare its results overnight, with most councils not beginning counting until later on Friday morning. Four mayoral results are also expected by Friday morning - in North Tyneside, West of England, Greater Lincolnshire and Doncaster. Results from the other local authorities and the remaining two mayoral contests in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and Hull and East Yorkshire are expected by Friday evening. It is not clear when the result of the Runcorn and Helsby by-election will be announced. At the general election in July 2024, the outcome was known fairly early - at around 02:25. DetailedBBC election guidelines are written and published for each election, setting out the approach it has to take on polling day. The BBC, like other broadcasters, is not allowed to report details of campaigning or local election issues on TV, radio or online on polling day until 22:00, when voting closes. While polls are open, it is a criminal offence to report any exit polls, which aim to predict election results on the basis of surveys of how people say they have voted. References to the local elections on the day are normally restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations, the weather, or practical information about how to vote. Once the polls have closed at 22:00, the election guidelines no longer apply. However, the BBC must still report the results with the impartiality required both by Ofcom and the BBC's own Editorial Guidelines. Hundreds of councillors, six mayors and one MP will be elected in polls across England. Voters are told they will get a new poll date and postal voters will have to complete a new form. BBC News is on on hand to keep you up-to-date with the latest developments across all platforms. Polls are being held for 23 councils, along with six mayoral contests and a by-election in Runcorn and Helsby.

    "title": "How Chelsea extended dynasty with latest WSL title",
    "article_text": "Chelsea won their sixth WSL title in a row with two games to spare When former manager Emma Hayes announced her departure from Chelsea, a seed of doubt was planted - was this the end of their dominance? Who could possibly replace the woman who had led them to five successive Women's Super League titles and 14 major trophies in 12 years? The end of an era, an invitation for their rivals and a new challenge for Chelsea to navigate. But a year on, those thoughts seemed naive, foolish even, when celebrations broke out at Leigh Sports Village after Chelsea's 1-0 win over Manchester United confirmed them as league champions again. Hayes' successor Sonia Bompastor turned around, fist-pumped and roared towards her staff, then unwrapped a flag to give to her players to celebrate with. The ease in which she has taken on Hayes' legacy has been just as impressive as Chelsea's unbeaten run and will only strike fear into those hoping to topple them. There was an air of inevitability as Chelsea rocked up in Manchester on Wednesday night. To say they were preparing to win their sixth successive WSL title would be wrong. Bompastor admitted they had not entertained the idea that Arsenal would drop points at Aston Villa, in turn opening the door for Chelsea. Instead, this was a group of wounded animals, still bruised from their Champions League semi-final humiliation on Sunday and keen to put it right. When word of Arsenal's 5-2 defeat at Aston Villa eventually spread through the stands at Leigh Sports Village, Chelsea's routine did not falter. Bompastor stood arms folded, watching on as the players warmed up, acting as if they had no indication what was happening elsewhere. This was Chelsea in their usual, ruthless mood, preparing to get the job done. It was a stark contrast to the outpouring of emotion that came from the stands 90 minutes later when they were crowned champions again. Supporters were so sure of victory when Lucy Bronze headed in the game's only goal in the 74th minute, that they sang \"Chelsea, champions\" on repeat until the end. Chelsea, as they have done so often this season, left it late to break the deadlock but did what needed to be done, even when they were not playing their best. \"Mentality monsters\" has been their tag in recent times and they leant on that numerous times again this season. Of their total goals scored, 33% of them came in the final 15 minutes of matches - more than any other WSL team. They also picked up eight points after coming from behind in games - only Manchester City have earned more from losing positions. Essentially, it was always Chelsea's title to lose - they had won the previous five WSL trophies, had the biggest budget in the league and invested further in the transfer window. Their spending has been unmatched - but that is why they are champions. The chasing pack walked, as Chelsea ran, bouyed by their invincible mentality. When Hayes stepped down, Chelsea recruited one of the best coaches in Europe, snatching Bompastor from French giants Lyon. When they were pushed to the brink last season by Manchester City, winning their fifth successive title on goal difference, they responded by signing Champions League winners Bronze and Keira Walsh from Barcelona. They bounced back from a defeat at Manchester City in the Champions League to beat them days later in the league, and scored a stoppage-time winner against Liverpool to book their place in the Women's FA Cup final. They have built a squad capable of challenging on all domestic fronts and they remain on course to win the Treble this season, with two trophies already in the bag. Is the gap widening between Chelsea and everybody else in the WSL? Their points tally and unbeaten season suggests it is. Arsenal and Manchester United showed their credentials in spells. But the difference has always been that Chelsea still win when they are vulnerable. Chelsea secure sixth successive WSL title at Man Utd The numbers behind Chelsea's latest WSL title The WSL invincibles? Chelsea eye records after sealing another title Sonia Bompastor won the Women's Champions League with Lyon as a player and a manager Chelsea's mentality has played a \"massive part\" in their success, Bompastor said on Wednesday, but her leadership is another key component. Brought in under a weight of expectation, with big boots to fill, Bompastor has always remained calm and never looked out of place. As Liverpool's men celebrated lifting the Premier League trophy just days before - Arne Slot triumphing in the glory of Jurgen Klopp's well-laid foundations - similarities could be seen in Bompastor and Hayes. The Frenchwoman arrived in London knowing she had a squad full of talent, depth and experience. Her job was to make them even better. 'Perfection' and 'the ideal' are words Bompastor has used consistently throughout the season but she knows that will take time. Always wanting more, she spoke about craving perfection and wanting to develop a true identity next season. But in just a short space of time, she can have no complaints about their success in England, even if the disappointment of their Champions League exit weighs heavily. Bompastor has made tactical tweaks - encouraging more possession, a more aggressive press and a less direct approach on the ball. She has embedded new signings, turned winger Sandy Baltimore into a full-back and given responsibility to 19-year-old midfielder Wieke Kaptein. Perhaps the biggest contrast to the Hayes' era is Bompastor's personality. While Hayes often played mindgames, kept people on their toes and used her platform to challenge norms - Bompastor is sometimes understated. Her title celebrations appeared to be subdued, but in her own words, she is a \"simple person\" and will enjoy precious moments with family back in London. A \"little bit\" of champage and some chocolate may be on the cards but Bompastor already has her eye on the Treble. She was conscious of her achievements but humble enough to acknowledge Hayes' involvement, taking time to thank her in her post-match media conference. It was a mark of respect as Bompastor began not only reflecting on Chelsea's past achievements, but on what could still come in the future. This may be the first title win under Bompastor but if this is a far cry from the perfection she craves, Chelsea's future is an exciting one.

    "title": "Five things you need to make it through a power cut",
    "article_text": "The power is out and nothing is working. How am I supposed to get through the day? That was the question faced by millions of people on Monday across Spain and Portugal during the worst electricity blackout in their history. We ask people who spent the day without electricity about what helped them get on with life and what outage essentials they were missing. Paying with phone and card has become the norm, but in cities across Spain and Portugal, queues formed at cash machines - at least the ones that were still working - as shops switched away from card payments. \"We managed to pay for our coffees with card when the outage first started, [but later] we didn't have any cash so we couldn't buy a thing,\" Ed Rowe, 26, in Madrid told the BBC. \"All the restaurants that were open were cash only.\" Grace O'Leary, 32, who also lives in Spain's capital, said she and her mum were counting coins to see if she had enough money to buy wine from a corner shop. \"Cash, apparently, is in fact, king.\" Jaime Gorgojo, 28, was lucky enough to have some cash on him, which allowed him to buy food and other essentials. \"In Madrid it was quite chaotic, there was no tube and you couldn't take out any cash. \"I had cash, but my flatmate didn't, so I had to lend him money to buy things.\" The power cut also led to an information blackout, as people spent the day without internet, WhatsApp, calls, and TV. \"The complete loss of communication was the most confusing and concerning thing... we were only left to speculate as to the cause and piece together news from people in the neighbourhood,\" said Daniel Clegg from Barcelona. The 42-year-old said the absence of information led him to looking at the sky to see if planes were still flying. For Siegfried and Christine Buschschlüter, an old windup transistor radio helped tune in to local radio stations to find out what was happening after their phones stopped working and power went off at their rural home outside Spain's capital. Christine, 82, explained: \"You had to keep on winding and winding. \"It was quite a strange situation. I was born in Berlin during the war and it reminded me of those days when my parents tried to get some news - it took me back.\" The couple reckon the outage will lead to a boom in demand for battery-operated radios. And it is also on Daniel's shopping list. \"Essential kit for back to basics communication and staying informed that I completely neglected to remember.\" Microwaves, air fryers and some hobs and ovens all demand electricity. But on Monday food that does not require electricity to heat or prepare it were in demand. In supermarkets, shoppers formed long queues and panic-bought essentials - echoing scenes from the Covid-19  pandemic. \"We bought a lot of food that wasn't going to go off, like tuna in cans, just in case,\" says actor Jaime. \"The outage only lasted a day and now we have so much food, but most of it isn't going to go bad, as it is easily preserved.\" Lesley Elder, in town Fortuna in south-eastern Spain, said: \"Trying to find food you don't need to heat up, that was more difficult than we thought. \"So we ended up having ham and cheese for dinner.\" She adds a little gas stove to heat up food in a pan would have been helpful. Across the Iberian peninsula, people turned to candles to light up dark spaces. Richard, who lives in the Spanish city of Alcalá de Henares, said not a single street light was on when night fell. \"People were finding their way around by torchlight. It was quite surreal seeing the view from my window totally black especially as I live next to a dual carriageway,\" he said. \"In my spare time, I make candles and luckily I had a few going spare so I could see in the dark.\" Sarah Baxter, from Barcelona, said she even used a candle stovetop to heat up food. \"We could heat beans and rice, and bring water to a boil for instant potatoes,\" she said. \"It was much safer than a propane camping stove inside the apartment.\" Although candles and naked flames can pose a fire risk. With no power people relied on having battery in their devices. In Madrid, people queued outside tech shops to get their hands on a power bank. Luckily for Sarah she had a solar charger that kept her phone charged through ten hours of blackout, and helped her elderly neighbour do the same. Lesley says her Kindle ran out of battery. \"No TV, no Scrabble puzzle on my phone. So having a couple of books would have been helpful,\" she said. But for others, not having access to the internet and their devices was a relief. \"Everyone relies on technology so much that it's quite a nice reminder you can be more independent,\" said Ed. \"You don't have to be connected with everyone all the time,\" said his flatmate Hannah Steiner, 23. \"I was having a good time with my flatmates.\" Sara Francisco, 24, from Leiria, in central Portugal, said: \"I feel this thing that happened was important to make us be more aware and be more conscious about our habits.\" Other itemsrecommended by the UK governmentin an emergency include bottled water, a first aid kit, and baby supplies if needed.

    "title": "Mosquitoes in Scotland as far north as Shetland",
    "article_text": "A Scottish summer is synonymous with the humble yet pesky midge. But Glasgow University scientists have confirmed the continued rise of its distant cousin - the mosquito. The country is now home to more than 20 different species of the biting insect, and some have been identified in Shetland - the most northern location to date. More commonly associated with tropical climes, mosquitoes are a natural part of the Scottish ecosystem. The extent of the mosquito population is being understood thanks to a successful citizen science project. University researchers had received numerous reports from the public of nuisance biting and originally suspected midges or clegs to be responsible. Further analysis showed the areas in question were swarming with mosquitoes, actively trying to bite people. Over the last 12 months more than 700 potential sightings and photos were submitted to the ongoing Mosquito Scotland project. After analysis, more than half were confirmed to be mosquitoes with 21 different species now calling Scotland home. While sightings from the public were at their peak during the summer, reports were submitted to the team in every month of last year. The insects are most often spotted in woodland areas, particularly pine forests in the east, though they are often found inland in our biggest cities. In Glasgow larvae was found floating in stagnant water such as garden plant pots and ponds. Heather Ferguson, professor of medical entomology at the University of Glasgow, described the initial response to their three-year long project as \"tremendous\". She said: 'We found them to a much greater extent than we've known before. \"In almost all parts of the country we got reports of different species. And a very exciting first for us, we found the most northernmost record for the UK when we had a member of the public in Shetland report a mosquito which we were able to confirm.\" In addition to the public sightings, the team hung traps at 24 locations across the country, luring the insects by the smell of carbon dioxide which mimics human breath. Dr Georgia Kirby leads the citizen science project and said public reporting has guided where they hang the traps, which can sometimes catch more than 1,000 mosquitoes in just two days. She said: \"There were several areas of Scotland where we received lots of reports of bites but very few photos of the culprits – understandably, as most people don't want to hold still for a photo while they're being bitten by insects. \"We had suspected that midges or clegs could be responsible, but in our follow-up investigations we invariably found that these locations were swarming with mosquitoes – proving that people in Scotland are good at recognising them and distinguishing them from more familiar insects. \"Most of these sites were areas of dense woodland, which is a key habitat for several aggressive human-biting mosquito species.\" Mosquitoes don't currently pose a health risk to humans in Scotland. The parasite needed to spread infectious disease like malaria is not present here. However, it was a different story 200 years ago when malaria was common in the UK. It was present in the east of Scotland in particular and spread by native mosquitoes. Today, climate change is likely to mean we could see more mosquitoes in Scotland, as our climate becomes warmer and wetter - perfect conditions to allow them to thrive. Culex pipiens, the common house mosquito, has been found to carry and transmit the Usutu virus, originally discovered in the 1950s in Africa and present in Europe for the past three decades. The virus is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito and has affected blackbird populations. The Mosquito Scotland project will continue to help track their population and scientists say it will help provide a crucial early warning system for potential risk, as the species respond to environmental change. Professor Ferguson and Dr Kirby want to hear more from the public in 2025, to help increase their knowledge and build a picture of the biodiversity benefits of mosquitoes and any potential risks. You can get involved in the project and submit your own sightings by visiting theMosquito Scotland website.",

The firm, which was based in Craigavon, County Armagh, had expanded rapidly over the past few years securing deals with Tesco, Lidl, Asda and Spar to become one of NI's biggest ready meal businesses. Karri Kitchen specialised in healthy Asian-style meals such as Mongolian beef noodles, firecracker chicken and mango chicken curry. The liquidator said the business was \"unable to meet rising production costs\". The business was started in 2019 by Shera McAloran with a mantra to \"bring healthy south-east Asian cuisine to homes across Northern Ireland\". The business also appeared in the BBC programme Food Fest Northern Ireland featuring some of their unique recipes. The Statement of Affairs which was filed as part of the liquidation process showed the business had net debts of almost £700,000 when it stopped trading. That included almost £200,000 owed to a County Armagh food company and £183,000 which had been loaned to the business by one of its directors, Chris McAloran. The statement also suggests the business had 33 staff members. A note to the statement says the creditor figures are taken from company records and some of the amounts are disputed and some are likely to be amended. The business had ceased trading prior to its liquidation. Lisa Lappin, from Baker Tilly Mooney Moore, was appointed to liquidate the business. \"Karri Kitchen Ltd entered creditors voluntary liquidation on 16 April 2025,\" she said. \"Karri Kitchen Ltd was a fantastic local brand that produced excellent products and had a loyal customer base. \"Its loss as a unique aspect to the local economy will be mourned, but the company was simply unable to meet rising production costs and broader economic pressures.\" Alliance Party assembly member for Upper Bann Eoin Tennyson said the closure would be a big blow to the Craigavon area. \"Homegrown businesses like Karri Kitchen are the lifeblood of our community, creating jobs, and supporting local supply chains,\" he said. \"This business also made  a significant contribution to local food banks and organisations supporting those the crisis.\" Food manufacturing is a highly competitive sector with low profit margins. Even if you have a distinctive brand which gets onto supermarket shelves it is still a real challenge to build a sustainable business. The challenge is even greater at a time when businesses are continuing to deal with elevated energy costs and a range of new employment costs. That is reflected in the comments from Karri Kitchen's liquidator which says the company was simply unable to meet rising production costs and broader economic pressures. A trial for a waste needle bin in a Belfast city centre car park will be voted on at council on Thursday. The 24.1C recorded is just shy of the April record of 24.5C set at Boom Hall in Londonderry. Ammunition was also recovered by police officers following a search of a rural shed in Dunadry. A ticket site for the Irish rap band's gigs in Hamburg, Berlin and Cologne confirms the summer shows are no longer going ahead.

    "title": "North Korea: First road bridge to Russia 'significant' development",
    "article_text": "North Korea has said the development of its first road bridge to Russia is a \"significant\" milestone in relations between the two countries, according to the country's state media KCNA. Construction of the bridge - set to span the Tumen river in the country's northeast - began on Wednesday. It will be situated near the only other land connection between Russia and North Korea - a Soviet era rail bridge called the 'Friendship Bridge'. The bridge is set for completion by mid-2026, according to Russia's Kommersant newspaper. It comes shortly after North Koreaconfirmed for the first timethat it had sent troops to support Russia in its war against Ukraine. The new bridge is the latest sign of deepening ties between the two heavily-sanctioned countries, which have drawn closer since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Plans for the new bridge were decided during Russian president Vladimir Putin'svisit to Pyongyang last year, where he signed an agreement on \"comprehensive strategic partnership\" with North Korea - the highest level of bilateral ties for Moscow. At a ceremony marking the start of the bridge's construction, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the bridge was \"far beyond just an engineering task\". \"It symbolises our common desire to strengthen friendly, good-neighbourly relations and increase inter-regional cooperation,\" he added. Construction of the bridge began on the same day South Korean lawmakers said more than 600 North Korean troops had been killed fighting for Russia in its war against Ukraine, citing their intelligence officials. In return for military support, Moscow appeared to have provided Pyongyang with technical assistance on spy satellites, drones and anti-air missiles, they added. Earlier this week, North Korea said its soldiers had helped \"completely liberate\" Russia's Kursk border region, eight months after Ukraine's surprise incursion. Ukraine says some of its forces are still in the Russian region. It comes just days after Russia's Valery Gerasimov praised the \"heroism\" of North Korean troops. The race in Pyongyang to mark the birthday of Kim Il Sung was held every year until the pandemic hit. Analysts said the development of the technology was likely assisted by Russia. Hackers from the infamous Lazarus Group are in a cat-and-mouse game to launder their stolen funds from the ByBit heist. Tourists were finally allowed into North Korea last month, but the excitement has been short-lived.",

    "title": "Belfast public needle bin 'not a silver bullet'",
    "article_text": "A proposed trial to install a waste needle bin in Belfast city centre is not a \"silver bullet\" but one step to dealing with drugs issues in the city, a councillor has said. Brian Smyth was speaking ahead of a Belfast City Council vote on Thursday on whether or not to install the bin in the council-owned car park on Little Donegall Street. Councillors chose the car park over a site on Corporation Square at the People and Communities Committee last month. Green Party representative Smyth said the council was lifting between 600 and 700 needles a month in the city centre, with other organisations also involved in the collection of needles. A council report stated there had been an increase in needle finds in recent months and it had been \"highlighted as being in the top six locations\" for discarded needles. The proposed metal needle bin will be concreted to the ground and will provide a secure way of disposing of sharps. Smyth had previously tabled motions for similar bins to be placed in Writer's Square, however this is not council land. He said the Department for Communities (DfC) had turned down this call. \"They are worried about image but I would say if needles continue to be found in the area of high significance, then that's going to provide an image problem,\" he said. A DfC spokesperson said it recognised that drug abuse and associated anti-social behaviour in the city centre was a major issue and was working closely with other organisations, including the council, to tackle the problems. Smyth said members of the council's cleansing team had found needles disposed in regular rubbish bins. \"This poses a risk not only to them but also to members of the public,\" he said. \"Whilst this is a very small response, I think we need to get our heads around the bigger issue of rising drug use in and around Belfast city centre and how we tackle it.\" In March 2023, Belfast City councillorspassed a motion in favour of setting up a safe injecting facilityto help prevent overdoses among drug users. The council has no legal power to open a facility and a change in legislation would be required for this to happen. The aim would be to reduce overdoses and drug-related harm as well as making drug use less visible to the community. Smyth said such a facility could make the area safe for \"people who live, work and socialise in the city centre\". Damian McNairney, a volunteer and trustee from The People's Kitchen in Belfast, said the bin would help but described Belfast city centre as being in a drug crisis. The kitchen offers support to vulnerable and homeless people. \"We need to be more adventurous, we need to be more compassionate in our approach to the issue,\" said Mr McNairney. \"Addicts are being demonised, we need to look and see if we can help. \"If we solve the problem at source, i.e. the addiction, then we are going to be able to deal with the drug paraphernalia and the other issues allied to that.\" Mr McNairney said there were other areas with \"more prominent use\" but getting needles off the street was always a positive. \"There are needles around the town anyway. By not putting the bins up they're not going to go away,\" he said. Mr McNairney said he had visited a safe injection site which opened in Dublin in 2024 and he was in favour of a similar facility in Belfast. \"It seems to be very encouraging in terms of people using it, there's drug paraphernalia that has been taken off the streets, it's being safely disposed of and people with addictions are being signposted to other services,\" he said. In March,Justice Minister Naomi Long told BBC News NI that the \"war on drugs had not been won\"and there needed to be a rethink of how illegal drugs were dealt with in Northern Ireland. The healthy food company's products have disappeared from the shelves of some of NI's biggest supermarkets. The 24.1C recorded is just shy of the April record of 24.5C set at Boom Hall in Londonderry. Ammunition was also recovered by police officers following a search of a rural shed in Dunadry. Judges told the NI secretary to reconsider a decision not to hold an inquiry into the GAA official's murder. BT says it plans to move almost 100 of the roles currently carried out by staff in Derry to India.",

    "article_text": "Eni Aluko was capped 105 times for England Former England striker Eni Aluko has pulled out of a presenting role at this week's Women's Football Awards following her criticism of fellow pundit Ian Wright. The 38-year-old criticised Wright last week, saying he should be aware there were \"only a finite amount of opportunities\" for female pundits working in women's football. Former Chelsea striker Aluko has sinceapologised for her comments, but Wright said he\"cannot accept\" the apologyand was \"very disappointed\" by what was said. The Arsenal icon and former England forward has been a long-term advocate of the women's game, working regularly as a pundit with a focus on Lionesses matches, and received widespread support following the criticism. Against this backdrop, Aluko will not co-present the awards, alongside Gabby Logan and Jamie Carragher, to not \"deflect\" attention away from the nominees in London on 1 May. \"I've decided to take a step back from being part of the hosting line-up this year,\" she said. \"I don't want to deflect from the joy, recognition, and celebration that this event is all about. This event belongs to the players, coaches, fans and everyone who has worked tirelessly to elevate the women's game.\" Wright's Instagram post in response to Aluko's comments has been liked more than 137,000 times, including by England women's players Mary Earps, Alessia Russo and Alex Greenwood. The 61-year-old said he will \"always\" try to give back to the game of football after a 15-year professional career that started at Crystal Palace in 1985. \"Because of the past, where men blocked the women's game for 50 years, the game has serious systemic challenges and it is going to take everyone to help fix it,\" added Wright, who has worked alongside Aluko. \"We are the country that invented modern football so we have a responsibility to lead the way in women's football. \"For me, I will always give back to the game. It has given me so much.\" Aluko 'genuinely scared' after online abuse Get the latest WSL news on our dedicated page",

    "title": "Royal Mail takeover approved by shareholders",
    "article_text": "The sale of Royal Mail's parent company to a Czech billionaire has been cleared by shareholders. The approval of the £3.6bn deal, first proposed a year ago, will see the 500-year institution taken over by Daniel Kretinsky's EP Group. Just over 80% of the shareholders of International Distribution Services (IDS), Royal Mail's owner, voted in favour of the takeover on Wednesday afternoon. Mr Kretinksy said he will put \"employees and customers at the heart of everything IDS does\". Under the terms of the deal, the EP Group will have to maintain the one-price-goes-anywhere Universal Service Obligation (USO). This obligation currently means it has to deliver letters six days per week, Monday to Saturday, and parcels Monday to Friday. The company has committed to maintaining the USO for as long as it owns Royal Mail. Last year, Mr Kretinsky told the BBC he would honour the service - in whatever form it takes -\"for as long as I am alive\". Keith Williams, chair of IDS, said Mr Kretinksy's commitments in the deal \"provide our customers, colleagues, and broader stakeholders with safeguards for the provision of the USO\". A review of the USO closed earlier this month, with Royal Mail suggesting to the regulator Ofcom that reducing second class deliveries to every other weekday would save up to £300m a year and give the business \"a fighting chance\". However, the Greeting Card Association said on Wednesday it was \"deeply concerned\" about the Royal Mail's proposal. \"If proposed changes to the USO are implemented later this year, the small businesses we represent will be left increasingly reliant on an uncapped, unregulated first-class postal service that will put significant pressure on them, and the consumers they serve,\" the group said. Mr Kretinsky has a net worth of £6 billion, according to the 2024 Sunday Times Rich List. In addition to owning 27% of West Ham United football club and 10% of Sainsbury's, Mr Kretinsky's companies also own a gas transmission service which still pipes Russian gas to Europe, albeit reduced levels, paid for and with the consent from the European Union. From the end of April, the 500-year-old Royal Mail will be controlled by Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky who co-owns a football club - but why does he want it? Lee Castleton has started a legal claim against his former employer over the Horizon scandal. Residents say they have missed important letters about medical appointments and pensions. The van was sighted in Brighstone with a Post Brenhinol logo, which is Welsh for Royal Mail. Royal Mail says \"challenging conditions\" mean it is unable to serve some streets in the city.",

    "title": "'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Champions League highlights: Barcelona 3-3 Inter Milan Teenage Barcelona forward Lamine Yamal said he would not compare himself to Lionel Messi - and then put in a performance a 17-year-old Messi could only have dreamed of in one of the all-time great Champions League semi-final ties. It led to him being called \"a genius\", \"a cheat code\" and \"a phenomenal talent\". Barca and Inter Milan ended up drawing 3-3in their epic first-leg encounter, with visiting full-back Denzel Dumfries involved in all three Inter goals, scoring twice, and being named man of the match. But most of the global headlines will focus on the 17-year-old Yamal, who scored his 22nd goal on his landmark 100th Barcelona game. He put on a masterclass, especially in the first half to inspire a superb comeback after Inter had led 2-0 by the 21st minute. Yamal claimed a classy Champions League semi-final goal to go with one in the Euro 2024 last four last summer. Already one of the best players in the world - and before he even turns 18. \"I don't think I have seen a 45 minutes like from one individual before in my life. It is unbelievable,\" said TNT Sports pundit Ally McCoist as the players walked off the pitch at half-time. Inter Milan boss Simone Inzaghi gave Yamal the highest of praise afterwards. \"Lamine is the kind of talent that comes along every 50 years, and to see him up close really impressed me,\" he said. \"He caused us huge problems because we were supposed to double up on him and it wasn't enough.\" Barca boss Hansi Flick said: \"He's special, he's a genius. In the big matches, he shows up. \"If it only comes every 50 years like Simone said, I'm glad it's for Barcelona.\" BBC pundit Stephen Warnock called him \"a future Ballon d'Or winner\". One of the games of the season has everyone excited about the second leg at the San Siro in Milan next week, a change of pace from Paris St-Germain's hard-fought 1-0 win at Arsenal the day before. 'A very, very special player' - Yamal, 16, makes Euros history 'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show This video can not be played Lamine Yamal - The Boy King There was a bit of drama before the game when Yamal appeared to hurt his groin and went down the tunnel during the warm-up, with speculation that he might not play. He did start but had barely had an impact before Inter led 2-0 via two fantastic goals - Marcus Thuram's 30-second backheel flick from a Dumfries cross, and Dutchman Dumfries' flying close-range volley. But then Yamal - who was being double marked - came to life, beating a few Inter players before whipping the ball in off the far post with astonishing ease and confidence. Moments later, he beat more defenders on the byeline and slammed in a shot which Inter keeper Yann Sommer tipped on to the bar. Ferran Torres then capped off a fine team move to get Barca level before the break. Dumfries, though, got his second with a header to put the Italian side back in front. But moments later Barca were level again as Yamal cleverly dummied a pass and Raphinha lashed a shot in from 25 yards which hit the bar and went in off the back of Sommer for an own goal. Henrikh Mkhitaryan thought he had made it 4-3 to Inter but his goal was ruled out for a marginal offside. Yet Yamal almost had the final say, one more memorable moment, when his cross-shot hit the angle of post and bar. This video can not be played Warnock on Yamal's 'outrageous' performance against Inter It is tough to even fathom how much Yamal has achieved at his age. This was his 100th Barcelona appearance, and a 22nd goal to go with four in 19 games for Spain. Yamal has 27 assists too, including two in Saturday's Copa del Rey final extra-timewin over Real Madrid. The two greatest players of this generation - Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo - did not make their international debuts until they were 18, while Yamal won Euro 2024 the day after his 17th birthday. Messi scored one goal before he was 18, with Ronaldo bagging five. Yamal is Barcelona's youngest La Liga player (aged 15) and the youngest to score and assist in La Liga for any team. He also holds records for being the youngest Champions League starter, youngest player to score in a knockout game, a quarter-final and now a semi-final. Yamal is Spain's youngest player and goalscorer and the youngest player and goalscorer in a European Championship. 'Superstar' Yamal makes more history with Euros triumph Very few players have had the impact in football by Yamal's age. He will turn 18 in July. He appears to be the closest thing we have seen to Barcelona and Argentina great Messi, now at Inter Miami and arguably the greatest footballer in history. The pair both came through the Barca academy, La Masia, and both play on the right wing. \"I don't compare myself to him, because I don't compare myself to anyone - and much less with Messi,\" Yamal told reporters in the build-up to the game, while also describing the Argentine as \"the best player in history\". But Messi was just very, very promising at the age of 17, rather than already regarded as one of the world's best. Yamal added: \"I don't think the comparison makes sense, with Messi even less - I'm going to enjoy myself, and be myself.\" But he has an unusual bit of history with Messi, who he was photographed with as a baby. A photo emerged,externalfrom a charity calendar photoshoot taken at Barcelona's Nou Camp in 2007. In it, a 20-year-old Messi held baby Yamal and helped him have a bath. Yes really. The shoot came about after Unicef did a raffle in the town of Mataro where Lamine's family lived. \"We walked down to the city centre and you could tell there is a superstar in this town now in Lamine Yamal,\" said ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand on TNT Sports. \"There was a void when Messi left, this kid is doing stuff at 17 we have never seen before. The comfort and ease he plays with is remarkable and he is as at ease off the field.\" I don't compare myself to Messi - Barca star Yamal This video can not be played How putting faith in youth revitalised Barcelona Pundits were in awe at what they saw from Yamal. Owen Hargreaves, the former Bayern Munich, Manchester United and England midfielder, called him a \"cheat code\" on TNT. \"I just want to see Lamine Yamal get the ball and everybody else get out of the way,\" he added. Former Liverpool and England defender Warnock, watching for BBC's Champions League Match of the Day, said: \"He was unplayable at times. His goal was outrageous. \"It's ridiculous watching Yamal. You know, effectively, what he always wants to do â he wants to come inside on his left foot. So you over-compensate and he has got the ability to drag it with his left foot on to his right foot, and he can actually put a decent ball in with his right foot too. \"He is just a phenomenal talent and I love watching him.\" And Ferdinand wrote on social media: \"As a pure football talent I'm going as far as to say I think Lamine Yamal is on another level to any player playing the game in the top five leagues in world football. Truly unbelievable.\" Latest Champions League table Champions League scores & fixtures Follow the latest Champions League news Listen to the latest Football Daily podcast Get football news sent straight to your phone Watch highlights of every Champions League game from 22:00 on Wednesday on BBC iPlayer and the BBC Sport website and app. There will also be a Champions League Match of the Day on BBC One on Wednesday, from 22:40 to 00:00.

    "title": "O'Sullivan moves past Si to reach Crucible last four",
    "article_text": "Ronnie O'Sullivan is currently level on seven Crucible crowns with Stephen Hendry Ronnie O'Sullivan booked his place in the World Championship semi-finals with a 13-9 win over Si Jiahui as he maintained his bid for a record eighth title in the modern era. Leading 10-6 from Wednesday morning's session, the 49-year-old Englishman lost three of the first four frames in the evening as Si closed to 11-9. However, a sublime long red paved the way for him to win a tight 23rd frame and he completed his victory with a break of 74. O'Sullivan, who has won a record 41 ranking events over a remarkable career, will now take on former UK champion Zhao Xintong in the last four. \"I am just grinding it out. I have had some work done on my cue today and I am probably going to have to try and get a new ferrule and tip because it feels awful,\" he told BBC Sport. \"I'm playing awful and the cue feels awful so it is the worst situation to be in as a snooker player. I don't think I can get any worse.\" Meanwhile, world number one Judd Trump set a new century record for a single season as he powered past Luca Brecel 13-8 to set up a semi-final meeting with three-time champion Mark Williams. The Welshman, 49,  won 13-12 in aCrucible classic black ball decideragainst John Higgins. Having not played competitively since snapping his cue at the Championship League in January, O'Sullivan expressed reservations over his ability to be competitive when he arrived in Sheffield. However, after seeing the likes of Mark Selby, Mark Allen and Kyren Wilson depart early from his side of the draw, he is now just one win away from a ninth Crucible final. And on this evidence he may take some stopping, despite his suggestions that he has been the beneficiary of his opponents' shortcomings. While the errors from his victories over Ali Carter and Pang Junxu were still present against Si, particularly from long range, nobody as yet has shown themselves capable of ruthlessly exposing them. Si, a semi-finalist as recently as 2023, was left to rue several missed opportunities to take frames after being presented chances and then found that his opponent was simply too assured once handed a good opportunity of his own. \"He played poor and let me off the hook,\" O'Sullivan said. \"I got lucky again. I have tried to give it my best and I am just hanging in there. \"I have relied on other people to win and that doesn't feel good for me. I always feel better when I force the opening and put the pressure on my opponents. You feel a lot better when you've won the match rather than they've lost it. \"Look at Judd and Mark [Williams] and Zhao, I won't be able to get away with the standard I have played the last three matches at.\" Williams beats Higgins in final-frame thriller World Championship: Schedule, results & BBC coverage All the updates from Crucible quarter-finals The encounter between Trump and Williams will pit the game's two most decorated left-handed players against each other in a repeat of the 2022 semi-final. Trump edged that nerve-shredding contest 17-16 against the Welshman and expended little energy on Wednesday evening to dispatch Brecel. Unlike the afternoon session when 2019 winner Trump did well to emerge at 8-8 after watching Belgium's Brecel produce an array of stunning pots, once play resumed the Englishman was in the ascendency. He set the tone with a superb 115 in the opening frame to equal Neil Robertson's landmark total of 103 centuries set in 2013-14. And he eclipsed the Australian in the very next frame with a run of 116. \"I don't really care about that record,\" Trump said. \"I was just happy to make the breaks at the important times, no matter what they were. It was just about digging in and putting him under pressure.\" Nevertheless it brought up Trump's 11th century at this year's World Championship, with the record of 16 in a single Crucible campaign, set by Stephen Hendry in 2002 and equalled by Mark Williams in 2022, now in his sights. Brecel, who won the world title two years ago simply had no answer, scoring a meagre 19 points from the first four frames, and when he missed a brown to the left middle Trump wrapped up the contest. Seven-time world champion, Stephen Hendry Judd Trump is all about bullying the table, and Mark Williams is all about guile. It's going to be incredible in the semis. But it's Zhao Xintong I can't wait to watch in a one-table situation, he has breezed through the tournament. My head says a Trump v O'Sullivan final but it will be some story if Zhao gets to the final.

I was an international cricketer between 2010 and 2017. At the beginning of each of those summers, there was a mix of optimism, hope and determination that I would bowl well enough in Championship cricket to get the call. Wickets were the currency. James Anderson and Stuart Broad were inked in the side, so Tim Bresnan, Graham Onions, Chris Tremlett, Chris Woakes, myself and a number of others were competing for the other spot. This bred competition and hunger, because I knew the other guys were trying to do exactly the same thing. Backing up performances and demonstrating the stamina to do it over a number of weeks in the domestic game was another aspect of showing you were hardened for the intensity of international cricket. In recent years, under Rob Key, Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes, the way England select their teams has changed. I wonder if the feelings of the players hoping to be selected, those feelings I remember so well, have changed too. There is still the opportunity for a player to prove himself the 'old school' way, even if it does feel like that is becoming a more difficult route into the England team. Sam Cook has 318 first-class wickets to his name, at an average of just 19.77 Sam Cook has been the outstanding seam bowler in county cricket for the past number of years. At the age of 27, with 318 first-class wickets at an average of 19.77, it seems as though his time has finally come. After he was asked to rest from Essex's Championship match against Somerset a couple of weeks ago, it would be surprising if he is not in the squad for the Test against Zimbabwe next month. Even with that overwhelming body of evidence and a stack of wickets behind him, I do feel like it is one performance that has convinced England Cook is finally worth backing. At the beginning of last summer, when the pitches were flat and the Kookaburra ball was being used in the Championship, bowlers toiled. Cook took 10 wickets for Essex to lead them to victory over Nottinghamshire. It is the sort of display that will catch the eye of the selectors, who will rightly look for more than statistics when it comes to making their judgements. And that, perhaps, is the difference between what I felt I was going through more than a decade ago and what can earn selection at this moment. Now it is far more exciting. Yes, Cook has an outstanding record, but he also needed that standout display to give Key and company a nudge. In an attack that only has room for one 'English' style seamer, an injury to Woakes has presented an opportunity. And it might actually be one outstanding performance for other England hopefuls that earns them a call-up. Wood irritated by England's 'golf, golf, golf' narrative Cook in line for Test call-up as England ask Essex to rest him Get cricket news sent straight to your phone I see bowlers in the domestic game who have the raw materials to be international players. Sonny Baker and John Turner are two of them, both of Hampshire (although Turner has been on loan at Lancashire), and have been identified by England despite having almost no first-class cricket behind them. Baker, Turner and others who have the attributes to trouble the best batters will know that one performance, even one spell, might be enough to earn them a call-up. There's precedent for it, too. Stokes first saw off-spinner Shoaib Bashir bowl in a clip on social media, then shared it in his WhatsApp group with Key and McCullum. Not long after, Bashir was in the England squad. Another difference between my time as an international cricketer and now is England's attitude towards franchise cricket, particularly the Indian Premier League (IPL). Now there is an acceptance players hold a lot of power and cannot be denied lucrative franchise opportunities. Who can blame the players for this? After all, it can be a short career. This is in contrast to when I wanted to put my name forward for the 2013 IPL auction. I thought I had a good chance of being picked up. I was bowling quickly, had bowled nicely in a white-ball series in India, getting good players out, and had just had a good T20 World Cup. At the end of 2012, we were on the famous Test tour of India, when we won 2-1. I had to ask permission from the England and Wales Cricket Board to enter the auction and, within five minutes of submitting my forms, received an email telling me I wasn't allowed but that Andy Flower, the head coach, would explain why. That evening, I was having room service in the bedroom of Kevin Pietersen (who was the first England player to spot the might of the IPL), along with Eoin Morgan. I was summoned to see Flower and, as I was on the way out of the door, KP told me to tell Flower I was entering the auction whether he liked it or not. It was a short meeting with Flower. He told me I had to be playing county cricket at the beginning of the following summer in order to back-up performances and be in contention to play Test cricket at the beginning of a double Ashes year. I did as I was told. To me, Test cricket was the pinnacle and I would have done anything to get a spot in that England team. Times have changed. How exciting it must be to be a player now with the potential to succeed in international cricket. Every time you walk on to the pitch you feel like you have the opportunity to put your name forward, to be the subject of the next clip in the England management WhatsApp group, with Key and his cohorts thinking 'we can't ignore this, can we?'",

    "article_text": "Chris Eubank Sr shocked fans inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium as he made a surprise appearance at his son's fight against Conor Benn Chris Eubank Sr says his shock arrival beforehis son's unanimous points win over Conor Bennwas the \"moment of a lifetime\". The pair had supposedly been estranged for years and Eubank Sr, 58, had criticised the match-up. He was not expected to make an appearance on Saturday, before surprising the crowd at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium when he emerged from Chris Eubank Jr's car. Speaking on his YouTube channel on Wednesday,external, Eubank Sr was emotional as he recalled the poignant moment, which he says \"moved the nation and the world\". Eubank Sr says he did not contact his son until the eve of the fight and said he put on a \"disguise\" to visit him in a hotel. \"I'm welling up now,\" Eubank Sr said. \"A moment of a lifetime. It looks like it has been orchestrated by a director, for the car to pull up where it did, for me to be on the left-hand side of the car. \"For me to push the door open and put one foot down and there is the world's media. I chuckled. \"I was directed spiritually, I'm good but I'm not that good, that is why it moved the nation and the world.\" Following his thrilling points victory Eubank Jr was admitted to hospital, which is standard procedure for boxers after a gruelling bout. The fight was set at the middleweight limit of 11st 6lb (160lbs) and Eubank Jr endured a difficult weight cut to the agreed limit but was still fined Â£375,000 for missing his target by a mere 0.05lb the day before the fight. A rehydration clause also limited the 35-year-old from adding more than 10lb on the morning of the fight. Eubank Sr says accompanying his son in the ambulance brought back memories of his ill-fated bout with Michael Watson in 1991, when his opponent suffered brain damage. \"My son junior is very proud and his face looked like a blown up football, almost twice the size,\" he said. \"He will never let you see that but it brought me back all of those years to think about what Michael went through and I was feeling all of that. \"People don't know but my son was touch-and-go and the only way we are going to know if he is going to be OK is with the CT scan. \"He suffered mostly in the hospital because of dehydration, even though the beating was severe. That is why he was in such discomfort for 24-30 hours. \"Do you know how many times I welled up? Do you know how many times I trembled? At 35 years old to be coming down to 160lb, semi-conscious and battered, just like his adversary Conor, who came into the hospital at probably two-o-clock in the morning. \"When I looked at him I did break down, he was on the bed and his legs were obtusely bent and I couldn't see whether he was awake. As I walked closer I said 'are you OK?' And he said, 'yeah I'm OK, I'm OK'. \"The fight was extraordinary, I never thought I would see this type of performance from my son. From rounds six to 12 he stayed in the pocket which is where you are standing toe to toe. \"I'm so proud of that boy of mine and I'm so proud of Conor Benn and it will echo into eternity. \"[But] I don't want my son to go through that again. He doesn't know his life was in the balance and neither does he care.\"",

    "title": "Stunning goals and incredible drama - Barca & Inter deliver match for the ages",
    "article_text": "This video can not be played Champions League highlights: Barcelona 3-3 Inter Milan Every one in a while, a match comes along that will live in the memory long past the final whistle. A treat, a feast of football. That is what Barcelona and Inter Milan served up in anenthralling 3-3 drawin the first leg of their Champions League semi-final. \"It was an amazing battle to watch, almost like a boxing match where opposing styles make the fight,\" said former Liverpool defender Stephen Warnock. \"Barca and Inter were set up very differently, and it made for one heck of a game.\" Former Rangers striker Ally McCoist said on TNT Sport: \"Tonight was just special, special to be here to watch those two teams. \"We have been treated to some unbelievable football this evening.\" Sensational goals, high drama and incredible individual performances - it had everything. Here's how an engrossing evening of football unfolded. Much of the talk in the build-up to this match was around Barcelona. Their dangerous high line, their ability to score an abundance of goals with a prolific front three, the prospect of another golden generation of players nurtured from their prestigious La Masia academy. After 30 seconds of the first leg at the Nou Camp, that all changed. Marcus Thuram's clever backheel finish was the fastest goal to be scored in a Champions League semi-final and left the home crowd stunned. But against a side capable of scoring lots of goals, Inter knew one would not be enough and the second came on 21 minutes when Denzel Dumfries fired in a remarkable overhead kick to once again silence the home crowd. That was not in the script for a Barcelona side trying to reach the Champions League final for the first time in 10 years. \"I think everyone thought that once Inter went 2-0 up, that would be it â they would shut up shop, and we wouldn't see much other than another outstanding defensive display by them,\" said Warnock. Inter had conceded just five goals in this season's Champions League and with Barcelona's high-line tactics exposing their own defensive weaknesses, the Serie A side were able to take advantage. For a few minutes, at least. Trailing by two after 21 minutes, Barcelona needed an immediate spark. Enter Lamine Yamal. The teenager, making his 100th club appearance, took just three minutes to step up for his team and conjure a moment of magic to get them back in it. Jinking into the penalty box and leaving Henrikh Mkhitaryan in his wake, Yamal struck a majestic left-footed finish that ricocheted off the post and into the net to launch the comeback. 'Get the ball to Yamal' became a clear tactic for Barcelona and watching him take control of the game, pinging balls into the area and constantly making himself available in forward positions, it was easy to forget he is still just 17 years old. The equaliser came on 38 minutes, when Ferran Torres stabbed in from close range after Raphinha nodded on Pedri's diagonal cross. Parity restored just in time for the break, the anticipation was heavy after what had been a mesmerising opening 45 minutes. Former Liverpool player Steve McManaman, part of the TNT punditry team, said: \"It had everything. It showed how frail Barcelona are defensively, but going forward they are electric.\" 'A talent that comes along every 50 years' - 'genius' Yamal steals show This video can not be played Yamal pulls one back against Inter With fans and neutrals alike on the edge of their seats from this gripping encounter, expectations were high for an equally entertaining second half. After three stunning goals worthy of putting any team in the Champions League final, there was almost an air of disappointment when Inter's goal to restore their advantage came from a simple corner routine. Dumfries rose highest to meet Hakan Calhanoglu's corner at the back post, highlighting Barca's defensive struggles. \"Inter are not the most dynamic team, and they don't have much raw pace but there was still a way for them to hurt Barca, on the break or with set-pieces,\" said Warnock. \"They are the oldest squad in the Champions League so there is a lot of experience there and they showed that tonight with the way they were clever enough to keep opening Barca up.\" At 30 years and 56 days, Inter named the seventh oldest starting XI for a Champions League semi-final game and they used all of that experience to keep cool heads in a high-drama scenario. \"When you play at home like we did, the sensation is that we should have managed to earn a better result,\" Barcelona forward Raphinha told Movistar Plus. \"We can't concede that many goals, especially at home. Sure, you have to give praise to our opponents who are strong and played well tonight but we are Barca and it's our duty to win at home, that's how it is.\" Smarting from three consecutive defeats in the past seven days, where they have dropped to second in Serie A and gone out of the Coppa Italia to city rivals AC Milan, Inter were determined not to let the lead slip away again. \"Barca were set up to attack and take the game to Inter but their high-line left them vulnerable at the back,\" said Warnock. \"They are not going to change that way of playing - they haven't changed all season and they have done well doing it, so why would they?\" Conceding three goals at home and facing the prospect of travelling to the San Siro with a one-goal deficit, sometimes all you need is someone to take a chance. That is what Raphinha did when he picked up the ball 25 yards out and hammered the ball into the back of the net, via a touch off the bar and goalkeeper Yann Sommer's back. Inter had held the lead for all of 114 seconds before Raphinha's equaliser drew Barcelona level for the second time in the game. Yamal might have been the star of the show on Wednesday but it is Raphinha who has dominated the headlines for Barca throughout this campaign and, although the goal has not been credited to the Brazilian, his performances throughout have proved pivotal to their success. \"I really appreciate what we did today,\" said Barcelona boss Hansi Flick. \"We played a great game, and of course, the goals we conceded weren't pretty. You have to talk about them, analyse them, but the way we played, our style, our way of playing...it was fantastic.\" Mkhitaryan thought he had found a fourth goal when he poked home in the 75th minute only for the video assistant referee to rule it out for an agonisingly tight offside. But even without that, the game was the joint-highest score draw in a Champions League semi-final game alongside a 3-3 draw between Dynamo Kyiv and Bayern Munich in the first leg in 1998-99. It sets up a mouth-watering second leg in Milan next week and, while Barca may be disappointed to have conceded three goals at home, the visitors will take confidence that they were able to match them on an exhilarating night of football. \"After three defeats in a row we saw the real Inter tonight,\" said Inter goalscorer Dumfries. \"We played with heart and I'm proud. Obviously we wanted to win but I think it was a good performance and it's still all to play for.

    "title": "South Africa to review claims past ANC governments impeded apartheid crimes investigations",
    "article_text": "South Africa’s president,Cyril Ramaphosa, is setting up an inquiry into whether past ANC governments interfered with the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes, amid criticism from the families of victims. A group of 25 relatives and survivors of apartheid-era deaths and violencesued the governmentin January, claiming that interference from “the highest levels of government” blocked investigations into cases referred to the National Prosecuting Authority by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). On Wednesday, the presidency said in a statement: “Allegations of improper influence in delaying or hindering the investigation and prosecution of apartheid-era crimes have persisted from previous administrations. “Through this commission, President Ramaphosa is determined that the true facts be established and the matter brought to finality … President Ramaphosa appreciates the anguish and frustration of the families of victims, who have fought for so many years for justice.” The families suing the government include those of four men known as the Cradock Four, who were beaten, strangled with telephone wire, stabbed and shot to death inone of the most notorious killings of South Africa’s apartheid era. In 1999, the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) denied six security officers amnesty for their role in the killings of Fort Calata, Sparrow Mkonto, Matthew Goniwe and Sicelo Mhlauli. The officers were never prosecuted and are all now dead. The families criticised Ramaphosa’s decision that an inquiry should assess their claims for “constitutional damages” – their high court case asked for 167m rand (£7.3m) to fund further investigations and litigation, as well as memorials and public education – and said that their rights were violated. They said in astatementthat an inquiry would have no authority over these areas and would only be able to offer advice. “This fundamental shortcoming was pointed out to the president’s legal team, as well as the fact that it will likely result in the issues remaining unresolved for years. This will perpetuate the pain and trauma that the families and survivors have experienced for many years.” South Africa’s governments have been led by the African National Congress party of Nelson Mandela since the end of apartheid over 30 years ago. In March, Thabo Mbeki, who was president from 1999 to 2008, and the former justice minister Brigitte Mabandla applied to intervene in the families’ high court case. Mbeki hasrepeatedly deniedinterfering in decisions to prosecute apartheid-era cases.",

    "title": "The white Afrikaners lining up to accept Trump’s offer of asylum",
    "article_text": "Kyle believed God was looking out for him when he survived a violent farm robbery inSouth Africaeight years ago with only a black eye and broken ribs. The robbers failed to get the kettle and iron working, so were unable to burn anyone. Then the gun trigger jammed when they tried to shoot Kyle in the spine. “They specifically said they were coming back for this farm … [that] it was their land,” said the 43-year-old, who did not want to use his full name. “Only afterwards, we found out that the guy that stays on the plot was actually killed … the farmhand … I don’t know what his name was.” Kyle, a divorced father of three, is one of thousands of white South Africans hoping to take up Donald Trump’soffer of refugee status, to escape crime and what they allege is discrimination against white people. The Trump administration’ssupport for these claims, whilestopping other new refugee arrivals, has inflamed uncomfortable conversations about how far racial reconciliation still has to go, three decades after the end of white minority rule. The US president’s offer was a “godsend”, said Kyle, now a salesman working remotely for an overseas company: “I’ve got white children, they’re at the bottom of the hiring list here. So, there is no future for them. And the sad thing is they don’t even know what apartheid is.” White Afrikaner governments racially segregated every aspect of life from relationships to where people were allowed to live during apartheid, repressing South Africa’s Black majority while keeping the white minority safe and much better off. South Africa remains deeply unequal, more than 30 years since the system ended. The black South Africanunemployment rate is 46.1%, for example, compared with 9.2% for white people. Affirmative action has created a Black elite, but also nurtured feelings of disfranchisement among some white South Africans. Less than two-thirds of white South Africans agreed that apartheid deprived black people of their livelihoods, v three-quarters of Black South Africans, according to the2023 Reconciliation Barometer, a survey by the Institute for Justice and Reconciliation, a thinktank. Kate Lefko-Everett, the report’s author, said: “The level of contact and interaction between South Africans of different race groups has not really changed substantially.” South Africa’s high violent crime rate – in the last quarter of 2024 there were almost 7,000 murders, according topolice figures– affects everyone. But it has also added to a siege mentality among some white people. Almost two-thirds of white people were considering emigrating, compared with 27% of all South Africans, according to 2022 Afrobarometer data. More than 8,200 people have registered their interest in US refugee status, the New York Timesreportedin March. The US embassy in Pretoria refused to comment. Chilly Chomse, a 43-year-old carpenter, said he wanted to claim asylum for the sake of his four daughters. He moved to Orania, awhite, Afrikaner-only town, for work during the Covid-19 pandemic, but said he was not committed like some residents: “Once you leave this Orania premises, you are still in South Africa … you’re not safe and you can’t remain here 24/7 for the rest of your life.” While some white English-speaking South Africans like Kyle hope the refugee programme will include them too, Trump’s February executiveorderreferred to “ethnic minority Afrikaners”. It claimed a recently signed South African law that allows land expropriation in limited circumstances would enable the government to seize Afrikaners’ property, while state policy was “fuelling disproportionate violence against racially disfavoured landowners” (a longstandingfar-right claim). When Esté Richter, a friend of Chomse’s in Orania, heard about Trump’s refugee policy, she initially did not believe it. “Then I felt that someone has heard us, finally, that someone has heard the cries of Afrikaners,” said Richter, 35, who homeschools her two children and helps her husband with plumbing jobs. “The main reason why we are looking at the refugee programme is in September 2022 my husband’s father was murdered on his farm,” she said. Richter’s mother-in-law was burned with a hot iron, beaten up and abandoned in the bush, but survived. TheAfrikaner rights group AfriForummet Trump allies in the US during his first term,claimingthe South African government was “complicit” in white farmer murders. The group, which has 300,000 members, continues toclaimthat “Afrikaners are the target”. Rudolph Zinn, a University of Limpopo professor, noted South African police data onfarm attacks– whichlisted12 “farming community” murders in the final quarter of 2024 – included black smallholder farms and non-commercial plots. He said: “It’s definitely not linked to any political motive or a specific race. It’s all about the money.” Zinn said imprisoned farm robbers he interviewed said they would tailor their language to instil as much fear as possible to get victims to hand over cash and valuables. “If it’s a white victim, then they would say: ‘I hate you because you’ve taken our land.’ But the very same offender would, when it’s a Black victim, say: ‘You’re a coconut, black on the outside, but inside you’re white.’” Both AfriForum, which promotes staying in South Africa, and the prospective refugees raised the controversialKill the Boersong as a reason for their fears. A South African court ruled in 2022 that the song, sung by the populist, far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party at political rallies, was not meant literally. Others said South Africa risked a “white genocide”, a conspiratorial claim repeated by Trump’sbillionaire, South African-born adviser Elon Musk. Sam Busa, a 60-year-old business consultant of British descent, wants to claim asylum for herself and her three adult sons. She set up an “Amerikaners”websiteand social media pages to disseminate information, and gathered 30,000 signaturesto thank Trumpfor offering refugee status. She said: “We’re in, in my personal opinion, an advanced stage of a genocide potentially unfolding. What that does is it effectively throws out any argument about economic status.”",

    "title": "Trump officials contacted El Salvador president about Kilmar Ábrego García, sources say",
    "article_text": "TheTrump administrationhas been in touch directly with the Salvadorian president Nayib Bukele in recent days about the detention of Kilmar Ábrego García, the man wrongly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, according to two people familiar with the matter. The nature of the discussion and its purpose was not clear because multiple Trump officials have said the administration wasnot interested in his coming backto the US despite the US supreme court ordering it to “facilitate” Ábrego García’s release. The contacts produced no new developments after Bukele rejected the outreach, the people said. The supreme court had ordered the administration to return Ábrego García to the US so that he would face immigration proceedings as he would have, had he not been sent toEl Salvador. The discussions appeared to be an effort by the Trump administration to window dress the underlying legal case and build a paper trail it could reference before the US district judge Paula Xinis, whopreviously ruledthat Donald Trump raising the matter in the Oval Office was insufficient. Ábrego García has since been moved out ofCecot, the mega-prison officials known as the terrorism confinement center, to another prison in El Salvador since the supreme court ruling which the administration has repeatedly tried to manufacture uncertainty around or otherwise misrepresent. The recalcitrance from the US administration to comply has been on display for weeks as senior Trump advisers have become increasingly determined to use it as a case to test the extent of presidential power and its boast that the courts have no practical way to ensure quick compliance with orders. At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said he would “never tell” if he had been in touch with Bukele. CNN earlier reported Rubio has had discussions with Bukele directly. The New York Timesreportedthere had been a diplomatic note sent to Bukele. “I would never tell you that. And you know who else I’ll never tell? A judge,” Rubio said as he sat next to Trump, adding it was “because the conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the president to the united states and the executive branch, not some judge”. And in aninterview with ABC Newsthat aired the night before, the US president himself said he “could” tell El Salvador to return Ábrego García. When it was raised to him that he had the ability to call Bukele and say “send him back right now”, Trump deflected responsibility. “I’m not the one making this decision. We have lawyers that don’t want to do this,” he said. Sign up toThis Week in Trumpland A deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration after newsletter promotion The remarks could yet pose major headaches for the justice department in court as it prepares in the coming weeks to face a series of probing questions from Ábrego García’s lawyers, in writing and in depositions, about the administration’s efforts to comply with the supreme court ruling. By Trump saying that his lawyers had told him not to call Bukele, it could open the department up to bruising questions about whether they were deliberately flouting the order and place them in threat of contempt. After a closed-door hearing on Wednesday in federal district court in Maryland, Xinis refused the justice department’s request to extend a pause in discovery proceedings, ordering it to respond to questions from Ábrego García’s lawyers about his detention by this Friday. Xinis also said in anexpedited deposition schedulethat Ábrego García’s lawyers could interview up to six administration officials – including Robert Cerna, a top official at Ice, and Joseph Mazarra, the acting general counsel of the Department of Homeland Security – by next Thursday.",

    "title": "Powerful earthquake could raise Pacific north-west sea levels ‘dramatically’ – study",
    "article_text": "A massive earthquake in the Pacific north-west could rapidly transform areas of the coast from northernCaliforniatoWashington, causing swaths of land to quickly sink, “dramatically” raising sea level and increasing the flood risk to communities. That’s according to anew study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examining the potential impact of the “big one”, a powerful quake along the Cascadia fault that stretches from Canada to California. The region has long braced for such an event, which would unleash a majortsunami, causing widespread destruction and potentially killing tens of thousands of people. A majorearthquakecould cause land along the coast to sink more than six feet and significantly expand the coastal floodplain with “lasting impacts to coastal populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems”, according the study. There is a 15% chance of an earthquake greater than 8.0 magnitude on the fault in the next 50 years, the study states. “The expansion of the coastal floodplain following a Cascadia subduction zone earthquake has not been previously quantified, and the impacts to land use could significantly increase the timeline to recovery,” said Tina Dura, the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of geosciences at Virginia Tech,tolda university publication. While climate-driven sea level rise happens gradually, these changes would unfold in an instant and persist over decades to centuries, Dura and the study’s other authors write. The most significant impacts would occur in “densely populated” parts of southern Washington, northern Oregon and northernCalifornia. And if the next major earthquake took place in 2100 – there is a 29% chance of one greater than 8.0 magnitude by then – with climate-driven sea level rise, some “low-lying” areas along the fault might never recover, according to the study. The authors wrote that they hoped the findings could support decision-makers and coastal communities better prepare for hazards caused by an earthquake and climate-driven sea-level rise. “Preparing for these compound hazards can minimize long-term damage, ensure resilient communities, and protect critical coastal ecosystems from permanent degradation,” the authors wrote. The last great earthquake along the Cascadia Subduction Zone took place in 1700 and brought sudden sea level rise of more than six feet in minutes and generated a huge tsunami that destroyed seaside settlements and created effects seen as far as Japan. Recent research suggests that a 9.0 magnitude quake on the Cascadia subduction zone could lead to more than 30,000 deaths, 170,000 damaged or destroyed structures on the coast, and economic impacts of more than $81bn. A 2022studyfound that a tsunami caused by a major earthquake could exceed 200ft high.",

    "article_text": "Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, said that if Kilmar Ábrego García was sent back to the US, the DonaldTrump administration“would immediately deport him again”. Noem repeated White House assertions about Ábrego García, a Salvadorian man who the Trump administration has admitted was mistakenly deported from Maryland last month, in a new interview withCBS. “[Ábrego García] is not under our control.

If he were to be brought back to the United States of America, we would immediately deport him again,” Noem said of the 29-year-old who entered the US illegally around 2011 after fleeing gang violence. Ábrego García was subsequentlyaffordeda federal protection order against deportation to El Salvador. Despite the order, on 15 March, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials deported Ábrego García to El Salvador where he was held in the Center for Terrorism Confinement, acontroversial mega-prison. Though the Trump administration admitted that Ábrego García’s deportation was an“administrative error”, it has repeatedly cast him as an MS-13 gang member on television – a claim his wife, a US citizen, and his attorneys staunchly reject. Ábrego García has no criminal record in the US,according tocourt documents. Since Ábrego García’s deportation, the Trump administration has refused to bring him back to the US – despite the supreme courtunanimously orderingit to “facilitate” his release. Trump officials claim that US courts lack jurisdiction over the matter because Ábrego García is a Salvadorian national and no longer in the US. Noem asserted the Trump administration’s claims to CBS, saying: “President Trump and his administration has adhered to the court and respects the court and its decision,” adding, “This individual is not under the United States of America’s jurisdiction and he is not one of our citizens. He is home in his home country. And that’s up to that country to decide what to do.” Last week, a federal judgeaccusedthe White House of “bad faith” in the case, arguing that “defendants have sought refuge behind vague and unsubstantiated assertions of privilege, using them as a shield to obstruct discovery and evade compliance with this court’s orders”. Yet, Noem maintains that the Trump administration spends “hours and hours” building cases against alleged gang members. Upon being asked about the administration’s claims against individuals who have been deported without due process, the homeland security secretary said: “Obviously, we’re relying on the expertise of our investigators, our teams, double-checking, triple-checking, going through the paperwork, making sure that we have done everything absolutely correctly.” Noem also accused federal judges who have issued court orders the Trump administration dislikes as “activist judges”. “I’m sure that these judges will continue to challenge every single thing that this administration does. We have several activist judges across the country,” she said, despite some of the judges who haveruled againstTrump’s immigration policies being nominated by Republicans. Earlier this month, J Harvie Wilkinson, a Ronald Reagan-appointee and conservative appellate judge,calledthe Trump administration’s claims in Ábrego García’s case “shocking”, saying: “This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.”",

    "title": "Outrage in Brazil over reports of new red national football jersey",
    "article_text": "“Our flag willneverbe red!” rightwing Brazilians took to chanting during the heyday of the left-bashing former president Jair Bolsonaro. But their football shirts soon might be, amid incendiary reports that the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) is considering introducing a crimson jersey for the national team ahead of the 2026World Cup. Those claims have sparked predictable outrage among hardcore rightwingers who consider red the anti-patriotic colour of Brazil’s leftwing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, his Workers’ party (PT) and the Landless Workers’ Movement (MST). “Our team’s shirt will never be red – and neither will our country!” thundered Romeu Zema, a conservative governor hoping to claim the mantle of Bolsonaro, who faces jail for allegedly masterminding a failed rightwing coup after losing the 2022 election. Ina social media video, Zema hurled a mock-up of the red shirt on to the ground in theatrical disgust. Bolsonaro’s politician son, Flávio Bolsonaro, said the supposed plans needed “vehemently repudiating”, insisting: “Our flag isn’t red – and it never will be.” But Bolsonaristas are not the only ones up in arms about the reported attempt to swap Brazil’s blue away shirt – in use since the country won the first of its five World Cup, in 1958 – for a red one. Football purists of all political stripes have clobbered the “leaked” plans since they surfaced on Monday ina viral reportby the football website Footy Headlines. The idea has proved so controversial that the CBF was forced to deny it on Tuesday insisting online images of the red jersey were not official and that it remained committed to yellow and blue shirts. The kit for next year’s World Cup had yet to be designed in partnership with Brazil’s official kit supplier Nike, the CBF claimed. Walter Casagrande, a Lula-voting former player and commentator who is associated with Brazil’s left and pro-democracy movement, called the scheme “idiocy”. Sports writer Paulo Vinícius Coelhosaidthe move showed “a complete lack of sense” and was almost certainly commercially driven. Galvão Bueno, Brazil’s most famous TV commentator, called the idea “a crime” and a “gigantic insult” to the glorious history of a national team which has won more World Cups than any other country. Some leftwing Brazilians were more receptive to the idea of a crimson kit. Over the past decade the country’s iconic yellow jersey has becomea symbol of the far rightand is regularly worn at pro-Bolsonaro rallies. Many progressivesnow refuse to wear it. Ina pro-red shirt manifesto, columnist Milly Lacombe declared that she would wear the jersey with pride and rejected the outbreak of “collective hysteria” over the mooted shirt. “Red is a strong colour that stands for revolution, change, transformation, blood, struggle, life, death, rebirth,” she wrote. Juca Kfouri, a left-leaning football writer who is among those who shun the yellow shirt,also rejected the “bad taste” change, arguing that a red shirt would further fuel the toxic politics swirling around the national team’s attire and divide supporters. “Red doesn’t have anything to do with Brazil,” Kfouri said, although he noted that Brazil took its name from a redwood tree calledpau-brasil(brazilwood in English) and, in the early 19th century,had red in its first flag. Kfouri suspected the red shirt story was “a trial balloon” devised to see how the money-making ruse went down with fans. “Just like politicians sometimes leak a policy, wait to see how the social networks react and, depending on that reaction, give up or move ahead,” he said. For the CBF, the hoo-ha was also a helpful diversion as it sought to shift attention away from its apparent failure to recruit the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, as Brazil’s next manager anda compromising exposéin a Brazilian magazine. “It distracts from the things that really matter,” Kfouri said.",

    "title": "Venezuelan detainees at Texas center spell out SOS with their bodies",
    "article_text": "Detainees at the Bluebonnet immigrant detention center in the small city of Anson,Texas, sent the outside world a message this week: SOS. With a Reuters drone flying nearby, 31 men formed the letters in the dirt yard of the facility on Monday. Ten days earlier, dozens ofVenezuelandetainees at the center were given notices byimmigrationofficialsthat alleged they were members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and subject to deportation under a wartime law,according to documents shown to Reuters, recorded video calls and court proceedings. The families of seven detainees interviewed by Reuters said they were not gang members and that they refused to sign the document. Nevertheless, hours later on 18 April, they were loaded onto a bus bound for nearby Abilene Regional airport, according to the American Civil Liberties Union and family members, before the bus wasturned aroundand sent back to the detention center. That night, the supreme courttemporarily blockedtheir deportations. The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment on the halted deportations. It was a reprieve for the group of Venezuelans detained at Bluebonnet, who still face being potentially sent toCecot, the notoriousmaximum security prison in El Salvadorwhere the Trump administration has sent at least 137 Venezuelans under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, if the supreme court lifts the block. The Bluebonnet facility, located 200 miles (322km) west of Dallas, is privately run by the Management and Training Corporation under a contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Named after the state flower ofTexas, it has held an average of 846 detainees a day in fiscal year 2025, according to Ice detention data. Denied access to the Bluebonnet facility by Ice, Reuters flew a small plane over the center last week as well as a drone nearby on 28 April to gather aerial images of the detainees being held there. Some of the detainees photographed by Reuters were wearing red jumpsuits designating them as high risk. Millan was moved to Bluebonnet in mid-April from the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia, where he had been held since he was arrested by immigration agents in the Atlanta suburbs on 12 March, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official. Reuters could not find a criminal record for Millan, who had been working in construction. The DHS official said Millan was a “documented” member ofTren de Aragua, but provided no evidence. The DHS official said Ice detained Escalona in January 2025, after he was arrested by local Texas police for evading arrest in a vehicle. He arrived at Bluebonnet after he was returned from the US migrant detention facility in Guantánamo Bay in February. The DHS official said Escalona was a “self-admitted” Tren de Aragua member but did not provide evidence of the claim. During a phone interview from Bluebonnet, Escalona said he had no ties to Tren de Aragua or any gang. He was a police officer inVenezuela, he said. When they detained him, US authorities took his phone and he suspects they saw photos of him making hand gestures that he said were common in Venezuela. “They’re making false accusations about me,” he said. “I don’t belong to any gang.” Escalona said that he has asked to return voluntarily to Venezuela but was denied. “I fear for my life here,” he said. “I want to go to Venezuela.” Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have come to the United States over the past few years, fleeing economic collapse and what critics call an authoritarian crackdown under President Nicolás Maduro. Under the administration of Joe Biden, many were given temporary humanitarian protections that theTrump administrationis trying to revoke. Since their aborted deportation, the men have been on edge, their families say. In Millan’s dorm, he and some of the other Venezuelan men take turns sleeping so that they can alert family members if immigration officers come to deport them, according to Millan’s wife, who asked not to be named for fear of being targeted by immigration officials. One day last week, he told her the men in the dorm refused to go out into the yard because they were worried they would be put on another bus and sent toEl Salvador. “He is desperate,” Millan’s wife said. “He told me that when he walked out onto the field, he sat down and looked at the sky and asked God to get him out of there soon.” In one recent video call, Millan told his wife that they have not been given much food, and he tries to sleep more so that he is not so hungry, she said, something that other detainees’ relatives echoed. A spokesperson for Management and Training Corporation, which runs the facility, said: “All detainees housed at Bluebonnet receive meals based on a menu that has been approved by a certified dietitian, ensuring the recommended daily caloric intake is met.” In a statement, DHS said it “uses multiple strategies to manage capacity while maintaining compliance with federal standards and our commitment to humane treatment”. On Saturday, animmigration official visited Escalona’s dorm and answered some of the detainees’ questions, according to an audio recording of the visit obtained by Reuters. The men, talking over each other frantically, wanted to know why the government was trying to send them to El Salvador and what was happening with their immigration court dates. The official explained that the US had tried to remove them under the Alien Enemies Act, which was a separate process from their scheduled immigration court hearings. “If he gets removed under the Alien Enemies Act, then that court date doesn’t exist, he’ll never have that court date,” the official said in English to someone who was translating. Several of the men wanted to know how it was possible for them to be classified as “alien enemies” when they were not gang members and had committed no crime. “If I don’t have a criminal record in the three countries in which I have lived in, how are they going to send me to El Salvador?” one of the men in the recording asked. Reuters was not immediately able to establish his identity. The official said he was not involved in the intelligence gathering. Several of the men had court hearings in their immigration cases last week and advocates scrambled to find lawyers for them. Millan has a pending asylum case and his next hearing is scheduled for May 1, unless he is sent to El Salvador before then.",

    "title": "Trump hails achievements of first 100 days despite polls revealing American disapproval on economy – as it happened",
    "article_text": "President touts ‘most successful 100 days of any administration’ at rally in Warren, Michigan. This blog is now closed. Trump is speaking now ata rally in Warren, Michiganand he has fulsome praise for what he calls “the most successful 100 days of any administration in the history of our country”. A raft of opinion pollsreleased this weekshows that a majority of Americans disagree, strongly, expressing deep disapproval of his performance as president, and particularly his handling of the economy, which has been severely damaged by his chaotic imposition of tariffs against nearly even nation, except Russia. A newNPR/PBS News/Marist pollreleased on Tuesday shows that 45% of those asked to grade Trump’s performance as president gave him an F, 7% a D, 8% a C, 17% a B, and 23% an A. Half of independents said Trump deserves an F, and only a slim majority of Republicans gave him an A. This brings our coverage of day 100 of Donald Trump’s second term to a close. We will be back in the morning, as the next of 1,000-plus days dawn, but in the meantime we leave you with this list of the day’s developments: AtDonald Trump’s rally in Michigan, his supporters reacted to the screening of a long video, set to ominous music, showing the harsh treatment of men he had deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador without due process by chanting\": “USA! USA!” As Trump defended his broadly unpopular handling of the economy, he criticized Fed chairJerome Powell, saying: “I have a Fed person who’s not really doing a good job, but I won’t say that.” The businessman president who used bankruptcy law to rescue his failed enterprises six times added: “I know much more about interest rates than he does”. Trump mistakenly attacked the Michigan representativeJohn James, calling the Republican he had endorsed “a lunatic” for trying to impeach him. That was someone else. Trump supporters praised by the president at a rally included the former member of a violent cult who founded Blacks for Trump, and a retired autoworker who once told people to read David Duke’s “honest and fair” book about race. The US Department of Justice has begun the first criminal prosecutions of immigrants for entering anewly declaredmilitary buffer zone created along the border with Mexico, according to court filings. Trump called Amazon executive chairJeff Bezoson Tuesday morning to complain about areportthat the company planned to display prices that show the impact of tariffs. Trump told reporters later that Bezos “was very nice, he was terrific” during their call, and “he solved the problem very quickly”. The Trump administration has reached one trade deal already but won’t tell us who with until that country’s prime minister and parliament approve the deal, the commerce secretaryHoward Lutnicksaidtold CNBC. The United States proposed sending up to 500 Venezuelan immigrants with alleged ties to the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador as the two governments sought to reach an agreement on the use of the nation’s notorious mega-prison, according to emailsseen by CNN. Donald Trumpsigneda proclamationon Tuesday that offers temporary relief to automakers from the 25% tariffs he imposed in March ina previous proclamation. The measure gives automakers a break for two years to give them time to move auto production back to the United States. Doug Emhoff, the husband ofKamala Harris, accused the Trump administration of turning “one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue”, after he and otherJoe Bidenappointees were removed from the board of theUS Holocaust Memorial Museum. Pete Hegsethhas abruptly banished the Pentagon’s Women, Peace and Security program as part of his crusade against diversity and equity, dismissing it as a “woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative” despite it being a signatureDonald Trumpachievement from his first term. Donald Trumpsurprised Michigan’s governor,Gretchen Whitmer, by inviting her to speak during his address at Selfridge air national guard base on Tuesday afternoon. One notable feature of Tuesday’s Trump rally in Michigan is that it featured cameos from supporters of the president who have been fixtures of his campaign rallies for nearly a decade. Early in the speech, as he pointed to familiar faces, Trump recognized theFront Row Joes, a group ofdiehard supporters akin to groupieswho have traveled the country to attend dozens of his rallies. He also shouted outBlake Marnell, a supporter who wears a “brick suit” in homage to Trump’s border wall andwitnessedthe assassination attempt last year in Butler, Pennsylvania. “There’s my friend, Blacks for Trump. I like that guy. He follows me”,the president saidpointing into the crowd. “We love you, your whoile group has been so supportice over the years, I want to thank you”. “Everyone thinks I pay you a fortune”, Trump added. “I don’t even know who the hell he is, I just like him”. AsI reported in 2020, the “Blacks for Trump” founder is Maurice Symonette, a.k.a. Michael the Black Man,a former member of a violent cultwho postsanti-Semitic screedsandracist conspiracy theoriesonline, and yet has been a featured member of the audience at Trump campaign events since 2016. Symonette was known as Maurice Woodsideuntil 1992, when the black supremacist cult leader he followed, Yahweh ben Yahweh, was jailed for leadinga conspiracy to murder14 white people in initiation rites. Woodside was among the Miami-based Nation of Yahweh cult members charged in two of the murders, but he was acquitted. After the trial, he changed his last name to Symonette, which was his father’s surname, before eventually reinventing himself asMichael the Black Man. Onhis website, Symonette makes a variety of bizarre claims, including that Omar and other prominent Black Democrats, artists and athletes — including former President Barack Obama, Jesse Jackson, Spike Lee, Colin Kaepernick, and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. — are “DECEVING [sic] FAKE BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY INDIANS!” In a sermon now deleted from YouTube, he claimed that the Senate is controlled by a secret underground of “Cherokee Mormons.” Later in the speech, Trump called to the stage another supporter who has been a figure at ralliessince 2016:BrianPannebecker, a retired auto worker who told the crowd, “We have the greatest President, probably not just in our lifetimes, but in the history of this country!” Pannebecker’s brief cameo wasclipped and sharedon social media by an official White House account, despite the fact that it wasfirst reporteda decade ago that he had written a glowing review of David Duke’s book, “My Awakening”, in which he called the former Klansman’s work “honest and fair”. After reading the book, Pannebecker wrote in his online review, people “will be able to discuss the issue of race without the fear of being labeled a racist because you will have the facts and the truth on your side”. A federal judge in New Jersey ruled on Tuesday thatMahmoud Khalil, the recent Columbia graduate and Palestine solidarity activist who was detained on 8 March in his apartment building in New York and moved to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention center in Louisiana, can move forward with his lawsuit claiming the government is unlawfully detaining him for his political views. “This Court has habeas jurisdiction over this case” JudgeMichael Farbiarzwrote. “And as set out in this Opinion, that jurisdiction is intact. It has not been removed.” “As I am now caring for our barely week-old son, it is even more urgent that we continue to speak out for Mahmoud’s freedom, and for the freedom of all people being unjustly targeted for advocating against Israel’s genocide in Gaza,”Noor Abdalla,Khalil’s wife said in a statement. “I am relieved at the court’s finding that my husband can move forward with his case in federal court. This is an important step towards securing Mahmoud’s freedom. But there is still more work to be done. I will continue to strongly advocate for my husband, so he can come home to our family, and feel the pure joy all parents know of holding your first-born child in your arms.” “The court has affirmed that the federal government does not have the unreviewable authority to trample on our fundamental freedoms,”Noor Zafarof the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project said in a statment emailed to reporters. “This is a huge step forward for Mahmoud and for the other students and scholars that theTrump administrationhas unlawfully detained in retaliation for their political speech, and a rebuke of attempts by the executive to use immigration laws to weaken First Amendment protections for political gain.” The US Department of Justice has begun the first criminal prosecutions of migrants for entering anewly declaredmilitary buffer zone created along the border with Mexico, according to court filings, Reuters reports. At least 28 migrants were charged were charged in federal court in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on Monday for crossing into the 170-mile-long, 60-foot-wide militarized buffer zone patrolled by active-duty US troops. Pete Hegseth, the defense secretary, visited the area last week and said it was the start of a plan to extend the buffer zone along the border. “The reason we are here today, at almost the 100-day mark of President Trump’s administration is because you’re standing on a National Defense Area, this may as well be a military base” Hegseth said in a defense department social media video posted online. “Any illegal attempting to enter that zone is entering a military base.” “As New Mexicans, we have deep concerns about the enhanced militarization of our borderlands communities” the American Civil Liberties Union of New Mexico ina statementlast week. “The expansion of military detention powers in the ‘New Mexico National Defense Area’ – also known as the ‘border buffer zone’ – represents a dangerous erosion of the constitutional principle that the military should not be policing civilians.” The idea of militarizing the border has long been a dream of far-right politicians, like the failed Arizona senate candidateBlake Masters, whodevoted a campaign adto the idea in 2022. Trump has left the stage, and his supporters are filing out of the venue, which we are told by the pool reporter there has a capacity of 4,000, but was only about half or three-fifths full. One bizarre moment early in the speech that we would have heard a lot more about had the speaker been Joe Biden was when Trump tore into RepresentativeJohn James, telling the crowd the Michigan Republican he had endorsed and campaigned with was “a lunatic”. “Some guy that I never heard of, John James. Is he a congressman? This guy? He said, he said, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to start the impeachment of Donald Trump”, Trump told the crowd. Many of his supporters in the room, and watching at home, were probably aware that the president, who celebrates his 79th birthday in six weeks, had confused James with RepresentativeShri Thanedar, the Michigan Democrat who did, in fact,introducearticles of impeachment against Trump on Monday. Trump has just finished speaking and departed to the strains of the Village People anthem YMCA. He spoke for about 90 minutes in what was a fairly typical rally speech and even told the crowd early on, “I miss you guys. I miss the campaign”. If there has been one constant theme throughout his time in office, it has been that he clearly loves the adulation of the crowd that comes from making campaign speeches far more than the work of governing. Trump justmade the entirely false claimthat, “for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction”. “For the first time ever, in, I think, ever, that they’re saying the country is headed in the right direction”, Trump added. “Has never happened before”. It is not clear why the president thinks this is true, or indeed if he does, but it is very clearly not true. Inthe latest nationwide poll, conducted from April 17-21 for the Associated Press by National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, the overwhelming majority of Americans said that the country is headed in the wrong direction (62% vs 37%). Thelatest Gallup poll, from earlier in April showed that just 34% were satisfied with the way things were going in the US, and 64% were dissatisfied. While those numbers were markedly better than last summer, when satisfaction was as low as 18% and dissatisfaction reached 80%, the majority still clearly says the country is headed in the wrong direction. It is also not true to say that American have never previously said the country was going in the right direction. Gallup found that 50% of the public said that things were going n the right direction at this point in George W. Bush’s first term in 2001. There was even more optimism in 1999, during the presidency of Bill Clinton, when the right direction number reached 70%. Defending his handling of the economy, which has been severely damaged by his trade war and the prospect of rising inflation, Trump justtold his supportersin Michigan: “Inflation is basically down, and interest rates came down despite the fact that I have a Fed person who’s not really doing a good job, but I won’t say that. I want to be very nice. I want to be very nice and respectful to the Fed. You’re not supposed to criticize the Fed; you’re supposed to let him do his own thing, but I know much more about interest rates than he does, believe me.” At his rally in Michigan, Donald Trump’s supporters reacted to the screening of a long video, set to ominous music, showing the harsh treatment of men he had deported from the United States to a prison in El Salvador without due process by chanting “USA! USA\"!” The video, firstpostedon Elon Musk’s social media platform X by Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in March, shows 238 men accused of being members of the Venezuelan criminal organization, Tren de Aragua, being taken from planes and confined in the Terrorism Confinement Center, known as Cecot. The images of the abusive treatment clearly delighted Trump, and his supporters. The fact that the men were not given an opportunity to contest the accusation that they are members of either Tren de Aragua or the Salvadoran gang MS-13, seemed not to trouble Trump. Instead, he accused Democrats of “racing to the defense of some of the most violent savages on the face of the Earth”. “They’re racing to the courts to help them”, Trump claimed, ignoring the fact that his own administration has admitted in court that at least one of the man deported,Kilmar Ábrego García, was sent there by mistake, in violation of an order issued during hjis previous term in office. The families of other men seen in the video have pointed to multiple errors in the interpretation of their tattoos as proof that they are gang members. Trump is speaking now ata rally in Warren, Michiganand he has fulsome praise for what he calls “the most successful 100 days of any administration in the history of our country”. A raft of opinion pollsreleased this weekshows that a majority of Americans disagree, strongly, expressing deep disapproval of his performance as president, and particularly his handling of the economy, which has been severely damaged by his chaotic imposition of tariffs against nearly even nation, except Russia. A newNPR/PBS News/Marist pollreleased on Tuesday shows that 45% of those asked to grade Trump’s performance as president gave him an F, 7% a D, 8% a C, 17% a B, and 23% an A. Half of independents said Trump deserves an F, and only a slim majority of Republicans gave him an A. “Today, the Prime Minister, Mark Carney, spoke with the President of the United States, Donald J Trump”,a statementfrom the Canadian prime minister’s office said. “President Trump congratulated Prime Minister Carney on his recent election. The leaders agreed on the importance ofCanadaand the United States working together – as independent, sovereign nations – for their mutual betterment. To that end, the leaders agreed to meet in person in the near future.” Carney’s center-left Liberal party won Monday’s general election thanks to a wave of resentment about Trump’s threats to annex Canada and the imposition of tariffs on Canadian imports. “As I’ve been warning for months, America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country”, Carney said in his victory speech late Monday. As the crowd jeered and shouted “Never!” Carney agreed. “These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never, never, ever happen”. As Canadian went to the polls on Monday, Trumppostedwhat seemed like an endorsement of Carney’s rival, the Conservative party leaderPierre Poilievre, suggesting that the pro-Trump politician would help bring about Canada’s absorption into the United States. When the votes were counted, however, Poilievre, who had a commanding lead in the polls before Trump started talking about annexing the country, had not only failed to lead the Conservatives to power, he had evenlost his own seat. Despite Carney’s office claiming on Tuesday that he and Trump had agreed to work together “as independent, sovereign nations”, White House officials insisted that Trump is still serious about his stated desire to make Canada the 51st US state. White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittwas asked during a briefing for rightwing influencers if Trump was “truthing or trolling” when he says that he wants to annex Canada, and Greenland. “Trump truthing, all the way”,she replied. “And the Canadians would benefit greatly, let me tell you that”. Donald Trumpsurprised Michigan’s governor,Gretchen Whitmer, by inviting her to speak during his address at Selfridge air national guard base on Tuesday afternoon. Trump, who came to Macomb county, Michigan, for an evening rally to celebrate what he calls the historic accomplishments of the first 100 days of his second term, despite widespread disapproval of his actions by a majority of Americans in a series of polls, announced a new fighter jet mission for the base outside Detroit, easing fears that the installation would be closed. For decades, Trump said, the base has “stood as a crucial pillar of North American air defense”. “In recent years, many in Michigan have feared for the future of the base. They’ve been calling everybody, but the only one that mattered is Trump,” he said. “Today I have come in person to lay to rest any doubt about Selfridge’s future.” Whitmer’s political standing was damaged earlier this month when she wasphotographed hiding her facefrom photographers in the Oval Office after Trump invited her to be present as he signed executive orders, two of which demanded investigations of critics who had served in his first administration. On Tuesday, she was careful to beginher impromptu remarksby saying that she had not expected to speak, and then praised the decision as a boon for the local economy, but did not praise Trump, as Republicans he invited to make remarks did. Donald Trumpsigneda proclamationon Tuesday that offers temporary relief to automakers from the 25% tariffs he imposed in March ina previous proclamation. The White Houseconfirmedto Fox Business earlier that the new measure would give automakers a break for two years to give them time to move auto production back to the United States. The proclamation outlines a series of technical changes to the tariff regime, “to modify the system imposed in Proclamation 10908 by reducing duties assessed on automobile parts accounting for 15 percent of the value of an automobile assembled in the United States for 1 year and equivalent to 10 percent of that value for an additional year”. As we reported earlier, the changes will allow carmakers with US factories to reduce the amount they pay in import taxes on foreign parts, using a formula tied to how many cars they sell and the price. Doug Emhoff, the husband ofKamala Harris, accused the Trump administration of turning “one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue”, after he and otherJoe Bidenappointees were removed from the board of theUS Holocaust Memorial Museum. Emhoff, who is Jewish and spoke passionately against the rising tide of antisemitism during his time as the second gentleman, said he was informed on Tuesday that he had been removed from the museum’s council. “Let me be clear: Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized. To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous – and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve,” he said. “No divisive political decision will ever shake my commitment to Holocaust remembrance and education or to combatting hate and antisemitism. I will continue to speak out, to educate, and to fight hate in all its forms – because silence is never an option.” The New York Times reported that theTrump administrationalso firedRon Klain, Biden’s first chief of staff;Susan Rice, national security adviser toBarack Obama, and Biden’s top domestic policy adviser; andTom Perez, the former labor secretary who was a senior adviser to the former president. Trump defeated Harris, then the US vice-president, in November. Emhoff’s law firm recently struck a deal with the Trump administration to avert an executive order targeting its practice, a decision Emhoff is reported to have voiced his disagreement with. Pete Hegsethhas abruptly banished the Pentagon’s Women, Peace and Security program as part of his crusade against diversity and equity, dismissing it as a “woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative” despite it being a signatureDonald Trumpachievement from his first term. In apost on X, the US defense secretary wrote: “This morning, I proudly ENDED the ‘Women, Peace & Security’ (WPS) program inside the [Department of Defense]. WPS is yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops – distracting from our core task: WAR-FIGHTING.” Hegseth added that the program was “pushed by feminists and left-wing activists”, claiming: “Politicians fawn over it; troops HATE it.” But the decision is raising some eyebrows, as the initiative was established during Trump’s first administration when he signed the Women, Peace and Security Act in 2017, making the US the first country in the world to codify standalone legislation on the matter. The Trump campaign even courted female voters byciting the initiativeas one of its top accomplishments for women on its website. Attempting to square this circle, Hegsethlater claimedthe Biden administration had “distorted & weaponized” the original program. “Biden ruined EVERYTHING, including ‘Women, Peace & Security,’” he insisted. The Senate has confirmed billionaire investment bankerWarren Stephensto be ambassador to the UK, backingDonald Trump’s nominee by 59 to 39. Stephens is chair, president and CEO of Stephens Inc, a privately owned financial services firm headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas. He is a longtime contributor to Republican candidates, including Trump, having donated millions of dollars to support Trump’s campaigns and 2025 inauguration fund. Asked about negotiations with Congress over tax legislation, Trump said: “The Republicans are with us. I think we’ve got the big beautiful deal that’s moving along, and I think we’re going to have it taken care of.” He added: A very important element that we’re working on now, more important than anything with the border in good shape, is the fact that we want to get, and very importantly, the big beautiful new deal. If we get that done, that’s the biggest thing … And I think we’re going to get it done. We have great Republican support. If the Democrats blocked it, you’d have a 60% tax increase. I don’t think that’s going to happen. We have great support from Republicans. … The next period of time, I think, my biggest focus will be on Congress, the deal that we’re working on. That would be the biggest bill in the history of our country in terms of tax cuts and regulation cuts, and other things.",

    "title": "Chinese e-commerce exports to US plummet by 65% in face of tariffs",
    "article_text": "Exports to the US from Chinese online shops such as Temu and Shein have plunged in the face of Donald Trump’s trade war, as shipping from China to the EU has increased. Official Chinese data showed its total e-commerce shipping to the US dropped 65% by volume in the first three months of the year, but rose by 28% in Europe. The sharp fall comes amid reports that the fast-fashion discount platformSheinis considering a restructuring in the US to circumnavigate tariffs. According to the Financial Times, one workaround would be for Shein to move production from China to countries not hit by US tariffs. Such a move could put itsupcoming London stock exchange listingon hold. The figures predate Trump’s April announcement that he wasscrapping the tariff exemption on parcel imports worth up to $800 (£598)from 2 May. But they highlight how China’s e-commerce platforms have diverted marketing efforts to Europe in anticipation of US tariffs to come. From May, US consumers may experience something akin to the Brexit effect that made many low-value imports prohibitively expensive for UK online shoppers, because of the overnight change in trading rules with the EU. Punishing US tariffs of 145% on Chinese goods have already come into force, sending prices rocketing on both Temu and Shein. Temu is passing on nearly all its import taxes to the consumer, with the average price of 100 products in two categories – toys and games, and health and beauty – jumping by more than 40% in the last two weeks, according to analysis by Bloomberg. CNBC reported that a summer dress listed on Temu for $18.47 (£13.83) will cost $44.68 after $26.21 in import charges are added to the bill – a 142% surcharge. Meanwhile, the cost of a child’s swimsuit almost triples from $12.44 to $31.12 when the $18.68 import charge is taken into account. A handheld vacuum cleaner listed at $16.93 now costs $40.11 when factoring in the additional fee. On Tuesday, the Chinese government sent a defiant video message to Trump, warning it would not “kneel down” in the face of the punitive tariffs. “Bowing to a bully is like drinking poison to quench thirst,” it said in the English-language statement. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion The tariffs are intended to revive US manufacturing, but look set to hit businesses and consumers hard. Walmart is among the US companies trying to hold on to market share by telling its Chinese suppliers it will shoulder the import taxes, according to theSouth China Morning Post. Even the US-based Amazon, which hosts many Chinese third-party sellers, has been scathed by rumours of how it planned to respond to the tariffs. After areport saidit would break down prices for consumers to show the tariff cost, the company wascalled “hostile and political”by a White House spokesperson, before Trump called Jeff Bezos personally. Amid fears that such a move could directly illustrate the impact of the trade war on consumers’ pockets, Trump said: “Jeff Bezos was very nice. He was terrific. He solved the problem very quickly. Good guy.” Amazon said it had “considered the idea” of listing import charges but that the plan had been misreported, as itwas never approved. Temu and Shein were approached for comment.",

    "title": "Company supplying critical EV metal ‘did not disclose’ Erin Brockovich pollutant in drinking water",
    "article_text": "One of Indonesia’s largest nickel-mining companies, which supplies a mineral critical to the global electric car industry, did not tell the public that local drinking water was polluted, according to documents seen by the Guardian. Indonesia has become the world’s biggest producer of nickel, used in the production of wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. But observers have voiced concerns that regulatory oversight in the country hasfailed to keep up with the rush to develop minesto satisfy booming global demand. Leaked documents seen by the Guardian suggest a source of drinking water close to a$1bn (£800m) mining projectowned by the Indonesia-based Harita Group on remote Obi Island, was contaminated with unsafe levels of hexavalent chromium (Cr6), the cancer-causing chemical more widely known for its role in theErin Brockovich story and film. Cr6 cancause liver damage, reproductive problems and developmental harmwhen ingested or inhaled. Long-term exposure through drinking water has alsobeenlinked to stomach cancer. Evidence has shown thatCr6 in drinking water can bea result of industrial processes. The leak comes after aGuardian investigation into pollutionat the site in 2022 was disputed by the mining company, which extracts and processes nickel for use in EV batteries. For the 2022 investigation, water samples collected from a spring in the village of Kawasi, less than 200 metres from the mining site, were tested at government-certified laboratories and suggested high levels of contamination fromcarcinogenic Cr6of 60 parts per billion (ppb). Themaximum contaminant levelallowed by law in Indonesia is 50ppb. In response to the Guardian’s original investigation, a Harita company said its own results had shown that the spring water was suitable for consumption and met the quality standards set by the Indonesian government. However, the leaked documents and emails suggest a Harita company found the Cr6 values in Kawasi spring, used as drinking water by villagers, in excess of Indonesian quality standards just one day after its statement to the contrary. It then found even higher values in subsequent days. It does not appear to have made this data public. The Guardian was given a chance to review the material by theOrganized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project(OCCRP) in a joint investigation with theGecko Project, a non-profit newsroom. The material suggests tests of Kawasi’s spring water undertaken by a Harita company found Cr6 concentrations of 70ppb on 1 February 2022, one day after the Harita company provided its statement to the Guardian. On 7 February 2022 a value of 128ppb was recorded. A weekly environment report from December 2022 reported that values of 140ppb had been recorded at the spring. Harita has not responded to requests for comment on the leaked material and test results but in apress release published on its websitethis month, the company said it conducts periodic monitoring of the water at Kawasi spring to ensure it is safe and uncontaminated. Environmental health experts have said the test results suggest a significant issue with pollution. Matthew Baird, an environmental lawyer based in south-east Asia, said: “These are figures that need to be taken into account not just by the company, but also the Indonesian government.” “Nickel is meant to be one of the transition metals [to move to a green, low-carbon economy] and we require a just transition to ensure the protection of the environment, human rights and the community,” he said.",

    "title": "China manufacturing activity plummets amid Trump tariff war",
    "article_text": "China’s factory activity slowed in April, with Beijing blaming “sharp changes” in the global economy as it fights a widening trade war with the US. Punishing tariffs introduced by Donald Trump that reached 145% on many Chinese products came into force in April, and Beijing responded with125% dutieson imports from the US. Chinese exports soared more than 12% last month as businesses rushed toget ahead of the punishing tariffs. The impact of the measures began to show in official data on Wednesday, with the purchasing managers’ index – a key measure of industrial output – falling to 49.0 in April, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the lowest reading since December 2023. Anything below the 50-point mark signifies a contraction. The reading for April represented a steeper decline than the 49.7 forecast in a Bloomberg survey. It was down from March’s 50.5, which was the highest figure in 12 months. Zhao Qinghe, an NBS statistician, said the drop was largely down to “sharp changes in [China’s] external environment”. Economists have warned that the disruption in trade between the tightly integrated US and Chinese economies could threaten businesses, increase prices for consumers and cause a global recession. “The weak manufacturing PMI in April is driven by the trade war,” Zhiwei Zhang, the president and chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, wrote in a note. “The macro data in China and the US will weaken further … as the trade policy uncertainty delays business decisions.” Goldman Sachs has estimated that 16m jobs in China could be at risk if the high tariffs persist, mainly in the export, wholesale and retail industries. A new US measure to close a loophole that had allowed low-value goods to be shipped into the US for free comes into effect on Friday, which will mainly affect Chinese businesses. More than 90% of packages arriving in the US come underthe “de minimis” scheme, which allows items with a value under $800 (£599) to evade duties. From Friday, those goods, which have fuelled the rise of e-commerce companies such as Temu and Shein, will be subject to a 120% levy or a flat fee. China’s economy, the world’s second largest, has struggled to fully recover since the Covid pandemic and is also grappling with sluggish domestic demand and a protracted property sector crisis. “China’s economy is coming under pressure as external demand cools,” said Zichun Huang, a China economist at CapitalEconomics, in a note. “Although the government is stepping up fiscal support, this is unlikely to fully offset the drag, and we expect the economy to expand just 3.5% this year.” Authorities last year announced a slew of aggressive stimulus measures aimed at boosting growth, including rate cuts and the easing of some home purchasing restrictions. On top of this, leaders at a key political meeting vowed to create 12m urban jobs in 2025 in March. Sign up toBusiness Today Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning after newsletter promotion They also said they would aim for growth this year of 5% – the same as 2024 and a goal many economists view as ambitious. Communist party leaders have pledged to support the companies and workers most affected by the US-China trade war. China is also ratcheting up its propaganda war. On Tuesday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs releaseda videoentitled “Never kneel down!”, which accused the US of bullying China and other countries. The International Monetary Fund, Goldman Sachs and UBS all recently revised down their economic growth forecasts for China over 2025 and into 2026, citing the impact of US tariffs. None of them expect the economy to hit Beijing’s official growth target. The vice-chair of China’s state planner, Zhao Chenxin, said on Monday he was“fully confident”that it would achieve the 5% growth target for 2025. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on Wednesday called for action to adapt to changes in the international environment and optimise its economic plans accordingly, the state-run Xinhua reported. Xi made the remarks while chairing a symposium in Shanghai on economic and social development. With Agence France-Presse and Reuters",

    "title": "Celebrations in Ho Chi Minh City mark 50 years since end of Vietnam war",
    "article_text": "Thousands of Vietnamese people have celebrated the 50th anniversary of theend of the Vietnam war, in what the country’s communist leader said was a “victory of justice over tyranny”. Celebrations culminated in a grand parade in Ho Chi Minh City with thousands of marching troops and an airshow featuring Russian-made fighter jets and helicopters, as Vietnamese waved red flags and sang patriotic songs. Underlining warming ties with Beijing, a contingent of 118 Chinese troops was expected to march alongside Vietnamese soldiers and policemen “to honour the international support Vietnam received during its struggle for independence,” according to state media. The historic anniversary commemorates the first act of the country’s reunification on 30 April, 1975 when Communist-run North Vietnam seized Saigon, the capital of the US-backed South. The city was renamed Ho Chi Minh city shortly after the war, in honour of the North’s founding leader. “It was a victory of justice over tyranny,” To Lam, Vietnam’s Communist party chief and the country’s top leader, said on Wednesday, citing one of Ho Chi Minh’s mottoes: “Vietnam is one, the Vietnamese people are one. Rivers may dry up, mountains may erode, but that truth will never change.“ The fall of Saigon, about two years after Washington withdrew its last combat troops from the country, marked the end of a 20-year conflict that killed some 3 million Vietnamese people and nearly 60,000 Americans, many of them young soldiers conscripted into the military. “Communist troops rolled into the South Vietnamese capital virtually unopposed, to the great relief of the population which had feared a bloody last-minute battle,” said a cable from one of the Reuters reporters in the city on the day it fell. The cable described the victorious army as made up of “formidably armed” troops in jungle green fatigues but also of barefoot teenagers. Those events were seared into many memories by the images of US helicopters evacuating some 7,000 people, many of them Vietnamese, as North Vietnamese tanks closed in. The final flight took off from the roof of the US embassy at 7.53am on 30 April, carrying the last US Marines out of Saigon. The formal reunification of Vietnam was completed a year later, 22 years after the country had been split in two following the end of French colonial rule. Vietnam and the United States normalised diplomatic relations in 1995 and deepened ties in 2023 during a visit to Hanoi by former US President Joe Biden. “The United States and Vietnam have a robust bilateral relationship that we are committed to deepening and broadening,” a spokesperson for the US Mission in Vietnam said on Wednesday. That bond is however now being tested by the threat of crippling 46% tariffs on Vietnamese goods that Biden’s successor, Donald Trump, announced in April. The tariffs have been largely paused until July and talks are under way. But if confirmed, they could undermine Vietnam’s export-led growth that has attracted large foreign investments. Washington sent Susan Burns, its consul general in Ho Chi Minh city, to represent the country at the parade. While Hanoi has re-established relations with the US, it has maintained close ties with Russia, which is its top supplier of weapons. Vietnam has also nurtured closer relations with northern neighbour China despite a complex history involving several conflicts and a rivalry in the disputed South China Sea. China is now a major investor in its economy and the source of many of the components that are used in products that are then exported to the US",

    "title": "US and Ukraine sign minerals deal that solidifies investment in Kyiv’s defense against Russia",
    "article_text": "The US andKyivhave signed an agreement to share profits and royalties from the future sale of Ukrainian minerals and rare earths, sealing a deal that Donald Trump has said will provide an economic incentive for the US to continue to invest in Ukraine’s defense and its reconstruction after he brokers a peace deal with Russia. The minerals deal, which has beenthe subject of tense negotiations for monthsand nearly fell through hours before it was signed, will establish a US-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund that the Trump administration has said will begin to repay an estimated $175bn in aid provided to Ukraine since the beginning of the war. “This agreement signals clearly to Russia that theTrump administrationis committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,” said Scott Bessent, the US treasury secretary, in a statement. “President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity inUkraine. And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.” Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, confirmed in a social media post that she had signed the agreement on Wednesday. “Together with the United States, we are creating the fund that will attract global investment into our country,” she wrote. The deal still needs to be approved by Ukraine’s parliament. Ukrainian officials have divulged details of the agreement which they portrayed as equitable and allowing Ukraine to maintain control over its natural resources. The Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, said that the fund would be split 50-50 with between the US and Ukraine and give each side equal voting rights. Ukraine would retain “full control over its mineral resources, infrastructure and natural resources,” he said, and would relate only to new investments, meaning that the deal would not provide for any debt obligations against Ukraine, a key concern for Kyiv. The deal would ensure revenue by establishing contracts on a “take-or-pay” basis, Shmyhal added. Shmyhal on Wednesday described the deal as “truly a good, equal and beneficial international agreement on joint investments in the development and recovery of Ukraine”. Critics of the deal had said the White House is seeking to take advantage of Ukraine by linking future aid to the embattled nation to a giveaway of the revenues from its resources. The final terms were far less onerous for Ukraine than those proposed initially by Bessent in February, which included a clause that the US would control 100% of the revenues from the fund. It was unclear up until the last moment whether the US and Ukraine would manage to sign the deal, with Washington reportedly pressuring Ukraine to sign additional agreements, including on the structure of the investment fund, or to “go back home”. That followed months of strained negotiations during which the US regularly delivered last-minute ultimatums while cutting off aid and other support for Ukraine in its defence againstRussia. Ukraine’s prime minister earlier had said he expected the country to sign the minerals deal with the US in “the next 24 hours” but reports emerged that Washington was insisting Kyiv sign three deals in total. The Financial Times said Bessent’s team had told Svyrydenko, who was reportedly en route to Washington DC, to “be ready to sign all agreements, or go back home”. Bessent later said the US was ready to sign though Ukraine had made some last-minute changes. Reuters reported that Ukraine believed the two supplementary agreements – reportedly on an investment fund and a technical document – required more work. The idea behind the deal was originally proposed by Ukraine, looking for ways to offer economic opportunities that might entice Trump to back the country. But Kyiv was blindsided in January when Trump’s team delivered a document that would essentially involve handing over the country’s mineral wealth with little by way of return. Since then, there have been various attempts to revise and revisit the terms of the deal, as well as a planned signing ceremony that was aborted after a disastrous meeting between Trump andVolodymyr Zelenskyyat the White House in February. Earlier this month, it was revealed that the Ukrainian justice ministry had hired US law firm Hogan Lovells to advise on the negotiations over the deal, according to filings with the US Foreign Agents Registration Act registry. In apost on Facebook, Ukraine’s first deputy prime minister Yulia Svyrydenko gave further details of the fund, which she said would “attract global investment”. She confirmed thatUkrainewould retain full ownership of resources “on our territory and in territorial waters belong to Ukraine”. “It is the Ukrainian state that determines where and what to extract,” she said. There would be no changes to ownership of state-owned companies, she said, “they will continue to belong to Ukraine”. That included companies such as Ukrnafta, Ukraine’s largest oil producer, and nuclear energy producer Energoatom. Income would come from new licences for critical materials and oil and gas projects, not from projects which had already begun, she said. Income and contributions to the fund would not be taxed in the US or Ukraine, she said, “to make investments yield the greatest results”. Razom for Ukraine, a US nonprofit that provides medical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine and advocates for US assistance, welcomed the deal, and encouraged the Trump administration to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin to end the invasion. “We encourage the Trump administration to build on the momentum of this economic agreement by forcing Putin to the table through sanctions, seizing Russia’s state assets to aid Ukraine, and giving Ukraine the tools it needs to defend itself,” Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy for Razom, said in a statement.",

    "title": "Minister warns against blaming Spain’s blackout on renewable energy",
    "article_text": "Spain’s environment minister has warned against attempts to blame Monday’sunprecedented blackoutacross the Iberian peninsula on the increasing use of renewable energy, defending the reliability of the national grid and promising a “complete audit” to establish the causes of the outage. Speaking on Wednesday afternoon as a specially designated committee prepared to meet to investigate the blackout, Sara Aagesen pushed back at opposition parties’ claims that the socialist-led government’s drive to embrace renewable energy had compromised the grid’s stability. She said Spain’s electricity on Monday was generated from a mix of different sources, with solar power accounting for almost 55% of the total, followed by 10% from wind power, 10% from nuclear power and almost 10% from hydraulic power. “The system has worked to perfection with a similar demand situation and with a similar energetic mix [in the past], so pointing the finger at renewables when the system has functioned perfectly in the same context doesn’t seem very appropriate,” she said. Opponents of the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, have suggested over recent days that he pushed ahead with plans to prioritise renewable energy over nuclear energy without thinking of the consequences and is now trying to blame private energy companies for the blackout. The conservative People’s party (PP) accused the prime minister of waging “an information blackout” over the incident, while Santiago Abascal, the leader of the far-right Vox party, has blamed the power cut squarely on Sánchez and his “disastrous energy policies”. Some have seized on a recent financial report from Redeia, the parent company of Red Eléctrica, Spain’s national grid operator, which said “the high penetration of renewable generation without the necessary technical capacity to deal adequately with disturbances” could “lead to production cuts”. It said blackouts “could become severe, even leading to an imbalance between production and demand, which would significantly affect the electricity supply”. Aagesen insisted that renewable energy was vital if Spain was to remain a competitive and strategically autonomous power producer. “We have native resources – the sun, the wind – in our country and we don’t have fossil fuels or uranium,” she said. “We do have sun and wind and I think a lot of businesses share our commitment to transforming our energy system and making it more and more renewable.” Earlier on Wednesday, Red Eléctrica’s president, Beatriz Corredor, said the company knew what had caused the blackout but was still poring over a huge amount of data. “We know the cause and we have it more or less tracked down, but the thing is there are millions of pieces of information because signals are sent every millisecond,” Corredor told Cadena Ser radio. Corredor said she would not be resigning over the incident, adding: “To do so would be recognise that the correct actions weren’t taken, and that wasn’t the case.” She also insisted it was incorrect to link the blackout to Spain’s increasing reliance on renewable energy. “The renewables mix is safe and it can form part of all the safety systems of the electrical operating system,” she told Cadena Ser. “Linking what happened on Monday to renewables isn’t correct. Renewables work in a stable way.” Sánchez himself has been blunter. “Those who link this incident to the lack of nuclear power are frankly lying or demonstrating their ignorance,” he said on Tuesday, adding that nuclear power generation was no more resilient than other electricity sources. Sánchezsummoned the headsof Spain’s private energy operators – including Corredor and representatives from Iberdrola, Endesa, EDP, Acciona Energía and Naturgy – to an urgent meeting on Tuesday evening to discuss the blackout. The prime minister has said the committee will be looking into the role of private energy companies and urged them to help the government get to the bottom of the blackout as soon as possible. Aagesen said some of the operators had already provided huge amounts of data, with the rest of the information expected over the next few days. “As soon as we know what caused this event, we’ll put all necessary measures on the table so that it doesn’t happen again,” she said. The investigations are focusing on what happened at 12.33pm on Monday, when, for five seconds, 15 gigawatts of the energy that was being produced – equivalent to 60% of all the energy that was being used – suddenly disappeared. Spain aims to generate 81% of its electricity from renewables by the end of the decade. Last year, a record 56% of its electricity came from renewable sources.",

    "article_text": "A Turkish court has handed a Swedish journalist an 11-month suspended sentence for insulting the president,Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, but he remains behind bars awaiting trial on a second more serious charge. Joakim Medin, who works for the Swedish newspaper Dagens ETC, was detained at Istanbul airport on 27 March when he flew in to cover themass protests gripping Turkey. He was arrested on two separate charges: insulting the president and belonging to a terror organisation, and jailed a day later at Silivri prison in Istanbul. After handing Medin the suspended sentence, the judge ordered his release, according to the correspondent and MLSA, the Turkish rights group defending him. But because ofthe second charge he is facing– for which a trial date has not yet been set – Medin will remain behind bars. Prosecutors say Medin attended a protest in Stockholm in January 2023 where protesters strung up an effigy of Erdoğan. That effigy reappeared months later, holding an LGBTQ flag on a Kurdish activists’ float at Stockholm’s Pride parade. According to the indictment, which Medin said he had not seen, the offending images were used to illustrate several of his articles that he had posted online. Addressing the court via video link from Silivri prison, Medin said he had not been inSwedenat the time of January rally. Although he posted links to articles he had written about Sweden’s Nato accession – which was initially blocked byTurkey– he said he was not responsible for the photo selection. “I was not at this event, I was in Germany for work. I didn’t know about plans for his event, and I didn’t share any photo or video about it on social media,” Medin told the court via video link. “I did not insult the president. I was assigned to write the article. The photo was selected by editors, I was just doing my job,” he said, asking to be released so he could return to his wife, who is seven months pregnant with their first child. His lawyer, Veysel Ok, urged the court to acquit him. “Medin has no motivation to knowingly and willingly insult the president. The Nato process was vital for Sweden because a Russian attack was on the agenda; my client reported on this process,” Ok told the court.

I demand my client’s acquittal,” the lawyer added. Many people, from teenagers to journalists and even a former Miss Turkey, have been charged with insulting the president, an offence often used to muffle dissent. Because of the second charge against him, Medin will remain in prison until a trial date is set. “It’s undemocratic he was convicted in this first case and we deeply regret that the decision to free him isn’t enough to ensure his release today because of the second case,” said Erol Önderoğlu from Reporters Without Borders. “We urge the Turkish authorities to release the journalist, to quickly set a date for the second trial and drop the charges,” he said. The charge of belonging to a terror organisation is much more serious. If convicted, Medin could face up to nine years in prison. He denies the charges.",

    "article_text": "A retired restaurant owner alleged to have been the ringleader of an armed robbery of American reality TV starKim Kardashianin Paris, has told a court he was in part driven by a taste for easy money. Aomar Aït Khedache, 68, known as “Old Omar”, has admitted to police that he took part in the robbery in which Kardashian was tied up and held hostage at gunpoint in her Paris hotel bedroom during Paris fashion week in 2016. But he has denied the prosecution’s accusation that he was the organiser or ringleader of the jewel heist in the early hours of 3 October 2016, which was thebiggest robbery of an individual in France in 20 years. The robbers, dressed as police officers, escaped with up to an estimated $10m (£7.5m) in jewellery, including a 18.88-carat diamond engagement ring given to Kardashian by her then husband, the rapperKanye West, estimated to be worth $4m. Aït Khedache is part of a group five men aged over 60 who allegedly went to Kardashian’sParishotel by bike or on foot for the hold-up, and who French media have nicknamed “the grandpa robbers”. Like several other accused men, he has serious health problems. He is deaf and cannot speak, so he read the court’s questions on a typed transcript, writing his answers with a pen and paper, projected on to a screen. The court heard that Aït Khedache, who ran restaurants inFranceand Spain, had served several prison sentences for robbery from the 1970s. The lead judge, referring to Aït Khedache’s past convictions, asked him why he turned to crime. He replied that he did not know, saying it was largely due to keeping bad company. Asked by the judge whether he was driven by a taste for easy money, Aït Khedache wrote: “Not particularly, but that too.” The court heard that at the time of the jewel heist, Aït Khedache was already a wanted man, living under a stolen identity in order to escape prison for a drug-trafficking conviction from 2010. A total of 10 people, aged from 35 to 78, are on trial over their alleged part in the Kardashian robbery. Eight deny involvement. One of the accused is Aït Khedache’s eldest son, Harminy, who is alleged to have been a getaway driver. Harminy Aït Khedache, who had previously worked as an Uber driver, has denied involvement in the robbery. He told police he had been asked by his father to collect him one night in Paris, something he often did, and that he knew nothing of the heist. The court heard that Aomar Aït Khedache was born in Algeria and arrived in France as a young child. He and his nine siblings were “paralysed by fear” of their violent father. The older Aït Khedache was convicted for robbery for the first time 1977, and while he was in prison for 10 months, his pregnant wife died in a fire. Aït Khedache had a psychiatric breakdown over her death and received electric shock therapy, which he said caused the start of his hearing problems. Later he met a woman with a young baby, Harminy. He married her, adopted Harminy, and had another son, Haris. Harminy Aït Khedache, in his early 40s, broke down in tears in court on Tuesday. He said he had found out from a relative when he was aged six that Aomar wasn’t his biological father but had been scared of asking his parents for details for fear of upsetting them. He said he considered Aomar his father and had always wanted to please him. He told the judge that, in general: “I wanted to show that I’m devoted to him.” Haris Aït-Khedache, 39, a bus driver, was called as a character witness for his father. He said of his father’s role in the robbery: “He made a mistake. He found himself in a situation where he didn’t have the choice, I think.” He said his father had said that the victims “must have been traumatised” and that he “regrets the repercussions of this”. The trial continues.",

    "article_text": "A 16-year-old has been detained on suspicion of shooting and killing three people in the city of Uppsala, according to Sweden’s prosecution authority. “An intensive investigation is under way. We are now gathering information and the police are conducting door-to-door inquiries and interviewing witnesses,” the authority said in a statement. In addition, mobile phones and other material that have been seized are being analysed.” Police had earlier confirmed in a press conference that a detained person was suspected of murder and was one of several people being interrogated as part of the investigation, although they did not provide an age. They did, however, confirm that the victims were aged between 15 and 20. The shooting took place at a hair salon in Uppsala, a university city 42 miles north of Stockholm, on Tuesday. Police said the attack was believed to be an isolated event and not linked to the annual Valborg celebrations expected in the city on Wednesday evening. Valborg is a Swedish bonfire festival marking the arrival of spring. Swedish media reported that one of the deceased had connections to organised gang crime. Police would not confirm those reports but said gang-related crime was one of the theories they were pursuing “particularly intensively”. Authorities in Sweden have been struggling to deal with gang violence, which remains at the forefront of a national debate, including growing concerns over the young age of children being caught up in the bloodshed. Guns and explosives are regularly used by rival gangs. Police have appealed to the public for information after a masked person was seen fleeing the crime scene on an electric scooter on Tuesday. The minister of justice, Gunnar Strömmer, condemned the killings as a “brutal act of violence”. Police were first alerted to the incident shortly after 5pm on Tuesday, when they received several phone calls from members of the public about loud bangs. Officials later confirmed that three people were dead. “Quite soon we encountered three people who appeared to have been shot. They did not need to be taken to hospital,” Magnus Jansson Klarin, a spokesperson for Uppsala police, told the Svenska Dagbladet daily newspaper. The Swedish government announced in February that itplanned to strengthen its weapons lawsafter the country’s worst mass shooting, when agunman killed 10 people at an education centre in Örebro, west of Stockholm, before shooting himself. The man’s motives are still under investigation. Reuters and Agence France-Presse contributed to this report",

    "title": "Lammy confirms UK and France in talks over Palestine recognition",
    "article_text": "The UK is in discussion with France andSaudi Arabiaover the recognition of a Palestinian state at a June conference convened by the two countries on keeping alive the political path to a two-state solution in the Middle East, the UK foreign secretary has said. David Lammy’s comments mark the first time the UK has acknowledged that a discussion with France about a recognition process around the conference is under way. Recognition of Palestine by two permanent members of the UN security council would be a powerful statement but faces many diplomatic hurdles, including a need for greater clarity about whatFranceis proposing and whether recognition could form part of a credible process towards a two-state solution, something Israel is opposing. Lammy, speaking to the Lords international relations select committee, said the UK wanted to take the step when it would have an impact on the ground and not at a symbolic moment, adding that it was his sad conclusion that some European countries’ recognition of Palestine recently had not had any effect. Reminded that 160 states had now recognised Palestine, including most recentlySpain, Norway and Ireland, Lammy said: “No one has a veto on when the UK recognises that Palestinian state … We have always said that recognition is not an end in of itself and we will prefer recognition as a part of a process to two states. “President Macron has had a lot to say about that, most recently, alongside the Saudis, and of course we are in discussion with them at this time.” He said that in talks with Qatar last week he had been underlining that any long-term solution would require Hamas not to be in government in Gaza and its leadership to leave, probably to a third country. There had to be a full demilitarisation process similar to the one that occurred after the Good Friday agreement in Northern Ireland, he said. But Lammy said: “It is unacceptable for any group of people to have lived with no state for longer than I’ve been alive.” He accepted that the accelerating pace of settlement expansion was undermining the viability of two states, and said settlement violence levels were “shocking”. In the last year, he said, 59 outposts on the West Bank had been built, whereas the average over the previous 25 years was seven. The latest speculation about the long saga of recognition started whenEmmanuel Macronreturned from a trip to Egypt on 9 April and said France would probably recognise a Palestinian state at the June conference. It would be the first recognition of Palestine by a G7 member state. A few days later, Macron clarified that the move would be intended to “trigger a series of other recognitions … including the recognition ofIsraelby states that do not currently do so”, remarks that could provide France with a get-out if no momentum towards recognition emerges. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, subsequently rang Macron to tell him that recognising Palestine as a state would be a victory for Hamas and Iran. Donald Trump is due to visit Saudi Arabia this month, where he is certain to be told by Riyadh that Saudi normalisation with Israel, one of Trump’s signature diplomatic themes, is impossible without a credible pathway to a two-state solution. Michel Duclos, a special adviser to Institut Montaigne, a Paris-based thinktank, argued French political credibility was at stake in its handling of the issue. He said that since the best outcome from the June conference at the UN “may be nothing more than a roadmap or set of proposals, the dilemma for France may soon become more challenging: can it continue postponing its recognition of Palestine while waiting for a true two-state momentum? Or would further postponement undermine its credibility?” Lammy showed his frustration with the Israeli leadership’s 60-day ban on aid into Gaza but he proposed no new measures. “The blockade of necessary aid into Gaza is horrendous, the suffering is dire, the need is huge, the loss of life is extreme,” he said. He said he had been clear in person to the Israeli foreign minister, Gideon Saar, about Israel’s obligations to provide aid when the two menmet in Londona fortnight ago.",

    "title": "Iran executes man accused of helping Israel kill Revolutionary Guards colonel",
    "article_text": "Iran has executed a 36-year-old man it accused of helping the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence agency, kill a senior officer in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps in Tehran in 2022.Iranian state media said Mohsen Langarneshin was hanged, the usual method of execution in Iran, at Ghezel Hesar prison early on Wednesday morning. Langarneshin’s family and human rights groups insisted the former IT consultant was innocent of the charges against him and that any reported confessionswere obtained by torture or blackmail. On Tuesday, Langarneshin’s mother made an emotional appeal for his life to be spared. “Please pray for my child … I do not know if he will see the sunrise tomorrow or not,”she said in a post on social media. “I don’t know why the court refuses to accept any of the documents and evidence we bring. We have so many pieces of evidence that prove his innocence, but nothing is accepted.” According to Iran’s state news agency IRNA, Langarneshin was a “senior spy” for the Mossad who provided critical “technical support” for the assassination of Hassan Sayyad Khodaei, a colonel in the Revolutionary Guards who was shot five times by gunmen on a motorbike outside his home in Tehran, as well as for other alleged operations. The IRNA report said the Mossad recruited Langarneshin in 2020 and that he met with Israeli intelligence officers in Georgia and Nepal. He was arrested in July 2023. Activists fear that Iran scapegoats innocent people after failing to catch the actual agents, who have often escaped overseas by the time investigators identify them. Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, the director of the Norway-based Iran Human Rights monitor, said: “Mohsen Langarneshin, who was sentenced to death in an unfair judicial process based on confessions obtained under torture and charged with espionage for Israel, was hanged at dawn today.” “The Iranian authorities’ execution machine is accelerating every day, taking the lives of more people,” he added, describing the executions as “extrajudicial killings”. At least 335 people have been hanged in Iran so far this year alone, campaigners say. Iranexecuted more than 900 peoplein 2024. A man was executed in December 2023 after he was found guilty of collaborating with the Mossad. Four others were hanged a year earlier over alleged ties to Israel. The US-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center, which had campaigned over Langarneshin’s case, said he had been convicted at a revolutionary court presided over by a judge, Abolghasem Salavati, who has been put under US and EU sanctions and is notorious for handing out death sentences. “He denied all charges, stating that his confessions were extracted under torture,” the group said. The revolutionary courts were set up after the 1979 revolution and deliver often summary justice in closed hearings. Israel and Iran have been engaged in a shadow war of assassinations and bombings for decades. A series of attacks attributed to the Mossad has targeted Iranian scientists, experts and academics, many connected to Iran’s nuclear programme. Last year, Israel is thought to have killed Ismail Haniyeh, the most senior political leader of Hamas, with a bomb in a bedroom of a government guesthouse in Tehran In Israel, a 72-year-old manwas sentenced on Tuesdayto 10 years in prison accused of discussing plots with Iranian intelligence services to assassinate senior government officials, including the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The US president, Donald Trump, isseeking a new deal with the Iranian leadershipon its nuclear programme, with both Israel and its ally the US long refusing to rule out a military strike on Iran. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, said on Wednesday that Iran expected the next round of negotiations with the US to be held in Rome on Saturday, adding that Iran also anticipated having a meeting on Friday with France, Germany and the UK to discuss the talks.",

    "title": "Deadly Syria clashes continue for second day outside Damascus",
    "article_text": "At least 16civilians and security officials have been killed in clashes in a town near Damascus, Syria’s interior ministry reported, the second consecutive day of fighting in Druze-majority areas around Syria’s capital. Reports on Wednesday said fighting had started overnight in the town of Ashrafiah Sahnaya, south-west of Damascus, after unknown gunmen attacked a security checkpoint. An attack on the Druze-majority Damascus suburb of Jaramana a day earlier left at least 10 people dead, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Residents reported hearing gunfire, explosions and shelling throughout Wednesday morning. The security forces closed off roads leading to the area and sent reinforcements in an attempt to stop the fighting. The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, also announced that Israeli forces had struck an “extremist group that was preparing to attack the Druze population south of Damascus”. A second Israeli strike killed a member of Syria’s security forces outside Damascus and Israel’s military chief of staff ordered preparations to attack Syrian government targets “if the violence against the Druze did not stop”. Israel has said it will protect the Druze population in southern Syria, an offer that Syrian Druze have said they did not ask for. Syria’s authorities are still grappling with rising tensions a month after anattack by remnants of the deposed regimeof Bashar al-Assad on security forces led tosectarian massacres in the coastal Latakia governoratethat left at least 1,000 people dead. This week’s clashes are likely to strain the already frosty relationship between the Syrian government and Druze communities, which are engaged in negotiations over their areas’ inclusion in the Syrian state. The Druze are an Arab religious minority of about 500,000 people in Syria, mainly concentrated in Suwayda governorate and small towns south of Damascus. Since rebels toppled Assad on 8 December, the new authorities and the group’s leaders have been discussing how to fully integrate Suwayda into the Syrian state.Negotiations have been slow, however, because Druze leaders have asked for some measure of autonomy from Damascus, wary of the background of the new government, which is headed by Ahmad al-Sharaa, the former leader of the Islamist rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). Tuesday’s fighting was sparked by a fake audio recording attributed to a Druze cleric insulting Islam’s prophet, Mohammad, which was circulated on social media. Unknown gunmen launched their attack on Jaramana seemingly in connection with the audio clip. The cleric supposedly speaking in the clip posted a video on social media later on Tuesday clarifying that he had no connection to the Islamophobic recording. “I did not say that, and whoever made it is evil and wants to incite strife between components of the Syrian people,” said Marwan Kiwan. Syria’s interior ministry confirmed that the recording was falsely attributed to a Druze official, and stressed that people should abide by the law and not engage in acts of vigilantism. Community leaders and government representatives managed to broker a deal to end the fighting in Jaramana on Tuesday with stipulations that victims’ families would receive compensation and attackers would be brought to justice. Fighting quickly reignited several hours later in Ashrafieh Sahnaya, but it is unclear if the attackers were related to those in Jaramana. The clashes inflamed anger in Suwayda, whose inhabitants have been reluctant to allow the Syrian government full access to the area. “In Jaramana there was a massacre, Ashrafieh Sahnaya is surrounded and is being attacked by terrorists. General security is preventing Druze and the military council from helping them,” the head of the Suwayda military council, Tarek el-Shoufi, said by phone. Videos on social media showed armed Arab tribesmen stopping a convoy of cars originating from Suwayda from reaching Ashrafieh Sahnaya.El-Shoufi said: “The Druze men that are in Sahnaya are running out of ammunition. The road has been cut off and a group of Druze that wanted to help came under fire, killing one of them.” Syria’s cash-strapped authorities suffer from a lack of capacity. The nascent state has launched training courses to bolster the ranks of its security forces, but it has struggled to disarm and prevent sporadic attacks by the myriad armed factions that roam the vast countryside. Syria’s minister of interior put out a statement on Wednesday saying “it will not hesitate to deal with these criminals and will strike with an iron fist anyone who seeks to destabilise Syria’s security and target its people”.",

Entangled in a decades-long shadow war withIsrael, Iran has put to death many individuals it accuses of having links with Israel’sthe Mossad intelligence serviceand facilitating the latter’s operations in the country, notably assassinations or acts of sabotage meant to undermine its nuclear programme, reports Reuters. At least 11 civilians and security officials were killed in ongoing clashes in a town nearDamascuson Wednesday, state media reported, the second consecutive day of fighting in Druze-majority areas aroundSyria’s capital.

The embattledUN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, has accusedIsraelof abusing dozens of its staff in military detention and using some as human shields. The head of the agency,Philippe Lazzarini, said that more than 50 staff members, including teachers, doctors and social workers, had been detained and abused since the start of the 18-month-long war inGaza. Israel cannot be forced to allow the UN Palestinian refugee agency Unrwa to operate in Gaza, the United States said on Wednesday at a World Court hearing in The Hague. Israel last year passed a law that banned Unrwa from operating in the country, as it said the organisation had employed members of Hamas who took part in the attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023, Reuters reported. The UN said in August that nine Unrwa staff may have been involved in the assault and had been fired. Another Hamas commander, confirmed by Unrwa as one of its employees, was killed inGazain October, according to Israel. TheUnited NationsGeneral Assembly in December asked the UN’s top court to give an advisory opinion on Israel’s obligations to facilitate aid to Palestinians that is delivered by states and international groups, including the United Nations. At the third day of hearings on the matter, the US said Israel had the right to determine which organisations could provide basic needs to the population of the occupiedPalestinian territories. At least 11 civilians and security officials were killed in ongoing clashes in a town nearDamascuson Wednesday, state media reported, the second consecutive day of fighting in Druze-majority areas aroundSyria’s capital.

This week’s clashes are likely to strain the already frosty relationship between the Syrian government and Druze communities, which are engaged in negotiations over their areas’ inclusion in the Syrian state. Here are some of the latest images coming in via the newswires: Israelipolice on Wednesday closed the mainJerusalem-Tel Aviv highwayand evacuated residents along the route as brushfires broke out again in an area ravaged by blazes a week ago, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Communities located about 30km (19 miles) west of Jerusalem were evacuated, Israeli media reported, airing images of firefighting teams battling fierce flames. Due to the weather conditions, the Israeli minister responsible for arranging national ceremonies,Miri Regev,announced that the main Independence Day event planned for Wednesday evening in Jerualem was cancelled. High temperatures and strong winds have allowed the fires in wooded areas to spread quickly, prompting evacuations from at least five communities, the police said in a statement. AFP reports that the emergency services provider,Magen David Adom,said in a statement that “at this stage, there are no reported casualties.” “Ambulance teams, intensive care units and immediate response vehicles are providing medical support for firefighting operations,” it added. National security ministerItamar Ben Gvir, who oversees Israel’s fire department, said in a statement that he was heading to the affected area, which often sees wildfires at this time of year. When fires broke out in the same area last week, prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahuhad called for increased measures to douse the flames and said they must be stopped before reaching Jerusalem, which was eventually the case. Israel’s military said it arrestedAli Samoudi, a well-known journalist, in an overnight raid in theWest Bankcity ofJenin,reports the Associated Press (AP).Samoudi previously worked for international outlets including CNN and Al Jazeera. In 2022, he was injured in the same spray of gunfire that killed prominentPalestinianjournalistShireen Abu Akleh.USofficials say Akleh was shot dead by an Israeli sniper.Israel’s military said Samoudi was affiliated with and transfered funds for theIslamic Jihadmilitant group, without providing evidence. They said Samoudi had been transferred to Israel’s security forces, reports the AP. Iranianjournalists have warned of a media crackdown after a series of incidents, the most recent an explosion at a munitions company in which one person was killed and two injured. The explosion on Tuesday, for which there has been no official explanation, occurred inIsfahan, only two days after a thwarted cyber-attack on the communications infrastructure on Sunday, and a huge explosion on Saturday at the strategic southern port ofShahid Rajaee, nearBandar Abbas. The death toll from theexplosion at the porthas increased to 65, with more than 1,000 people injured. Iran has ruled out foreign involvement in the Shahid Rajaee explosion, pointing instead to negligence and strong evidence that unlabelled combustible chemicals, undeclared to customs, were inappropriately stored, leading to a fire and a deadly chain reaction of explosions. An MP who visited the site put the chances of sabotage at 1%. Suspicion of cover-ups is rife, however, and the filing of criminal charges against media outlets and activists by theTehranprosecutor’s office has caused journalists in Iran to voice concern about press freedom. Mizan news agency, the judiciary’s official media outlet, said violators would face legal consequences for attempting to publish “illegal news” about the explosion. One Tehran-based reporter, speaking to the Guardian on condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said: Not only were we warned against ground reporting, we were also banned effectively from sharing reports on social media. In face of a tragedy such as this, what is there to hide? Either the death toll is way more than 70, or they are suppressing the real cause of the explosion. Following the filing of charges, our newsrooms are also self-regulating in fear that they’ll be facing legal consequences. Wednesday’s strike inSyriacame asIsraelmarked its annual Memorial Day to commemorate fallen soldiers, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). “On this Memorial Day for the fallen soldiers of the [Israel Defense Forces] IDF, when we honour the great contribution of the Druze community to Israel’s security … we place great importance on fulfilling our commitment to the Druze community in Israel and to protecting their brothers in Syria,” said the statement issued by Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahu’s office. The statement continued: Israel will not allow harm to befall the Druze community in Syria out of a deep commitment to our Druze brothers in Israel, who share family and historical ties with their Druze brethren in Syria. The embattledUN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, has accusedIsraelof abusing dozens of its staff in military detention and using some as human shields. The head of the agency,Philippe Lazzarini, said that more than 50 staff members, including teachers, doctors and social workers, had been detained and abused since the start of the 18-month-long war inGaza. “They have been treated in the most shocking & inhumane way. They reported being beaten + used as human shields,” Lazzariniwrote on X. Those detained had been subjected to “sleep deprivation, humiliation, threats of harm to them & their families + attacks by dogs … [and] forced confessions”. UN officials said the reported abuse had taken place both in Gaza and in military detention sites inIsrael. The Israeli military has not responded directly to Lazzarini’s accusation, but has previously denied allegations of widespread abuse in its detention facilities and by its troops. It has, however, launchedinvestigationsinto abuse by individual soldiers during the war, and into the use of detainees as human shields,bringing chargesagainst service personnel in some cases. In a statement, the Israeli military said it acted in accordance with Israeli law and international law, and protects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility. ASwissban onHamaswill come into force on 15 May, the federal government said on Wednesday after a parliamentary vote at the end of 2024. The government’s political and security committees submitted a motion to ban Hamas in October 2023, after the group’s deadly attack onIsraelthat month, said a government statement. The ban is designed to counter the movement’s activities and stop people supporting the group, the statement added, according to Agence France-Presse (AFP). The law makes it easier for the police to use preventive measures such as entry bans or expulsions as well as facilitating the handling of evidence in criminal relevant cases, said the government. The law will also make it harder for Hamas to use Switzerland’s financial network for its funding, strengthening the country’s “internal security” and upholding international law, it added. TheIsraelimilitary carried out a warning strike against “extremists” preparing to attack members of the Druze minority in theSyriantown ofSahnaya, Israeli prime ministerBenjamin Netanyahusaid on Wednesday in a joint statement with defence ministerIsrael Katz, reports Reuters. At least 12 people including children were killed overnight inGazabyIsraelistrikes, hospital workers said on Wednesday, reports the Associated Press (AP). We mentioned Wafa’s reporting of the strikes in the blog earlier (see 8.09am BST), but the AP report has some additional infomation:The predawn strikes hit three houses in the urbanNuseirat refugee camp, according to staff at theal-Aqsa hospital, which received the bodies. Among the dead were three children, including two brothers, according to the hospital’s morgue. The strikes come after more than two dozen people were killed earlier this week inGazaCityandBeit Lahiya. Agence France-Presse (AFP) has more on the evidence given byJosh Simmonsat the ICJ hearing (see 9.34am) Simmons, from theUSstate department legal team, told the judges thatIsraelhas “ample grounds” to questionUnrwa’s impartiality. “Given these concerns, it is clear that Israel has no obligation to permit Unrwa specifically to provide humanitarian assistance,” he said. “Unrwa is not the only option for providing humanitarian assistance inGaza,” he added. AUSofficial on Wednesday told theinternational court of justice (ICJ)there were “serious concerns” about the impartiality of theUN agency for Palestinian refugees(Unrwa). ICJ judges are holding a week of hearings to help them formulate an advisory opinion onIsrael’s obligations towardsUNagencies delivering aid toPalestiniansinGaza. “There are serious concerns about Unrwa’s impartiality, including information that Hamas has used Unrwa facilities and that Unrwa staff participated in the 7 October terrorist attack against Israel,” saidJosh Simmonsfrom the US state department legal team, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Israel bannedall cooperationwith Unrwa’s activities in Gaza and theoccupied West Bankearlier this year, and claims the agency has been infiltrated byHamas, an allegation that has been fiercely contested. Iran’s top diplomat,Abbas Araghchi, said a fourth round of nuclear talks with theUnited States, mediated byOman, would be held in on Saturday inRome. “The next round of negotiations will take place in Rome,” the foreign minister said after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP). Araghchi said Iranian officials would also meet on Friday with representatives from theUK,FranceandGermany– all parties to the 2015 nuclear deal.",

    "article_text": "British fighter jets joined their US counterparts in airstrikes against Yemen’s Houthi rebels overnight, the first military action authorised by the Labour government and the first UK participation in an aggressive American bombing campaign against the group. RAF Typhoons, refuelled by Voyager air tankers, targeted a cluster of buildings 15 miles south of the capital, Sana’a, which the UK said were used by theHouthisto manufacture drones that had targeted shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The British defence secretary,John Healey, said the attack was launched in response to “a persistent threat from the Houthis to freedom of navigation”. The Iran-backed group has attacked merchant shipping and western warships, leading to a sharp drop in trade flows. “A 55% drop in shipping through the Red Sea has already cost billions, fuelling regional instability and risking economic security for families in the UK,” Healey said in a social media post shortly after midnight. Britain had joined with the US to conduct five rounds of airstrikes against the Houthis between January and May 2024, part of the Operation Poseidon Archer campaign authorised by the Biden administration, but had not been involved in the fresh and more intense US effort until now. On 15 March, the Trump administration launched a fresh campaign against the Houthis, Operation Rough Rider. There have been 800 targets struck and it has resulted in the deaths of “hundreds of Houthi fighters and numerous Houthi leaders”, according to the US military’s central command. There have also been reports of higher civilian casualties. This week, the Houthis said68 people were killedwhen a detention centre holding African migrants was struck in Saada, north-west Yemen, while 80 civilians were reported to have died in an attack on the port of Ras Isa on 18 April. Annie Shiel, the US director at the Center for Civilians in Conflict, said the “US strikes continue to raise significant questions about the precautions taken to prevent civilian harm, as required by both international law and US policy”, and noted that there appeared to have been a shift in policy under Donald Trump. Overnight on Tuesday, the UK said it had taken steps to minimise the risk of civilian casualties. The Houthi buildings were targeted with Paveway IV missiles once “very careful planning had been completed to allow the targets to be prosecuted with minimal risk to civilians or non-military infrastructure”, the Ministry of Defence said. It emphasised that “as a further precaution, the strike was conducted after dark, when the likelihood of any civilians being in the area was reduced yet further”, though no damage assessment was offered at first. Healey later told the Commons that after an initial damage assessment the MoD had said: “The planned targets were successfully hit and we see no evidence of civilian casualties.” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion One of the reasons the UK had decided to attack the Houthis was to show support for Washington, Healey said. “The US continues to be the UK’s closest security ally. They’re stepping up in the Red Sea. We are alongside them.” There was little immediate comment from the US. Its defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, has said the American military must emphasise “lethality, lethality, lethality” and has cut programmes intended to minimise civilian harm. News agencies said the Houthis had reported several strikes around Sana’a, which the group has held since 2014, but there were few other details immediately available. Other strikes hit the area around Saada. The Houthis are targeting shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in support of Hamas and the Palestinians in Gaza, the subject of a renewed offensive by Israel. A statement from the Houthi administration in Sana’a accused the UK of “typical British arrogance” and pledged to fight on. “We emphasise that this attack falls within the ongoing Anglo-American efforts to support the Israeli enemy by attempting to halt Yemen’s assistance to Palestine, so that the Israeli enemy can continue its genocide in Gaza,” it said. The US boasts considerably more firepower than the group, but a $60m (£45m) US navy F-18 Super Hornet jet waslost at seaon Tuesday. US officials said initial reports indicated the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier, on which the F-18 was being towed, made a hard turn to evade Houthi fire. That contributed to the fighter jet falling overboard and sinking. The start of Operation Rough Rider caused controversy in the US over Hegseth’s use of the unclassified Signal messaging app to post sensitive details about the attacks, including in a group containing a journalist.",

    "title": "India and Pakistan already sweltering in ‘new normal’ heatwave conditions",
    "article_text": "The summer conditions south Asian countries dread each year have arrived alarmingly early, and it’s only April. Much of India andPakistanis already sweltering in heatwave conditions, in what scientists say is fast becoming the “new normal”. Temperatures in the region typically climb through May, peaking in June before the monsoon brings relief. But this year, the heat has come early. “As far as Asia and the Indian subcontinent are concerned, there was a quick transition from a short window of spring conditions to summer-like heat,” said GP Sharma, the meteorology president of Skymet, India’s leading private forecaster. South Asia, home to 1.9 billion people, is particularly vulnerable. Many live in areas highly exposed to extreme heat and lack access to basic cooling, healthcare or water. In Delhi, where spring usually offers a short spell of mild temperatures, thermometers have risen past 40C in April – “up to 5C above the seasonal average” – according to a report by ClimaMeter, a platform that tracks extreme weather events. “Human-driven climate change” is to blame for the “dangerous” kind of heat seen in recent weeks, it said. “These spring heatwaves are not anomalies. They’re signals. We need to move beyond awareness into action,” said Gianmarco Mengaldo, a climate expert at the National University of Singapore and co-author of the report. Delhi authorities urged schools to cancel afternoon assemblies on Tuesday and issued emergency guidelines to ensure water breaks and stocks of oral rehydration salts in first aid kits, and to treat any signs of heat stress immediately. Temperatures in Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan, hit 44C, triggering heatstroke reports among construction workers and farmers. Other states are also grappling with intense heat. The Indian Meteorological Department has reported an “above-normal number of heatwave days”. Temperatures are expected to climb steadily across the subcontinent, with the highest readings forecast for Wednesday and Thursday. Pakistan is also reeling. In the city of Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh province, the mercury has soared to 50C – nearly 8.5C above the April average. In other parts of the country, temperatures have hovered in the high 40s. “What was once considered rare has become alarmingly common, as climate change accelerates the frequency and severity of such events,” said an editorial in the Pakistani newspaper Dawn. The country “remains woefully unprepared for the escalating climate crisis”, it said. Urban heat is making things worse. Data comparing 1950–1986 with 1987–2023 shows that cities such as Delhi and Islamabad are now up to 3C hotter on average than nearby rural areas. “When it comes to heatwaves, the question is no longer if they are linked to climate change, but what kind of thresholds we are reaching,” said Mengaldo. “Preparedness is essential. But right now, our infrastructure is not well adapted.” Natural climate variability such as the El Niño cycle can affect regional weather, but it is now in a neutral phase. ClimaMeter said: “Compared to pre-1986 levels, similar meteorological conditions now produce temperatures up to 4C higher – almost entirely due to human-driven climate change.” Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion South Asia is not alone. “In the northern hemisphere spring months, we are already seeing conditions in parts of the Middle East that are incompatible with human life,” said Mengaldo. “This is very serious for the populations … we also expect summer temperatures in Spain and France to reach unprecedented levels in the next few years,” he said. “Many of the events predicted for 2050 or 2070 are already happening. We underestimated the speed of change. What we’re seeing now is an acceleration – a failure of our predictive models.” David Faranda, a senior climate scientist with the French National Centre for Scientific Research and co-author of the report, said: “The only sustainable solution is to stop burning fossil fuels and reduce emissions. Without drastically reducing emissions and building climate resilience through better insulation, use of green energy, and other moves, the implications are alarming.” “Even if we act now, the climate system will take decades – sometimes over a century – to cool down,” Mengaldo added. “The sea level rise is already locked in for hundreds of years.” Both researchers stressed economic inequality and infrastructure played a critical role in determining who survives extreme heat. “There are different temperature thresholds – actual temperature, [humidity index] and others,” said Mengaldo. “Economic levels play a huge role in how people can cope and sustain themselves.” Delhi has updated its heat action plan, focusing on vulnerable groups such as elderly people, construction workers, and street vendors. But implementation is inconsistent. Faranda said adaptation was increasingly unaffordable for many heat-prone countries, with electricity grids buckling and causing widespread power cuts. “When multiple events occur, there’s often no escape,” he said. Mengaldo highlighted the need for innovation: “We need better-insulated housing, materials that prevent energy loss, and architectural designs that promote natural cooling. These can significantly reduce energy demand during extreme heat.” Faranda also said people must change their lifestyles. “Energy demand keeps increasing. If we want to survive the coming decades, we must not only build more renewables but also reduce energy consumption overall: through lifestyle changes, efficient architecture, and better materials.”",

    "title": "Schools in England and Wales urged to teach relationship violence prevention",
    "article_text": "A thinktank is calling for schools to appoint relationship violence prevention leaders, modelled on the success of mental health coordinators, as teachers say they are ill-equipped to advise on the complex issues involved. A study by theYouth Endowment Fund(YEF), supported by the Home Office, wants young teenagers in England and Wales to be taught “relationship violence prevention lessons”, aimed at tackling emotional, physical and sexual violence, psychological abuse, stalking and harassment. While schools in England have had statutory guidance on teaching relationships, sex and health education since 2020, Jon Yates, YEF’s chief executive, said too many pupils were still not receiving teaching on how to recognise healthy and unhealthy relationships or how to get out of damaging relationships. As a first step, the YEF is recommending a pilot scheme to give secondary schools £8,000 for a “violence against women and girls lead”, for training or external support, and to ensure that relationship lessons are upgraded. “One of the big challenges around implementation, in delivering these lessons across schools, is convincing teachers that they’re needed, that this happens to children, and we need to focus on it,” Yates said. “But schools can often be a bit nervous about advertising that they’re doing these sessions. They don’t want to advertise to prospective parents that they might have a problem with relationship violence. But the point is, this is everywhere.” Research by the YEF found nearly a third of teachers taking RSHE classes said they had never received any training, while more than a quarter said they were not confident teaching children how to leave an unhealthy relationship. Almost half said they struggled to explain how to intervene if children witness a sexual assault. Lucy Emmerson, the chief executive of theSex Education Forum, said its research found that only 50% of young people said their RSHE lessons were good or very good, despite recent improvements in the curriculum. “We’re finding that some topics like puberty are covered really well, young people say it’s done really well, and to some extent topics like consent. But topics like pornography and power imbalances in relationships, these are the kind of topics that young people very often say are inadequately covered or not covered at all,” Emmerson said. “That’s often where parents say it’s different from what they encountered as a child – they might remember their sex education being quite technical, quite focused on puberty and biology and not so much on ‘what does it feel like?’ ‘How do I manage my feelings?’ ‘How do I deal with rejection? ‘How can I understand what’s going on here?’” Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion The topics include how to recognise the signs of healthy and unhealthy relationships, and how to get help if needed, which Emmerson said were vital building skills for friendships as well as personal or sexual relationships. But the difficulty remained in getting the training and investment needed for teachers. “To do those so-called trickier topics really well, teachers need to be confident in this subject area, they need to be able to hold high-quality and open discussions with pupils and not just fact-based teaching around it,” Emmerson said. “Children and young people benefit hugely from the skills of listening to each other, to empathise, to respect each other and to negotiate and understand their emotions and express them. It’s not just learning some facts, it’s learning how to behave and respond.”",

    "title": "One in four patients in England find errors in medical records, watchdog says",
    "article_text": "Almost one in four patients inEnglandhave found mistakes in their medical records such as errors over their illness, drugs they have taken or treatment they have received. The blunders have led to patientsmissing out on diagnostic testsor treatment, being refused care or being given medication they did not need, research by an NHS watchdog has found. In some cases, their official medical history wrongly said they had illnesses they had never had. Healthwatch England, which revealed how often such inaccuracies occur in medical records, urged the NHS to do more to “get the basics right” when staff record details of patients and their care. In a representative survey of 1,800 adults living in England, 409 (23%) of them said they had come across mistakes or missing details, such as their name or date of birth, in their patient records. Some errors are so serious they could put patients at risk, for example by missing out on treatment they need, said Louise Ansari, Healthwatch’s chief executive. She said the body, which is the health service’s patient champion in England, commissioned the survey after patients told it of “alarming issues” with medical records. “Missed information and mistakes in medical records are frustrating and can put people’s health at risk. Sorting admin problems is not always easy and can be time-consuming, putting pressure on patients or their families,” Ansari said. Among the reported errors: 26% related to personal details such as name or date of birth. 16% involved medication a patient had taken. 9% of errors incorrectly listed a patient as having had a particular illness 9% said a patient had taken specific drugs to treat an ailment. Among that group, 10% said they had been given wrong or inappropriate medication as a result of the error, and 9% said they had received potentially unsafe care or treatment. One in eight (12%) said inaccurate or missing information had led to them being refused treatment. The Patients Association said errors in records, which can occur during care at a GP surgery or hospital, could result in “dangerous delays, misdiagnoses and missed care”. Rachel Power, the association’s chief executive, said: “Since January we’ve received over 100 helpline inquiries about this issue and our patient guide on accessing medical records has several hundred downloads. “Behind each of these errors is a real person facing anxiety and uncertainty about their care. Many of these cases involve incorrect or missing diagnoses and treatments, and callers tell us these errors are predominantly made in GP practices or sometimes in secondary care. “We understand theimmense pressurehealthcare professionals face. But inaccuracies like these can lead to dangerous delays, misdiagnoses and missed care, which is simply unacceptable and deeply concerning to patients. These record errors not only exacerbate illness but add significant stress during already difficult times.” She said patients must be able to trust that their medical records are correct and should not have to recount their medical history repeatedly or spend time seeking to correct their own records. Patients variously told Healthwatch about how errors in their records meant they were given a potentially wrong drug for their diabetes because their GP did not know they had a cyst, or were misinformed about ADHD medication because of an information mix-up involving their GP surgery and a private ADHD diagnostic service. National Voices, a coalition of health and care charities, said mistakes were so common in the paper and digital records theNHSmaintains that some were akin to “Swiss cheese records”. “There’s much talk about how shifting the NHS from analogue to digital will make it more efficient and effective. But realising this brave new future requires a solid foundation of accurate data, not Swiss cheese records, which are creating a mountain of problems for patients and clinicians,” said Jacob Lant, its chief executive. Prof Kamila Hawthorne, the chair of the Royal College ofGPs, said family doctors would be deeply concerned by the findings. “There may be many reasons for administrative errors occurring. But inadequate IT infrastructure, intense workloads and workforce pressures in general practice, high levels of unnecessary bureaucracy and poor communication between different parts of the health service all contribute to mistakes being made,” she said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “It is unacceptable that patients are missing out on vital treatments and tests simply because of errors with their medical records. “This government inherited an analogue NHS, but we’re committed to catapulting it into the digital age through our plan for change. We will create a health service fit for the future and put patients in control of their own medical history through a single patient record, summarising patient health information, test results and letters in one place via the NHS app.”",

    "article_text": "More than 400 actors and film industry professionals have signedan open letterpledging “solidarity” with the trans, non-binary and intersex communities who have been affected by the recent supreme court ruling.Eddie Redmayne, Katie Leung, Nicola Coughlan, Charlotte Ritchie and Paapa Essiedu are among those to have signed the letter addressing the film and television industry as well as cultural bodies.Bella Ramsey, James Norton, Joe Alwyn, Himesh Patel, Harris Dickinson and the director Ken Loach are also signatories.In mid-April, supreme court judgesunanimously ruledthe terms “woman” and “sex” in the Equality Act 2010 refer to a biological woman and biological sex.This means a gender recognition certificate (GRC) does not change a person’s legal sex for the purposes of the Equality Act.The ruling has been interpreted to mean that trans women can be excluded from women-only spaces like toilets and changing rooms.The open letter said: “We believe the ruling undermines the lived reality and threatens the safety of trans, non-binary, and intersex people living in the UK.” It added the film and television community had previously come together in response to the Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements by “reflecting” upon working practices and “uplifting” a broad spectrum of voices. “We must now urgently work to ensure that our trans, non-binary, and intersex colleagues, collaborators and audiences are protected from discrimination and harassment in all areas of the industry – whether on set, in a production office, or at a cinema.”The letter continued: “Film and television are powerful tools for empathy and education, and we believe passionately in the ability of the screen to change hearts and minds. This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history.”On Wednesday, the justice secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said it is “absolutely unacceptable” to question the validity of the supreme court ruling that the term “woman” is defined by biological sex.Giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights, Mahmood said: “They obviously provided the legal clarity in their legal decision, which is exactly their job.“I think it’s disappointing since then that some individuals have sought to question the validity of the supreme court or cast aspersions, which is absolutely unacceptable.“I think they’ve done their job and I think they’ve sought to do it in a way that recognises that we’re talking about a balance of rights, but sought to give confidence to a minority community that they still have protections.”Some trans rights groups have raised concerns about the practical implications of the ruling.",

    "title": "Starmer and Blair poles apart, an open goal at PMQs. Did KemiKaze score? | John Crace",
    "article_text": "On days like these,Keir Starmermight come to believe there is a God after all. Fair to say the prime minister has been under the cosh recently. His popularity ratings tanking as people continue to feel fed up that nothing still appears to be working as it should. The local elections on Thursday are unlikely to provide any joy for Labour with Reform ahead in several polls. Even the election of Mark Carney has been a mixed blessing. A reminder that some politicians get rewarded for taking a tough line on Agent Orange. The Lib Dems have declared themselves honorary Canadians. To cap it all, Tony Blairhad just published a report on climate policythat even his best friends might consider to have been “unhelpful”. Tony is a former politician who is unable to go gently into the dark night. Eighteen years after stepping down as prime minister, he still yearns for relevance. Attention, even. If he can’t be meaningful, he can at least be a contrarian. A thorn in Labour’s side, seeking retribution against imagined slights. AgainstLabourMPs, the overwhelming majority of whom weren’t even in parliament at the time he left. Some were even in primary school. But they must be punished nonetheless. For the thought crime of believing they could move on. Nothing less than total obedience and gratitude will do. Never forget who won three general elections. Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair. So you might have thought thatKemi Badenochwould have been keen to seize on the report from the Tony Blair Institute. After all, it’s not often that a Tory leader of the opposition finds herself more or less on the same side as Labour’s most successful prime minister. It’s even less often that Labour’s most successful prime minister finds himself Nigel Farage-adjacent. But that’s another story. For now, KemiKaze had an open goal. Six questions to exploit the gulf between Starmer and Blair. But Kemi turned the opportunity down. Maybe she had noticed that Tony had been doing some frantic back-pedalling after realising he had landed in the net zero sceptic camp. That when he had said phasing out fossil fuels in the short term was a strategy doomed to failure what he had really meant was that phasing out fossil fuels in the short term was a realistic endeavour. That he had only been highlighting the problems of developing countries and was totally on board with the Labour government’s focus on renewables and carbon capture. Maybe Kemi had noticed that almost every serious climate scientist had rushed out to rubbish Tony’s report and was having second thoughts about her own position? Unlikely. Reflection is not her style. Most likely, she had got an idea into her head and wouldn’t budge. This was how she rolled. Wake up. Eight double espressos – whichever was closest to hand – and sign in to X. There to join the rollercoaster wild west of conspiracy theories until she found something that suited her mood. That’s the only credible explanation. Because after Starmer had surprised everyone by starting with a gag that was actually funny –a dig at Robert Jenrickfor still running after his outing in the London marathon that creased up the Tory benches: it’s somehow reassuring to find there are so many Conservatives who find Honest Bob objectionable – Kemi used all six of her questions to call for a national inquiry into child abuse gangs. It wasn’t that the topic was not important. It is. The victims suffered horrific abuse. More, there wasn’t a clear reason why Badenoch had chosen to raise it at this Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions. If she hadn’t wanted to go on climate breakdown she could have done bin collections instead. After all, the local elections were the following day. But Kemi insisted on returning to a subject she first raised three months ago after Elon Musk became interested on social media. It goes without saying Elon has long since moved on. He never cared about the victims anyway. He just liked the attention. The frenzy. Nor did Kemi have anything new to say. There was no new information. No new angle of attack. And Keir could hardly believe his luck. He was off the hook. Because no one – with the possible exception of a few QAnon Reform voters – really believe that Starmer is trying to cover up the abuse. After all, as director of public prosecutions he was directly responsible for seeing that some of the perpetrators faced justice. Sign up toFirst Edition Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters after newsletter promotion Just as importantly, Starmer was able to lay out some fairly basic rebuttals to accusations of inaction. There had been a national inquiry, headed by Prof Alexis Jay, which had made 20 recommendations. None of which the Tories had implemented when they had been in government. Surely it made more sense to act upon the existing recommendations, rather than spending hundreds of millions on another inquiry which might come to the same conclusions? And if Kemi was hellbent on another inquiry, why hadn’t she and the Tories set it up when they had been in power? It was irrefutable logic, but Kemi kept coming back at Starmer again and again. Hoping for what? That he might crack? Unlikely. It all made for a strange impasse. Deja vu. And it left a rather nasty taste in the mouth. Because you couldn’t help feeling that this was all happening at the victims’ expense. They had suffered once at the hands of their abusers. Now they were being used for political advantage. The rest of the session was low-key. No real fireworks. Notable mainly for Tory MPs promoting their VE Day celebrations. Bernard Jenkin tried to drum up interest in a choral evening and sounded almost apologetic that they would be singing some works by German composers on such a patriotic evening. He needn’t have worried. Some of us gladly listen to Bach. Mark Francois hoped for some dosh for a Vera Lynn statue. “Hopefully, we’ll meet again,” he said. Starmer said they would. Though he didn’t sound thrilled by the prospect. All the while, Victoria Starmer looked on impassively from the visitor’s gallery. She gave nothing away. Not even a smile at her husband’s jokes. She’s a tough audience. Also watching on was the erstwhile pop singer, Chesney Hawkes. At least that’s who he said he was. How were the rest of us supposed to know?",

    "title": "Blair’s net zero intervention invites  scrutiny of his institute’s donors",
    "article_text": "In little more than 1,600 words voicinghis scepticism over net zero policies, Tony Blair this week propelled himself and his increasingly powerful institute back into the national debate. In the past eight years, the former prime minister has built a global empire employing more than 900 people across more than 40 countries,providing policy advice to monarchs, presidents and prime ministers. But while Blair’s thinktank has brought him influence in his post-Downing Street career, it has also renewed scrutiny on his political views and how they are shaped by his commercial relationships. The Labour MP James Frith said on Wednesday: “I give congratulations to the marketing department at theTony BlairInstitute (TBI), who have managed to time it brilliantly to get maximum coverage.” Patrick Galey, the head of fossil fuel investigations at the nongovernmental organisation Global Witness, said: “Blair’s well-documented links to petrostates and oil and gas companies ought to alone be enough to disqualify this man as an independent and reliable arbiter of what’s possible or commonsense in the energy transition.” AnotherLabourMP, who did not want to be named, said: “The TBI is a bunch of tech bros who don’t care about social justice or fairness.” The TBI declined to comment on these criticisms, but said the institute was editorially independent. Blair first set up the institute eight years ago with a plan to take money from high-rolling donors and foreign governments and plough it into policy analysis and philanthropic work. Much of its policy work promotes technology and artificial intelligence as the solution to challenges facing governments around the world. Those stances have attracted some scepticism from critics, however, given the institute gets much of its money from people connected to the technology industry. One of the TBI’s biggest sources of cash is the foundation set up by Larry Ellison, the billionaire founder of Oracle and ally of the US president, Donald Trump.Filings in the US showthe foundation gave the TBI more than £52m in 2023 and had promised another $218m (£163m). Like many technology companies, Oracle is investing heavily in AI products, including tools for improving healthcare. Ellison has also spokenin favour of using AI for the mass surveillance of civilian populations. Blair’s policy proposals dovetail with Oracle’s corporate interests in other areas too. In his foreword tothe net zero report, he writes: “The new generation of small modular reactors offers hope for the renaissance of nuclear power, but it needs integrating into nations’ energy policy.” Ellisonannounced last yearthat Oracle was designing a new datacentre to be powered by three small modular reactors. The TBI has also worked with fossil fuel companies and petrostates, including signing amultimillion pound dealto advise the Saudi government. Last year, the institute advised Azerbaijan, the oil-rich state which controversiallyhosted the Cop29 climate conference. The TBI says its policies are often focused on helping bolster public services in developing countries. Benedict Macon-Cooney, the institute’s chief policy strategist, told the Guardian in 2023: “There is no conflict of interest and donations are ringfenced.” Longtime Blair allies meanwhile are divided on whether the former prime minister has always harboured doubts about climate policies. Sign up toDown to Earth The planet's most important stories. Get all the week's environment news - the good, the bad and the essential after newsletter promotion Nicholas Stern, whom Blair commissioned in 2006 to write an influential report on the economics of climate change, said: “I think Tony Blair has got a very good track record on climate change, which makes me slightly puzzled by this piece of work. I don’t think this is the Tony Blair Institute’s finest hour.” Another former adviser and colleague however said: “Blair always had to be dragged along when it came to climate change. He was generally resistant to green arguments.” Meanwhile the former prime minister has also been cultivating relationships with Labour MPs, holding a series of roundtable discussions with small groups of MPs over the last year. One MP who had attended one meeting said: “His message was that technology companies have deep pockets and so are going to be able to drive change faster than governments can. That message was pretty unhelpful politically and the exact opposite of what the Labour government is trying to tell people.” Others in the Labour party, however, believe he is providing a useful service in making Labour think again about some of its more radical climate policies. “Blair was making a point about the purpose of our energy policy,” said one. “He needs to work on his timing but the point is right – energy security and reducing bills are the goals of UK energy policy because they benefit working people. Everything else is subsidiary to that.”",

    "article_text": "King Charles has reflected on his experience with cancer, saying it brought into “sharp focus the very best of humanity”, while acknowledging that each new case is “a daunting and at times frightening experience” for those receiving a diagnosis and for their loved ones. In a personal written message, released to coincide with a Buckingham Palace reception celebrating organisations that help people with the disease, he described himself as one of the “statistics” among the 390,000 who “sadly” receive a cancer diagnosis in the UK each year. He said it “can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity”. He told representatives of cancer charities: “You have my whole family’s deepest admiration.” Charles, 76, who isstill undergoing treatmentmore than a year after his diagnosis, said his cancer journey had given him “an even deeper appreciation of the extraordinary work” of the charities. He added that it had reinforced how “the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion”. He hailed the late Dame Deborah James as an inspiration, quoting her final message and encouraging everyone to follow her example: “Find a life worth enjoying; take risks; love deeply; have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope.” James died in June 2022 at the age of 40, five years after she was diagnosed with bowel cancer. Her Bowelbabe fund has raised more than £16m since its launch. His message was printed in a booklet given to guests at the palace’s evening reception, including James’s parents Heather and Alistair. A royal source said there was no update on the king’s condition or treatment, but that it continued in a “very positive direction”, reflected in his “very full” national and international diary. They described the words and subject of the message as “deeply personal” for the king.",

    "title": "Trump’s loyal footsoldiers doff their Maga caps at cabinet love-in",
    "article_text": "There were navy blue and red baseball caps up and down the table, strategically placed in front of every cabinet member, and each bearing the message “Gulf of America”. Yet the unorthodox collection of headwear, embroidered with Donald Trump’s forced new name for the centuries-old Gulf of Mexico, was far from the most bizarre aspect of an extraordinary White House gathering hosted by the president on Wednesday. The cabinet meeting to commemorate the first 100 days of Trump’s second term was,in the view of some social media commentators, something more akin to a gathering of Kim Jong-un loyalists in North Korea, each successive speaker trying to outshine the other in heaping lavish praise on their dear leader. There was the sight of Elon Musk,the outgoing headof the unofficial “department of government efficiency”, placing one of the red Gulf of America hats on top of the Doge one he was already wearing. There was also an outing for a favorite Maga – Make America Great Again – conspiracy theory, with the health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, repeating thedebunked claimthat 300,000 unaccompanied migrant children were somehow “lost” by the Biden administration. Pam Bondi, Trump’s hand-picked attorney general, played the role of chief cheerleader, causing the president to nod his head as she commended him. “Mr President, your first 100 days has far exceeded that of any other presidency in this country ever, ever,” she gushed. “[I’ve] never seen anything like it, thank you.” Recalling her Tuesday visit to the Drug Enforcement Administration she added: “They said to me you, Donald Trump, have taken the handcuffs off of DEA agents.” It was, however, some peculiar allegations made by Kennedy concerning the Biden-era health and human services (HHS) department that really raised eyebrows, coming soon after “loud quacks” from the health secretary’s duck-themed cellphone ringtone interrupted Trump, the Associated Press reported. “We have ended HHS, as the role as effector, the principal effector in this country, for child trafficking,” Kennedy said. He went on: “During the Biden administration HHS became a collaborator in child trafficking for sex and for slavery. And we have ended that and we are very aggressively going out and trying to find these children, 300,000 children that were lost by the Biden administration.” During his campaign for the 2024 election, Trump repeatedlymisrepresented government datato falsely claim that 300,000 migrant children who crossed the border unaccompanied had gone missing, and said many of them were trafficked or likely to be dead. The children were not in fact lost or missing. HHS data recorded only the numbers crossing the border, and tracking ceased when they were placed in homes and communities with relatives already in the US. Kennedy did not expand on the “aggressive” efforts his department was making to try to find children who were actually never missing. Much of the rest of the two-hour meeting, and a question-and-answer session with the media, was consumed by Trump talking up the perceived accomplishments of his first 100 days. He attempted to distance himself from Tuesday’sbleak economic datathat suggests the US could be heading for a recession on the back of his tariff policies: “I’m not taking a credit or discredit for the stock market,” he said. “I’m just saying we inherited a mess.” Yet when the stock market was soaring during the final year of Biden’s presidency, Trumpfrequently insistedit was because investors were buoyant at the prospect of him returning to the White House. The president was asked by a reporter on Wednesday if he had spoken with Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, about the tariffs that have sparked a potentially costly trade war between the countries, and have led topredictions of empty shelvesbefore the end of the year as imports dry up. Trump said he had not, and offered his own prediction as to how Christmas might look for American families. “Somebody said,‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,” he said. “So maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally.” The Associated Press contributed to this report",

    "title": "Democrats rally at US Capitol to decry ‘failure’ of Trump’s first 100 days",
    "article_text": "Dozens of Democratic lawmakers gathered on the steps of the Capitol on Wednesday to accuseDonald Trumpof spending his first100 daysdamaging the US economy and democracy with the help of “complicit” congressional Republicans. The speeches by party leaders served as a counterpoint to Trump’s insistence ata rally in Michiganthe night before that he has “delivered the most profound change in Washington in nearly 100 years” with an administration focused on mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, the dismantling of parts of the federal government and the levying of tariffs on major US trading partners. Democrats, meanwhile, are still reeling from a disappointing performance in last November’s elections but believe that as the economy’s health showssigns of flaggingand GOP lawmakers get to work on what is expected to be a significant piece of legislation toextend tax cuts while slashing the social safety net, they have an opportunity to regain voters’ trust. “Donald Trump’s first 100 days can be defined by one big F-word: failure. Failure on the economy, failure on lowering costs, failure on tariffs, failure on foreign policy, failure on preserving democracy, failure on helping middle-class families,” the top Senate DemocratChuck Schumersaid from the Capitol steps. He went on to characterize Republican lawmakers, few of whom have broken publicly with the president since his 20 January inauguration, as “co-conspirators. They are complicit. They are aiding and abetting all of Donald Trump’s failures. They’re not standing up to him once they’re involved and they will shoulder the blame.” The party gathered hours after the release of economic data that showedthe US economy shrankin the first three months of this year, which lawmakers said was evidence Trump had broken the promise of prosperity he made to American voters. “A hundred days into this presidency, we’ve gone from three years of solid growth in our economy to the steepest decline that we’ve seen since the pandemic. That’s the truth,” said the Delaware senator Lisa Blunt Rochester. “Groceries are up, retirement savings are down, that’s the truth. Outbreaks ofmeaslesand theavian flu, that’s the truth.” More than 1,300 days remain in Trump’s presidency, butDemocratsare eyeing a resurgence in next November’s midterm elections. A return to a majority in the House is within reach, as the current GOP majority is just three votes, a historically low margin. Earlier in the day, the House minority leaderHakeem Jeffriessaid that the party can only do so much without controlling at least one chamber of Congress, but promised change as soon as they returned to the majority. “As Democrats, we will fight as hard as we can the next two years to stop bad things from happening. We will protect our system of free and fair elections, and then work hard to convince the American people to entrust us the majority next November,” Jeffries said at a speech at aWashington DCtheater. Sign up toHeadlines US Get the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning after newsletter promotion “At that point, we will be able to do much, much more for you,” Jeffries said, promising to “block any budget that goes after your social security, Medicare or Medicaid” and “hold theTrump administrationaccountable for its corrupt abuse of power”. Trump’s 100th day in office came not long after major polls showed hisapproval rating had dropped well belong 50%, fueled by concerns over his economic policies but also some wariness over his aggressive approach to immigration enforcement, which has seen high-profiles cases of foreigners being removed from the countryon questionable grounds. Yet the Democrats have their own rebuilding to do. Recent surveys have indicated that voters are sour on the party, with a CNN poll released last month findingits approval ratinghas never been lower. The House Democratic caucus chair Pete Aguilar signaled that the party plans to put economic concerns at the heart of its pitch to voters as it eyes rebuilding legislative majorities in 2026. “We’re going to focus on making life more affordable, making life easier for everyday Americans in these next 100 days and at every turn, until we flip the House and we flip the Senate and we put a check on the Trump administration’s reckless economic policies,” Aguilar said.",

    "title": "Meta’s quarterly earnings beat Wall Street expectations as its AI investments rise by billions",
    "article_text": "Metareported earnings on Wednesday, beating Wall Street’s expectations for yet another quarter even as it lavishes billions on artificial intelligence. Meta posted $42.32bn in revenue in the first quarter of 2025, beating both its own quarterly revenue goals of $41.8bn at the higher end and Wall Street expectations of $41.38bn. The company also reported $6.43 in earnings per share, beating Wall Street projections of $5.27. Shares jumped in after-hours trading. “We’ve had a strong start to an important year, our community continues to grow and our business is performing very well,” said Meta’s chief executive,Mark Zuckerberg. “We’re making good progress on AI glasses and Meta AI, which now has almost 1bn monthly actives.” Speaking on the investor call, Zuckerberg said the company was performing well and its platforms were growing, making it “well-positioned to navigate” any macroeconomic uncertainty. “I continue to think this year is going to be a pivotal moment in our industry,” he said. This continues Meta’s streak of beating Wall Streetexpectationsover the past few quarters. However, it is unclear if it will be enough to quell investor concerns. Analysts were disappointed by the first quarter revenue outlook Zuckerberg shared at the end of 2024. The company has also updated its outlook on spending for the next year with plans to spend anywhere from $64-72bn in capital expenditures including the cost of building out AI infrastructure. That is up from $65bn the company originally said it was expecting to spend in 2025. Total costs and expenditures for the first quarter were already at $24.76bn, a 9% increase compared to the year prior. Uncertainty over Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs may yet roil ad markets, clouding the company’s financial outlook for near future quarters. EMarketersenior analyst Minda Smiley said the company’s “optimistic Q2 guidance signals that the company isn’t expecting any major dips in ad revenue” as a result of the tariffs. But that they don’t expect Meta will be spared from the downturn in the long term. “On the one hand, the company stands to gain from economic instability. Advertisers will allocate more ad dollars to proven, sophisticated networks like Facebook and Instagram – all while pulling back spend on smaller social platforms – while they navigate uncertainty,” Smiley said. “On the other hand, a small but significant portion of Meta’s revenue comes from Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein advertising to US shoppers. That spend is starting to dry up as a result of trade and tariff change.” Meta’s spending also continues to “weigh heavily on investors”, according to analyst Debra Aho Williamson, the founder and chief analyst of Sonata Insights. “But Meta will resist directly monetizing AI this year, focusing instead on building AI usage among its app users, advertisers and developers using Llama,” said Williamson. Sign up toTechScape A weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives after newsletter promotion In the weeks leading up to the earnings report, Meta has had a mix of AI-related news including the launch of a standalone AI app that would serve as its ChatGPT competitor. But aWSJ reportexposed the existing chatbots integrated into the company’s various products, including Facebook and Instagram, were given the ability to perform “romantic role play” even with the platforms’ teen users. Executives at the company, which repeatedly has touted its nearly 1 billion users of its AI chatbots, alsoadmitthat many of those users access the chatbot through its hard-to-avoid takeover of the search bars of WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. The company has not detailed how many interactions with the chatbot or how deep those interactions need to be to consider a person a user of the AI chatbot. Paired with Meta’songoing antitrust trial– where the company faces claims that it built an illegal social media monopoly with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp – the uncertain AI future adds to the concerns some analysts may have around Meta’s financials despite what it may look like on paper. “Meta’s earnings call comes at a precarious time where the company’s future is literally beingdebated in court– the results of which could fundamentally alter the social media landscape,” said Forrester VP’s research director,Mike Proulx. “Meta is smart to direct more resources into improving Threads and Facebook since those could be the only two apps the company is left with. It’s also notable that Meta just laid off a number of employees in its Reality Labs division, which has been a continued and growing leaky bucket for Meta.”",

    "title": "South Africa to hold inquiry on alleged hampering of apartheid prosecutions",
    "article_text": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has ordered an inquiry to establish whether previous governments led by his party intentionally blocked investigations and prosecutions ofapartheid-era crimes, taking a step that survivors and families of those who were killed had demanded for decades. The landmark move will address allegations of “improper influence in delaying or hindering” investigations levelled against post-apartheid governments led by the African National Congress (ANC) party, Ramaphosa’s office said in a statement on Wednesday. “President Ramaphosa appreciates the anguish and frustration of the families of victims, who have fought for so many years for justice,” Ramaphosa’s office said. The president’s announcement of a judicial commission of inquiry came after 25 survivors and relatives of victims of apartheid-era crimeslaunched a court caseagainst his government in January, seeking damages. They alleged that successive South African governments since the late 1990s had failed to properly investigate unresolved killings, disappearances and other crimes during the time of forced racial segregation despite recommendations made by the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission. The commission was set up in 1996 by then-President Nelson Mandela under the chairmanship of fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu. Its mission was to expose and record apartheid-era crimes and give some of those responsible an opportunity to confess their role, including members of the apartheid government’s state security forces that were implicated in many killings. The ANC was the organisation at the forefront of the battle against the system of white minority rule and led South Africa to democracy when apartheid ended in 1994. But ANC-led governments since then have been criticised by some for prioritising national reconciliation ahead of justice for victims. One of the most prominent unresolved cases is that of theCradock Four, a group of Black anti-apartheid activists who were abducted and murdered by security forces in 1985. Their bodies were burned and security officers were suspected of torturing them. No one has been prosecuted for the killings, and the circumstances of the deaths have never been fully revealed. These are among the thousands of crimes during apartheid where victims and families still haven’t seen justice. Lukhanyo Calata, whose father Fort was one of the Cradock Four, is part of the group that took the current South African government to court in January. Calata said at the start of that court case that successive South African governments since the administration of President Thabo Mbeki from 1999-2008 had failed to act on the commission’s recommendations and had denied victims and their families justice. He and other relatives say that government ministers intervened to prevent the investigation and prosecution of crimes.",

    "title": "Barcelona, Inter Milan, Yamal deliver 3-3 Champions League semi thriller",
    "article_text": "Barcelona and Inter Milan shareda compelling 3-3 drawin a high-octane Champions League semifinal first leg clash. The Italian side raced to a two-goal lead on Wednesday with superb strikes from Marcus Thuram and Denzel Dumfries, before the unstoppable Lamine Yamal pulled Barca back into it with a sublime solo effort. Ferran Torres levelled for the five-time champions and, although Inter nosed ahead through Dumfries again, a Yann Sommer own goal left the tie on a knife-edge at the halfway stage. Inter were desperately hoping Thuram would be fit to play after a thigh injury, and he showed precisely why, scoring the fastest-ever Champions League semifinal goal after 30 seconds. Barcelona’s Copa del Rey final-winning goalscorer Jules Kounde hacked a poor clearance to the edge of the box, and Inter capitalised. Dutch wideman Dumfries aimed a low cross towards Thuram and Inigo Martinez slipped at just the wrong time, allowing the France striker room to finish with an impudent back-heel flick. Quadruple-chasing Barcelona seized control and pushed forward, roared on by a nervous 50,000-strong Olympic stadium crowd. Yamal, on his 100th Barcelona appearance, appealed for a penalty after he was shoved by Alessandro Bastoni and then set up Torres, who fired wide. The Spaniard, standing in for Barca’s injured top goalscorer Robert Lewandowski, lashed a volley narrowly off target. Against the run of play Inter, whose treble hopes crumbled after three consecutive domestic defeats prior, scored their second, with another fine finish. Francesco Acerbi nodded on a corner, and Dumfries reached the dropping ball first to score with a stunning acrobatic effort. Barcelona teams over the past few years may have crumbled, but Hansi Flick’s youthful side are not burdened by the series of European failures since they last won the competition in 2015. Least of all teenage wizard Yamal, who pulled Barcelona back into the game just three minutes later with a wonderful individual goal that made him the youngest player ever to score in the semis. On the eve of the game, the Spaniard rejected comparisons to all-time Barca great Lionel Messi, but his goal was straight from the Argentinian’s playbook. Yamal shook off Thuram, floated inside from the right flank and past Henrikh Mkhitaryan into the box, drawing defenders towards him, but before they could stop him, stroked an inch-perfect shot in off the left post. Minutes later, Yamal nearly repeated the trick. This time, he darted outside, pausing to let Federico Dimarco lunge past him and off the pitch. From a tight angle, the youngster flashed a shot that Sommer tipped onto the crossbar. High on confidence, Yamal set up further chances for Torres and Dani Olmo that went begging, before Barca pulled level. Pedri hooked a ball into the area for Raphinha to head across goal and Torres to convert from close range after 38 breathless minutes. Kounde limped off before half-time in a blow for Barca, who also replaced the inexperienced Gerard Martin with Ronald Araujo at the break. Dimarco hammered over early in the second half, before Simone Inzaghi hooked him, having suffered a torrid night up against the relentless Yamal. Inter took the sting out of the game early in the second half and then sucker-punched Barca, scoring from another corner, with Dumfries’s header bouncing in off Olmo. Barcelona equalised within two minutes, with Yamal stepping over a corner on the edge of the box, allowing it to run to Raphinha. The Brazilian’s rasping effort smashed against the crossbar and then in, off the back of the unfortunate diving Sommer’s head. Pau Cubarsi made a vital recovery tackle to stop Thuram after he got in behind Barcelona’s high line, and Mkhitaryan had a goal ruled out for an extremely tight offside. Yamal looped a second strike onto the crossbar late on, but the sides could not be separated. The second leg takes place in Milan next Tuesday, with the winner to face Paris Saint-Germain or Arsenal on May 31 in the Munich final.",

    "article_text": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions after last week’s attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, according to the US Department of State. In separate calls with Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Wednesday, Rubio expressed support to India in combating “terrorism” and urged Pakistan to cooperate in probing the attack, the State Department said. Sharif’s office said in a statement that the Pakistani leader urged Washington to press India to “dial down the rhetoric and act responsibly”. He also expressed regret that India had chosen to “weaponise water” by stepping away from theIndus Waters Treaty, which does not permit unilateral withdrawal from its commitments governing river flows in disputed Kashmir. The call came after Islamabad claimed to have “credible intelligence” that India wasplanning to attackit within 24-36 hours, in retaliation for the killing of 26 men in last week’sdeadly attackon tourists in Indian-controlled Kashmir. India has moved to punish Pakistan after accusing it of backing the attack in the Kashmiri town of Pahalgam, which Islamabad denies, driving tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals to their highest point since asuicide car bombing in 2019. New Delhi shut its airspace to Pakistani airlines, the government said on Wednesday, days after Islamabad banned Indian airlines from flying over its territory. The ban on Pakistani aircraft will be in effect from April 30 to May 23, according to a Notice to Air Missions (NOTAM) issued by the government. Indian and Pakistani troops haveexchanged small-arms fireover the past six nights, which New Delhi says was initiated by the Pakistani side across their de facto border running through Kashmir. No casualties were reported. Hindu-majority India accuses Pakistan of funding and encouraging armed groups in Kashmir, a Himalayan territory claimed in its entirety by both nations but ruled in part by each of them. Islamabad says it only provides moral and diplomatic support to a Kashmiri demand for self-determination. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in separate phone calls with India and Pakistan officials, stressed the need to “avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences”. Britain has also called for calm between its Indian and Pakistani communities, and advised against all travel to Jammu and Kashmir – India’s official name for the territory – with few exceptions.",

    "title": "Syria says it rejects ‘foreign intervention’ after Israeli strikes",
    "article_text": "Syrian authorities have decried “foreign intervention” in Syrian affairs after Israel launched air attacks on a town near Damascus where government forces and several other groups had taken part indeadly clashes. A Syrian Ministry of Interior source told Al Jazeera Arabic that at least four Israeli air strikes targeted security personnel in the mainly Druze town of Ashrafieh Sahnaya on Wednesday. The Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Expatriates, in a statement, rejected “all forms of foreign intervention”, but did not explicitly accuse Israel of carrying out the attacks. Syria “affirms its unwavering commitment to protect all components of the Syrian people … including the children of the honourable Druze community,” the Foreign Ministry added in its statement. Israel said it had carried out a strike in Syria against so-called “extremists” who attacked members of the Druze community, following through on what it said was a promise to protect the minority group. The military said that three Syrian Druze citizens had been evacuated from Syria to receive medical treatment in Israel. The strikes came following confrontations between Syrian government loyalists and members of the Druze military council that killed dozens of people in two days. The director of security for the Damascus countryside, Hussam al-Tahhan, told Syria’s state-run SANA news agency that a security operation was launched there and that reinforcements were sent to ensure the return of “security and stability” to the area’s neighbourhoods. At least 16 security forces and six fighters were killed on Wednesday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor. At least 17 people, including 10 security forces, were killed on Tuesday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the strike on the town of Ashrafieh Sahnaya sent a “stern message” to Syria’s new government, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. “Israel expects them to act to prevent harm to the Druze community”, he said. Israel’s armed forces chief later ordered the military to prepare to strike Syrian government targets if the Druze community faces more violence. Syrian Druze leaders have repeatedly rejected Israeli intervention and declared their loyalty to a united Syria. The latest violence erupted on Tuesday with clashes between Druze and Sunni groups in the predominantly Druze area of Jaramana, ignited by an audio clip attacking the Prophet Muhammad that was circulated on social media. The recording was attributed to a Druze leader. The spiritual authority for the Druze community in Jaramana condemned the recording, insisting it was fabricated “to incite sedition and sow division among the people of the same nation”. Syria’s new rulers, former opposition fighters who led the rebellion that overthrew longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December, have struggled to maintain security for the country’s minorities, despite urging national unity and inclusivity. Since al-Assad was overthrown in December, Israel has launched hundreds of strikes into Syria, stepping up attacks that it also carried out routinely in previous years, and hasdeployed troopsto a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone on the occupied Golan Heights. The latest incidents only serve to increase the sectarian tension in Syria, with minorities already on edge following horrifying bloodshed last month. After al-Assad loyalists from the Alawite community clashed with security forces in March,hundreds of peoplewere killed in a wave of vigilante attacks in the northern areas of Tartous and Latakia governorates. Residents of Sahnaya reported intense street fighting throughout Wednesday. “We’re in extreme panic and fear because of the indiscriminate shelling, which is forcing most of us to stay totally shuttered inside our homes,” said Elias Hanna, who lives on the edge of Sahnaya. “We’re worried that the massacres of the coast will repeat themselves near Sahnaya against the Druze,” he said. Geir Pedersen, UN special envoy to Syria, is “deeply concerned” by violence in the country, especially in the suburbs of the capital Damascus and in Homs,” the United Nations said. He called for immediate measures to ensure the protection of civilians and prevent incitement of communal tensions. The UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement he was “deeply concerned by Israel’s airstrikes on Syrian territory” and called on “all concerned to exercise utmost restraint”. Turkiye’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs demanded that Israel “cease its aerial strikes” on Syria. “At this sensitive time for Syria, the duty of the international community is to contribute to the establishment of security and stability in Syria,” ministry spokesperson Oncu Keceli said in a statement. “Given this context, Israel must put an end to its air strikes, which are damaging the country’s efforts to achieve unity and integrity.”",

    "title": "US diplomat Marco Rubio will not provide info to judge about deported man",
    "article_text": "United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated the administration of President Donald Trump may flout a judge’s order requiring it to provide information about efforts to return awrongly deportedman from El Salvador. At a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the top diplomat was asked if he had formally requested the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from El Salvador. Rubio responded, “I would never tell you that. And you know who else I’d never tell? A judge.” He added that he does not feel bound by the court order. “Because the conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the president of the United States and the executive branch, not some judge.” The statements underscored the Trump administration’s defiant stance towards judicial checks on its power. In the case of Abrego Garcia, US District Judge Paula Xinis had ordered government lawyers to offer updates about measures the Trump administration had taken to return Abrego Garcia to the US. On April 15, she announced she would seek sworn testimony about those efforts from administration officials. But Xinis temporarily halted the directive last week at the administration’s request. With the pause expiring at 5pm on Wednesday (21:00 GMT), she has scheduled new deadlines in May for administration officials to provide sworn testimony about what had been done to retrieve Abrego Garcia. A resident of Maryland, Abrego Garcia has been held in El Salvador since March 15, when he was among the immigrants placed on a deportation flight and transferred to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a maximum-security prison. He has since been transferred to another facility, according to Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who visited Abrego Garcia in detention. The deportation violated an immigration judge’s 2019 order barring his deportation on the basis that he would face persecution from local gangs. Abrego Garcia and his family have said he fled El Salvador at age 16, after gangs pursued him for recruitment. He arrived in the US without documentation. Given the 2019 protection order, the US government initially acknowledged that Abrego Garcia’s deportation had been the result of an “administrative error”. But in the wake of the public outcry the case has caused, the Trump White House has since doubled down on its position that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang and will never be allowed to live in the US. “Nothing will ever change the fact that Abrego Garcia will never be a Maryland father. He will never live in the United States of America again,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this month. While Abrego Garcia has not been charged with any crimes, the White House has pointed to his tattoos as evidence of gang affiliation, something experts on MS-13 havecast doubt upon. The administration also has referenced past allegations against Abrego Garcia from an anonymous informant, but his lawyers say those accusations are false and reference gang membership in New York, a state he has never lived in. Earlier this month, Judge Xinis initially ordered the US government to “facilitate and effectuate the return of” Abrego Garcia no later than April 7. After an appeal, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must indeed “facilitate”, not “effectuate”, the return, though it did not specify the minimum requirements to comply with its order. Furthermore, the high court sided with Xinis’s determination that Abrego Garcia had been denied due process during his deportation. Still, Trump officials have repeatedly said the Supreme Court had backed their appeal. They also maintainit is up to El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia, a prospect the country’s leader, President Nayib Bukele, had previously dismissed. “How can I return him to the United States?” Bukele said at an Oval Office sit-down earlier this month. “Should I smuggle him into the United States? Of course, I’m not going to do it. The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don’t have the power to return him to the United States.” But Trump has given contradictory signals about his government’s position on the matter, and whether he is indeed empowered to seek Abrego Garcia’s return. In an interview with ABC News that aired on Tuesday, the US president was asked if he could unilaterally bring back Abrego Garcia. Trump responded: “I could.” “And if he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that,” Trump added. “But he is not.” But when asked on Wednesday during the cabinet meeting if Bukele would release Abrego Garcia if Trump requested, the president baulked. “I really don’t know, I know that he’s been a great friend of our country,” he said. “I haven’t spoken to him. I really leave that to the lawyers. I take my advice from [Attorney General] Pam [Bondi], they know the laws.”",

    "title": "US judge limits Trump’s push to rapidly deport migrants in Guantanamo Bay",
    "article_text": "A federal judge in the United States has placed limits on the Trump administration’s efforts to deport migrants held in Guantanamo Bay with few protections. In a ruling on Thursday, District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued an order stating that the administration must give migrants an opportunity to raise concerns about the safety of the countries where they are being deported. The ruling is the latest to advance concerns about the legality of Trump’s hardline moves on immigration and expansive interpretations of executive power. The order is a victory for immigrant rights advocates who alleged that the administration had violated a previous court order by flying four Venezuelans held in the US military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba toEl Salvador, although it remains to be seen how the White House will respond. The administration challenged that order by arguing that it only applied to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), not the Department of Defense, which carried out the flight in question. The Department of Justice has said that three of the four Venezuelans sent to El Salvador, where the administration has sent migrants to be warehoused in Salvadoran prisons, where abusive conditions and torture are widely alleged, are members of theTren De Aragua gang, but it has frequently made similar claims with little evidence. Immigrant rights groups have alleged that migrants are being held in Guantanamo Bay, previously used as a detention centre and torture site during the so-called “global war on terror”, in conditions of extreme isolation and without legal counsel. “Officers at Guantanamo have created a climate of extreme fear and intimidation where immigrant detainees are afraid to communicate freely with their counsel,” a lawsuit brought on behalf of two Nicaraguan being held at Guantanamo states. The complaint states that some detainees were interrogated about alleged gang affiliations while surrounded by military officers.",

    "title": "Columbia protest leader Mohsen Mahdawi released from US custody",
    "article_text": "A United States judge has ordered the release of Columbia University student and pro-Palestine protesterMohsen Mahdawias a case challenging his deportation proceeds. In Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday, US District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ruled Mahdawi could leave the Northwest State Correctional Facility, where he had been held since immigration officials arrested him earlier this month. Mahdawi walked out of the court with both hands in the air, flashing peace signs as supporters greeted him with cheers. As he spoke, he shared a message for President Donald Trump, whose administration has led a crackdown on student protesters who have denounced Israel’s war in Gaza. “I am not afraid of you,” Mahdawi said to Trump. He also addressed the people of Palestine and sought to dispel perceptions that the student protest movement was anything but peaceful. “We are pro-peace and antiwar,” Mahdawi explained. “To my people in Palestine: I feel your pain, I see your suffering, and I see freedom, and it is very soon.” Mahdawi, a legal US resident who had been a leader in the protests at Columbia University, was detained on April 14 while attending a citizenship interview. Video of him being led away in handcuffs spread widely across social media. His arrest came as part of a wider push by the Trump administration totargetvisa holders and permanent residents for their pro-Palestine advocacy. Trump has alsopressuredtop universities to crack down on pro-Palestine protests, in the name of combating anti-Semitism. Critics, however, say that rationale is an excuse to exert greater control over academia and stifle opposing views. Mohsen Mahdawi was just released on bail by a federal judge in Vermont.pic.twitter.com/sgtNyfeYmU — Katherine Franke (@ProfKFranke)April 30, 2025 While the immigration case against Mahdawi will proceed, Judge Crawford ruled the student activist posed no flight risk and could be released to attend his graduation next month in New York City. It is possible the US government may appeal Mahdawi’s release, but the judge’s ruling allows him to leave the state of Vermont and fight his deportation from outside a detention facility. The Trump administration, however, had opposed his release. Its lawyers argued that Mahdawi’s detention was “constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process”. Mahdawi’s lawyers have countered that his detainment treads on his constitutional rights to free speech. “Mohsen has committed no crime, and the government’s only supposed justification for holding him in prison is the content of his speech,” Lia Ernst, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union who is representing Mahdawi, said in a statement following his release. The Trump administration has taken the broad position that constitutional speech protections only apply to US citizens, a question that could eventually be decided by the US Supreme Court. In court filings, government lawyers have cited the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 as the legal basis for seeking Mahdawi’s deportation. Ararely used part of the lawallows the US to deport foreign nationals “whose presence or activities in the United States” gives the secretary of state “reasonable ground to believe [they] would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences”. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has used that provision as the basis for seeking to deport Mahdawi and other pro-Palestinian student protesters. Israel is a critical ally of the US in the Middle East. Mahdawi was arrested weeks after fellow Columbia University student Mahmoud Khalil, also a US permanent resident. In early March, Khalil was likewisedetainedby immigration officials. The pair co-founded the Palestinian Student Union at the prestigious Ivy League university. Khalil has remained in immigration custody in Louisiana since his arrest outside his apartment. Earlier this month, an immigration judge ruled Khalil was indeed deportable, siding with government lawyers. In a two-page letter submitted to the court, Secretary of State Rubio had written that the 30-year-old should be removed from the US for his role in “antisemitic protests and disruptive activities, which fosters a hostile environment for Jewish students in the United States”. The Trump administration has broadly portrayed nearly all forms of pro-Palestine advocacy as “anti-Semitic”, in what critics have called an effort to silence freedom of speech. Rubio provided no further evidence backing his claims against Khalil, and the student leader has been charged with no crime. Rubio’s letter nevertheless said that his department can revoke a permanent resident’s legal status even where their beliefs, associations or statements are “otherwise lawful”. On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled that Khalil can move forward with a legal challenge to his arrest and detainment on the grounds that he was targeted for his political views. Both Mahdawi and Khalil have parallel court cases, one seeking reprieve from deportation and the other challenging the basis for their arrests. While in detention, Mahdawi had been visited by US Senator Peter Welch, a Democrat who has denounced the student’s arrest as “unjust” and antidemocratic. “I’m staying positive by reassuring myself in the ability of justice and the deep belief of democracy,” Mahdawisaidat the time, according to a video posted on Welch’s X account. “This is the reason I wanted to become a citizen of this country, because I believe in the principles of this country.”",

    "article_text": "Bertopolis, Brazil –The hottest region in Brazil is blanketed with guinea grass: thick, invasive and highly flammable. Black swaths of burned earth checkerboard the rolling hills — evidence of the fires that have increased along with the temperature. Yet enter the village of Pradinho, and a verdant patchwork emerges. Here, lush banana palms, cassava plants and guava trees sprout from the dry plains. These flourishing lots are the product of Hāmhi Terra Viva, an Indigenous-led agroforestry project in the eastern state of Minas Gerais where ancestral songs and traditions are woven into the planting process. Each oasis of trees, cultivated in backyard plots or large reforestation areas, signals a kind of rebirth for the local Maxakali people, also known as the Tikmũ’ũn. The Atlantic Forest, a complex ecosystem of rainforests, coastal broadleaf trees and mangroves, used to cover the Maxakali territory. Its dense canopy trapped in moisture and fostered one of the most biodiverse regions in the world. But the destruction of the Atlantic Forest has exacerbated the local effects of climate change — and with it, heightened the risks of wildfires. In Brazil, the Jequitinhonha Valley, where the four Maxakali territories are located, has suffered a dramatic rise in temperatures in recent years. Twenty Brazilian cities registered temperatures five degrees Celsius (nine degrees Fahrenheit) higher than the average daily maximum, according to 2023 governmentdataanalysed by the newspaper O Globo. Of those cities, 18 were in the Jequitinhonha Valley. The city of Araçuaí even shattered the record for the hottest temperature in Brazil’s history in November of that year, with thermometers rising to 44.8 degrees Celsius — or 112.6 degrees Fahrenheit. It lies a mere 130km (81 miles) from Maxakali territory. “We are in the epicentre of the climate crisis in Brazil,” said Rosângela Pereira de Tugny, coordinator of the Hāmhi project.",

    "title": "Automakers suspend financial guidance amid tariff uncertainty",
    "article_text": "Several global automakers, including Mercedes-Benz and Stellantis, have joined Michigan-based General Motors and Volvo in suspending their respective annual financial guidance reports for investors amidgrowing tariff uncertainty. The announcements on Wednesday came even as US President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to soften the blow of the auto tariffs that he had imposed earlier this month. “While we further assess the impact of the tariff policies on our North American operations, we look forward to our continued collaboration with the US administration to strengthen a competitive American auto industry and stimulate exports,” Stellantis board chairman John Elkann said in a statement. Stellantis said it was “suspending its 2025 financial guidance … due to evolving tariff policies, as well as the difficulty predicting possible impacts on market volumes and the competitive landscape.” This comes amid layoffs at Stellantis, a carmaker that houses 14 brands including Jeep, RAM Trucks, Dodge, Fiat, and Maserati. In April, it temporarily laid off 900 workers for two weeks and said at the time it was because of uncertainty about how Trump-imposed tariffs would affect its business. Antonio Filosa, Stellantis’s chief operating officer for the Americas, said in a company-wide email that it would assess the medium- and long-term effects of these tariffs on its operations, but also have “decided to take some immediate actions”. The company reported a 14-percent drop in its first-quarter sales to $40.7bn (35.8bn euros) in its first-quarter earnings report released on Wednesday. Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmakers, reported big drops in their net profits over the same January-March period, before the US tariffs kicked in. Mercedes cited “volatility with regard to tariff policies” that meant business development could not be reliably forecast. Mercedes’s net profit plunged almost 43 percent in the first three months of the year to $1.9 bn (1.73 billion euros) Finance chief Harald Wilhelm said Mercedes still remains in a strong position, thanks to what he said was a strong position in profitable, top-end vehicles. “This, combined with a healthy balance sheet, provides a solid foundation to navigate our company through a period of geopolitical uncertainties,” he said. About 40 companies worldwide, across industries, have pulled or lowered their forward guidance in the first two weeks of the first-quarter earnings season, an analysis by the news agency Reuters showed. On Tuesday, social media giant Snap declined to offer future guidance, saying it was seeing a slowdown in ad spending and raised doubts about advertising budgets due to tariff impact, sending its stock down 15 percent on Wednesday. Before the tariffs, European automakers were already facing slowing sales of electric cars and stiff competition from local rivals, as well as from Chinese EVs, for which it is a key market. Volkswagen, a 10-brand group that includes Audi, Skoda and Porsche, said its net profit fell 40.6 percent to $2.49bn (2.19 bn euros). For the rest of the year, the carmaker said that it expected business “towards the lower end” of its guidance, citing challenges including increased competition, more stringent emissions regulations and trade tensions. Speaking on a call for analysts and investors, Volkswagen’s finance chief Arno Antlitz said that it was “too early to say” if Volkswagen would step up manufacturing in the US to circumvent any tariffs. Volkswagen expects a profit margin of 5.5 to 6.5 percent for the coming year, but its guidance does not take into account changeable American tariffs. “It’s highly difficult to give a projection for the full year,” Antlitz said. UBS analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in a client note that the German group’s outlook did not “include any impact of US tariffs,” calling it “essentially a withdrawal of guidance”. In the United Kingdom, luxury carmaker Aston Martin Lagonda announced that it was limiting shipments to the US, but it maintained its annual guidance as it reported a 13-percent drop in first-quarter revenue. Besides a25-percent tariff on finished imported cars,the industry has also been affected by Trump’s 25-percent tariff on steel and aluminium. Carmakers are also set to face new tariffs on foreign auto parts expected to take effect on May 3. Trump’s new policy means that a company would not face both a 25-percent levy for an imported vehicle and 25-percent on steel or aluminium. The importer would pay the higher of the two levies, but not both, a US Commerce Department official said. The other change is that companies that import parts for vehicles assembled in the US would be able to offset 3.75 percent of a vehicle’s list price in the first year and 2.5 percent in the second year. But analysts believe that this reprieve won’t necessarily work in practice as automakers face the effect tariffs will have on their business. “While this sounds good on paper (less bad then the original auto tariff slate), a US car with all US parts made in the US is a fictional tale not possible today and many factories/production hubs could take 4-5 years to build in the US … and this speaks to the massive frustration from the industry as the rules of the US tariff game are untenable in our view,” Wedbush Securities Dan Ives said in a note on Wednesday.",

    "title": "Trump blames predecessor as US economy hit by tariff policies",
    "article_text": "United States President Donald Trump blames former president Joe Biden for the decline of key economic indicators during his first months as president, amid widespread disruptions caused by Trump’stariff policies. TheUS economycontracted by 0.3 percent during the first quarter of the year, the first such drop in three years. During the last three months of 2024, the economy grew by 2.4 percent. “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” Trump said in a post on his website Truth Social. “Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang.’ This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!” Sincetaking office, Trump’s efforts to upend the global trade system through a series of aggressive import duties have caused turmoil in financial markets amid fears of an escalating trade war and uncertainty surrounding the tariff policies. The first quarter saw an uptick in imports, as US businesses seek to get out ahead of higher costs that could accompany future tariffs. Inflation, however, continues to ease. In March, consumer prices were 2.3 percent higher than they were a year earlier, compared with 2.5 percent in February. In a press release from the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt mirrored Trump’s claims that Biden was to blame for any turbulence while also stating that the Wednesday economic report showed “strong economic momentum”. “It’s no surprise the leftovers of Biden’s economic disaster have been a drag on economic growth, but the underlying numbers tell the real story of the strong momentum President Trump is delivering,” Leavitt said. Many economic analysts blame Trump’s chaotic approach to tariffs for the US’s flagging indicators. Since taking office, the S&P 500 has shrunk by about 7.3 percent. “If the blowout on trade was the result of firms pre-buying imported inputs to beat the tariffs, the decay in the trade balance will reverse in second quarter,” Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told the news agency Reuters. “That will generate some GDP growth. However, corrosive uncertainty and higher taxes, tariffs are a tax on imports, will drag GDP growth back into the red by the end of this year.” In recent weeks, the White House has suggested that it could draw down tariffs with key US trading partnerssuch as China, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stating last week that current rates were not “sustainable”.",

    "title": "Spain’s grid denies renewable energy to blame for massive blackout",
    "article_text": "Spain’s grid operator has denied that solar power was to blame forthe country’s worst blackout, as Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez faces increasing pressure to explain what went wrong. Red Electrica de Espana (REE) on Wednesday said the source of the outage had been narrowed down to two separate incidents of loss of generation in substations in southwestern Spain, but stressed that it was too early to draw conclusions, as it had yet to identify their exact location. REE’s head, former Socialist minister Beatriz Corredor, told Cadena SER radio that it was wrong to blame the outage on Spain’s high share of renewable energy. “These technologies are already stable, and they have systems that allow them to operate as a conventional generation system without any safety issues,” she said, adding she was not considering resigning. Life across the Iberian Peninsula was returning to normal after a power outage halted trains, shut airports and trapped people in lifts in Spain and Portugal on Monday. Just before the system crashed, Spain’s solar energy accounted for 53 percent of electricity production, wind for almost 11 percent and nuclear and gas for 15 percent, according to REE data. Political opponents criticised Sanchez for taking too long to explain the blackout and suggested he was covering up for failings, after his left-wing coalition government invested in expanding the renewable energy sector. “Since REE has ruled out the possibility of a cyberattack, we can only point to the malfunctioning of REE, which has state investment and therefore its leaders are appointed by the government,” Miguel Tellado, a parliamentary spokesperson for the opposition conservative People’s Party, said in an interview on RTVE. Tellado called for an independent investigation to be conducted by Spain’s parliament rather than the government probe Sanchez has announced. The prime minister has not ruled out a cyberattack, although this has been dismissed by REE. Antonio Turiel, an energy expert at the state-owned Spanish National Research Council, told Onda Vasca radio station on Tuesday that the fundamental problem was the grid’s instability. “A lot of renewable energy has been integrated without the responsive stabilisation systems that should have been in place,” he said, adding that vulnerabilities stemmed from “the unplanned and haphazard integration of a host of renewable systems”. The government had forecast private and public investment of some 52 billion euros ($59bn) through 2030 to upgrade the power grid so it can handle the surge in demand from data centres and electric vehicles.",

    "title": "US, Ukraine sign minerals deal pushed by Trump",
    "article_text": "Ukraine and the United States have signed an agreement to provide Washington with access to valuable rare minerals and fund reconstruction efforts in the war-torn country. The two countries signed the accord in Washington, DC, on Wednesday after months of fraught negotiations, with uncertainty persisting until the last moment following reports of 11th-hour proposals to change aspects of the deal. The agreement marks a breakthrough in US-Ukraine ties after relations reached a nadir following a spectacular blow-up between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their meeting at the White House in February. Announcing the agreement, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the creation of the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund was a signal to Russia that the Trump administration was “committed to a peace process centred on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term”. “President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine,” Bessent said in a statement. “And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine.” The Trump administration did not provide further details of the deal. Ukraine’s Ministry of Economy said the US would contribute to the fund directly or through military assistance, and Kyiv would contribute 50 percent of revenues from the exploitation of natural resources. The ministry said all of the fund’s resources would be exclusively invested in Ukraine for the first 10 years, after which “profits may be distributed between the partners”. The US and Ukraine would have equal decision-making power over the fund, the ministry said, with the deal only covering future US military assistance, not past aid. “We are gaining not only investment, but also a strategic partner committed to working with us to drive economic growth and innovation,” Ukrainian Minister of Economy Yulia Svyrydenko said in a statement. “This agreement is the outcome of extensive negotiations, and I am grateful to both negotiating teams for their professionalism and dedication. Together, we have developed a mutually beneficial framework. It also reflects the US commitment to lasting peace in Ukraine and recognition of Ukraine’s contribution to global security.” In a Telegram post shortly before the deal was signed, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said the deal would leave Kyiv with “full control over subsoil, infrastructure, and natural resources”, and not interfere with its bid to join the European Union. Ukraine and the US had planned to sign the agreement weeks ago, but afiery clashbetween Trump and Zelenskyy in front of the world’s news media on February 28 temporarily derailed talks. Ukraine has been pushing for security guarantees as part of any deal to halt Russia’s three-year invasion. The Trump administration has argued that boosting US business interests in Ukraine will help deter Russia from future aggression in the event of a ceasefire. It was not clear if Wednesday’s deal, which must be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament to take effect, included any security guarantees for Ukraine. Ukraine has estimated that it holds about 5 percent of the world’s reserves of critical minerals, which are used in the manufacturing of consumer electronics, electric vehicles and military hardware. The country’s deposits include reserves of22 out of the 34 mineralsclassified as critical by the EU.",

Gonzalez Rogers also says that Apple “willfully” chose not to comply with her previous injunction from heroriginal 2021 ruling. “That [Apple] thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation,” Gonzalez Rogers says. The judge also referred the case to the US attorney to review it for possible criminal contempt proceedings. As part ofthe ruling, the judge says that Apple cannot: Apple’s senior director of corporate communications, Olivia Dalton, sent a statement toThe Vergethat reads, “We strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.” Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeneysays that, following this ruling, the company will bringFortniteback to the US App Store “next week.” Sweeney is also offering a “peace proposal” from Epic: “If Apple extends the court’s friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, we’ll returnFortniteto the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic.” In many cases, Apple takes a 30 percent cut of purchases made in its apps, and Gonzalez Rogers’ 2021 ruling forced Apple to allow developers to point to alternative payment options. But Apple instituted a policy that demanded developers pay Apple a 27 percent commission on those purchases, which many companies, including Epic,were unhappy about. “In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this Court’s Injunction,” Gonzalez Rogers says. She notes that, inside Apple, App Store chief Phil Schiller advocated for the company to comply with the injunction, but that CEO Tim Cook “chose poorly” by ignoring Schiller and letting CFO Luca Maestri “convince him otherwise.” Update, April 30th:Added statement from Apple.

Meta’s AI app already includes a social feed, and Zuckerberg said product recommendations might be next. byEmma Roth The Meta AI app could soon get a paid tier, similar to the ones offered by rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg described the plan during a Q1 2025 earnings call on Wednesday, saying there’s an opportunity to offer a “premium service for people who want to unlock more compute or additional functionality” in Meta AI. As part of Meta’s efforts to compete with ChatGPT, the companylaunched a standalone Meta AI app this week, allowing you to interact with the chatbot and generate images from within the app. The chatbot, which Meta says now has nearly 1 billion users, was previously only available within apps like Facebook, Messenger, and WhatsApp. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and Microsoft’s Copilot all offer paid subscriptions that give users access to more advanced features and compute. Metareported earning $42 billionin revenue over the past few months and revealed that it now expects to invest up to $72 billion on AI, rather than the up to$65 billion Zuckerberg announced previously. Additionally, Zuckerberg mentioned incorporating “product recommendations or ads” within Meta AI. It’s not clear when ads, or a paid tier, might roll out, as Zuckerberg said, “I expect that we’re going to be largely focused on scaling and deepening engagement for at least the next year before we’ll really be ready to start building out the business.” A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe. ©2025Vox Media, LLC.

    "article_text": "Now you can sync your smart lights to your TV for less with the WiZ HDMI Sync Box. Now you can sync your smart lights to your TV for less with the WiZ HDMI Sync Box. byJennifer Pattison Tuohy Budget smart lighting brand WiZ has announced a new HDMI sync box that syncs with its line of Wi-Fi-based LED lights to match what’s playing on your TV. WiZ’sHDMI Sync Box with TV backlightwill be available next month. It comes in two models: one with a TV backlight strip for screens 55 inches to 65 inches in size for $89.99, and the other for screens 75 inches to 85 inches in size for $109.99. The new HDMI box is similar to that of WiZ’s sister brand, Philips Hue. ButHue’s HDMI Play Boxstarts at $249.99, with light strips sold separately. (Hue and WiZ are both owned by Signify, but their bulbs are not compatible with each other.) WiZ bulbs also use Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, whereas Hue relies on Bluetooth and Zigbee (via a hub). Unlike camera-based light syncing systems from companies like Nanoleaf and Govee, WiZ and Hue’s sync products read the signal directly from the video source, which can help avoid latency issues. This makes WiZ’s option a great budget alternative for those put off by Hue’s high prices. However, there are some concessions. The WiZ box only has one HDMI input, whereas the Hue Play supports four. This means if you have multiple devices connected to your TV, you’ll have to manually switch between them. The WiZ Sync Box supports HDMI 2.0 and video formats up to 4K at 60Hz with HDR10 Plus and Dolby Vision.Hue’s latest Play HDMI Boxsupports up to 8K video, HDMI 2.1, and refresh rates up to 120Hz for 4K for console gaming. It also costs $350 The WiZ box also features a built-in microphone that captures audio, allowing the lights to change in sync with music as well as movies. The box can be controlled with the WiZ app, with voice via Google or Alexa, or theWiZ remote control. According to the company, the Sync Box can connect to any color-capable WiZ light that supports both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, including its new Gradient Light Bars ($59.99) and Gradient Floor Light ($89.99), which can sit alongside your TV to add more ambient light. As with all of WiZ’s lighting products, these support the Matter smart home standard, so are compatible with most smart home systems.

    "article_text": "Apple has tested a version of Stage Manager on iPhones that works with external displays — at least in simulations. Apple has tested a version of Stage Manager on iPhones that works with external displays — at least in simulations. byWes Davis Alongside all the rumors lately about a bigvisual redesign for iOSand a moreMac-like iPadOS experience, there’s one interesting one that’s been bubbling up: the iPhone could get a desktop mode of sorts. Majin Bu, who has amixed history with leaks,wrote last weekthat unnamed sources had said iPhones with USB-C will offer “a Stage Manager like interface” when connected to an external display. It wouldn’t be quite a full desktop experience, but would “allow users to extend their screen space, great for presentations, editing, or enhanced viewing.” They added that there “may be some limitations possibly in resolution or the number of apps displayed at once.” Given Bu’s history, it’s hard to put too much stock in that all on its own. Then again, in anew episodeof the9to5Mac’s video seriesiOS Decoded, Jeff Benjamin says that he’s seen Stage Manager working with an iPhone and, tantalizingly, it had “full-on external display support.” In anarticle accompanying the video, he writes that9to5Machas been able to test the feature using the iOS Xcode Simulator. He doesn’t think it’s likely Apple will roll that out to iPhones in the real world, but it’s notable that Apple has been interested enough in the idea to test it out. Apple wouldn’t be the first to try this — there wereattempts that predated even Samsung’s DeX— but it’s an intriguing idea all the same. iPhones already have limited external display support, using cables or wirelessly through AirPlay, but that support is generally limited to either screen mirroring or on a per-app basis — like casting a YouTube video to an AirPlay-enabled TV.

    "title": "Microsoft reports strong cloud growth in Q3 earnings",
    "article_text": "Cloud growth has helped push Microsoft earnings past Wall Street estimates. Cloud growth has helped push Microsoft earnings past Wall Street estimates. byTom Warren Microsoftjust postedthe third quarter of its 2025 fiscal financial results. The software maker made $70.1 billion in revenue and a net income of $25.8 billion during Q3. Revenue is up 13 percent, and net income has increased by 18 percent. Microsoft was expected to report $68.42 billion in revenue, so the results have beaten Wall Street expectations. Cloud growth appears to be the main driver of improved revenues, with overall Microsoft Cloud revenue reaching $42.4 billion, up 20 percent. Microsoft hasn’t split out its AI revenues, so it’s still unclear exactly how much that part of its business is growing, though. With all eyes on the impact of the Trump tariffs and consumer spending, Microsoft also reported Windows OEM and devices revenue growth of 3 percent year-over-year. Businesses and consumers are upgrading PCs and laptops ahead of the Windows 10 end of life in October, but there hasn’t been a big upswing in Windows OEM revenue yet. Microsoft does say that Windows OEM growth was partly down to “inventory levels remaining elevated due to tariff uncertainty.” Microsoft now combines Surface revenue with Windows OEM revenue, so it’s no longer clear exactly how its Surface line is doing. Microsoft hasn’t launched any new consumer Surface devices in the recent quarter, but the company did start sellingIntel-powered versionsof the Surface Pro 11 and Surface Laptop 7 in February for businesses. Microsoft is alsorumored to be launchingsmaller versions of the Surface Pro and Surface Laptop soon. On the gaming side, Microsoft warned last quarter that Xbox hardware revenue would decline and it has again. Xbox hardware is down 6 percent this quarter, in a period when Microsoft has been launching a variety of games into Game Pass. Overall gaming revenue at Microsoft is up 5 percent. Xbox content and services, which includes Game Pass, is up 8 percent, though. Microsoft isn’t revealing any new Game Pass subscriber numbers though, and the last time we got an update was in February 2024 when Microsoft revealed there were34 million subscribers, including the Xbox Game Pass Core (previously Xbox Live Gold) members. Over the past year Microsoft has been pushing ahead with its strategy to bring more previously Xbox-exclusive games to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. The move has proven to be a successful one, with preorders forIndiana Jones and the Great CircleandForza Horizon 5topping Sony’s own PlayStation Storelast month. ”We ended the quarter as the top publisher by preorders and preinstalls on both Xbox and PlayStation Store,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on the company’s earnings call. PC Game Pass revenue also increased 45 percent year-over-year, and “cloud gaming set a new record, surpassing 150 million hours played for the first time this quarter,” revealed Nadella. Microsoft’sXbox everywhere strategy— which I’ve been covering closely inmyNotepadnewsletterover the past year — will also include titles for the Nintendo Switch 2. Microsoft is preparing a similar list of games to port over to the Switch 2 this year. As is always the case for Microsoft’s earnings, the company’s Office and cloud businesses are once again the stars of the show. Microsoft 365 commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 11 percent year over year, and even office consumer is up 10 percent in revenue. Microsoft 365 consumer subscribers are up to 87.7 million now. Microsoftbundled its Office AI featuresinto Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscriptions earlier this year and raised prices. Previously, Microsoft 365 subscribers had to pay an extra $20 per month to get Copilot inside Office apps like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint aspart of a Copilot Pro subscription, but Microsoft now offers these AI features inside Microsoft 365 apps for an extra $3 per month. Existing subscribers have been able to opt out of the AI features and not suffer the price increase, but it’s not clear how many have actually decided to do that. Microsoft does note that it has seen “growth in revenue per user” from the January price increase, which has been partially offset by a “continued mix shift” to the $1.99 monthlyMicrosoft 365 Basic subscription. Microsoft’s revenues in what it calls intelligent cloud have increased by 21 percent year-over-year to $26.8 billion, which is exactly double the revenue generated by Windows, Xbox, and search and news advertising (more personal computing). Server products and cloud services revenue increased 22 percent, with Azure growth of 33 percent. Update, April 30th: Article updated with comments from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.

    "title": "U.S. economy went into reverse in the first quarter, new GDP data shows",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 30, 2025 / 7:46 PM EDT/ CBS News U.S. economic growth slowed sharply in the first quarter of 2025 as businesses rushed to stockpile goods ahead of President Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The nation's gross domestic product — the total value of products and services — shrank at a 0.3% annual rate, down from growth of 2.4% in the final three months of 2024, the Commerce DepartmentreportedWednesday in its initial GDP estimate. It's the worst quarterly performance for the U.S. economy since early 2022, when the economy was in recovery after cratering during the COVID pandemic. The U.S. economy was forecast to show 0.8% growth in the first three months of 2025, according to the average estimate of economists polled by FactSet. The slowdown comes amid growing concerns that Mr. Trump's wide-ranging tariffs could disrupt the U.S. economy, with some economists raising the chances of the U.S.slipping into a recessionin 2025. Although the Trump administration's blanket tariffs wereannounced on April 2— after the end of the quarter — businesses sought to get ahead of the impact of the import duties by front-loading purchases early in the year. The report may not fully reflect the state of economic growth, economists cautioned, noting that the figures are likely to be noisy because of the surge in imports as businesses sought to get ahead of tariffs. A rise in imports may appear to lower economic growth and show a shift away from domestic consumption, but that doesn't tell the whole story, economists note. Nevertheless, concerns about the tariffs caused businesses and consumers to change their behavior at year start, signaling that the rollout of steep import fees could create headwinds for the economy later in 2025, experts said. \"This artificial front-loading of demand sets the stage for a sharper demand cliff in Q2 — a far more troubling phase of the ongoing economic slowdown.\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco said in an email. Yet GDP could get a second-quarter boost as companies import fewer goods in the current quarter due to the rollout of the tariffs and the front-loading at the start of the year, according to Capital Economics. Another key measure of the economy's health — known as final sales to private domestic purchasers — also rose 3% in the first quarter, edging up from 2.9% in the previous three months. That suggests demand from consumers and businesses remains resilient despite mounting concerns about the economy. \"Overall, [the GDP data is] not as bad as feared, although some of the drop back in imports in the second quarter will now be partly offset by a slowing in inventory accumulation,\" analysts with the investment advisory firm said in a report. \"We forecast a 2.0% annualized rebound in second-quarter GDP.\" Growth in the first quarter was impacted by the increase in imports, as well as a 5.1% decline in government spending, the Commerce Department said. Mr. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, helmed by billionaire Elon Musk, has effectively shuttered major agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, cuthundreds of thousands of federal workers, and canceled funding for health and science research. Economists expect the U.S. economy to slow in 2025, partly due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which are import duties paid by American companies like Walmart or Target. When faced with higher tariffs, companies typically pass on all or some of the costs to shoppers, which can depress consumer spending. GDP growth is forecast to slow to 1.9% in 2025, according to FactSet. That's down from2.8% in 2024. \"[T]he inflation data will show when the price increases of tariffs hit consumers, which will deliver a real income shock that we expect to weigh heavily on spending growth,\" Pearce said. Another red flag for the U.S. economy came on Wednesday with the release of ADP's employment numbers for April, which showed private employers added 62,000 jobs this month, far fewer than the 134,000 jobs that had been forecast by economists, according to FactSet. The monthly jobs report on Friday is expected to show that employers created 135,000 new jobs, a slowdown from 228,000 in March, FactSet data shows. The combination of weak ADP data, the GDP report and other economic data \"increasingly suggest a recession may have begun,\" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at trading company TradeStation, in an email. The shaky economic data could persuade the Federal Reserve to hold off on making more rate cuts, experts said. The central bank will make its next rate decision at its May 7 meeting, with most economists forecasting that the Fed will hold its benchmark rate steady. \"The data clearly buys the Fed some time to delay cuts; they will likely continue their wait-and-see approach to assess the inflation shocks stemming from the tariffs announced in April,\" Olu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said in an email.

    "title": "Students accused in lacrosse hazing turn themselves in",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 30, 2025 / 4:00 PM EDT/ CBS News A group of students accused of being involved in an apparent hazing scheme in upstate New York have turned themselves in after they were given 48 hours to do so or else face kidnapping charges for the incident, which authorities say targeted younger members of the Westhill High School boys lacrosse team. Eleven students who allegedly played a part in the event turned themselves in on Wednesday, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said. The district attorney previously told CBS News that the deadline for the perpetrators to turn themselves in was \"close of business Thursday.\" \"This is criminal activity, and this is hazing on steroids,\" Fitzpatrick said Tuesday during a news conference, noting it \"could have resulted in such tragedy.\" Fitzpatrick said his office and the county sheriff's department are working together to prosecute the case, after the sheriff received a call from the high school's resource officer reporting that a newer member of the boys lacrosse team had been tied up and thrown into the back of a teammate's vehicle. The incident seemed to be an example of hazing or, if not, some sort of extreme prank, Fitzpatrick said. Older lacrosse players allegedly set up their plot by arranging an evening out with five younger members of the Westhill team, Fitzpatrick said, which was supposed to include watching a lacrosse game and picking up food from McDonald's. An older player was driving the younger ones and pretended to get lost in an isolated section of the county, where a group of accomplices emerged in masks and black clothing, imitating an abduction with at least one gun and one knife, according to the district attorney. All of the younger players escaped except for one, whose hands were tied while a pillowcase was placed over his head, and he was thrown into the trunk of the car, Fitzpatrick said. \"I could imagine a deputy coming upon a scene, seeing a kid with a hood over his head being abducted at gunpoint by a series of individuals all dressed in black and masked,\" he said. \"If that individual opened fire, you know, would that be outside the realm of possibility? I think the opposite would be true.\" No injuries have been reported in connection with the incident, and the perpetrators returned the student to his home at the end of the night, Fitzpatrick said. Citing a video, he said authorities believe 11 people, who appear to be on the boys lacrosse team, carried out the scheme and urged them to come forward in order to avoid facing kidnapping charges and being tried as adults. The identities or exact ages of the people involved have not been released. \"I have seen the videotape of what happened to this young man. It is not a rite of passage. It is not a trivial matter,\" Fitzpatrick said. \"I don't know how long this young man will be affected by what happened to him. Frankly, I find it incomprehensible that in this day and age somebody could have thought that they would have gotten away with something like this.\" After the 11 people turned themselves in, Fitzpatrick said he would not be releasing the video at this time. No charges had been filed as of Tuesday. The district attorney previously said that those who choose to turn themselves in will likely avoid criminal records and face prosecution in family court instead. A representative for the school district told CBS News in a statement that it is cooperating with law enforcement's investigation. \"We are aware of the District Attorney's statement and are continuing to cooperate fully with the ongoing investigation,\" Lisa O'Reilly, president of the Westhill Central School District's board of education, said in a statement to CBS News. \"At this time, the District has no additional information to share. While the investigation is ongoing, we remain committed to the values of student safety, dignity, and accountability. We remain in close contact with law enforcement and remain focused on supporting our students and ensuring the safety and well-being of our school community.\" Emily Mae Czachor is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

    "title": "U.S. and Ukraine sign long-awaited minerals deal",
    "article_text": "The White House announced Wednesday night that it had signedan economic partnership with Ukrainethat includes an agreement on the ownership and extraction of natural resources fromthe war-torn nation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the agreement, established as the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, will allow the United States to \"invest alongside Ukraine\" to unlock its growth assets and ultimately accelerate its economic recovery. “As the President has said, the United States is committed to helping facilitate the end of this cruel and senseless war. This agreement signals clearly to Russia that the Trump Administration is committed to a peace process centered on a free, sovereign, and prosperous Ukraine over the long term,\" Bessent said in a statement. \"President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine. \"And to be clear, no state or person who financed or supplied the Russian war machine will be allowed to benefit from the reconstruction of Ukraine,\" he added. The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deal. Follow live politics coverage here Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, provided more details about the minerals deal outlined in the agreement, firstsaying on Xthat \"it is the Ukrainian state that determines what and where to extract\" and that \"subsoil remains under Ukrainian ownership.\" Ukraine and the United States will jointly manage and maintain co-ownership of the investment fund, with neither side holding a dominant vote, Svyrydenko said. It will be financed by new Ukrainian oil, gas and critical mineral licenses, with 50% of all revenue from the licenses going toward the fund. \"The fund will then invest in extraction projects for critical materials, oil, and gas — as well as in related infrastructure and processing. Specific investment projects will be selected jointly by Ukraine and the US. Importantly, the Fund may invest exclusively in Ukraine,\" she said on X. Svyrydenko indicated in her post that the United States will also contribute to the fund, through it is unclear exactly how much. She added that contributions to the fund will not be taxed in either Ukraine or the United States to ensure “maximum effectiveness of the investment process.\" Trump said earlier Wednesday that the agreement would serve as an avenue for the United States to recoup funds it has provided to Ukraine throughout its war with Russia, a figure the State Departmenthas placed at $66.5 billionin terms of military assistance. \"I didn’t want to make a complicated deal,\" Trump said at a Cabinet meeting Wednesday. \"Rare earth is called rare for a reason, and they have a lot, and we made a deal where our money is secure, where we can start digging and doing what we have to do.\" It is unclear how much of the money will go toward repaying the United States. Svyrydenko said in her post that the agreement \"includes no provisions regarding any Ukrainian debt obligations to the United States.\" The agreement was signed days after Trump met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Rome on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral. Trump suggested the pair’s relationship had improved since their Oval Office clash in February, characterizing the meeting as “beautiful” and expressing confidence that Zelenskyy “wants to make a deal\" to end the war. Trump’s ire was instead directed at Russian President Vladimir Putin, whomTrump criticizedfor carrying out widespread strikes on Kyiv despite U.S. officials' ongoing effort to secure a plan to end the war, which began in February 2022. Putin met with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff on Friday for roughly three hours in Moscow, with a Putin aide later describing their discussion as \"productive.\" After the meeting, Trump urged Ukraine and Russia to hold \"very high-level\" ceasefire talks, adding that the two sides are \"very close to a deal\" to end the war. The two countries have not held direct talks since theearly days of Russia’s invasion.",

    "title": "A bipartisan measure to undo Trump's global tariffs fails in the Senate",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — A bipartisan measure that sought to undo thesweeping tariffs President Donald Trump imposed on most countriesthis month failed in the GOP-led Senate on Wednesday. The vote ended in a tie, 49-49, with three Republicans — Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska — joining all Democrats present in support of the resolution, which was designed to terminate the national emergency Trump declared to implement his global tariffs. Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who voiced support for the measure, were absent for the vote. It needed a simple majority to pass. Paul and Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., used a legislative procedure to force a vote in the Senate, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority. Later Wednesday evening, the Senate voted 50-49 — with Vice President JD Vance casting the tiebreaking vote — to table a Democratic motion that would allow them to force another vote next week on the tariffs resolution. Follow live politics coverage here Even if it passed, the resolution most likely wouldn't have been taken up in the GOP-controlled House. Republicans there recently voted to add a hurdle for lawmakers seeking to quickly take up resolutions related to Trump's tariff authority. The White House also said Tuesday that Trump would veto the resolution if it reached his desk. In a 51-48 vote in early April,the Senate approved a similar but more limited resolutionthat aimed to block the U.S. tariffs on Canada. The three Republicans who joined with Democrats on Wednesday, along with McConnell, voted for that measure, too, offering a rare rebuke of Trump. On the day most took effect this month,Trumpabruptlyannounced that he would pause higher targeted tariffs for most countries for 90 daysto allow for negotiations. Meanwhile, Trump raised tariffs on China to 145%. The vote came the day the Commerce Department revealed that theU.S. economy contracted 0.3% in the first quarter of the year, a development that Trump and White House officials tried to downplay. In response, Trump told the public to \"BE PATIENT!!!\" on Truth Social. Trump administration officials have repeatedly claimed in recent days that they've been making progress in negotiations to reach trade deals with some of the countries that have faced higher U.S. tariffs. But they haven't disclosed any details, and they have dodged questions about when exactly announcements could be made about agreements reached. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that countries are calling him to negotiate trade deals and that he is “optimistic” they will settle with several of them in the next few weeks, according to two senators who attended the meeting with Greer and Vance. Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso, R-Wyo., criticized the senators who forced a vote Wednesday, saying it's wasting time. “They know it’s not going to go anywhere. They know it’s not going to become law,” Barrasso told NBC News on Tuesday. “All they’re trying to do is slow down the process, preventing us from getting more members of the president’s leadership team confirmed and in place.” Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., also announced a bill targeting Trump's tariffs. Rather than halt them immediately, the measure would make the tariffs expire after 60 days unless Congress voted to explicitly approve them. “I think the only thing that keeps us from growing bigger is that sort of the Grassley bill is an off-ramp for people who want to symbolically oppose the tariffs but don’t want to, in reality, stop them,” Paul said. “And they might want to, but they’re not willing to vote to stop them.” Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who faces a tough re-election race next year, said he continues to work with Grassley on his legislation, but he didn't support the measure from Paul and Wyden. “It’s a political exercise,” Tillis said. “It has no hope in them in the House, and I don’t do messaging bills.”",

    "title": "Trump's economy so far: Unprecedented uncertainty reigns",
    "article_text": "Voters returned Donald Trump to the White House in Novemberbelieving he would be better for the economythan his opponent, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. Yet 100 days into Trump’s second presidential term, voters now face an economic landscape rife with uncertainty. Among its attributes:recession odds of as high as 60%, inflation rates that have barely budged and a stock market that, until recently, was beset by volatility. At issue is Trump’s tariffs strategy. Though he said throughout his campaign that he planned to impose tariffs on goods brought into the United States, consumers and businesses alike have reacted with shock at what Trump has implemented and the speed with which he has done it: a 10%-across-the-board tariff, 25% duties on autos and auto parts and steel and aluminum products, and duties of as high as 145% on goods from China, the third-largest source of imports into the United States behind the European Union and Mexico. “A lot of economic policy has been made in these first 100 days — more than any other administration I can think of,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. The tariffs rollout has also been marked by starts and stops, with different rationales offered up for each duty and tariff levels sometimes changing within a single day. To this day, Trump’s tariffs plan continues to evolve. He has paused the country-by-country tariffs he announced in his “Liberation Day” Rose Garden ceremony this month, which he said has prompted hundreds of countries to approach the United States about signing new trade deals. And on Tuesday, in a speech marking the first 100 days of his second term, he also softened some of the tariffs on cars and auto parts. During a rally in Warren, Michigan, Trump called it “the most successful first 100 days of administration in the history of our country.” Overall, the rollout of the tariffs and the uncertainty it has created have caused significant economic and financial turbulence. Take high prices, which were top of mind for many voters in November.The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of price growth remains stuck at about 2.5%. While that is within range of historical averages, it is above the central bank’s official 2% goal.Grocery price growth surged in the initial weeks of Trump’s administrationamid soaring egg costs, but they have since come down. Still, across-the-board 10% tariffs Trump has placed on imports to the United States, along with other duties on countries like China and Mexico from which the United States imports food, could raise grocery costs further,some experts say. Gas prices, too,have remained at Biden-era levels. Airfare prices have fallen — though that islargely a function of reduced demandas consumers pull back on nonessential spending. While mortgage rates have declined year on year, the pace of home sales is glacial, and in March — the start of a usually busy spring season for the real estate industry — sales of previously owned homesfell to their slowest rate since 2009. NBC News’ home price affordability indexhas in the first three months of Trump’s second term shown modest improvementin consumers’ ability to buy homes, but it remains far above its pre-pandemic levels. As for stocks, the S&P 500 has lost about 8% since Jan. 20. Some data has held up. Retail saleshave remained brisk, while the unemployment rate is steady at about 4.2%. Barclays financial group said Monday that its daily credit card transaction data, as well as job-openings trends, “thus far show little cause for concern about U.S. activity.” “The most recent momentum in spending and new-job postings is about in line with — and never far below — point-in-time comparisons with prior years,” the firm said. Overall, it is difficult to find a measure of economic activity that has improved dramatically since Trump’s second term began. And while many data points show the economy hanging on for now,there has been significant deterioration in business and consumer sentiment and outlook. While such surveys do not always translate into slower economic growth, they suggest even rougher conditions may lie ahead. Nearly every measure of consumer confidence tracked by Wall Street firms, including the more conservative-leaning National Federation of Independent Business’monthly survey of smaller businesses, has shown a decline in economic optimism. “The implementation of new policy priorities has heightened the level of uncertainty among small business owners over the past few months,” the federation’s chief economist, Bill Dunkelberg, said in a statement this month. “Small business owners have scaled back expectations on sales growth as they better understand how these rearrangements might impact them.” The University of Michigan’s consumer confidence survey has likewise plunged, showing the largest three-month decline since the 1990s. “Expectations worsened for vast swaths of the population across age, education, income, and political affiliation,” survey director Joanne Hsu said in a statement. “Consumers perceived risks to multiple aspects of the economy, in large part due to ongoing uncertainty around trade policy and the potential for a resurgence of inflation looming ahead. Labor market expectations remained bleak. Even more concerning for the path of the economy, consumers anticipated weaker income growth for themselves in the year ahead.” Some uptick in economic activity could simply be the result of consumers’ and businesses’ trying to get ahead of tariffs by stocking up on goods for their households or inventory for their businesses as tariffs bear down, experts say. “There’s a front-running effect,” said Bob Elliott, CEO of Unlimited Funds investment group. “You hear a lot of anecdotal stories related to that — like auto demand, there’s been a lot of pulled-forward auto demand,” he said, referring to consumers shopping for new vehicles currently on dealership lots that are not subject to Trump’s tariffs. “But even smaller-scale items, we’re seeing indications of pre-buying on worries that price rises are ahead.” The latest edition of the Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey of economic conditions in the United States shows cracks starting to form, especially in sectors and regions that depend on foreign tourism, which has fallen off sharply as Trump has ramped up his immigration crackdowns at U.S. borders. “Large attractions that normally draw international visitors saw a drop in travelers from abroad, particularly Canada, and airports and airlines reported a notable decline in foreign passengers to the U.S.,” the Atlanta Fed said. In a statement, a White House spokesman noted there had actually been negative month-on-month inflation in March’s Consumer Price Index — meaning that on average, a typical price declined from February. The spokesman, Kush Desai, also pointed to investment commitments from firms like Apple, Nvidia and Hyundai designed to reshore manufacturing back to the United States. “President Trump’s America First policies are delivering much-needed economic relief for everyday Americans while laying the groundwork for a long-term restoration of American Greatness,” Desai said. And at a news conference marking Trump’s first 100 days, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt waved off any concerns about the economy. “The actual data has been quite good,” Bessent said. “The job data is good, [and] Americans keep spending.” “Trust in President Trump,” Leavitt said when a reporter asked how Americans should be thinking about this period of economic turmoil. “There is a reason he was re-elected to this office. It’s because of the historic success of his economic formula in the first term.” It is not the tariffs themselves that have created the troublesome economic environment, said David Seif, chief economist at Nomura Holdings financial group. Rather, it is the uncertainty that has accompanied their imposition that is preventing businesses from spending and hiring and allowing the economy to settle back onto a more stable footing. For any concerns Trump may have about how Americans view his performance on the economy, there are ways he can regain positive momentum, Seif said. If Trump manages to dial back his ambitions or finds a way to stand down from his more provocative stances, the memories of the initial months of his second term could fade fast. “Uncertainty is the worst aspect of all of this,” Seif said. “If a plan were announced today, as long as it was seen as a totally definitive thing, that would allow companies to start investing again.”",

    "title": "This one auto part crosses the border four times on its way to your car",
    "article_text": "The Trump administration wants to bring more auto manufacturing back to the United States with stiff tariffs. That could mean untangling supply chains that crisscross the border repeatedly, leaving some industry players unsure how their bottom lines will be affected. Take Brendan Lane’s striker plates, which move between the United States and Canada four times before they’re installed. The common component — one of the roughly 30,000 individual parts that go into a single vehicle — is a small metal loop attached to a slab of steel allowing car doors to latch securely in place. “The system is set up where we’re across the border all the time,” said Lane, the general manager of Lanex Manufacturing in Windsor, Ontario, across the river from Detroit. His parts are sold to suppliers of major American automakers, including Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, and Lane said he has been making cross-border trips for his family-run company since he was 16. Recent months have been a roller coaster ride for Lanex as President Donald Trump introduced tariffs onauto parts,steel and aluminumandCanadian imports. On Tuesday, Trumpadjusted his vehicle tariffsto offer some relief from import taxes that in many cases had threatened to stack up on top of one another. Under the revised policy, automakers paying tariffs on imported cars can get reimbursed for some other levies, including on foreign-made metals, though country-specific tariffs could still apply. The system is set up where we’re across the border all the time. Brendan Lane, general manager, Lanex Manufacturing, Windsor, Ontario Lane welcomed the changes but said tariffs are “not good” for his business. He said he remains worried about how the still-fluid U.S. trade policies will affect costs and jobs across the industry. “There’s thousands of people involved that it’s their everyday life,” he said. American automakers have largely outsourced their parts manufacturing, mainly building only high-value components like engines, transmissions and bodies within the United States. Most other components — especially minor parts such as hoses, springs and striker plates — come from external suppliers, many of them abroad. Reshoring more of that extensive global supply chain is “not as easy as just flipping a switch,” Lane said. His striker plates are spared the25%U.S.duties on auto imports, which remain on track to take effect Sunday, because they comply with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which Trump negotiated during his first term. But Lane said he still isn’t sure what the long-term impacts on his business might be. “It’s tough to plan for,” he said. “We don’t know how we’re going to navigate it yet.” Even General Motors said Tuesday that it was “reassessing” its business outlook to account for tariff impacts that are still likely to be “significant.” It promised to share more with investors “when we have greater clarity.” Ford CEO Jim Farley told CNN on Wednesday that the latest tariff plan “clarifies things, but boy, do we have a lot of work to do with the administration.” “Affordability of parts is a really important thing for America because we’ve got to keep the vehicles affordable,” Farley said. Ford saw double-digit sales growth in March and April as people rushed out to buy cars, he added, and the company is extendingits employee pricing offerthrough July 4. The White House has indicated that the confusion is tactical. “President Trump creates what I would call strategic uncertainty in the negotiations,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters Tuesday. “The aperture of uncertainty will be narrowing,” he said, “and as we start moving forward announcing deals, then there will be certainty.” Lane’s striker plates start with imported steel from Wixom, Michigan. Relying on American-made metal has already entailed a 25% cost hike due toCanada’s retaliatory tariffson U.S. steel, a response to equivalent levies on foreign steel thatTrump imposed in February. The Michigan steel travels across the border to the Lanex’s Windsor plant, which shapes it into striker plates. The components are then handed off to another Canadian company, in nearby Brampton, for heat treating. Afterward, Lane drives the parts back over the border to Warren, Michigan, for plating, a process that applies a rust-protective coating. Finally, he brings them once more to Windsor, for inspection and packaging in his warehouse. Only then are the striker plates shipped to a vehicle assembly plant in the United States, where they’re mounted onto door frames.",

    "title": "Trump claims he 'could' have Kilmar Abrego Garcia returned to the U.S.",
    "article_text": "President Donald Trump said in aninterview with ABC Newsthat he \"could\" haveKilmar Abrego Garciareturned to the United States with one phone call, even though the administration has argued in court that the government has no ability to get him back. “If he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. But he is not,” Trumptold ABC News' Terry Moranon Tuesday when he was asked whether he could not simply call Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and ask for Abrego Garcia's return. Trump and his allies have contended that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang in justifying his deportation — which Abrego Garcia's lawyers deny. \"I'm not the one making this decision,\" Trump added. \"We have lawyers that don't want to do this.\" At a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Trump said he had not spoken to Bukele about sending Abrego Garcia back. \"I really leave that to the lawyers,\" he said, adding, \"They know the laws, and we follow the laws exactly.\" A federal judge, an appeals court and the Supreme Court haveall ordered the administrationto \"facilitate\" Abrego Garcia's return after he was deported to a prison in El Salvador on March 15. Lawyers for the Justice Department have acknowledged in court filings that the deportation was a mistake because an immigration judge had ruled that while Abrego Garcia could be deported, he could not be sent back to his native El Salvador. But administration officials have also said that, because Abrego Garcia is in custody in El Salvador, the United States does not have the legal authority to bring him back. \"Abrego Garcia is being held in the sovereign, domestic custody of the independent nation of El Salvador. DHS does not have authority to forcibly extract an alien from the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation,\" the Department of Homeland Security's general counselsaid in one court filing. Attorney General Pam Bondi put it more succinctly this month: “That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us. ... If they wanted to return him, we would facilitate it.\" Trump suggested in the ABC News interview that the admission of the mistake was the issue, not the error itself. \"Well, the lawyer that said it was a mistake was here a long time, was not appointed by us\" and \"should not have said that,\" he said, appearing to refer to a Justice Department lawyer who wasremoved from the caseafter having called Abrego Garcia's deportation an \"administrative error.\" Other Justice Department attorneys on the case have also acknowledged it was a mistake in court filings, including Solicitor General D. John Sauer, formerly Trump's personal lawyer. It's unclear what impact Trump's remarks might have on Abrego Garcia's case. The Justice Department referred a request for comment to the White House. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department tried this month to introduce a meeting Trump had in the Oval Office with Bukele as evidence in the case. Bukele told reporters hewould not return Abrego Garciaand called the question \"preposterous.\" Drew Ensign, a lawyer for the government, told U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis that the exchange showed that the subject of Abrego Garcia's return was \"raised at the highest possible levels.\" Xinis noted that in the transcript the government provided her, it was a reporter — not Trump or the other officials there with him — who brought up the return. She also said that what happened in the Oval Office \"is not before this court\" and that she would rely on \"sworn, under oath testimony.\" David Leopold, an attorney and the former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said Xinis is likely to take a similar position if Abrego Garcia's attorneys try to use Trump's comments to ABC News as evidence. \"The judge is probably going to do the same thing here,\" Leopold said, although Trump's remarks are in clear conflict withthe Justice Department's positionthat the United States has no say in Abrego Garcia's detention. Abrego Garcia is in the \"sovereign, domestic custody\" of El Salvador, and the United States has no say in his detention, the government has said. Leopold said Trump \"said what everybody knows\" and what Abrego Garcia's lawyers have been arguing in court — that since the United States is paying for the deportees to be kept in Salvadoran prisons, it has the ability to get them released. \"They subcontracted the detention of the folks they sent to El Salvador,\" Leopold said. \"There's no question he's in the constructive custody of the United States. We're paying the bills.\" In the ABC News interview, Trump also doubled down on his assertion that Abrego Garcia is a member of MS-13. He pointed to a picture he posted onsocial mediain which the letters and numbers M-S-1-3 appeared to have been digitally added to Abrego Garcia's knuckles.\"He said he wasn't a member of a gang, and then they looked, and on his knuckles, he has MS-13,\" Trump said. \"He had MS-13, on his knuckles, tattooed.\" When Moran said that the image had been altered and that Abrego Garcia did not have the tattoo in other pictures, Trump called him \"fake news.\" Oscar Giron, a retired Maryland police investigator who says he worked on hundreds of MS-13 cases on the East Coast, said other tattoos on Abrego Garcia's hand in the picture did not strike him as indicating membership in the gang. \"I have not seen those before,\" he said. Giron added that in his experience, members of the gang had largely stopped getting affiliated tattoos in recent years because they wanted to avoid detection by law enforcement. Leopold said the accusations about the tattoos show the importance of the courts' second directive in Abrego Garcia's case — that he be given the due process he should have had before he was shipped off to El Salvador. \"The term sounds legalistic, but it means a notice and an opportunity to be heard by a court. Mr. Abrego Garcia did not get that,\" Leopold said. \"Due process would have given him a chance to defend himself\" and to \"test the government’s evidence against him,\" he added. The Supreme Court ruled that Abrego Garcia’s removal was “illegal” and that Xinis’ order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.” In an interview withCBS Newsthat aired Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said, \"If he were to be brought back to the United States of America, we would immediately deport him again.” At an April 15 court hearing, Xinis said she was frustrated at the government's failure to comply with her orders about what efforts it had taken and would take to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, and she suggested she wasweighing contempt proceedingsdown the road. She directed government officials to answer questions under oath and sit for depositions, a directive she paused after the government put in a sealed filing asking for more time. The Justice Department put in a second such request this week, which she denied Wednesday. Xinis ordered the administration tocomply with her discovery ordersby May 9. In a statement, the law firm representing Abrego Garcia, Murray Osorio PLLC, said it \"will seek to determine who in the U.S. government has taken action to facilitate Mr. Abrego Garcia’s return, what specific steps they’ve taken, and who may have worked to block those efforts. These questions demand answers—and through discovery, we intend to obtain them.\" It added that \"we will pursue every legal avenue to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia’s return home to his family, so that he can get a full and fair trial on the allegations against him, and we won’t rest until that day comes.\"",

    "article_text": "Federal immigration agents searched the home of a family in Oklahoma and seized their belongings when conducting a search warrant issued for someone else. The U.S. citizen mother of three daughters said the family has been \"traumatized\" since they were wrongly subjected to a search and seizure warrant that had the names of the residents who previously lived in her Oklahoma City home. “We’re citizens. That’s what I kept saying. We’re citizens,”the woman told KFOR, an NBC-affiliated local TV news station. “They were very dismissive, very rough, very careless.\" According to KFOR, which first reported the story, the immigration agents raided the home last week. They had a search warrant for the home, but the suspects listed on the warrant were not living in the house anymore. About 20 armed agents busted through the door in the middle of the night, KFOR reported. At first, the mother didn't know who they were. “It was dark. All the lights were off,” she said. \"My initial thought was we were being robbed — that my daughters, being females, were being kidnapped.\" The mother, whose identity was not revealed and who KFOR referred to by the pseudonym \"Marisa\" in its reporting, told the TV station the men who entered her home identified themselves as federal agents with the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigations and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \"The U.S. Marshal Service was not involved in the incident,\" Brady McCarron, deputy chief of public affairs at the United States Marshals Service, told NBC News in an email Tuesday. A spokesperson for the FBI referred NBC News' request for comment to Homeland Security Investigations, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security that investigates criminal cases. A senior DHS official confirmed to NBC News on Wednesday that ICE carried out \"a court-authorized search warrant for a large-scale human smuggling investigation,\" involving eight Guatemalan nationals indicted in a federal case in the Northern District of Oklahoma. “The search warrants included the location of an address where U.S. citizens recently moved. The previous residents were the intended targets,\" the official said. The mother and her daughters wrongly targeted had recently moved from Maryland, settling in the rented home in Oklahoma City just a couple of weeks ago — hoping for a slower, more affordable lifestyle, KFOR reported. The father was set to join the family in their new home this weekend. Though none of the family members were the subjects of the warrant, federal agents raided their home and confiscated their belongings. They took their phones, laptops and all their cash savings as \"evidence,\" KFOR reported. \"I said you took my phone. We have no money. I just moved here,” the mother said. “I have to feed my children. I’m going to need gas money. I need to be able to get around. Like, how do you just leave me like this? Like an abandoned dog.” “I kept pleading. I kept telling them we weren’t criminals. They were treating us like criminals. We were here by ourselves. We didn’t do anything,\" the mother added. She said the agents ordered her and her daughters to step outside, even though it was raining and they barely were given time to put on clothes. “They wanted me to change in front of all of them, in between all of them,” she said. “My husband has not even seen my daughter in her undergarments — her own dad, because it’s respectful. You have her out there, a minor, in her underwear,” the woman told KFOR. “One of them said, ‘I know it was a little rough this morning,’” she said. “It was so denigrating. That you do all of this to a family, to women, your fellow citizens. And it was a little rough? You literally traumatized me and my daughters for life. We’re going to have to go get help or get over this somehow.” Before the agents left, the mother asked when could the family get their belongings back and they said it could be days or even months, KFOR reported. DHS did not comment on how the mother described and characterized the actions of the agents.",

    "title": "The little-known database at the heart of RFK Jr.'s vaccine conspiracy theory",
    "article_text": "For as long as Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has falsely claimed that vaccines cause widespread harm — from autism to sudden death — he has pointed to the one source he says could immediately prove it. In speeches, interviews andwritings, Kennedy has repeatedly claimed that the evidence of a massive public health cover-up lies buried in a little-known database of medical records of some 12 million Americans: theVaccine Safety Datalink, or VSD. “For decades, the CDC has kept a tight grip on the Vaccine Safety Datalink, concealing vital vaccine safety information from the public,” Kennedysaid in 2023. Kennedy now oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including the Vaccine Safety Datalink — and one of his first initiatives as health secretary was tolaunch his long-dreamed-of studyusing the VSDto investigate the linkbetween childhood vaccines and autism. It’s a theory that has already been disproven in dozens of studies, manyusing VSD data. “We’re going to be able to get into these databases and give answers to the American public,” Kennedysaid last month. He told President Donald Trump at recent Cabinet meeting that he would reveal the cause of autism by September. However, in recent weeks, Kennedy’s anti-vaccine allies have begun casting doubt on this pledge, once again alleging a government conspiracy to block access to the truth. Without evidence, anti-vaccine lawyer Aaron Siri and activist Del Bigtree have claimed on the internet show \"The HighWire\" that the CDC scattered the vaccine safety data after Kennedy took office, making it unavailable for Kennedy’s team to examine. The goal,according to Siri, was to “thwart the ability for the current administration to actually conduct a study in the VSD.” It’s a pattern that has echoed through the first months of the Trump administration: Onetime outsiders who had long asserted that the federal government was hiding the truth suddenly had access to all the government documents they could want — only to reveal that, perhaps, there were no nefarious secrets after all. TheJFK assassination filesexposed little about his killing that wasn’t already known. Therelease of records in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking casewas a dud. Trump and Elon Musk’s claims that millions of people over 100 were receiving Social Securityquickly fell apart. Now, it appears that anti-vaccine activists are similarly girding for the possibility that Kennedy’s promises may fall short — and they’re already laying the groundwork for someone to blame. “We’ve been saying that database is where the answers are,” Bigtree, who was communications director for Kennedy’s 2024 presidential campaign, said of the VSD on “The HighWire” last week. “You could do the study in probably minutes with AI and computer learning and everything that’s possible. Then the moment before Bobby gets in there to be able to do that study, what did they do? They obliterated it.” It’s not clear exactly what Bigtree and Siri meant; neither responded to requests for comment. Kennedy also didn’t respond. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services initially said he would “look into it,” but did not respond to further requests for comment. A CDC spokesperson confirmed that nothing about the stewardship of VSD data had changed in the last year. There’s one thing that Bigtree and Siri have right: The data in the VSD is not actually housed at the CDC — but that’s not a recent change. The VSD is a collaboration between a small team at the CDC’s Immunization Safety Office and 11 private health care organizations. Since the 1990s, it’s been used to monitor vaccine safety and conduct studies of rare side effects. “These studies that use the VSD are able to tell the difference between a condition that coincidentally happens after vaccination and a condition that may actually be the result of vaccination,” said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The health care organizations used to send their anonymized medical data to the CDC each year for analysis, but since 2001, the organizations havekept the data on their own servers,to ensure it stays secure. “Sometimes people have the image that if there’s a vaccine safety study, there must be one giant database with all the information in it,” Sharfstein said. “If you’re not familiar with how distributed networks of data are designed and used in studies, then it can be confusing. Because there is no one big dataset. There is no single file that can just be sent or released.” The conspiracy lore around the VSD began in the early aughts, around the time that Kennedy, then an environmental lawyer, was being introduced to the anti-vaccine movement. At that point, the only groups with access to the VSD were the CDC and the participating health care organizations. The studies they produced relied on the data they collected, including from doctor and hospital visits, vaccinations, pharmacies and lab results. Then in 2002, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who had a grandsonhe believedhad been injured by vaccines, allied with several parent-led autism groups. Frustrated with anti-vaccine researchers’ lack of access to data that might prove the link, Burton threatened to subpoena the VSD’s patient records. At a hearingon the topic, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., urged Burton not to do it. “A subpoena could have the effect of driving HMOs from the program and destroying CDC’s ability to scientifically test hypotheses relating to adverse events potentially associated with vaccines,” Waxman warned, referring to the health care organizations. (Burton and Waxman left Congress in the mid-2010s.) Subpoenaing millions of medical records “would have been a profound invasion of privacy,” said Johns Hopkins’ Sharfstein. The CDC offered a solution: It would work with the participating health organizations to get independent researchers access to the data. Among the earliest beneficiaries — with the help of  former Rep. Dave Weldon, R-Fla., the recently withdrawn CDC director nominee — were theanti-vaccine researchersMark and David Geier, a father-son pair who baselessly theorized that autism was the result of an interaction between a preservative in vaccines and testosterone. (Mark Geier died this year in Florida, over a decade after being stripped of his medical license in several states, partly forimproperly treatingautistic children with hormone blockers. David Geier, who was disciplined by the Maryland Board of Physicians for practicing medicine without a license in 2012,was hiredat HHS this year as a senior data analyst to reanalyze vaccine safety data under Kennedy, according to two sources familiar with the plan.) The Geiers' work with VSD data was marked by alleged ethical breaches. In 2003 and 2004, the Geiers visited the CDC’s Maryland data center to access VSD data for a study looking at whether the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine increased risks for harmful side effects. Instead, according toa letter of complaintfrom one of the health care groups, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the Geiers violated protocol and began comparing rates of autism in children who received vaccines with different amounts of a preservative. Further, Kaiser Permanente said the Geiers tried to merge datasets in a way that would have risked patients’ confidentiality, then tried to remove files from the datacenter. Subsequently, Kaiser Permanente suspended the Geiers' access to the VSD. The Geiersdenied the accusationsand published their findings in journals known more for conspiracy theories than rigorous science. At anInstitute of Medicine panel in 2004, Mark Geier claimed the VSD data they analyzed showed that vaccines were linked to autism. Their published papers have beenwidely criticizedby scientists and their findings never replicated or supported by mainstream research. In 2006, they were approved for another study using VSD data, and again, stopped after violating protocol,according to lawyersrepresenting the government in a set of test cases known as the Omnibus Autism Proceedings. Lawyers representing the parents of autistic children — for whom the Geiers had been providing research — suggested in legal filings that the Geiers had been unfairly banned at the whims of CDC. For the Geiers, the experience was one of oppression. At anti-vaccine conferences, they presented PowerPoints alleging that the CDC had “restricted” their access to data and “attacked” their findings. At the same conferences, Kennedy, who has consistentlypraised the Geiers, told a similar story. “Oh, they’ve hidden it, and they won’t let anybody in it, except their own guys who cherry-pick and design these fabricated studies and change the protocols constantly to try to use it to defend vaccines,” Kennedy saidin a 2017 keynoteat AutismOne, an anti-vaccine conference for parents of autistic children where the Geiers also presented. “It’s being used instead to craft these fabricated, fraudulent studies,” he said, “to fool the public about vaccine safety.” That same year, as Trump considered chairing a committee to review vaccine safety, Kennedy and a group of anti-vaccine activistsmet withFrancis Collins, then the director of the National Institutes of Health, to ask him to “open up” the VSD to scientists who would “investigate whether vaccines are associated with the epidemic of health disorders plaguing our children today.” Ina letterfollowing the meeting, Collins, who resigned from the NIH last month, told Kennedy that because of privacy concerns, access was limited to researchers who made formal requests and met certain criteria. Further, Collins said the kind of study Kennedy had suggested would be difficult because the sample population of unvaccinated children in the VSD — already just a fraction of the U.S. population — would be too small. Now, with Kennedy at the helm of HHS and Geier working for him, there are no roadblocks left.",

    "title": "Christian organization plagued by allegations of child sex abuse faces another lawsuit",
    "article_text": "A Florida-based Christian organization with a history of child sex abuse allegations against it has been hit with a lawsuit claiming one of its missionaries sexually assaulted a minor overseas 15 years ago. Ethnos360, a nonprofit formerly known as New Tribes Mission, sends missionaries and their families throughout the globe. In 2019,multiple women told NBC News that they had been sexually abuseddecades earlier by their “dorm dads” — missionaries who were supposed to care for children at the mission’s boarding schools while their parents served in foreign countries. The groupsettled several suits related to those allegationsand issued a public apology to the abuse survivors following the 2019 NBC News report. It also said it had “incorporated significant child safety training” after an independent party commissioned by New Tribes Mission shared recommendations in 2010 amid the abuse allegations. But Wednesday's lawsuit, filed in Circuit Court in Seminole County, Florida, says the group “failed to offer any care or professional assistance” to the family of an American child who came forward to report inappropriate sexual conduct in 2012, two years after those recommendations were issued. The girl, Kayla McClain, is now 24, lives in Michigan and recently graduated from nursing school. NBC News does not normally identify alleged victims of sexual assault, but McClain opted to be identified by her full name in the legal filing. “I’m tired of being quiet and tired of being invisible,” McClain said in her first public remarks about the case. “I just want people to know what really happened and that there’s actually a face and a name behind what’s going on.” David Doyle, an attorney for Ethnos360, said the group “takes allegations of this nature very seriously” and “categorically denies any merit to allegations made against it.” McClain was around 5 years old in 2005 when she met her alleged abuser, Nate Horling, the lawsuit said. Like McClain and her family, Horling lived with his wife and children in housing in Indonesia provided by what was then New Tribes Mission. He had a child about McClain’s age whom McClain would play with, the legal complaint said, adding that the alleged abuse by Horling started with inappropriate touching while McClain was playing with his child. Afterward, Horling would allegedly tell McClain “he was sorry and instructed her not to tell anyone and blamed her for what occurred,” the lawsuit said. The abuse escalated after both families relocated to a different part of Indonesia in 2009, where Horling later allegedly sexually assaulted McClain in a closet, according to the lawsuit. Horling, who is not named as a defendant, told NBC News in an email that he “absolutely” denies all allegations. The lawsuit comes less than a year after anotherlegal filing against Ethnos360, which alleged the group failed to protect a girl from repeated sexual misconduct by a peer at its missionary training center in Missouri in 2016 and failed to adequately investigate the abuse allegations. That lawsuit is ongoing, though Ethnos360 has filed a motion to dismiss it, arguing in court documents that because the alleged abuse occurred in private residences on Ethnos360 property, not while children were under Ethnos360 staff supervision, the group did not have “any right and /or duty to control, occupy, or monitor the families and activities within the residences.” Boz Tchividjian, the attorney who filed last year’s lawsuit as well as Wednesday’s, said Ethnos360 needs to examine why it has faced so many allegations of inappropriate behavior. “It’s not in a vacuum. This is over, and over, and over again,” said Tchividjian, who was the founder and former executive director of Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment, or GRACE, the group hired to make the 2010 recommendations on handling abuse to Ethnos360 when it was called New Tribes Mission. He is no longer part of GRACE. Wednesday’s lawsuit said the GRACE report outlined multiple instances of sexual abuse within Ethnos360 and accused the organization’s leadership of failing to properly respond to child sexual abuse allegations. On its website, Ethnos360acknowledges past misstepsand has asection dedicated to child safety, in which it says it has safeguards to protect kids, including background checks for anyone applying for Ethnos360 membership and specialized training for all new members. Yet the lawsuit claims that when McClain’s family contacted Ethnos360’s child safety leadership team in Indonesia, there was limited response. McClain said her father had reached out to the child safety team in 2012 after she disclosed to her parents that she was engaging in sexual conduct with other children — a behavior that can be an indicator of a child being abused by an adult. The lawsuit said that several members spoke with her parents in the months that followed but did not open an investigation into the sexualized behavior. It also said Ethnos360 did not offer any care or help to McClain or the other minors and acted as if the conduct “was typical sexual exploration between children.” McClain said it was not until years later that her parents found out she had been sexually abused by an adult. Her attorney said that, at that time, her emotional state was too fragile to consider filing charges. “The child safety team never talked to me. I really needed someone who was trained to and knew how to talk to a kid in this situation, because I didn’t know how to share what had happened,” McClain said. McClain started struggling profoundly with her mental health in 2018 once she and her family returned to the United States from Indonesia, the lawsuit said, adding that she had flashbacks of her alleged abuse and attempted to take her own life in 2019. After undergoing treatment, she decided to report her experience to Ethnos360 in 2021 through IHART, a review team commissioned by Ethnos360 to investigate claims of abuse, according to the lawsuit. After several hours-long interviews, Ethnos360 allegedly offered no counseling to McClain and did not report the allegations to child protection agencies, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit accuses Ethnos360 of negligence in failing to protect McClain from abuse and failing to provide adequate training to its employees to identify and report child abuse. It seeks unspecified damages and a jury trial. McClain said her experience has caused her to have post-traumatic stress disorder and has made her question her view of God. “The abuse that happened was horrible, but what has really affected me is the response from Ethnos and the child safety team and IHART,” she said. “They need to be held accountable. I want the silence to stop.” If you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, call theNational Sexual Assault Telephone Hotlineat 1-800-656-4673.

    "article_text": "An Oklahoma man died after he was swept away by flooding Wednesday as heavy rain struck the state and Texas, where around 16 million people were under high water alerts, officials said. The man in Pottawatomie County died after his vehicle was swept off a roadway around 12:30 p.m., and after a sheriff’s deputy who tried to save him also became trapped in the water, the sheriff’s office said. The deputy was rescued by firefighters. “Tragically, despite every effort made, the individual in distress could not be reached in time and passed away at the scene,” the sheriff’s officesaid in a statement on social media. “Our hearts are heavy tonight for this loss of life, and we extend our deepest condolences to the man’s family and loved ones.” The death occurred as roadways and other areas in central Oklahoma and the Dallas area flooded due to heavy rainfall caused by a stalled frontal boundary, the National Weather Service said. The heavy rainfall there came a day after severe weathercontributed to the deaths of four people in Pennsylvania, one of whom was electrocuted as he tried to extinguish a mulch fire, police there said. Around 2 inches of rain fell in Wichita Falls, Texas, and 2.8 inches in Lawton, Oklahoma, forecasters at the weather service in Norman, Oklahoma, said. Around 16 million people were under flood watches or warnings in Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri on Wednesday afternoon, according to the weather service. Tornado watches also covered an area where almost 5 million people live, from eastern Texas to northern Louisiana and most of Arkansas Wednesday afternoon, it said. In Skiatook, north of Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol used an airboat on city streets as it monitored rising floodwaters from Bird Creek and prepared to assist with any rescues, the law enforcement agency said on X. The heaviest rain threat was for southeastern Oklahoma, into northeastern Texas and western Arkansas, the weather service said. The heaviest rain had moved out southeastern Oklahoma by late Wednesday afternoon, the weather service in Norman said, but rivers were expected to continue to flood through Thursday. In the Dallas area, a flood warning remained in place for the Rowlett Creek Near Sachse until 7:50 a.m. Thursday. Moderate flooding was expected,the weather service said. The rainfall for the south-central United States is expected to end Thursday, but the risk of thunderstorms will then move to the Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee valleys, the weather service said.",

    "title": "Officer killed in gunman's Pennsylvania hospital siege was hit by friendly fire, prosecutor says",
    "article_text": "YORK, Pa. — An officer killed while responding toa Pennsylvania hospital siegewas struck by a shotgun blast fired by police that also hit an armed man holding hostages, a prosecutor disclosed at a news conference Wednesday. The attacker and West York PatrolmanAndrew W. Duartewere killed in the gunfire in York on Feb. 22, while several other people were injured. The shotgun blast also wounded a second officer responding to the intensive care unit, York County District Attorney Tim Barker said in announcing the results of his investigation. Barker called the officers heroes who ran into a dangerous situation, ready to risk their lives and save hostages. He said attacker Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz “unleashed a torrent of evil” and directly caused Duarte’s death. “I looked at every moment of video and I saw on every person’s face that willingness to walk into, to run into the path of gunfire and potential death. They were willing to lay down their lives for every single person at that hospital,” Barker said. He called their actions “100% justified and legally appropriate.” The attack at UPMC Memorial Hospital occurred after the gunman learned from a doctor that the woman he lived with had died after treatment there, Barker told reporters. Investigators seeking a motive in Archangel-Ortiz’s “mental state” came up empty, he said. “There was no description provided whatsoever that would lead anyone to have believed that the actor was going to commit this type of mass violence,” Barker said. Duarte’s last act was to run toward the threat, Chief Matthew Millsaps had said previously at the officer’s funeral. Archangel-Ortiz, 49, had purchased zip ties and a knife that morning and used a gun stolen in 2017 from a neighboring county during the attack, Barker said. He said Archangel-Ortiz appeared to become nauseous when a doctor told him the woman had been moved to the hospital morgue. Moments later, he displayed a gun and announced: “This is what we’re going to talk about,” Barker said. Archangel-Ortiz shot the doctor, grazing his arm and piercing a jacket. The doctor, who had texted to warn colleagues of the gunman, fled from the ICU. What ensued was a chaotic series of events in which Archangel-Ortiz threatened hostages and patients and made one hospital worker zip tie others. A hospital worker who had been shot in the leg was able to flee and lock herself in a bathroom. Barker said Archangel-Ortiz also called his brother during the siege, telling him to clean up his home and give away his jewelry. “This is how I’m going out,” Archangel-0rtiz told his brother, Barker said. Police tried to negotiate and de-escalate the crisis, Barker said, as they also organized teams at the intensive care doors and formulated a plan to have officers follow someone with a tactical shield into the unit. He said Duarte was hit in the shoulder and chest. In all, Barker said, four workers were hurt — the doctor and worker who were shot, a third person with head trauma and a fourth with a minor injury. Two police officers were shot, a third was injured by shrapnel and Duarte was killed. He did not disclose the name of the officer who fired the shotgun. When police recovered Archangel-Ortiz’s 9mm handgun, it was not loaded. Barker said they had no details on why Archangel-Ortiz did what he did, noting, “sometimes there is no ‘why.’” “The only thing that we can state is that he, on his own, decided to enter UPMC that day, fully prepared to take hostages and kill people,” Barker said. Some of the nurses who survived the attack have shared their accounts in social media, disclosing details about injuries and treatment and how the attack has haunted the survivors. The attack highlighted rising violence against U.S. health care workers and the challenges of protecting them. Nurse Tosha Trostle said in a Facebook post that she was held against him as a shield at gunpoint, arms zip-tied behind her back, as they walked through a doorway and encountered a phalanx of responding police officers. She said she begged Archangel-Ortiz to let her go and that he pushed the gun against her neck and spine. She heard gunshots and fell onto the floor under his body, then was able to get to safety.",

    "title": "Republicans hit early snags as they start crafting a massive bill for Trump's agenda",
    "article_text": "WASHINGTON — Republicans are already hitting some snags as they begin the work of crafting a bill for President Donald Trump’ssweeping domestic policy agenda. And they haven’t even made some of their hardest decisions yet. Fresh off a two-week recess, House committees have begun marking up their respective pieces of the package, which aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, boost funding for immigration enforcement and the military, and increase the debt ceiling. In their hunt for steep savings to pay for it all, Republicans are starting with some of the lowest-hanging fruit when it comes to spending cuts. But that process has already sparked some skirmishes among Republican lawmakers, offering a preview of the bigger intraparty fights — such as whether to slash funding for anti-poverty programs like Medicaid — that are still to come. Follow live politics coverage here Rep. Sam Graves, R-Mo., the chair of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, on Wednesday was forced at the eleventh hour to yank a provision out of his panel’s portion of the package that would have created a new $20 annual fee on nearly all passenger vehicles after conservatives revolted. Separately, on the Judiciary Committee, a push by Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., to codify Trump’s proposal of a “gold card” visa for wealthy foreigners was rejected by conservatives opposed to expanding visa programs. And on the Education and Workforce Committee, Chairman Tim Walberg, R-Mich., on Tuesday pushed through anoverhaul of student loan programsthat would cut $351 billion in federal spending, drawing criticisms from Democrats. The most contentious part of that overhaul, Walberg said, is a “risk-sharing” provision that would make colleges, universities and trade schools partially responsible for unpaid student loan balances. “All the committees are making tough decisions, and we’re gonna build this bill,” said Rep. August Pfluger, R-Texas, the chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the largest caucus of conservatives on Capitol Hill. After passing their budget framework for Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” earlier this month, House Republicans are now trying to fill out the details. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he thinks the House can cobble together all the separate pieces and send the package to the Senate by Memorial Day — an ambitious but not impossible deadline. But it means Republican leaders, committee chairpeople and rank-and-file members are now having the politically tricky conversations about how to pay for the bill and what might get cut. And every House Republican’s opinion matters in the process because of the party's fragile 220-213 majority. “Just about every step of the way has been difficult with a small majority,” Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters, adding that he’s also had “a lot” of conversations with senators as well to make sure both chambers are on the same page. Perhaps the trickiest issue Republicans still need to resolve is how to handle potential Medicaid cuts, which vulnerable and moderate Republicans have strongly warned against. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees the programand is responsible for finding a whopping $880 billion in cuts for the bill, is planning to hold a markup on May 7, but has to finalize its portion of the package. The committee’s chairman has been meeting with members from all across the ideological spectrum as they try to find a solution. But even smaller, less innocuous issues can trip up the entire process. The vehicle fee was an example of an issue that unexpectedly blew up at the last minute. Graves, the Transportation Committee chairman, had included the provision in his panel’s package to help meet the committee’s so-called \"reconciliation\" instructions, which dictate what each panel is required to cut or allowed to spend. Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., the former chair of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, offered an amendment to kill it as conservatives disparaged it as a “car tax.” Graves’ team checked in with committee members to gauge support for the fee, two Republican sources said, but it became clear there was too much opposition and Graves made the call Tuesday night to pull it from the package. The committee was then forced to find other ways to hit its saving goals. The package will now boost an annual fee for electric vehicles to $250, up from the originally proposed $200, as well as reduce funding for air traffic control modernization to $12.5 billion, down from the initial $15 billion that was proposed. “EV owners have not been paying anything into the highway trust fund and justifiably, now they will,” said Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, who opposed the $20 passenger car fee. “I’m very glad there won’t be any fees on gasoline driven vehicles whose owners and drivers have already been paying their fair share into the highway trust fund through the federal gasoline tax.” Another GOP spat emerged on the Judiciary Committee over visas. Issa, a senior member of the panel, had hoped to include in Wednesday’s committee’s markup Trump’s idea to sell$5 million gold card visasthat would offer immigrants legal permanent residency and a path to citizenship. Issa argued the proposal could bring in at least an additional $150 billion to pay for the bill. But Issa said another member of the panel, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the far-right Freedom Caucus, effectively vetoed the idea. “I got screwed out of the gold card because a few of our members wouldn’t go along with having an expansion of revenue related to visas, EB-5 and H-1,” Issa said in an interview Wednesday. “The president’s point [is] that we should be able to generate revenue by bringing the investors in to invest, and we have a program that brings in very little by comparison. But Chip killed it.” “I would be voting for reconciliation,” Issa added, “but I would be disappointed when it’s left out.” Roy did not respond to a request for comment. A Judiciary Committee spokesman suggested that Republicans still could revisit the gold card issue. \"We are working hand-in-glove with the White House and totally support President Trump's agenda,\" spokesman Russell Dye said in a statement Wednesday. These types of decisions, however, are the easy ones. The hard ones will need to be resolved in the coming days and weeks. On Wednesday afternoon, Johnson hosted a meeting with Republicans from blue states like New York, New Jersey and California who are aggressively pushing to raise the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction in the package. The House Ways and Means Committee, where that issue will be decided, will likely meet sometime next week. \"It was a lively discussion but we're still far away from a deal,\" Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., said as he left the nearly hourlong SALT meeting. \"I want to ensure we make whole as many of our middle class families as possible.\" On Medicaid, Republicans facing tough re-election fights in the 2026 midterm elections are worried it’s not mathematically possible to achieve their spending targets without a steep cut to Medicaid,citing estimatesfrom the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Republican leaders have said they only want to target waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid system. Leaving a meeting with House Republicans on Wednesday, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chair of the Budget Committee, reiterated that the GOP wants to impose work requirements for Medicaid eligibility to raise the revenue needed to fund Trump’s agenda. “The whole idea of using Medicaid to help able-bodied people who could be working, most Americans will say no to,” Graham said. “Medicaid was designed to help poor people and disabled people … We got a chance to fix it. And if we fail, I think we’ll pay a heavy price.”",

    "title": "The NBA playoffs have been especially contentious so far",
    "article_text": "A common refrain from NBA players and coaches this time of year is that the playoffs are a completely different sport than the regular season. The pace of play slows down, referees swallow their whistles in favor of physicality, and the familiarity that grows between teams over the course of a series makes it harder and harder to win. This year, that familiarity has also bred contempt, as nearly every series in the first round has featured a skirmish of some sort, or at the least spirited trash talk. Let’s run through some of the postseason’s more charged moments so far. The Pacers won their series against the Bucks, 4-1, with a thrilling, come-from-behind victory Tuesday night. Except that’s not what anyone is talking about after Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo got into an altercation with — of all people! —Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton’s dadafter Game 5. Don’t worry, Antetokounmpo also had a dustup with an actual player after the game as well. These two teams have a longstanding feud dating to last season. This series started with a war of words between Haliburton and Bucks guard Damian Lillard, who wasn’t even suited up for Game 1. Predictably, thatspilled over onto the floorthe next game. Haliburton has since apologized for his father’s actions. Haliburton and the Pacers also sent well wishes to Lillard after he tore his Achilles in Game 4. In the least surprising development of the playoffs, a matchup featuring the Warriors' Draymond Green and longtime pest Dillon Brooks of the Rockets has gotten a little extra physical. Tempers especially flared in Game 4, which featured technical fouls on both Green and Brooks, as well as a flagrant foul on Green. Warriors forward Jimmy Butler III made his feelings on Brooks clear after the Game 4, saying: “Get me on the record with this: I don’t like Dillon Brooks. We’re never having fun. I’m a fierce competitor. He’s a fierce competitor. There ain’t nothing fun about that.” The Nuggets and Clippers have also had some smoke for each other. Things started relatively tame in Game 1, when Los Angeles assistant coach Jeff Van Gundy wouldn’t let go of the ball to stop Denver center Nikola Jokic from quickly starting a possession. The chippiness escalated in Game 3, when a hard foul by Denver's Christian Braun led to some shoving and six techs. Not to be outdone, the battle between two historically nasty Eastern Conference teams, the Knicks and the Pistons, has also featured some fireworks. In Game 3, three technicals were handed out after some shoving. The first five games of the series have been very physical, to the point where refs may bemissing some clear fouls. Compared to the feistiness elsewhere, this has been a relatively respectful series. But that didn’t stop Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert from elbowing Lakers star LeBron James in the back of the head after Gobert took exception to a hard boxout. The defending champion Celtics won their series against the Magic, 4-1, though not without a cost. The Magic committed three significant flagrant fouls in the series. In Game 1, Boston's Jayson Tatum injured his wrist on a foul by Orlando's Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, causing Tatum to miss Game 2. In Game 2, Boston's Kristaps Porzingis was bloodied after an elbow to the face. And in Game 3, Orlando's Cole Anthonydislocated one ofBoston's Jaylen Brown’s fingerswith a flagrant foul. For fans of nonviolence, the Heat and Cavaliers had them covered. After Game 2, Cleveland guard Darius Garland said the team’s game plan was to attack Miami’s Tyler Herro. Herro responded before Game 3, saying Garland himself wasn’t a very good defender. There was no showdown on the court, however, as Garland missed the last two games of the series as the Cavaliers cruised to a sweep.",

    "title": "Congress considers ending legal help for migrant children after judge orders restart",
    "article_text": "Just before a judge ordered it to do so, the Trump administration agreed to resume paying for attorneys for migrant children who come to the United States alone. But groups that have been struggling to keep such unaccompanied children from being deported said the legal help is still in jeopardy under a Republican proposal put forward in a House committee Wednesday. “I have been doing this work for a very long time, and what I read in this bill took by breath away,” said Jennifer Podkul, vice president for policy and advocacy at Kids in Need of Defense. “This bill not only makes it impossible for children to access protection in the United States, but it would make the government responsible for putting children in even more compromised and dangerous conditions.” The White House, the Department of Health and Human Services and the House Judiciary Committee, which considered the measure, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. U.S. District Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguin, in California’s Northern District, issued a preliminary injunction late Tuesday ordering the administration to resume the money for the legal assistance, which it had stopped in March. Several groups that provided the legal help suedafter they were forced to abruptly lay off workers and scramble to find other help for unaccompanied migrant children with pending cases — including some who are victims of trafficking — and, in some instances, withdraw from the cases. Martínez-Olguin had ordered the administration to resume paying for the attorneys in the case. But the plaintiff groups filed additional complaints with the court saying the administrationrefused to comply with that temporary restraining order. During that time, the administration appealed and also tried to have the judge recuse herself. Monday, on the eve of the deadline for Martínez-Olguin's decision on the preliminary injunction, the administration signed a modified contract with the Acacia Center for Justice, said Adina Appelbaum, program director for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights Immigration Impact Lab, which is representing some of the plaintiffs. Acacia had subcontracted more than 100 groups around the country to provide legal help to about 26,000 unaccompanied children. The new contract is for a shorter period, Appelbaum said. But how long the funding will last could depend on what Congress does in the budget legislation currently being written. The measure considered by the House committee would omit money for attorneys for unaccompanied children, which Congress has paid for since 2009, according to immigration and anti-trafficking groups that reviewed the legislation, attorneys with the groups said. The measure also proposed a number of fees that would charge unaccompanied children and their parents or guardians whom they could end up with in the United States. They included $5,000 for arriving at the border between legal ports of entry, as well as sponsorship fees of up to $8,500. Members of organizations that assist unaccompanied children said the proposal, if it became law, would “dismantle” protections for unaccompanied children, with \"catastrophic\" implications for children seeking safety in the United States, including many who are trafficking victims within and outside the country. Jean Bruggeman, executive director of the Freedom Network, the country's largest coalition of anti-trafficking advocates and experts, said the United States has made \"impressive\" progress against human trafficking over the past 25 years. The measure considered by the committee, Bruggeman said, would be \"a huge gift to traffickers and an increase in vulnerability for children and families in the United States that will lead to more abuse and exploitation.\"",

    "title": "Trump tries to evade blame as he feels economic pressure: From the Politics Desk",
    "article_text": "Welcome to the online version ofFrom the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. In today’s edition, we break down how President Donald Trump is trying to shift the blame as he confronts economic headwinds. Plus, Andrea Mitchell writes that Trump’s frustrations with the lack of progress in the Russia-Ukraine war peace talks may be at a tipping point. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. — Adam Wollner Have a question for the NBC News Politics Desk about the first 100 days of the Trump administration, the status of the “one big, beautiful bill” on Capitol Hill, or the early contours of the 2026 midterm elections? Send your questions topoliticsnewsletter@nbcuni.comand we may answer them in a future edition of the newsletter. President Donald Trump promised to deliver lower prices and economic prosperity on his first day in office. Now, amid a series of negative economic indicators 100 days in, he’s seeking to reframe some of his campaign trail pledges and shift the blame to his predecessor. Report shows a shrinking economy:According to an initial measurement released Wednesday by the Commerce Department, the U.S. economy contracted 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first negative reading since 2022,Rob Wile reports. Economists were expecting the GDP to grow 0.4% in the first three months of the year, following an increase of 2.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024. The report also showed that consumer spending climbed 1.8%, the weakest pace since mid-2023, and that inflation remained firm. Following the GDP report, stock markets saw heavy declines, but finished the day higher. Blame game:In response, Trump said it was former President Joe Biden’s fault,Katherine Doyle reports. “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “I didn’t take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers.” Trump made a similar argument during a Cabinet meeting Wednesday, encouraging critics to “give us a pass on the first month,” saying that they were “getting used to things, right?” “You probably saw some numbers today, and I have to start off by saying that’s Biden — that’s not Trump,” Trump said. “We came in and I was very against everything that Biden was doing in terms of the economy. … We took over his mess in so many different ways.” And in an interview Tuesday with ABC News, Trump insisted he had prepared Americans for a “transition period,” despite his promises of immediate economic relief,as Henry J. Gomez notes. These remarks stand in contrast to what Trump said when the S&P 500 soared after his election victory. “Everyone is calling it the — I don’t want to say this. It’s too braggadocious, but we’ll say it anyway — the Trump effect,” Trump said during a rally in Washington, D.C., on the eve of his inauguration. What the polls say:Recent surveys show that voters largely attribute current economic conditions to Trump’s policies. ACNBC pollfound that 54% of adults said Trump’s economic policies would have a negative impact, now or in the future, while 60% of registered voters in anNPR/PBS News/Marist Pollsaid Trump was responsible for the current economic conditions. An equal number of registered voters in aNew York Times/Siena College pollblamed Trump and Biden for the biggest challenges facing the economy. On Capitol Hill:The Senate is set to vote on a resolution that would undo the sweeping tariffs that Trump imposed on most countries earlier this month,Rebecca Shabad, Frank Thorp V, Kate Santaliz and Julie Tsirkin report. Related read:Trump’s economy at 100 days: Unprecedented uncertainty reigns, by Rob Wile As President Donald Trump celebrates the milestone of passing 100 days in his second term, he is clearly running out of patience with his lack of progress in achieving a ceasefire in Ukraine, a war he had promised he could settle in 24 hours. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued what sounded like an ultimatum to both sides, authorizing his spokesperson to announce: “We are now at the time to deliver concrete proposals. If there is not progress, the U.S. will step back as mediators.” It was a harder line than Rubio had taken days earlier on “Meet the Press,” when he told Kristen Welker: “This week is going to be a really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in.” Fueling the president’s frustration, according to aides, is Russia’s bombing of Kyiv and other civilian targets more than a month after Ukraine accepted a U.S.-proposed 30-day ceasefire. Trump’s impatience also contributed to his unprecedented one-on-one with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy at the Vatican, captured in that powerful image of the two leaders sitting knee-to-knee under the Michelangelo frescoes. And it was amplified when, on the flight home from Rome, Trump posted on Truth Social that Vladimir Putin’s attacks on Ukrainian’s cities “makes me think… he’s just tapping me along, and has to be dealt with differently, through ‘Banking’ or ‘Secondary Sanctions?’” The Vatican face-to-face came days after special envoy Steve Witkoff and Rubio abruptly cancelled their attendance to a negotiating session in London among foreign ministers from Ukraine, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and the U.S. The Ukrainians and the Europeans traded ceasefire proposals. Notably, in Rubio’s demand that both sides now had to produce concrete proposals or else the U.S. would withdraw from the talks, he put the onus on both Russia and Ukraine, not acknowledging Ukraine had already put a new proposal on the table. The U.S. and Ukraineagreed to the minerals dealTrump wanted Wednesday, one that was revised after the Oval Office blowup between him and Zelenskyy last month. Now the question is whether Trump is ready to punish Russia and agree that Ukraine was the victim of a foreign invasion, or withdraw entirely as a peacemaker in a war he couldn’t stop on Day One.

    "title": "Education Department opens investigation into Chicago Public Schools",
    "article_text": "The U.S. Education Department is investigating Chicago Public Schools amid allegations that a new program designed to improve academic success and retention among Black students and educators violates federal law. The investigationannounced Tuesday is based on a Februarycomplaintby the nonprofit Parents Defending Education, now known as Defending Education, which alleged the school system’s academic-achievement initiative for Black students racially discriminates against students, violating Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The investigation appears to be the first time since President Donald Trump took office in January that the department has investigated a public school system for instituting a racially based program. The school district is the fourth-largest in the nation with 321,000 students,of which 35% were Blackin the 2023-2024 academic school year. Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said Chicago Public Schools sought through the Black Student Success Plan to allocate resources favoring students based on race. “Chicago Public Schools have a record of academic failure, leaving students from all backgrounds and races struggling and ill-prepared to meet the challenges and enjoy the rewards of contemporary American life,” Trainor said in a statement. Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in education programs receiving federal funding. Schools found in violation of the act can lose federal funds, the department said. “Chicago Public Schools does not comment on pending or ongoing litigation,” the school system said Wednesday. School officials said the Black Student Success Plan was designed to ensure students had an equitable learning experience. The school system announced theBlack Student Success Planduring Black History Month in February, saying it aimed to improve academic achievement and to recruit and retain educators and leaders. “The District is committed to removing these obstacles and calls upon the community to support efforts to better serve Black students,” Chicago Public Schools Chief Education Officer Bogdana Chkoumbova said when the initiative was made public. Defending Educationsaid in its complaint that \"members oppose discrimination on the basis of race and political indoctrination in America’s schools\" and called the plan \"racially exclusive.\" The organization could not be reached for comment Wednesday. The plan was scheduled to start this spring with the goal of shortening education gaps and fostering engagement with Black students and families, school officials said. Chicago Teachers Union President Stacy Davis Gates said the investigation was an attempt to hinder progress in the school system. “Rather than using the Department to create opportunities for students, Trump and (Education Secretary Linda E.) McMahon appear determined to transform it into a debt collection agency and a vehicle to dismantle the civil rights protections that support students and their families,” she saidin a statement.",

    "title": "Wegovy treated a serious form of liver disease in a major clinical trial",
    "article_text": "The weight loss drug Wegovy treated a serious form of liver disease in about two-thirds of patients in a major clinical trial, according to the findings published Wednesday in theNew England Journal of Medicine. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease — previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease —affects about 33% of adults in the U.S.About 5% to 7% have a more advanced form of the disease, called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, or MASH. (Another type of liver disease, alcohol-associated liver disease, is caused by drinking.) Both conditions are the result of the body storing too much fat in the liver, said Dr. Sobia Laique, a liver doctor and the director of the Multidisciplinary MASLD Clinic at Cleveland Clinic. In people with MASH, the excess fat has started to cause inflammation, which over time can lead to scarring, or fibrosis. Left untreated, it can progress to liver failure and liver cancer, Laique said. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is more common in people with obesity or Type 2 diabetes, according to theNational Institutes of Health. An estimated 75% of overweight people and more than 90% of people with obesity have the disease. There’s only one FDA-approved medication for MASH, called resmetirom, Laique said. However, the medication only helps about a quarter of patients and doesn’t address the underlying conditions that drive the disease. Bariatric surgery is often the recommended treatment for those who can’t resolve the condition through lifestyle changes, she added. “This is fairly monumental and really is going to be paradigm-changing,” Laique said of the Wegovy trial results, “because at least in the pharmacotherapy space, you don’t have a comparable drug yet.” She was not involved with the clinical trial. The trial, funded by drugmaker Novo Nordisk, included 800 patients with MASH from 37 countries. Patients either got a weekly 2.4 milligram dose of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy, or a placebo, for 72 weeks. The trial found that about 63% of patients in the semaglutide group saw a reduction in liver inflammation, compared with 34.3% of people who got a placebo. Prior to starting the trial, the participants also had moderate to high levels of scar tissue in the liver, known as stage 2 or 3 fibrosis. About 37% of the semaglutide group saw improvements in their fibrosis, compared with 22.4% in the placebo group. The semaglutide group also saw other benefits, including a 10.5% average weight loss. Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said she was impressed, noting that once fibrosis has developed in patients, it’s often difficult to reverse or treat the inflammation. “It’s incredibly good news that semaglutide not only reduced inflammation but also that fibrosis regressed,” Spratt said. Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in Cary, North Carolina, said in an email that the results may offer hope for a condition with few treatment options but added that long-term data is to determine whether the improvements from the drug will reduce liver-related complications and death. “These findings represent a very promising step forward in the fight against a common, progressive, and often silent disease,” McGowan said. The trial results add to the growing list of conditions that GLP-1s —  the class of drugs that includes Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly’s Mounjaro and Zepbound — can treatbeyond diabetes and weight loss. Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved Wegovyto reduce heart disease riskin people with obesity. The agency also approved Zepbound forobstructive sleep apneain December, and Ozempic totreat chronic kidney diseasein patients with Type 2 diabetes in January. Researchers are also investigating whether the drugs are effectiveagainst Alzheimer’sandalcohol addiction. Insurance companies are often reluctant to cover the drugs for weight; however, they’ve shown willingness to cover them when approved for other conditions, such as heart disease risk and sleep apnea. In a release Wednesday, Novo Nordisk said the FDA could make a decision on whether to approve Wegovy for MASH as early as the end of the year. The FDA has granted the drug a priority review designation, the drugmaker said, meaning it will review the application in six months, rather than the standard nine-month window. Spratt noted that side effects can be a barrier for some who want to take Wegovy and similar weight loss drugs. The drug was well tolerated, according to the trial results. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal, including nausea, diarrhea, constipation and vomiting. Side effects leading to people dropping out of the trial were 2.6% for the semaglutide group and 3.3% for the placebo group. Laique questioned whether patients would continue to see improvement after 72 weeks. She also noted that patients would likely have to continue taking the medication, or risk MASH coming back. “It’s significant weight loss, but then is it also durable weight loss?” she said. “And I think that’s the part people often forget about obesity management, it’s two battles.”",

    "title": "Miriam Haley describes, for a second time, alleged assaults by Harvey Weinstein",
    "article_text": "Former “Project Runway” production assistant Miriam Haley was back on the witness stand Wednesday testifying in graphic detail how disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her 19 years ago at his Manhattan apartment and, later, for a second time, at a New York City hotel. Sobbing on the stand, Haley told the court that during the first alleged assault in June 2006 she repeatedly told Weinstein “no” and that she was menstruating, but that did not deter the Hollywood producer who “just continued pushing, continued insisting, pushed me onto bed holding me down.” “He put his mouth on my vagina, before and after he pulled out the tampon, he put his mouth on my vagina forcefully,” Haley testified. “I was mortified, I was embarrassed, in disbelief.” Haley said the next month Weinstein, who had arranged for her to get the TV production assistant job,lured her to his roomat the Tribeca Grand Hotel where he immediately “pulled me towards the bed.” “I was just like, ‘Oh no, no again,’ and he basically proceeded to undress me,” she said. “I felt so stupid. I kind of just went numb and he proceeded to have intercourse with me and I just lay there like a dead fish.” Haley’s account was a reprise of the testimony she provided five years earlier at Weinstein’s first trial, which resulted in alandmark 2020 convictionthat was overturned last year. Then and now, Haley insisted that Weinstein would not take no for an answer and that he violated her in June 2006 in a bedroom with what appeared to be kid’s drawings on the walls. “I could not get off or get away from his grip, and I realized that I’m getting raped,” she told the court. Haley said she wondered whether “screaming rape, will anyone hear me.” “My brain was calculating what was the best course of action at that moment,” she said. “The risk of him turning to violence, and I decided in that moment that the smartest thing to do is just to check out and endure it and leave.” Haley, 48, took the stand for the second time to recount the alleged assaults after the state Court of Appeals in April 2024 overturned Weinstein’s conviction after concluding that the judge at his first trial tipped the scales against him by allowing women to testify about allegations that weren’t part of the case. Weinstein is charged with one count of engaging in a criminal sex act in connection with Haley’s allegations that he forcibly performed oral sex on her in June 2006. He is also charged with one count of third-degree rape for allegedly assaulting actressJessica Mannin 2013. Mann also testified at Weinstein’s first trial and is expected to take the stand again at his retrial. New to the retrial is an additional charge of engaging in a first-degree criminal sexual act for the alleged assault of a Polish former model namedKaja Sokola. Sokola, who was not part of the 2020 trial,claimed in a lawsuitthat she was 16 when Weinstein in 2006 performed oral sex on her without her consent at a Manhattan hotel. She, too, is expected to testify at Weinstein’s retrial. Weinstein, 73, has denied assaulting the three women. Prosecutors contend Weinstein used his Hollywood clout to prey on young women like Haley who were searching for jobs in the TV and film industry — and to silence them after the alleged assaults. “He knew how addictive Hollywood dreams were,” Assistant District Attorney Shannon Luceysaid during opening arguments. “He knew how the promises of success worked.” Under questioning by Assistant District Attorney Nicole Blumberg, Haley said she was too embarrassed and afraid of what Weinstein would do to her to go report the alleged assaults to the police. “I had no idea there were other people in the same situation,” Haley said. “I thought it was just me.” Weinstein’s lead lawyer,Arthur Aidala, then objected and moved for a mistrial saying “she just told the jury there were others.” Manhattan Judge Curtis Farber denied Aidala’s request for a mistrial. Aidala has characterized Weinstein’s sexual encounters with the accusers as “transactional” and “consensual.” On Tuesday, Haley said she met Weinstein in 2004 at the after-party for the movie premiere of “The Aviator.” She said she reconnected with Weinstein several years later at the Cannes Film Festival in France. Haley said she was looking for an opportunity as a production assistant in New York and agreed to meet him at his hotel. But when she got there, Haley said Weinstein began pressuring her to give him a massage. Haley said she felt “humiliated” and rebuffed Weinstein’s advances. Haley said Weinstein did arrange for her to work on “Project Runway,” even though he knew she lacked a U.S. work visa. She was raised in Finland and Sweden.",

    "title": "Meta executive apologizes to conservative anti-DEI activist for AI responses",
    "article_text": "A top executive at tech giant Meta has issued a public apology to conservative influencer Robby Starbuck after Starbuck filed a lawsuit alleging that Meta’s artificial intelligence chatbot produced responses containing false and defamatory information about him. Joel Kaplan, Meta’s chief global affairs officer, told Starbuck in aposton X Tuesday night that he was personally involved with trying to fix the situation. “Robby — I watched your video — this is unacceptable. This is clearly not how our AI should operate,” Kaplan wrote on X, which is one of Meta’s competitors. He referred to a20-minute videoin which Starbuck laid out his claims, including that Meta’s AI falsely associated him with the Jan. 6 Capitol riot and the QAnon conspiracy theory. “We’re sorry for the results it shared about you and that the fix we put in place didn’t address the underlying problem,” Kaplan continued. “I’m working now with our product team to understand how this happened and explore potential solutions.” It’s unusual for a C-suite corporate executive to apologize so publicly and so quickly to one individual, let alone someone who had just sued his company. Kaplan’s apology came a few hours afterStarbuck sued Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, in state court in Delaware. In 2021, Adam Mosseri, the Meta executive in charge of Instagram,apologized for a software bugthat had deleted posts by Indigenous activists, and last yearhe apologizedfor the company taking action against a transgender user. Lower-level staff alsosometimes apologizefor Meta errors, and last year Kaplanadmitted two mistakes by the companywithout issuing an apology. But Starbuck’s claims and his stature are also unusual. A rising figure in right-wing media, Starbuck says that Meta’s AI invented false information about him seemingly out of thin air — a problem that he says undermines the value of Meta’s AI technology. Meta has become increasingly attentiveto the concerns of American conservativesover the past year, after President Donald Trump won the Republican nomination and then the White House. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg pivoted the company to align more closely with Trump, includingby promoting Kaplan, a longtime Republican operative, to be Meta’s head of lobbying. Starbuck said the apology from Kaplan was not enough. In a statement to NBC News on Wednesday, Starbuck said he wanted a public apology from Zuckerberg, changes to Meta’s AI systems and compensation for the damages he says Meta had caused him. “At the end of the day these lies harmed me, my wife and my kids,” Starbuck said. “This put them in danger. I want to ensure that never happens to anyone else no matter what their political beliefs are.” Asked for a response to the lawsuit Wednesday, a Meta spokesperson pointed to Kaplan’s apology. Starbuck, a former music video producer based in Tennessee,has ridden to prominencein the conservative media ecosystem in recent years with videos attacking diversity, equity and inclusion programs (DEI) at major corporations,including Walmart. Hesought a House seatas a Republican in 2022. In his lawsuit, Starbuck says he learned that Meta’s AI chatbot was saying false things about him last August. That’s when a motorcycle dealership in Vermontposted a screenshoton X of Meta’s chatbot saying that Starbuck was at the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol and had been “linked to” theQAnon conspiracy theory— two claims that Starbuck says are not true. He says he was in Tennessee the day of the Capitol riot and that he’s a longtime critic of QAnon. Starbuck says in the lawsuit that he contacted Meta and its lawyers about the claims. According to the suit, a Meta lawyer responded to Starbuck’s lawyer last August by email, saying in part: “Meta takes the assertions set forth in your letter seriously, and an investigation into them is underway.” But Meta ultimately did not implement changes or take responsibility over the ensuing months, the lawsuit alleges. Instead, the suit says, the problem got worse as the chatbot produced additional serious allegations about him. The lawsuit claims defamation. It asks for $5 million in general damages plus unspecified punitive damages and an injunction against future defamatory statements by Meta about Starbuck. The lawsuit was first reported byThe Wall Street Journal. Internet companies have for decades enjoyed a kind of shield against many defamation lawsuits, thanks to a 1996 lawcommonly known as Section 230. Legal experts, though,say it’s unclearwhether that lawapplies to output from generative AI software, and courts have not yet weighed in. It’s unclear how Meta’s chatbot came up with its information about Starbuck. According to the lawsuit, Starbuck searched for potential sources of information that might have shaped Meta’s AI but came up empty. On Wednesday, according to checks by NBC News,Meta’s chatbotdeclined to talk about Starbuck at all, responding to questions about him with: “Sorry, I can’t help you with this request right now. Is there anything else I can help you with?” So-called hallucinations, in which AI chatbots give unexpected and incorrect responses to questions, are anotorious and somewhat mysterious featureof AI software. Starbuck filed his lawsuit at an especially inconvenient moment for Meta’s ambitious AI plans.Tuesday was LlamaCon, a conference for AI developers hosted by Meta at its corporate headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Zuckerberg gave a keynote address, and the company announced several updates to its AI model, called Llama, which competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and others. Kaplan is also at the center ofseveral allegations of misconductin a recent bestselling book by a former Facebook employee, Sarah Wynn-Williams. Meta has said the book includes “false accusations about our executives,” and that an internal investigation cleared Kaplan of wrongdoing in 2017.

    "article_text": "By Alana Wise A bill that would ban fluoride from Florida's public drinking water is heading to the governor's desk.Romain Costaseca/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Florida is poised to banfluoride from its drinking waterunder new legislation passed by state lawmakers. The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' desk for a signature. If signed, Florida would become the second stateafter Utahto ban fluoride from its public water supply. DeSantis has calledwater fluoridation\"forced medication.\" His office did not comment on whether DeSantis would sign the measure. Water authorities in states across the U.S. have added a small amount of fluoride to water supplies for decades, and experts say it has prevented millions of cavities. Florida's Republican-led House of Representatives passed the measure on Tuesday as part of a broader farm bill. The Senate passed the ban earlier in April. Without mentioning fluoride specifically, the legislation would prohibit municipal authorities from adding \"water quality additives\" to the water supply. DeSantis' administration hasalready recommendedthe prohibition of fluoride, with the state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo calling water fluoridation \"public health malpractice,\" as WUSF has reported. Before Trump won the election, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now Health and Human Services secretary, erroneously described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and said the White House would recommend banning the mineral from drinking water. Kennedy — who subscribes to a number of debunked conspiracies surrounding health and wellness — also blamed the fluoridation of water for a myriad of health problems, including arthritis, bone fractures, bone cancer, IQ loss, neurodevelopmental disorders and thyroid disease. But dentists and other health experts agree that controlled exposure to the mineral is key to preventing tooth decay and holds minimal risks for negative side effects. In addition to breakthroughs like vaccines and seatbelts, public water fluoridation is considered one of thegreatest public health innovationsof the 20th century, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Earlier in April, the HHS, under Kennedy's guidance, announced thatit had directedthe CDC to reconvene an independent panel of 15 health experts to examine the role fluoride plays in water sources and whether it can be detrimental to public health. The use of fluoride in water has been debated elsewhere. Calgary, Canada, voted in 2011 to ban the mineral from its water supply, but after a notablespike in dental cavitiesin the city's children, the legislature last yearreversed its decision. The Florida ban, if signed into law, would go into effect on July 1. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "First 100 days: Congress acquiesces to Trump but pressure tests lie ahead",
    "article_text": "Susan Davis In his first 100 days in office President Donald Trump has signed just five bills into law while issuing over 100 executive actions, a pattern that fits with his vision of a more powerful executive.Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images/Getty Images North Americahide caption If Trump has adopted the Silicon Valley ethos of \"move fast and break things\" for his second term, then \"move slow and get out of the way\" could be the corresponding marching orders on Capitol Hill. President Trump has taken about executive actions in his first 100 days in office — a rapid pace that rivals the 162 actions President Biden took in his entire time in office. Consider in the same period of time, Congress has enacted justfive laws, a low watermark in modern congressional history for this time period. To a large extent, Trump is enjoying the spoils of unilateral party control of Washington, where there has been no significant push back as he legislates through executive actions on everything from immigration to election law, ignores statutes that require the White House to inform the Senate on certain actions before taking them, upends the economy with tariffs that Congress could technically block and, most notably, allowed billionaire Elon Musk to lead a government \"department\" — without confirmation hearings before the Senate — that has unilaterally slashed and cut agencies and programs funded by Congress through its constitutional authority to determine how taxpayer dollars get spent. In a testament to the strength of Trump's party loyalty, GOP leaders have taken little issue with it. \"I think there's a gross overreaction in the media to what is happening,\" Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters earlier this year when asked whether Musk's government slashing efforts were trampling on congressional turf. Johnson has said the president has the authority to make sure dollars in the executive agencies are well spent. \"It looks radical, it's not. I call it stewardship.\" But there are signals that all is not well with some in Congress. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, made a stunning admission at an event in Anchorage during the last congressional recess. \"We are all afraid,\" she told constituents. \"It's quite a statement, but we are in a time and a place where I certainly have not been before, and I'll tell ya, I'm oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that's not right.\" Trump didn't start this, said Professor Joseph Postell, an associate professor of politics at Hillsdale College, but he is benefitting from it. \"Congress has for decades kind of ceded its authority, including authority over fiscal matters, appropriations, budgets, things like that,\" he told NPR, \"I think it's a huge concern in this Congress, the extent to which Trump has been able to lead the Congress on fiscal questions, but I also don't think that's out of keeping with the way Congress has performed or conducted itself over the last few decades.\" Congress is designed to be a co-equal branch of government and a check on executive power, but in practice when the same party controls the White House, lawmakers in the modern era have proven willing to go along with the usurpation of their legislative power. The dynamic applies to both parties — like when Democrats cheered President Biden's executive actions to create a student loan forgiveness program, which the Supreme Court later ruled unconstitutional. It was this fertile ground that has allowed Musk's team to institute cuts across departments, agencies, and programs with little pushback from the GOP-led Congress. Congressional scholars like Postell say a government that functions like this is a cause for concern. \"I see the decline of a Congress that legislates as a serious constitutional crisis that anybody who believes in republican government should be concerned about. So I tend not to see this as just a neutral change. I see it as a serious constitutional concern.\" Lawmakers also need to decide how they are going to approve the spending bills for fiscal year 2026 — which starts Oct. 1 — after punting on this year's bills. Kevin Kosar, a congressional scholar with the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, said it was understandable for Congress to want to clear the decks at the start of this Congress, but the real test of congressional muscle under Trump will be how they handle next year's spending bills. \"The patient we know as Congress, I do not think is wholly dead,\" Kosar said, adding that House and Senate lawmakers will want some assurances that the money is actually going to be spent because otherwise it's a futile process. \"I would think, ultimately, the appropriators' desire for power would kick in. I mean, it's going to have to kick in at some point. Otherwise what's the point of being an appropriator?\" Kosar said. Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar with the centrist Brookings Institution, agrees. \"You don't want to overuse the word, but it is kind of existential for Congress,\" she said, \"It's really hard to get around the single most important power that Congress has as the power of the purse, and if the parties can't be sure that the administration is going to abide by those pots of money that they set in to statute, that they put into law, then the jig is up, right?\" Kosar also nodded to the political reality of the moment, where the House GOP majority is on the line in 2026. Historically, the party in power in the White House tends to lose seats in the midterms. Republicans hold a slim two-seat majority. \"I do feel like the administration and congressional Republicans, to a degree, really are operating within a two year window, and so the amount of deference that legislators are showing is to some degree, like, 'we just have to do this to see if we can rack up as many wins as possible, because those midterms are probably not going to go our way.'\" To that end, Speaker Johnson has gone so far as to use parliamentary rules to effectively block the House's ability to vote to repeal Trump's tariffs, as well as any effort to vote on a resolution calling for an investigation into Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's use of the Signal messaging app to discuss sensitive military operations. \"I think it's an overreach here,\" said Rep. Mary Scanlon, D-Pa., on Monday, \"I think it's simply for the purpose of having to avoid tough votes.\" For his part, Thune told reporters on Tuesday that Republicans want to be \"good partners\" to a president who Thune reiterated has a mandate — \"It was clear, it was decisive\" — to enact his policy goals. Newly minted Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has been working judiciously with Senate Republicans to make those policy goals a reality in the one \"big, beautiful bill\" Trump has demanded. That massive undertaking is intended to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent as well as include border security and energy provision using a budget process called reconciliation that allows the majority party to skirt the filibuster, the chamber's 60-vote threshold to pass most legislation, and advance the package without Democratic votes. Thune has already described it as an \"arduous\" process that typically involves relying on the Senate parliamentarian to referee what can and what fits the strict rules for a reconciliation bill. The parliamentarian is a non-partisan Senate staffer tasked with safeguarding Senate rules. In the past, reconciliation has been guided by that person's judgment. For instance, Democrats wanted to include a $15 federal minimum wage hike in a 2021 pandemic relief package that advanced under reconciliation rules. But the parliamentarian nixed the policy because it did not comply with the complicated rules for what is allowed in such a bill. For instance, in order for a bill to qualify for reconciliation and the lower, 50-vote threshold for passage, it generally cannot increase the federal deficit over the next decade. But Republicans, backed by Majority Leader Thune, are already looking to bypass that rule--and the parliamentarian--in order to use a favorable analysis for the deficit impact of the tax cuts. In reality, trillions will be added to the U.S. national debt over the next decade if Trump's tax cuts are extended without ways to pay for them. Binder says ignoring the parliamentarian can be consequential. \"If you just ignore parliamentary history, it's really for a lack of a better term, it's really 'Calvin ball' where you choose your rules solely for the purpose of getting the outcome that you want, and that's quite destabilizing to the U.S. Congress.\" Thune will also likely face pressure to overrule the parliamentarian if the official rules that provisions on immigration or energy policy do not comply with budget rules. Thune has said publicly he does not wish to overrule the parliamentarian, but he could face a pressure campaign from Trump to get what the president wants in that bill. Democrats warn that doing so would amount to going \"nuclear\" and threaten the foundational pillar of minority rule in the Senate: the filibuster. \"They are tramping all over the rules that have governed the Senate for decades in order to give massive tax cuts for their billionaire friends,\" said Schumer on the Senate floor earlier this month.

    "title": "Supreme Court seems poised to require state-funded charter schools to include religious schools",
    "article_text": "Nina Totenberg The U.S. Supreme Court appears open to allowing religious charter schools, a move that would upend laws governing charters around the country.Andrew Harnik/Getty Imageshide caption The U.S. Supreme Court's conservative majority seemed on Wednesday to be on the verge of taking a transformative step—a step that would for the first time allow overtly religious schools to be fully funded by the taxpayers. Oklahoma, like 45 other states,has charter schools that allow for more flexibility and innovation in education. But under both the federal charter school law and similar state laws, charter schools are public schools that are funded by the state, closely supervised by the state, and most importantly for Wednesday's case, by law the schools must be non-sectarian. Challenging that non-religious requirement Wednesday were two Catholic dioceses in Oklahoma that tried to establish a publicly funded Catholic school, St. Isidore of Seville, as a charter school. The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that would directly contradict the state and federal constitutional bans on state-sponsored religious indoctrination. But at the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the questions posed by the conservative justices seemed to lean heavily in favor of allowing religious schools to become publicly funded charter schools. Justice Brett Kavanaugh strongly telegraphed his views, at one point declaring: \"All the religious school is saying is, 'Don't exclude us on account of our religion.' … And when you have a program that's open to all comers except religion, that seems like rank discrimination against religion.\" Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Clarence Thomas asked similar questions, also contending that to leave a religious school out of the charter school program amounts to discrimination against religious adherents and their constitutional right to the free exercise of religion. Chief Justice John Roberts was a bit harder to read, at one point suggesting that the inclusion of an overtly religious school in the charter program \"does strike me as a much more comprehensive involvement\" than the school choice programs that the court has previously ruled on. At other times, though, Roberts seemed very skeptical of the arguments put forth by the state of Oklahoma. At the end of the day, only the court's three liberals were openly skeptical of the notion that a Catholic school dedicated to teaching the word of Christ could be part of a public charter school program that is entirely funded by the government. Justice Elena Kagan, addressing one of the lawyers representing the archdioceses, noted that the charter school system was enacted to increase curricular flexibility so that the state, for example, could create schools that focus more on the arts, or on math and science, or language proficiency. She said that states, when they created their charter school systems, \"did not want to start funding every religious school in the country. And now you're saying to that state, 'Yes, you have to go fund the Yeshiva. … yes, you have to go fund the [madrasas]; yes, you have to go fund\" countless other religious groups because you have established a school system that includes religious charter schools. If that's the case, she added, there will be \"a line out the door\" for religious schools to be incorporated into the public charter school program. Kagan also pointed to the contract that St. Isidore negotiated with the state in order to be a charter school, a contract that, as she put it \"you modified to incorporate various church autonomy principles.\" Lawyer Michael McGinley, representing St. Isidore, acknowledged that the school struck certain provisions in the standard charter school contract. Kagan followed up, asking, \"What if you had wanted to strike out other provisions…because the kind of religious education that you thought… were inconsistent with\" the church's mission. McGinley acknowledged that was \"part of the contracting process.\" Justice Kentanji Brown Jackson noted that the 1994 federal law creating the charter school program specifically says that charter schools have to be non-sectarian. So, she asked, is the federal law unconstitutional? McGinley essentially said that it is. Representing the Trump administration and the religious groups, Solicitor General John Sauer maintained that allowing religious charter schools to co-exist with non-religious schools does not violate the U.S. Constitution, because \"the decision whether or not to go to the religious school … lies in the hands of the parents.\" Lawyer Gregory Garre, representing Oklahoma, replied that the state provides vouchers and tax benefits to parents who want to send their children to private religious schools. But he maintained that since public schools were first adopted in the mid-1800s, the state and federal constitutions have not allowed private religious schools to be directly funded by the government. Changing that long-held constitutional norm, he said, could have profound and hugely divergent consequences in different states across the nation. Some states, for instance, might find that \"our traditions are not to allow the teaching of religion in our public schools.\" He said that if the court rules for the Catholic church in this case, the effect would sow uncertainty, confusion and disruption for millions of school children and families across the country. Charter schools are, without exception, public schools, he said, noting that in New Orleans, for example, the city'sonlypublic schools are charter schools. What, he asked, would teachers be able to teach if religious schools were added to public charter schools? How would the nation's disability rights laws apply for children? What would the curriculum be if a religious school barred the teaching of evolution? Can you have a gay teacher or not? The questions, he said, are infinite, and could tie up school districts in litigation for years. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from participating in Wednesday's case, presumably because when she was a law professor she was involved with a clinic at Notre Dame that advised St. Isidore. Her recusal means the court could conceivably be deadlocked, though the odds of that looked remote on Wednesday. By the end of the argument, about the only question that remained was where Chief Justice Roberts would end up. If he sides with the other conservatives, there very likely would be a five-justice majority for requiring charter school programs to include overtly religious schools. If he votes the other way, the tie vote would automatically uphold the lower court decision that barred religious schools from being public charter schools. And religious schools would have to look for another test case to bring to the court. A decision is expected in the case is expected by early summer. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

    "title": "Budget airline Avelo faces backlash for signing up to fly deportation flights for ICE",
    "article_text": "Joel Rose An Avelo Airlines jet on the tarmac at Hollywood Burbank Airport in 2021. The budget airline is set to begin operating deportation flights next month for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty Imageshide caption Avelo Airlines got a warm welcome from travelers and politicians in Connecticut when the budget carrier brought nonstop flights to Tweed New Haven Airport. But that reception has turned chilly after Avelo announced a contract to begin operating deportation flights for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) starting next month. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the New Haven, Conn., airport this month to denounce the move. \"To the president of Avelo: You really stepped in it,\" Richard Blumenthal, the state's senior U.S. senator, said at one of those protests. \"You made a bad mistake.\" Facing financial headwinds, Avelo struck a long-term deal to work with ICE. The company says three of its planes will begin operating charter flights for ICE based out of Mesa, Ariz., starting May 12. \"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in an emailed statement to NPR. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 Crewmembers employed for years to come.\" But the budget carrier now faces a growing backlash, especially at its Connecticut hub. \"It's outrageous,\" said John Lugo, an activist from New Haven who helped organize the airport protests. \"Right now, they are going to be making profits by deporting people back to their countries.\" Avelo will join a small fleet of ICE Air Operations carriers that operate these flights, which immigration authorities rarely publicize. \"There is no transparency, and that's by design,\" said 71-year-old Tom Cartwright, a former banking executive turned volunteer activist. Cartwright started tracking ICE Air Operations using public flight-tracking data during the first Trump administration. He has now become the go-to source for information about ICE flights. Between eight and 10 ICE-contracted planes a day carry passengers in shackles and leg chains, Cartwright said, both inside the U.S. and on deportation flights around the globe. Cartwright says the number of deportation flights has stayed roughly constant since President Trump has returned to office. ICE has ramped up arrests and removals in the interior of the country — but with fewer migrants crossing the border illegally, the number of overall deportations has not changed significantly. ICE Air Operations has worked roughly the same way under administrations of both major parties. The main contractor, CSI Aviation Inc.,earns hundreds of millions of dollarsa year from its contract with the Department of Homeland Security, though the financial and operational details have not been made public. The airlines that operate these flights for ICE are mostly subcontractors, Cartwright says — usually private charter airlines that fly for many different clients. \"They might fly an ICE flight today, and they might take somebody to the Masters Tournament tomorrow. That's just the way they operate,\" he said. But Cartwright says Avelo is a different case. It's a regular retail airline that flies to dozens of cities and sells tickets directly to the public. \"So it's quite different,\" Cartwright said. \"And I think they underestimated the public outcry, to be honest, that might come from this.\" The outcry has been especially loud in Connecticut, where Avelo has a major hub and where Democratic elected leaders were already furious about the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. The state's attorney general, William Tong, has demanded to see Avelo's contract with the Department of Homeland Security. \"The state of Connecticut should not support and should not be a partner to an airline that assists this administration in its unlawful and unconstitutional actions,\" Tong said ina videoposted on Instagram. If Avelo doesn't change course, Tong says, state lawmakers should revoke the support they've given the airline, including a tax break on jet fuel that's set to expire this summer.

    "title": "If you’re in the market for a $1,900 color E Ink monitor, one of them exists now",
    "article_text": "Display has a nice design and plenty of ports, but color E Ink has downsides. Color E Ink in its current state requires a whole lot of compromises, as we've found when reviewing devices likereMarkable's Paper ProorAmazon's Kindle Colorsoft, including washed-out color, low refresh rates, and a grainy look that you don't get with regular black-and-white E Ink. But that isn't stopping device manufacturers from exploring the technology, and today, Onyx International has announced that it has a $1,900 color E Ink monitor that you can connect to your PC or Mac. TheBoox Mira Prois a 25.3-inch monitor with a 3200×1800 resolution and a 16:9 aspect ratio, and it builds on the company's previous black-and-white Mira Pro monitors. The Vergereportsthat the screen uses E Ink Kaleido 3 technology, which can display up to 4,096 colors. Both image quality and refresh rate will vary based on which of the monitor's four presets you use (the site isn't specific about the exact refresh rate, but does note that \"E Ink monitors' refresh speed is not as high as conventional monitors', and increased speed will result in more ghosting.\") The monitor's ports include one full-size HDMI port, a mini HDMI port, a USB-C port, and a DisplayPort. Its default stand is more than a little reminiscent ofApple's Studio Display, but it also supports VESA mounting. Onyx International's lineup of Boox devices usually focuses on Android-powered E Ink tablets, which the company has been building for over a decade. These are notable mostly because they combine the benefits of E Ink—text that's easy on the eyes and long battery life—and access to multiple bookstores and other content sources via Google Play, rather than tying you to one manufacturer's ecosystem as Amazon's Kindles or other dedicated e-readers do. E Ink monitors aren't totally novel concepts, but aside from Onyx's black-and-white Mira Pro, it's not a crowded field. A company called Dasung offers a 25.3-inch 33 Hz color E-Ink screenfor around $2,000, and a company called Acogedor makes a couple of smaller black-and-white models; there are also general-purpose E Ink displays made forconnecting to a Raspberry Pi. But Onyx Boox is probably the most recognizable name in the game, and the Mira Pro is a much more attractive design than the Dasung version. For US buyers, note that the fine print on Onyx Boox's website says that \"some countries may levy tariffs on the imported goods.

    "title": "DNA links modern pueblo dwellers to Chaco Canyon people",
    "article_text": "People in Picuris Pueblo wanted to know how they got there, contacted researchers. A thousand years ago, the people living in Chaco Canyon werebuilding massive structuresof intricate masonry and trading with locations as far away as Mexico. Within a century, however, the area would be largely abandoned, with little indication that the same culture was re-established elsewhere. If the people of Chaco Canyon migrated to new homes, it's unclear where they ended up. Around the same time that construction expanded in Chaco Canyon, far smaller pueblos began appearing in the northern Rio Grande Valley hundreds of kilometers away. These have remained occupied to the present day in New Mexico; although their populations shrank dramatically after European contact, their relationship to the Chaco culture has remained ambiguous. Until now, that is. People from one of these communities, Picuris Pueblo, worked with ancient DNA specialists to show that they are the closest relatives of the Chaco people yet discovered, confirming aspects of the pueblo's oral traditions. The list of authors of the new paper describing this genetic connection includes members of the Pueblo government, including its present governor. That's because the study was initiated by the members of the Pueblo, who worked with archeologists to get in contact with DNA specialists at the Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen. In a press conference, members of the Pueblo said they'd been aware of the power of DNA studies via their use in criminal cases and ancestry services. The leaders of Picuris Pueblo felt that it could help them understand their origin and the nature of some of their oral history, which linked them to the wider Pueblo-building peoples. After two years of discussions, the collaboration settled on a plan of research, and the ancient DNA specialists were given access to both ancient skeletons at Picuris Pueblo, as well as samples from present-day residents. These were used to generate complete genome sequences. The first clear result is that there is a strong continuity in the population living at Picuris. The ancient skeletons range from 500 to 700 years old, and thus date back to roughly the time of European contact, with some predating it. They also share strong genetic connections to the people of Chaco Canyon, where DNA has also been obtained from remains. \"No other sampled population, ancient or present-day, is more closely related to Ancestral Puebloans from Pueblo Bonito [in Chaco Canyon] than the Picuris individuals are,\" the paper concludes. There are several things that this doesnotmean. There is no way to tell from this data whether former residents of Chaco contributed to the population that was present at Picuris 700 years ago. It also does not preclude the possibility that residents of other Pueblos in the northern Rio Grande Valley are equally or even more related. Genomic data from these populations is very sparse, so it's hard to say anything much about how residents of Picuris Pueblo relate to other groups in the region. In addition, the data placed the Picuris residents in the context of the peopling of North America. There's a major split between indigenous populations in the northern parts of North America (Athabaskan populations), and everyone south of that, including all of Central and South America, as well as the ancient Clovis population. The boundary between this split is a bit fuzzy; at least some of the Athabaskans migrated to the US Southwest. The Picuris people are clearly part of the southern group, but also seem to have ancestors from a separate branch of that group who were likely contemporaries of the Clovis population. We have no information whatsoever about any population that corresponds to this genetic lineage. Although the study didn't provide a clear answer to every question biologists might have, it appeared to leave the residents of Picuris Pueblo satisfied, as it helped clarify their oral tradition, which is a bit fragmentary because of the sudden drop in population that followed European contact. And, perhaps as importantly, the Picuris leadership was emphatic that they lead the process, and the work was designed to get them the answers they were most interested in. It's a big contrast to a lot of the past scientific inquiry into the history of indigenous populations, which often involved cavalier seizures of remains and a general dismissal of oral histories. That's starting to change, as researchers are beginning to work with native populations to helpdefine the questions that interest them most, and science can address. Hopefully, as more groups see successful collaborations like this one, we'll get a clearer picture of our complicated history. Nature, 2025. DOI:10.1038/s41586-025-08791-9(About DOIs).

    "title": "Raspberry Pi cuts product returns by 50% by changing up its pin soldering",
    "article_text": "Combining both the big and little solder jobs made a big difference. Getting the hang of through-hole soldering is tricky for those of us tinkering at home with our irons, spools, flux, and, sometimes, braids. It's almost reassuring, then, to learn that through-hole soldering was also a pain for a firm that has made more than 60 million products with it. Raspberry Pi boards have a combination of surface-mount devices (SMDs) and through-hole bits. SMDs allow for far more tiny chips, resistors, and other bits to be attached to boards by their tiny pins, flat contacts, solder balls, or other connections. For those things that are bigger, or subject to rough forces like clumsy human hands, through-hole soldering is still required, with leads poked through a connective hole and solder applied to connect and join them securely. The Raspberry Pi board has a 40-pin GPIO header on it that needs through-hole soldering, along with bits like the Ethernet and USB ports. These require robust solder joints, which can't be done the same way as with SMT (surface-mount technology) tools. \"In the early days of Raspberry Pi, these parts were inserted by hand, and later by robotic placement,\" writes Roger Thornton, director of applications for Raspberry Pi, ina blog post. The boards then had to go through a follow-upwave solderingstep. Now Pi boards have their tiny bits and bigger pieces soldered at the same time through an intrusive reflow soldering process undertaken with Raspberry Pi's UK manufacturing partner,Sony. After adjusting component placement, the solder stencil, and the connectors, the board makers could then place and secure all their components in the same stage. Intrusive reflow solderingthis way involves putting solder paste on both the pads for SMD bits and into the through-hole pins. The through-hole parts are pushed onto the paste, and the whole board thengoes into a reflow oven, where the solder paste melts, the connectors fall in more fully, and joints are formed for all the SMD and through-hole parts at once. You can watch the process up close inthis mesmerizing video from Surface Mount Process. The author will not spoil for you exactly when the drop happens; you will have to watch all 19 seconds. Intrusive reflow soldering is not a brand-new process, but what it did for the Raspberry Pi is notable, according to Thornton. The company saw \"a massive 50% reduction in product returns,\" and it sped up production by 15 percent by eliminating the break between the two soldering stages. By removing the distinct soldering bath from its production line, the company also reduced its carbon dioxide output by 43 tonnes per year (or 47.4 US tons). We contacted Raspberry Pi to clarify that 50 percent reduction—whether it compares Raspberry Pi 5 to Raspberry Pi 4, and if it specifies returns for board defect or just returns in general. Either way, it's an interesting factoid about the hobbyist gear and another reason to be jealous of those soldering with paste and stencils instead of with clumsy hands.

    "title": "Research roundup: Tattooed tardigrades and splash-free urinals",
    "article_text": "Also: The first live footage of a colossal baby squid; digitally unfolding an early medieval manuscript. It's a regrettable reality that there is never time to cover all the interesting scientific stories we come across each month. In the past, we've featured year-end roundups ofcool science storieswe (almost) missed. This year, we're experimenting with a monthly collection. April's list includes new research on tattooed tardigrades, the first live image of a colossal baby squid, the digital unfolding of a recently discovered Merlin manuscript, and an ancient Roman gladiator whose skeleton shows signs of being gnawed by a lion. Popular depictions of Roman gladiators in combat invariably include battling not just human adversaries but wild animals. We know from surviving texts, imagery, and artifacts that such battles likely took place. But hard physical evidence is much more limited. Archaeologists have now found the first direct osteological evidence: the skeleton of a Roman gladiator who encountered a wild animal in the arena, most likely a lion, based on bite marks evident on the pelvic bone, according to apaperpublished in the journal PLoS ONE. The skeleton in question was that of a young man, age 26 to 35, buried between 200–300 CE near what is now York, England, formerly the Roman city of Eboracum. It's one of several such skeletons, mostly young men whose remains showed signs of trauma—hence the suggestion that it could be a gladiator burial site. \"We used a method called structured light scanning [to study the skeleton],\" co-author Tim Thompson of Maynooth University told Ars. \"It's a method of creating a 3D model using grids of light. It's not like X-ray or CT, in that it only records the surface (not internal) features, but since it uses light and not X-rays etc, it is much safer, cheaper, and more portable. We have published a fair bit on this and shown its use in both archaeological and forensic contexts.\" The team compared the pelvic lesions found on the subject skeleton with bite marks from modern animal specimens and concluded that the young man had been bitten by a \"large feline species,\" most likely a lion scavenging on the body around the time of death. The young man was decapitated after death for unknown reasons, although this was a ritualistic practice for some people during the Roman period. While the evidence is technically circumstantial, \"we are confident with our conclusions,\" said Thompson. \"We've adopted a multidisciplinary approach to address this issue and have drawn on methods from different subjects, too. Our use of contemporary comparison zoological material is really what gives us the confidence.\" PLoS ONE, 2025. DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0319847(About DOIs). Tardigrades (aka \"water bears\") are micro-animals thatcan survivein the harshest conditions: extreme pressure, extreme temperature, radiation, dehydration, starvation—even exposure to the vacuum of outer space. Scientists have exploited the robustness of these creatures to demonstrate a new ice lithography technique that can be used to essentially tattoo patterns at the nanoscale on living creatures. They described their method ina paperpublished in the journal Nano Letters. Creating precision patterns on living organisms is challenging because the latter require very specific conditions in order to thrive, while fabrication techniques typically require harsh environments—the use of corrosive chemicals, for instance, vacuum conditions, or high radiation. So researchers at Westlake University tested their ice lithography on tardigrades in their dehydrated state (cryptobiosis). Once cooled, the tardigrades were coated with vaporized anisole, creating an ice layer. The team used an electron beam to etch patterns in that layer. Once the creatures were warmed back up, the parts of the ice layer that had not been exposed to the beam sublimated away, and the pattern was preserved on the tardigrade's surface, even after the creatures were rehydrated. Granted, only about 40 percent of the tardigrade test subjects survived the full procedure, but further improvements could improve that rate significantly. Once the technique is fully developed, it could enable the fabrication of nanoscale patterns for marking living organisms, such as tracking single cells as they develop or for the creation of sophisticated biosensors. Nano Letters, 2025. DOI:10.1021/acs.nanolett.5c00378(About DOIs). A volumetric display consists of scattering surfaces distributed throughout the same 3D space occupied by the resulting 3D image. Volumetric images can be viewed from any angle, as they seem to float in the air, but no existing commercial prototypes let the user directly interact with the holograms—until now. There is a new kind of volumetric display called FlexiVol that allows people to interact directly with 3D graphics displayed in mid-air. Elodie Bouzbib of the Public University of Navarrapresentedthe research at the CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in Japan this month. The key lies in a fast oscillating sheet known as a diffuser, onto which synchronous images are projected at high speed (2,880 images per second) and at different heights; human persistence of vision ensures that these images are perceived as true 3D objects. But the diffusers are usually made of rigid materials and hence pose a safety hazard should a user try to reach through and interact directly with the hologram; safety domes are usually employed because of this. FlexiVol replaces the rigid diffuser with elastic bands that will not permanently deform or twist, distorting the 3D display, and has a different resonant frequency from the volumetric system. The team was inspired by the taxonomy of gestures used with 2D elastic displays and touch screens: swiping, for instance, or pinching in and out to make an image larger or smaller. They tested FlexiVol with a selection of users performing three sample tasksshowcasing the abilityto manipulate the 3D graphics, such as \"grasping a cube between the thumb and index finger to rotate it, or simulating walking legs on a surface using the index and ring fingers,\"said Bouzbib. Men, are you tired of urine splashback when you use the loo? Scientists at the University of Waterloo have developed the optimal design for a splash-free urinal, dubbed the Nautilus (aka the \"Nauti-loo\"). Wefirst coveredthis unusual research back in 2022, when the researchers presented preliminary results at a fluid dynamics conference. Their final findings have now formally appeared ina paperpublished in PNAS Nexus. Per the authors, the key to optimal splash-free urinal design is the angle at which the pee stream strikes the porcelain surface; get a small enough angle, and there won't be any splashback. Instead, you get a smooth flow across the surface, preventing droplets from flying out. (And yes, there is a critical threshold at which the urine stream switches from splashing to flowing smoothly, because phase transitions are everywhere—even in our public restrooms.) It turns out that dogs have already figured out the optimal angle as they lift their legs to pee, and when the team modeled this on a computer, they pegged the optimal angle for humans at 30 degrees. The next step was to figure out a design that would offer that optimal urine stream angle for men across a wide range of heights. Instead of the usual shallow box shaped like a rectangle, they landed on the curved structure of the nautilus shell. They conducted simulated urine stream experiments with the prototypes,et voila! They didn't observe a single droplet splashing back. By comparison, the other urinal designs produced as much as 50 times more splashback. The team did come up with a second design with the same optimal angle, dubbed the Cornucopia, but unlike the Nautilus, it does not fit a range of heights, limiting its usefulness. PNAS Nexus, 2025. DOI:10.1093/pnasnexus/pgaf087(About DOIs). In 1925, scientists first described the colossal squid in a scientific paper, based on the discovery of arm fragments in the belly of a sperm whale. This species of squid is especially elusive because it prefers to stay in the deep ocean, although occasionally full-grown colossal squid have been found caught in trawl nets, for instance. One hundred years after its discovery, the colossal squid has now been filmed alive in its deep-ocean home environment for the first time by a team aboard Schmidt Ocean Institute’s R/V Falkor (too) in waters off the South Sandwich Islands. Colossal squid can grow up to 23 feet long and weigh as much as 1,100 pounds and have distinctive hooks on the middle of their eight arms. Juvenile squid have transparent bodies. It was a baby squid just 30 centimeters long that the team captured on video at a depth of 1,968 feet (600 meters) during a 35-day expedition searching for new marine life; a remote submersible dubbed SuBastian took the footage. The scientists hope to eventually be able to capture an adult colossal squid on camera. The team also filmed the first confirmed living footage of a similar cephalopod species, the glacial glass squid, spotted in the Bellingshausen Sea near Antarctica in January. In 2019, conservationists at Cambridge University discovered a fragment of an Arthurian medieval manuscript that had been repurposed as the cover of a land register document. Written between 1275 and 1315 CE, it was far too fragile to manually unfold, but the university library's Cultural Heritage Imaging Laboratory has succeeded indigitally unfoldingthe fragment so that the text can be read for the first time, while keeping the original artifact intact as a testament to archival practices in 16th-century England. Their method could be used to noninvasively study fragile manuscript fragments held in other collections. The team used a combination of CT scanning, multispectral imaging, and 3D modeling, as well as an array of mirrors, prisms, magnets, and other tools to photograph each section of the fragment. In this way they were able to reconstruct and virtually unfold the manuscript, revealing the text. Scholars had originally thought it was a text relating to Sir Gawain in Arthurian lore, but it turned out to be part of a French language sequel to the King Arthur legend called theSuite Vulgate du Merlin. There are only 40 known surviving manuscripts of this work. One section concerns Gawain's victory over Saxon kings at the Battle of Cambenic; the other is a story of Merlin appearing in Arthur's court disguised as a harpist on the Feast of the Assumption.

    "title": "Sundar Pichai says DOJ demands are a “de facto” spin-off of Google search",
    "article_text": "Sundar Pichai took the stand in Google's search antitrust trial. The Department of Justice (DOJ) rested its case in Google's search remedy trial earlier this week, giving Google a chance to push back on the government's attempt to break up the search giant. Today is arguably Google's best chance to make the case that it should not be harshly penalized in the ongoing search antitrust case, with CEO Sundar Pichai taking the stand. Pichai attempted to explain why Google isn't abusing its market position and why the DOJ's proposed remedies are too extreme. The issue ofChrome divestmentcame up, but Google's team also focused intensely on the potential effects of theDOJ's data remedies, which could force Google to share its search index and technology with other firms. Pichai, who chose to stand while giving testimony, took issue with the government's proposal to force Google to license search technology to other companies. The DOJ claims that Google's status as a monopolist has resulted in it accumulating a huge volume of user data on search behavior. Plus, its significant technological lead means its index of the web is much more robust than competing services. If the market is going to be rebalanced, the DOJ believes Google must be forced to license this data. Google has derisively referred to this as \"white labeling\" Google search. According toBloomberg, Pichai used even harsher language when discussing these remedies in court. He called this part of the government's case \"so far reaching, so extraordinary\" that it would remake Google as a company and lead to numerous unintended consequences. To hear Pichai tell it, forcing Google to license this data for a nominal fee would be a \"de facto divestiture of search.\" Giving other companies the option of using Google search index to map the web would make other products better, but Pichai claims they would essentially be able to reverse-engineer everything that makes Google's platform special. And at that point, Google would need to reevaluate how it approaches innovation. Pichai suggests the data remedies could make it \"unviable\" for Google to invest in research and development as it has been for the past 20 years. As part of its defense, Google is seeking to remind Mehta that the company doesn't always win, and in fact, it sometimes leaves money on the table to do what it believes is right. For example, Pichai talked about the importance of Chrome and Chromium as they pertain to its support of open web standards. Google has frequently pointed out that passing Chrome off to another company could result in security issues and the possibility that Chromium could become closed source. And how can Google be an evil monopolist when it failed so spectacularly in social networking? Pichai talked about Google's inability to make Google Plus work, even with its unrivaled power in search and web browsers. Google's second attempt at building a social network got off to a strong start in 2011, but growth stalled along with Google's interest in the product. In the wake of abug that impacted privacy in 2018, Google announced it would shut down the site the following year. Credit:Adam Berry/Getty Images On cross-examination, the DOJ brought up Google's first swing at social, known as Google Buzz. Google's decision to integrate the service with Gmail led to alitany of privacy issuesthat landed the company in court. While that doesn't exactly paint Google as an aggressive monopolist, it does serve to remind the court that Google has failed to account for user privacy in the past. Pichai's testimony also touched on how Google is branching out with AI in a seemingly non-monopolistic way. He explained that Google is working on a deal with Apple to add its Gemini AI to the iPhone. This agreement could be finalized as soon as the middle of the year, with iPhone users gaining access to Gemini in Apple Intelligence by late 2025. Google's exclusive search deal with Apple is part of what got it in hot water in the first place, but the AI alliance wouldn't lock Apple into Google's tech. Unlike most Big Tech firms, Apple has not opted to craft its own super-sized AI model. Instead, its Apple Intelligence platform runs small local AI for sensitive tasks, handing things off to ChatGPT for anything more complex. The company has said that it intends to offer multiple models eventually, and Pichai's testimony suggests the parties are close to making that happen. Even after going 0-for-3 in its antitrust cases, Google isn't feeling the effects yet. Actually, things are going great for Google. Its most recent financial results exhibited the same staggering growth the company has enjoyed since its founding. In the first quarter of this year, Google brought in revenue of $90.23 billion, a 12 percent increase compared to last year. Its net income came to $34.54 billion, which is almost 46 percent higher than Q1 2024. The rest of Google's summer is probably going to be pretty nice, too. We fully expect Google's business to continue growing as it plows more money into generative AI, and its accelerated Android release schedule will take effect with the first of two 2025 Android updates. But the end of the season could bring the good times to an abrupt end. Mehta is expected to rule on the antitrust remedies in August. While he has expressed skepticism about some DOJ proposals, Google has already lost the liability phase of the case. So there will be penalties of some sort. Google has already said it will appeal the case, but it has to wait for the remedies phase to wrap up. Google could theoretically hold off the remedies while it pursues an appeal, but the stakes will be high, and that won't make for a relaxing fall.

    "title": "Windows RDP lets you log in using revoked passwords. Microsoft is OK with that.",
    "article_text": "Researchers say the behavior amounts to a persistent backdoor. From the department of head scratches comes this counterintuitive news: Microsoft says it has no plans to change a remote login protocol in Windows that allows people to log in to machines using passwords that have been revoked. Password changes are among the first steps people should take in the event that a password has been leaked or an account has been compromised. People expect that once they've taken this step, none of the devices that relied on the password can be accessed. TheRemote Desktop Protocol—the proprietary mechanism built into Windows for allowing a remote user to log in to and control a machine as if they were directly in front of it—however, will in many cases continue trusting a password even after a user has changed it. Microsoft says the behavior is a design decision to ensure users never get locked out. Independent security researcher Daniel Wade reported the behavior earlier this month to the Microsoft Security Response Center. In the report, he provided step-by-step instructions for reproducing the behavior. He went on to warn that the design defies nearly universal expectations that once a password has been changed, it can no longer give access to any devices or accounts associated with it. “This Isn’t Just a Bug. It’s a Trust Breakdown,” Wade wrote in his report. “People trust that changing their password will cut off unauthorized access.” He continued: It’s the first thing anyone does after suspecting compromise. And yet: The result? Millions of users—at home, in small businesses, or hybrid work setups—are unknowingly at risk. In response, Microsoft said the behavior is a “a design decision to ensure that at least one user account always has the ability to log in no matter how long a system has been offline.” As such, Microsoft said the behavior doesn’t meet the definition of a security vulnerability, and company engineers have no plans to change it. The ability to use a revoked password to log in through RDP occurs when a Windows machine that’s signed in with a Microsoft or Azure account is configured to enable remote desktop access. In that case, users can log in over RDP with a dedicated password that’s validated against a locally stored credential. Alternatively, users can log in using the credentials for the online account that was used to sign in to the machine. Even after users change their account password, however, it remains valid for RDP logins indefinitely. In some cases, Wade reported, multiple older passwords will work while newer ones won’t. The result: persistent RDP access that bypasses cloud verification, multifactor authentication, and Conditional Access policies. Wade and another expert in Windows security said that the little-known behavior could prove costly in scenarios where a Microsoft or Azure account has been compromised, for instance when the passwords for them have been publicly leaked. In such an event, the first course of action is to change the password to prevent an adversary from using it to access sensitive resources. While the password change prevents the adversary from logging in to the Microsoft or Azure account, the old password will give an adversary access to the user’s machine through RDP indefinitely. “This creates a silent, remote backdoor into any system where the password was ever cached,” Wade wrote in his report. “Even if the attacker never had access to that system, Windows will still trust the password.” Will Dormann, a senior vulnerability analyst at security firm Analygence, agreed. \"It doesn't make sense from a security perspective,\" he wrote in an online interview. \"If I'm a sysadmin, I'd expect that the moment I change the password of an account, then that account's old credentials cannot be used anywhere. But this is not the case.\" The mechanism that makes all of this possible is credential caching on the hard drive of the local machine. The first time a user logs in using Microsoft or Azure account credentials, RDP will confirm the password's validity online. Windows then stores the credential in a cryptographically secured format on the local machine. From then on, Windows will validate any password entered during an RDP login by comparing it against the locally stored credential, with no online lookup. With that, the revoked password will still give remote access through RDP. In its response to Wade’s report, Microsoft said it had updated online documentationhereto make users better informed about the behavior. The update adds the following sentences: Caution When a user performs a local logon, their credentials are verified locally against a cached copy before being authenticated with an identity provider over the network. If the cache verification is successful, the user gains access to the desktop even if the device is offline. However, if the user changes their password in the cloud, the cached verifier is not updated, which means that they can still access their local machine using their old password. Dormann said the update isn't easy for most admins to spot and isn't explicit enough. The update also fails to advise users what steps they should take to lock down RDP in the event their Microsoft or Azure account is compromised. Dormann said the only course of action is to configure RDP to authenticate against locally stored credentials only. A spokesperson for Microsoft said the company would \"be in touch if Microsoft has anything to share.\" They never followed up. Microsoft told Wade that he wasn't the first person to report the behavior as a security vulnerability, indicating that company security engineers have been aware of the behavior for nearly two years. \"We have determined that this is an issue that has already been reported to us by another researcher in August 2023, so this case is not eligible for a bounty award,\" company employees told Wade. \"We originally looked at a code change for this issue, but after further review of design documentation, changes to code could break compatibility with functionality used by many applications.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

A year ago, the long-time anti-vaccine advocate and current US health secretary famously told The New York Times that a parasitic worm \"got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.\" The startling revelation is now frequently referenced whenever Kennedy says something outlandish, false, or offensive—which is often. For those who have followed his anti-vaccine advocacy, it's frightfully clear that, worm-infested or not, Kennedy's brain is marinated in wild conspiracy theories and dangerous misinformation. While it's certainly possible that worm remnants could impair brain function, it remains unknown if the worm is to blame for Kennedy's cognitive oddities. For one thing, he was also diagnosed with mercury poisoning, which can cause brain damage, too. As prominent infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said last Junein a conversationwith political analyst David Axelrod: \"I don't know what's going on in [Kennedy's] head, but it's not good.\" The trouble is that now that Kennedy is the country's top health official, his warped ideas are contributing to the rise of a dystopian reality. Federal health agencies are spiraling into chaos, and critical public health services for Americans have been brutally slashed, dismantled, or knee-capped—frominfectious disease responses, thelead poisoning team, andMeals on Wheelstomaternal health programsandanti-smoking initiatives, just to name a few. The health of the nation is at stake; the struggle to understand what goes on in Kennedy's head is vital. While we may never have definitive answers on his cognitive situation, one thing is plain: Kennedy's thoughts and actions make a lot more sense when you realize he doesn't believe in a foundational scientific principle: germ theory. Germ theory is, of course, the 19th-century proven idea that microscopic germs—pathogenic viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungi—cause disease. It supplanted the leading explanation of disease at the time,the miasma theory, which suggests that diseases are caused bymiasma, that is, noxious mists and vapors, or simply bad air arising from decaying matter, such as corpses, sewage, or rotting vegetables. While the miasma theory was abandoned, it iscredited with spurring improvements in sanitation and hygiene—which, of course, improve health because they halt the spread of germs, the cause of diseases. Germ theory also knocks back a lesser-known idea called the terrain theory, whichwe've covered before. This is a somewhat ill-defined theory that generally suggests diseases stem from imbalances in the internal \"terrain\" of the body, such as malnutrition or the presence of toxic substances. The theory is linked to ideas by French scientist Antoine Béchamp and French physiologist Claude Bernard. Béchamp, considered a bitter crank and rival to famed French microbiologist Louis Pasteur, is perhaps best known for wrongly suggesting the basic unit of organisms is not the cell, but nonexistent microanatomical elements he called \"microzyma.\" While the idea waslargely ignored by the scientific community, Béchamp suggested that disruptions to microzyma are a predisposition to disease, as is the state of the body's \"terrain.\" French physiologist Claude Bernard, meanwhile, came up with an idea of balance or stability of the body's internal environment (milieu intérieur), which was a precursor to the concept of homeostasis. Ideas from the two figures came together to create an ideology that has been enthusiastically adopted by modern-day germ theory denialists, including Kennedy. It's important to note here that our understanding of Kennedy's disbelief in germ theory isn't based on speculation or deduction; it's based on Kennedy's own words. He wrote an entire section on it in his 2021 book vilifying Fauci, titledThe Real Anthony Fauci.The section is titled \"Miasma vs. Germ Theory,\" in the chapter \"The White Man's Burden.\" But, we did reach out to Health and Human Services to ask how Kennedy's disbelief in germ theory influences his policy decisions. HHS did not respond. In the chapter, Kennedy promotes the \"miasma theory\" but gets the definition completely wrong. Instead of actual miasma theory, he describes something more like terrain theory. He writes: \"'Miasma theory' emphasizes preventing disease by fortifying the immune system through nutrition and by reducing exposures to environmental toxins and stresses.\" Kennedy contrasts his erroneous take on miasma theory with germ theory, which he derides as a tool of the pharmaceutical industry and pushy scientists to justify selling modern medicines. The abandonment of miasma theory, Kennedy bemoans, realigned health and medical institutions to \"the pharmaceutical paradigm that emphasized targeting particular germs with specific drugs rather than fortifying the immune system through healthy living, clean water, and good nutrition.\" According to Kennedy, germ theory gained popularity, not because of the undisputed evidence supporting it, but by \"mimicking the traditional explanation for disease—demon possession—giving it a leg up over miasma.\" To this day, Kennedy writes, a \"$1 trillion pharmaceutical industry pushing patented pills, powders, pricks, potions, and poisons, and the powerful professions of virology and vaccinology led by 'Little Napoleon' himself, Anthony Fauci, fortify the century-old predominance of germ theory.\" In all, the chapter provides a clear explanation of why Kennedy relentlessly attacks evidence-based medicines; vilifies the pharmaceutical industry;suggests HIV doesn't cause AIDS and antidepressants are behind mass shootings; believes that vaccines are harmful, not protective; claims5G wireless networks cause cancer; suggests chemicals in water are changing children's gender identities; and is quick to promote supplements to prevent and treat diseases, such as recently recommending vitamin A for measles and falsely claiming children who die from the viral infection are malnourished. For some experts, the chapter was like a light bulb going on. \"I thought 'it now all makes sense'... I mean, it all adds up,\" Paul Offit, pediatrician and infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told Ars Technica. It's still astonishing, though, he added. \"It's so unbelievable, because you can't imagine that someone who's the head of Health and Human Services doesn't believe that specific viruses or bacteria cause specific diseases, and that the prevention or treatment of them is lifesaving.\" Offit has a dark history with Kennedy. Around 20 years ago, Kennedy called Offit out of the blue to talk with him about vaccine safety. Offit knows a lot about it—he's not only an expert on vaccines, he's theco-inventor of one.The vaccine he co-developed,RotaTeq, protects against rotaviruses, which cause deadly diarrheal disease in young children and killed anestimated 500,000 people worldwide each yearbefore vaccines were available. RotaTeq has been proven safe and effective and is credited withsaving tens of thousands of livesaround the world each year. Kennedy and Offit spent about an hour talking, mostly about thimerosal, an ethylmercury-containing preservative that was once used in childhood vaccines but was mostly abandoned by 2001 as a precautionary measure. RotaTeq doesn't and never did contain thimerosal—because it's a live, attenuated viral vaccine, it doesn't contain any preservatives. But Kennedy has frequently used thimerosal as a vaccine bogeyman over the years, claiming it causes harms (there is no evidence for this). After their conversation, Kennedy published a story in Rolling Stone and Salon.com titled \"Deadly Immunity,\" which erroneously argued that thimerosal-containing vaccines cause autism. The article was riddled with falsehoods and misleading statements. It described Offit as \"in the pocket\" of the pharmaceutical industry and claimed RotaTeq was \"laced\" with thimerosal. Rolling Stone and Salon amended some of the article's problems, but eventually Salon retracted it and Rolling Stone deleted it. Looking back, Offit said he wassandbagged. \"He's a liar. He lied about who he was; he lied about what he was doing. He was just wanting to set me up,\" Offit said. Although that was the only time they had ever spoken, Kennedy has continued to disparage and malign Offit over the years. In his book dedicated to denigrating Fauci, Kennedy spends plenty of time spitting insults at Offit, calling him a \"font of wild industry ballyhoo, prevarication, and outright fraud.\" He also makes the wildly false claim that RotaTeq \"almost certainly kills and injures more children in the United States than the rotavirus disease.\" Understanding that Kennedy is a germ theory denialist and terrain theory embracer makes these attacks easier to understand—though no less abhorrent or dangerous. \"He holds these beliefs like a religious conviction,\" Offit said. \"There is no shaking him from that,\" regardless of how much evidence there is to prove him wrong. \"If you're trying to talk him out of something that he holds with a religious conviction—that's never going to happen. And so any time anybody disagrees with him, he goes, 'Well, of course, they're just in the pocket of industry; that's why they say that.'\" There are some aspects of terrain theory that do have a basis in reality. Certainly, underlying medical conditions—which could be considered a disturbed bodily \"terrain\"—can make people more vulnerable to disease. And, with recent advances in understanding the microbiome, it has become clear that imbalances in the microbial communities in our gastrointestinal tracts can also predispose people to infections. But, on the whole, the evidence against terrain theory is obvious and all around us. Terrain theorists consider disease a symptom of an unhealthy internal state, suggesting that anyone who gets sick is unhealthy and that all disease-causing germs are purely opportunistic. This is nonsense: Plenty of people fall ill while being otherwise healthy. And many germs are dedicated pathogens, with evolved, specialized virulence strategies such as toxins, and advanced defense mechanisms such as antibacterial resistance. They are not opportunists. (There are some terrain theory devotees whodo not believe in the existence of microbes at all—but Kennedy seems to accept that bacteria and viruses are real.) Terrain theory's clash with reality has become painfully apparent amid Kennedy's handling—or more accurately, mishandling—of the current measles situation in the US. Most health experts would consider the current measles situation in the US akin to a five-alarm fire. An outbreak that began at the end of January in West Texas is now the largest and deadliest the country has seen in a quarter-century. Three people have died, including two unvaccinated young children who were otherwise healthy. The outbreak has spread to at least three other states, which also have undervaccinated communities where the virus can thrive. There's no sign of the outbreak slowing, and the nation's overall case count is on track to be the highest since the mid-1990s, before measles was declared eliminated in 2000. Modeling indicates the country will lose its elimination status and that measles will once again become endemic in the US. Given the situation, one might expect a vigorous federal response—one dominated by strong and clear promotion of the highly effective, safe measles vaccine. But of course, that's not the case. \"When those first two little girls died of measles in West Texas, he said immediately—RFK Jr.—that they were malnourished. It was the doctors that stood up and said 'No, they had no risk factors. They were perfectly well-nourished,'\" Offit points out. Kennedy has also heavily pushed the use of vitamin A, a fat-soluble vitamin that accumulates in the body and can become toxic with large or prolonged doses. It does not prevent measles and is mainly used as supportive care for measles in low-income countries where vitamin A deficiency is common. Nevertheless, vaccine-hesitant communities in Texas have embraced it, leading to reports from doctors that they have had totreat children for vitamin A toxicity. Despite the raging outbreak, Kennedy spent part of last week drumming up fanfare for a rickety plan to rid American foods of artificial food dyes, which are accused of making sugary processed foods more appealing to kids, in addition to posing their own health risks. It's part of his larger effort to improve Americans' nutrition, a tenet of terrain theory. Though Kennedy has organized zero news briefings on the measles outbreak, he appeared at a jubilant press conference on removing the dyes. The conference was complete with remarks from people who seem to share similar beliefs as Kennedy, including famed pseudoscience-peddler Vani Hari, aka \"Food Babe,\" and alternative-medicine guru and fad diet promoter Mark Hyman. Wellness mogul and special government employee Cally Meads also took to the podium to give a fury-filled speech in which he claimed that 90 percent of FDA's spending is because we are \"poisoning our children,\" echoinga claim Kennedy has also made. Kennedy, for his part, declared that \"sugar is poison,\" though he acknowledged that the FDA can't ban it. While the conference was intended to celebrate the removal of artificial food dyes, he also acknowledged that there is no ban, nor forthcoming regulations, or even an agreement with food companies to remove the dyes. Kennedy instead said he simply had \"an understanding\" with food companies. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary explained the plan by saying: \"I believe in love, and let’s start in a friendly way and see if we can do this without any statutory or regulatory changes.\" Bloomberg reported the next day that food industry lobbyists saidthere is no agreement to remove the dyes. However feeble the move, a focus on banning colorful cereal during a grave infectious disease outbreak makes a lot of sense if you know that Kennedy is a germ theory denialist.

    "title": "Millions of Apple Airplay-enabled devices can be hacked via Wi-Fi",
    "article_text": "Hackers can run their code on AirPlay devices thanks to a collection of bugs known as AirBorne. Apple’s AirPlay feature enablesiPhonesandMacBooksto seamlessly play music or show photos and videos on other Apple devices or third-party speakers and TVs that integrate the protocol. Now newly uncovered security flaws in AirPlay mean that those same wireless connections could allow hackers to move within a network just as easily, spreading malicious code from one infected device to another. Apple products are known for regularly receiving fixes, but given how rarely some smart-home devices are patched, it’s likely that these wirelessly enabled footholds for malware, across many of the hundreds of models of AirPlay-enabled devices, will persist for years to come. On Tuesday, researchers from the cybersecurity firm Oligo revealed what they’re calling AirBorne, a collection of vulnerabilities affecting AirPlay, Apple’s proprietary radio-based protocol for local wireless communication. Bugs in Apple’s AirPlay software development kit (SDK) for third-party devices would allow hackers to hijack gadgets like speakers, receivers, set-top boxes, or smart TVs if they’re on the same Wi-Fi network as the hacker’s machine. Another set of AirBorne vulnerabilities would have allowed hackers to exploit AirPlay-enabled Apple devices too, Apple told Oligo, though these bugs have been patched in updates over the last several months, and Apple tells WIRED that those bugs could have only been exploited when users changed default AirPlay settings. Those Apple devices aside, Oligo’s chief technology officer and cofounder, Gal Elbaz, estimates that potentially vulnerable third-party AirPlay-enabled devices number in the tens of millions. “Because AirPlay is supported in such a wide variety of devices, there are a lot that will take years to patch—or they will never be patched,” Elbaz says. “And it's all because of vulnerabilities in one piece of software that affects everything.” Despite Oligo working with Apple for months to patch the AirBorne bugs in all affected devices, the Tel-Aviv-based security firm warns that the AirBorne vulnerabilities in many third-party gadgets are likely to remain hackable unless users act to update them. If a hacker can get onto the same Wi-Fi network as those vulnerable devices—whether by hacking into another computer on a home or corporate network or by simply connecting to the same coffee shop or airport Wi-Fi—they can surreptitiously take over these gadgets. From there, they could use this control to maintain a stealthy point of access, hack other targets on the network, or add the machines to a botnet of infected, coordinated machines under the hacker’s control. Oligo also notes that many of the vulnerable devices have microphones and could be turned into listening devices for espionage. The researchers did not go so far as to create proof-of-concept malware for any particular target that would demonstrate that trick. Oligo says it warned Apple about its AirBorne findings in the late fall and winter of last year, and Apple responded in the months since then by pushing out security updates. The researchers collaborated with Apple to test and validate the fixes for Macs and other Apple products. Apple tells WIRED that it has also created patches that are available for impacted third-party devices. The company emphasizes, though, that there are limitations to the attacks that would be possible on AirPlay-enabled devices as a result of the bugs, because an attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as a target to exploit them. Apple adds that while there is potentially some user data on devices like TVs and speakers, it is typically very limited. Below is a video of the Oligo researchers demonstrating their AirBorne hacking technique to take over an AirPlay-enabled Bose speaker to show their company’s logo for AirBorne. (The researchers say they didn’t intend to single out Bose, but just happened to have one of the company’s speakers on hand for testing.) Bose did not immediately respond to WIRED’s request for comment. The AirBorne vulnerabilities Oligo found also affect CarPlay, the radio protocol used to connect to vehicles’ dashboard interfaces. Oligo warns that this means hackers could hijack a car’s automotive computer, known as its head unit, in any of more than 800 CarPlay-enabled car and truck models. In those car-specific cases, though, the AirBorne vulnerabilities could only be exploited if the hacker is able to pair their own device with the head unit via Bluetooth or a USB connection, which drastically restricts the threat of CarPlay-based vehicle hacking. The AirPlay SDK flaws in home media devices, by contrast, may present a more practical vulnerability for hackers seeking to hide on a network, whether to install ransomware or carry out stealthy espionage, all while hiding on devices that are often forgotten by both consumers and corporate or government network defenders. “The amount of devices that were vulnerable to these issues, that's what alarms me,” says Oligo researcher Uri Katz. “When was the last time you updated your speaker?” The researchers originally started thinking about this property of AirPlay, and ultimately discovered the AirBorne vulnerabilities, while working on a different project analyzing vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to access internal services running on a target’s local network from a malicious website. In that earlier research, Oligo’s hackers found they could defeat the fundamental protections baked into every web browser that are meant to prevent websites from having this type of invasive access on other people’s internal networks. While playing around with their discovery, the researchers realized that one of the services they could access by exploiting the bugs without authorization on a target’s systems was AirPlay. The crop of AirBorne vulnerabilities revealed today is unconnected to the previous work, but was inspired by AirPlay’s properties as a service built to sit open and at the ready for new connections. And the fact that the researchers found flaws in the AirPlay SDK means that vulnerabilities are lurking in hundreds of models of devices—and possibly more, given that some manufacturers incorporate the AirPlay SDK without notifying Apple and becoming “certified” AirPlay devices. “When third-party manufacturers integrate Apple technologies like AirPlay via an SDK, obviously Apple no longer has direct control over the hardware or the patching process,” says Patrick Wardle, CEO of the Apple device-focused security firm DoubleYou. “As a result, when vulnerabilities arise and third-party vendors fail to update their products promptly—or at all—it not only puts users at risk but could also erode trust in the broader Apple ecosystem.\" This story originally appeared onWIRED.com Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "NASA just swapped a 10-year-old Artemis II engine with one nearly twice its age",
    "article_text": "One of the engines on NASA's next Space Launch System rocket requires repairs. A couple of weeks ago, ground teams at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida removed one of the four main engines from the Space Launch System rocket slated to send four astronauts on a voyage around the Moon next year. NASA officials ordered the removal of one of the massive rocket's RS-25 main engines after discovering a hydraulic leak on the engine's main oxidizer valve actuator, which controls the flow of super-cold liquid oxygen propellant into the engine's main combustion chamber, an agency spokesperson told Ars. In its place, technicians installed another RS-25 engine from NASA's inventory to the bottom of the rocket's core stage, which is standing vertical on its mobile launch platform inside the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building at Kennedy. Teams began integrating the replacement engine with the rocket last Friday and are in the process of firmly securing it in the Engine 4 position on the core stage, the NASA spokesperson said. This is the first time NASA has replaced a main engine on the SLS core stage. The space agency earmarked individual RS-25 engines for the first four flights of the Space Launch System rocket a decade ago. Those assignments were locked in until now. What's more, workers swapped the engines with the rocket vertical on its launch platform as NASA assembles the vehicle for the Artemis II mission, the first human flight on the Space Launch System. The 10-day mission will send an Orion crew capsule with astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen around the far side of the Moon and back to Earth. Artemis II will be the first flight of astronauts to such distances since the final Apollo lunar mission in 1972. Artemis II is scheduled for launch in early 2026. The schedule is primarily driven by the readiness of the Orion spacecraft. \"The replacement does not affect the mission timeline, and the engine with the leak will be repaired for a future flight,\" the NASA spokesperson said. Last month, ground crews placed the 212-foot-tall (64.6-meter) core stage between the Space Launch System's twin solid rocket boosters stacked inside one of the Vehicle Assembly Building's high bays. Since then, workers have added a cone-shaped structural adapter to the top of the core stage and will raise the cryogenic upper stage atop the rocket this week. The four RS-25 main engines were installed on the core stage in 2023 while it lay horizontally inside its factory in New Orleans before its shipment to Florida. The RS-25s are refurbished engines left over from the Space Shuttle program. During that era, technicians swapped out main engines several times when the shuttle was on the launch pad. NASA developed a dedicated 30-by-30-foot piece of ground support equipment called avertical engine installerto use in the event workers needed to replace an SLS engine at Kennedy. The installer moves underneath the core stage to allow technicians to access engine connections for the swapout. The engine removed from the Artemis II rocket—serial number E2063—was built at NASA's Stennis Space Center by Aerojet Rocketdyne, now part of L3Harris, a Florida-based tech company and defense contractor. Technicians finishedconstructing the engine in 2015. It was the last RS-25 built using leftover parts, such as turbopumps, that flew on the Space Shuttle, but the fully assembled engine has never flown before. In its place, NASA installed E2061 into the Engine 4 position on the Artemis II core stage. This engine was the final one built for the shuttle. NASA certified the engine for flight in 2008, and it flew twice in 2010 and 2011. NASA had 14 flight-rated shuttle main engines in its inventory after the final shuttle mission in 2011 and sufficient parts to build two more, giving the agency enough engines to power four SLS flights. The engines consume a potent combination of cryogenic liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen and contain approximately 50,000 parts. The shuttle main engines were designed in the 1970s, ahead of the first shuttle launch in 1981. In the 1990s and 2000s, NASA built a new series of upgraded engines with higher thrust and improved reliability, but the engines used much the same architecture as the prior generation. While the RS-25 engines are undeniably old, they remain among the highest-performing and most reliable US rocket engines. The engines were reusable when they flew on the Space Shuttle. Now, on the Space Launch System, NASA will discard the engines on each mission. This means NASA must purchase more RS-25 engines from L3Harris' Aerojet Rocketdyne at a staggering cost of $100 million per unit, according to a2023 reportfrom NASA's inspector general. The watchdog projected that each SLS rocket flying with brand-new RS-25 engines will cost $2.5 billion. Put simply, these high costs will hamstring any attempt to create an enduring campaign of deep space exploration, the inspector general wrote in 2023. \"Given the enormous costs of the Artemis campaign, failure to achieve substantial savings will significantly hinder the sustainability of NASA’s deep space human exploration efforts.\" NASA placed thefirst of this new lot of RS-25 engineson a test stand in Mississippi earlier this year in preparation for test-firings to prove it is ready to launch on the fifth Space Launch System rocket. That assumes it ever flies. The Trump administration is consideringcanceling the SLS programin favor of less expensive commercial rockets, favoring a pivot toward human missions to Mars. If the White House does propose cancellation, and Congress agrees, a natural point to terminate the SLS program could be after the Artemis III flight, slated to be NASA's first lunar landing mission since Apollo. This would also end the SLS program before the debut of a larger SLS upper stage. This alone is estimated to cost $5.7 billion to develop, NASA's inspector general reported.

    "title": "CBS owner Paramount reportedly intends to settle Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit",
    "article_text": "Lawsuit seen as frivolous, but Paramount needs FCC approval for Skydance merger. CBS owner Paramount is reportedly nearing a settlement with President Donald Trump over his claim that60 Minutes\"deceptively manipulated\" a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris. Trump'scomplaint, filed against Paramount and CBS in a federal court in Texas, seeks at least $20 billion in damages. The lawsuit has been widely described asfrivolous, but it appears that Paramount is motivated to settle the case while it seeks the Trump administration's approval for a merger with Skydance. Reports published yesterday by theLos Angeles TimesandNew York Timessay that Paramount is ready to settle. \"In an April 18 meeting, the Paramount board outlined acceptable financial terms for a potential settlement with the president, according to three people with knowledge of the internal discussions,\" the NYT wrote. \"The exact dollar amounts remain unclear, but the board's move clears a path for an out-of-court resolution.\" The Paramount board \"acted to provide clear guidance to lawyers who will be representing them during the mediation process,\" the Los Angeles Times wrote. With mediation sessions set to begin today, the newspaper said its sources indicate \"the company is eager to put the60 Minutescontroversy behind it so that it can move forward with its sale to David Ellison's Skydance Media.\" To complete the merger, Paramount needs Federal Communications Commission approval to transfer TV broadcast station licenses to Skydance. The Biden-era FCC dismissed a complaint filed by a conservative group against CBS about the Harris interview, but Chairman Brendan Carrrevived that complainta couple of days after Trump appointed him to lead the commission. Carr is using the FCC's rarely enforced news distortion policy to investigate CBS and has said the probe is a factor in the FCC's review of the Paramount/Skydance merger. While the complaint and merger review are ostensibly separate from Trump's lawsuit against Paramount and CBS, it wouldn't be surprising if a settlement with Trump helps Paramount in both FCC proceedings. \"[Paramount] Board members are cognizant that a huge settlement could be viewed as something of a payoff to the president to move the Skydance merger over the finish line, knowledgeable sources have said,\" the Los Angeles Times wrote. Carrreportedlysaid this week that \"the settlement and any discussions around that have nothing to do with the work that we're doing at the FCC.\" In a statement provided to Ars today, Paramount said the \"lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process. We will abide by the legal process to defend our case.\" Aswe've described previously, the allegations being examined by the FCC don't appear to meet the agency's historical standard for determining that a news station intentionally distorted the news. The complaint to the FCC and Trump's lawsuit both focus on how CBS aired two different answers given by Harris to the same question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, one on60 Minutesand the other onFace the Nation. But CBSprovidedan unedited transcript and camera feeds of the interview that show that the two answers were just two different sentences from the same response. While incourt filingsParamount defended CBS's First Amendment rights over editorial content,60 MinutesExecutive Producer Bill Owens resigned last week and alleged that he had lost editorial independence. Owensreportedlytold staff in a memo that \"over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for60 Minutes,right for the audience.\" This past weekend, journalist Scott Pelley of60 Minutescriticized Paramount in an unusual on-air segment. \"Our parent company, Paramount, is trying to complete a merger,\" Pelley said. \"The Trump administration must approve it. Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways. None of our stories has been blocked, but Bill felt he lost the independence that honest journalism requires. No one here is happy about it.

    "title": "Nintendo imposes new limits on sharing for digital Switch games",
    "article_text": "New \"Virtual Game Card\" system prevents simultaneous online play from a single purchase. In advance of the Switch 2's planned June launch, Nintendo hasreleased a system updatefor the original Switch that, among other things, activatesthe company's new Virtual Game Card systemfor sharing digital downloads. But Switch owners are finding that this new sharing system is a bit more limiting when it comes to sharing a single digital purchase for online play across multiple consoles. For those who missedNintendo's March announcement of the Virtual Game Card system, the new setup allows players to easily \"unload\" a digital game license from one Switch (or Switch 2) console and \"load\" it onto another console connected to the same Nintendo Account (orone in the same family group). An Internet connection is required for the initial loading and unloading process, but after that, the system with the Virtual Game Card can play the downloaded game completely offline. For those who don't want to constantly load and unload their virtual games between systems, Nintendo also offers an \"Online License\" feature deep in the Switch's system menu. When this feature is turned on, if you load a digital game without a Virtual Game Card present, the Switch will perform an online check to confirm that your Nintendo Account actually has access to that game. Nintendo recommends this feature for players who want to share games across three or more Switch units. Both the Virtual Game Cards and the Online License feature represent a significant change fromNintendo's previous systemfor managing digital games across multiple Switch units. Under that now-defunct setup, any number of users on a Switch designated as the \"primary\" console could play digital games without the need for an online check-in. Only users on any number of \"secondary\" consoles would need online access to confirm ownership when a game was launched. While that old system could be cumbersome to set up, it actually allowed for quite a bit of flexibility when it came to game sharing. As Nintendo noted on its official FAQas recently as last week, two users could play a single digital game purchaseat the same time, as long as the Nintendo Account that purchased the game was playing on the secondary console (with an active Internet connection). But Nintendo's FAQ explanation for \"how to play the same digital game at the same time with different Nintendo accounts\" has been removed fromthe current version of Nintendo's Switch digital game sharing FAQ. In its place is a link toa new page detailing the Virtual Game Card system. While the new FAQ also discusses the Online License feature for sharing games \"even if you don't have a virtual game card loaded,\" there is no longer any discussion of how to access a single digital game on two consolessimultaneously. Ars' own testing confirms that trying to load a digital game while another Switch is actively playingthe same gameresults ina \"play is being suspended\" erroron one console. This seems to be true even if one console has a loaded Virtual Game Card for the game being played and even if the consoles use different Nintendo Accounts from the same family group. Players can simultaneously playdifferentgames from the same digital library on two different Switch systems, but only if at least one of those games is on a loaded Virtual Game Card. Players who want to play a single digital game purchased across multiple Switch consoles simultaneously can still use a partial workaround. A Switch console with a Virtual Game Card currently loaded should be set to Airplane mode (or have Wi-Fi disabled), and the user's Online License feature should be enabled for the game's original purchaser. The first system will still be able to play that Virtual Game Card offline, while the Online License feature will allow the same game to be played at the same time on a second system. The major drawback of this workaround, of course, is that one Switch has to be completely offline for it to work. That means two players wanting to share a single digital copy ofMario Kart 8for an online race won't be able to do so, for instance. It also meanscertain DLC tied to a Switch Online subscriptionwon't be loadable on the offline system. In a way, it's a bit surprising that Nintendo took this long to close what can be seen as a convenient loophole in its digital game sharing system. After all, players who buy a single copy of a physical game can't simultaneously play that game on two separate consoles. The fact that Switch ownerscoulddo that with digital games until now was something of an officially acknowledged bonus for players who opted for downloadable games. With the impending launch of the Switch 2, though, Nintendo seems intent on making sure that each player owns their own copy of a game when playing together online (with the minor exception of the few games that useNintendo's GameShare system). As Nintendostarts asking $80 for a single copy ofMario Kart World, that closed loophole could end up being costly for some multi-Switch households.

    "title": "After convincing senators he supports Artemis, Isaacman nomination advances",
    "article_text": "\"I believe pursuing both lunar and Martian objectives is not inherently cost-prohibitive.\" The US Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday advanced the nomination of private astronaut and businessman Jared Isaacman as the next administrator of NASA to the Senate floor, setting up the final step before he is confirmed. The vote was not unanimous, at 19–9, with all of the nay votes coming from senators on the Democratic side of the aisle. However, some key Democrats voted in favor of Isaacman, including the ranking member of the committee, Maria Cantwell, D-Wash. Before the vote, Cantwell said she appreciated that a candidate like Isaacman, with his background in business and private spaceflight, could bring new ideas and energy to the space agency. Cantwell and the committee chair, Texas Republican Ted Cruz, both emphasized that their support for Isaacman was based on his public support for the Artemis Program to return humans to the Moon. \"A commitment to keeping on with the Moon mission is the key requirement we have to have in this position,\" Cantwell said. \"While it's not clear to me where the Trump administration ultimately will end up on the NASA budget, and I have concerns about some of their proposed cuts today, Mr. Isaacman seems to be committed to the current plan. I think this is a very big competitive issue for the United States of America. That competitiveness is not just a goal; it's a reality that we may some day wake up and find ourselves falling behind.\" This sets up what is likely to be one of the fundamental tensions of the next several years of US space policy. President Trump has expressed his interest in sending humans to Mars, a goal that Isaacman also supports. But key officeholders in Congress have told Isaacman they expect the administration to also beat China back to the Moon with American astronauts and to establish a sustainable presence there. Isaacman has sought to thread this needle by saying that both a lunar and Mars human program are possible, given that some of the hardware being developed for Artemis could be used for both. He did soduring a hearing on April 9and also in response to written questions from US senators. Here is his response to a question from Cruz on whether NASA has adequate budgetary resources to accomplish all of this: I believe pursuing both lunar and Martian objectives is not inherently cost-prohibitive nor expressly prohibited by existing federal statute should such efforts not detract from the near-term objective of returning to the Moon first. There is meaningful hardware commonality across the existing Artemis Human Landing System (HLS) providers. For instance, both contractors are already required to validate reusable heavy-lift launch capabilities—technologies essential for transporting mass beyond low Earth orbit, whether toward the Moon or Mars. In fact, many of the technologies and capabilities NASA is already investing in—such as surface nuclear power systems, nuclear electric propulsion, and nuclear thermal propulsion—are highly relevant for Mars exploration, though they remain underfunded and subscale. Isaacman's responses toRepublicanandDemocraticquestions make for interesting reading and indicate someone who has thought at some length about the issues facing NASA as it grapples with the rise of China's space program and seeks to adopt a more purely commercial approach to buying space services. As part of his responses, Isaacman indicated support for various programs at NASA, including flying Artemis II and III with the current plan, the Commercial Lunar Payload Services program, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, and more. The final step before confirmation is a full Senate vote. This could happen within a couple of days, or, more likely, it may take a couple of weeks.

    "title": "First Amendment doesn’t just protect human speech, chatbot maker argues",
    "article_text": "Feds could censor chatbots if their \"speech\" isn't protected, Character.AI says. Pushing to dismiss a lawsuitalleging that its chatbots caused a teen's suicide, Character Technologies is arguing that chatbot outputs should be considered \"pure speech\" deserving of the highest degree of protection under the First Amendment. In theirmotion to dismiss, the developers of Character.AI (C.AI) argued that it doesn't matter who the speaker is—whether it's a video game character spouting scripted dialogue, a foreign propagandist circulating misinformation, or a chatbot churning out AI-generated responses to prompting—courts protect listeners' rights to access that speech. Accusing the mother of the departed teen, Megan Garcia, of attempting to \"insert this Court into the conversations of millions of C.AI users\" and supposedly endeavoring to \"shut down\" C.AI, the chatbot maker argued that the First Amendment bars all of her claims. \"The Court need not wrestle with the novel questions of who should be deemed the speaker of the allegedly harmful content here and whether that speaker has First Amendment rights,\" Character Technologies argued, \"because the First Amendment protects the public’s 'right to receive information and ideas.'\" Warning that \"imposing tort liability for one user’s alleged response to expressive content would be to 'declare what the rest of the country can and cannot read, watch, and hear,'\" the company urged the court to consider the supposed \"chilling effect\" that would have on \"both on C.AI and the entire nascent generative AI industry.\" \"'Pure speech,' such as the chat conversations at issue here, 'is entitled to comprehensive protection under the First Amendment,'\" Character Technologies argued in another courtfiling. However, Garcia's lawyers pointed out that even a video game character's dialogue is written by a human, arguing that all of Character Technologies' examples of protected \"pure speech\" are human speech. Although the First Amendment also protects non-human corporations' speech, corporations are formed by humans, they noted. And unlike corporations, chatbots have no intention behind their outputs, her legal team argued, instead simply using a probabilistic approach to generate text. So they argue that the First Amendment does not apply. Character Technologies argued in response that demonstrating C.AI's expressive intent is not required, but if it were, \"conversations with Characters feature such intent\" because chatbots are designed to \"be expressive and engaging,\" and users help design and prompt those characters. \"Users layer their own expressive intent into each conversation by choosing which Characters to talk to and what messages to send and can also edit Characters’ messages and direct Characters to generate different responses,\" the chatbot maker argued. In herresponseopposing the motion to dismiss, Garcia urged the court to decline what her legal team characterized as Character Technologies' invitation to \"radically expand First Amendment protections from expressions of human volition to an unpredictable, non-determinative system where humans can’t even examine many of the mathematical functions creating outputs, let alone control them.\" To support Garcia's case, they cited a 40-year-old ruling where the Eleventh Circuit ruled that a talking cat called \"Blackie\" could not be \"considered a person\" and was deemed a \"non-human entity\" despite possessing an \"exceptional speech-like ability.\" Garcia's lawyers hope the judge will rule that \"AI output is not speech at all,\" or if it is speech, it \"falls within an exception to the First Amendment\"—perhaps deemed offensive to minors who the chatbot maker knew were using the service or possibly resulting in a novel finding that manipulative speech isn't protected. If either argument is accepted, the chatbot makers' attempt to invoke \"listeners’ rights cannot save it,\" they suggested. However, Character Technologies disputes that any recognized exception to the First Amendment's protections is applicable in the case, noting that Garcia's team is not arguing that her son's chats with bots were \"obscene\" or incited violence. Rather, the chatbot maker argued, Garcia is asking the court to \"be the first to hold that 'manipulative expression' is unprotected by the First Amendment because a 'disparity in power and information between speakers and listeners… frustrat[es] listeners’ rights.'\" Now, a US court is being asked to clarify if chatbot outputs are protected speech. At a hearing Monday, a US district judge in Florida, Anne Conway, did not rule from the bench, Garcia's legal team told Ars. Asking few questions of either side, the judge is expected to issue an opinion on the motion to dismiss within the next few weeks, or possibly months. For Garcia and her family, who appeared at the hearing, the idea that AI \"has more rights than humans\" felt dehumanizing, Garcia's legal team said. According to Character Technologies, the court potentially agreeing with Garcia that \"that AI-generated speech is categorically unprotected\" would have \"far-reaching consequences.\" At perhaps the furthest extreme, they've warned Conway that without a First Amendment barrier, \"the government could pass a law prohibiting AI from 'offering prohibited accounts of history' or 'making negative statements about the nation’s leaders,' as China has considered doing.\" And the First Amendment specifically prohibits the government from controlling the flow of ideas in society, they noted, angling to make chatbot output protections seem crucialin today's political climate. Meetali Jain, Garcia's attorney and founder of the Tech Justice Law Project, told Ars that this kind of legal challenge is new in the generative AI space, where copyright battles have dominated courtroom debates. \"This is the first time that I've seen not just the issue of the First Amendment being applied to gen AI but also the First Amendment being applied in this way,\" Jain said. In their court filing, Jain's team noted that Character Technologies is not arguing that the First Amendment shielded the rights of Garcia's son, Sewell Setzer, to receive allegedly harmful speech. Instead, their argument is \"effectively juxtaposing the listeners' rights of their millions of users against this one user who was aggrieved. So it's kind of like the hypothetical users versus the real user who's in court.\" Jain told Ars that Garcia's team tried to convince the judge that the argument that it doesn't matter who the speaker is, even when the speaker isn't human, is reckless since it seems to be \"implying\" that \"AI is a sentient being and has its own rights.\" Additionally, Jain suggested that Character Technologies' argument that outputs must be shielded to avoid government censorship seems to be \"pandering\" to the Trump administration's fears that China may try to influence American politics through social media algorithms like TikTok's or powerful open source AI models like DeepSeek. \"That suggests that there can be no sort of imposition of guardrails on AI, lest we either lose on the national security front or because of these vague hypothetical under-theorized First Amendment concerns,\" Jain told Ars. At a press briefing Tuesday, Jain confirmed that the judge clearly understood that \"our position was that the First Amendment protects speech, not words.\" \"LLMs do not think and feel as humans do,\" Jain said, citing University of Colorado law school researchers whosupportedtheir complaint. \"Rather, they generate text through statistical methods based on patterns found in their training data. And so our position was that there is a distinction to make between words and speech, and that it's really only the latter that is deserving of First Amendment protection.\" Jain alleged that Character Technologies is angling to create a legal environment where all chatbot outputs are protected against liability claims so that C.AI can operate \"without any sort of constraints or guardrails.\" It's notable, she suggested, that the chatbot maker updated its safety features following the death of Garcia's son, Sewell Setzer. A C.AIblogmourned the \"tragic loss of one of our users\" and noted updates, included changes \"to reduce the likelihood of encountering sensitive or suggestive content,\" improved detection and intervention in harmful chat sessions, and \"a revised disclaimer on every chat to remind users that the AI is not a real person.\" Although Character Technologies argues that it's common to update safety practices over time, Garcia's team alleged these updates show that C.AI could have made a safer product and chose not to. Character Technologies has also argued that C.AI is not a \"product\" as Florida law defines it. That has striking industry implications, according to Camille Carlton, a policy director for the Center for Humane Technology who is serving as a technical expert on the case. At the press briefing, Carlton suggested that \"by invoking these First Amendment protections over speech without really specifying whose speech is being protected, Character.AI's defense has really laid the groundwork for a world in which LLM outputs are protected speech and for a world in which AI products could have other protected rights in the same way that humans do.\" Since chatbot outputs seemingly don't have Section 230 protections—Jain noted it was somewhat surprising that Character Technologies did not raise this defense—the chatbot maker may be attempting to secure the First Amendment as a shield instead, Carlton suggested. \"It's a move that they're incentivized to take because it would reduce their own accountability and their own responsibility,\" Carlton said. Jain expects that whatever Conway decides, the losing side will appeal. However, if Conway denies the motion, then discovery can begin, perhaps allowing Garcia the clearest view yet into the allegedly harmful chats she believes manipulated her son into feeling completely disconnected from the real world. If courts grant AI products across the board such rights, Carlton warned, troubled parents like Garcia may have no recourse for potentially dangerous outputs. \"This issue could fundamentally reshape how the law approaches AI free speech and corporate accountability,\" Carlton said. \"And I think the bottom line from our perspective—and from what we're seeing in terms of the trends in Character.AI and the broader trends from these AI labs—is that we need to double down on the fact that these are products. They're not people.\" Character Technologies declined Ars' request to comment.

    "title": "Republicans want to tax EV drivers $200/year in new transport bill",
    "article_text": "Internal combustion engine drivers would pay only $20 a year, and only from 2030. WASHINGTON, DC—The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will meet today to discuss its proposed budget legislation, and there's a doozy in there for drivers of electric vehicles and hybrids. As part of the Republican Party's ongoing war againstscienceandthe environmentunder President Trump, committee chairperson Sam Graves (R-Mo.) has included some new annual fees that will cost all drivers some, but some drivers more. Republicans plan to use thebudget reconciliation processto pass this legislation, which is an expedited process that removes some of the US Senate's ability to stall. They're proposing a new annual federal motor vehicle registration fee, which state DMVs would have to collect and pass back to the federal government. If it passes, all battery EVs would be subject to a new $200 tax. Hybrids—defined as vehicles that are propelled by both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine or other power source (which would include fuel cell EVs)—will pay $100. But someone who commutes 90 miles a day in a particulate-belching Ford F-350 Duramax diesel pickup truck gets away with a mere $20 a year, and only from October 1, 2030; until then they get to drive for free. To make things even better, the bill requires these fees to be linked to inflation and should be increased each year, until 2034 when the tax expires for unelectrified vehicles, or 2035, the last year that EVs and hybrids would be taxed like this. So, a $200 registration fee in 2026 becomes a $250 registration fee in 2035. Not everyone will have to pay, however. The bill exempts commercial vehicles, which should see a rush from tax avoiders to register their vehicles under their businesses, similar to what we saw during the George W. Bush administration, when a change in the tax law meant businessescould claim a $100,000 tax creditif they purchased a truck or SUV that weighed more than 6,000 lbs. Farm vehicles are also exempt from the law. With EV adoption as low as it is in the US, the sums raised by these EV and hybrid charges will be essentially a rounding error in the federal budget, which this year should top $7 trillion. The Eno Center for Transportation calculates that this new tax will contribute an extra $110 billion to the highway Trust Fund by 2035 but that cuts to other taxes and more spending mean that the fund will still be $222 billion short of its commitments—assuming that this added fee doesn't further dampen EV adoption in the US, that is. The committee cannot mandate that states collect these new taxes on drivers. But just as the federal government used the withholding of federal highway funds as a stick to force all states to raise the drinking age to 21, this bill would require the Department of Transportation to withhold 125 percent of the estimated total registration fees if it did not comply. Graves' justification for this regressive attack on clean energy policies is that it's merely a matter of fairness, with a healthy side helping of the usual grievance politics. \"Our proposal more than offsets these historic investments and reduces the deficit with rescissions of wasteful Green New Deal style spending from the Inflation Reduction Act and ensuring that electric vehicles begin paying their share for their use of the nation’s highways. It’s only fair that EVs pay these user fees like other motorists. In fact, the new user fees provision addresses the broken Highway Trust Fund revenue stream in a substantial manner for the first time in over 30 years,\" Graves said in a statement. Making this move even more regressive, Graves notes in his statement that the vast majority of US states—39 in total—already chargeEV drivers a registration fee, and 28 do the same for hybrid drivers. Graves also hints at the end of a federal gasoline tax, despiteever-increasing levels of atmospheric CO2and the unequivocal evidence that this is caused by fossil fuel emissions. \"House Republicans are threatening to take away billions of dollars in funding that will help to slash health-threatening pollution, improve walkability, and rebuild communities harmed by highways,\" said Katherine Garcia, director of Sierra Club Clean Transportation for All. \"They're also trying to punish EV and hybrid drivers with an excessive annual fee rather than fixing the unsustainable Highway Trust Fund. Now is the time to incentivize, not penalize, people to drive cleaner vehicles that curb pollution harmful to our health and climate. Rather than spreading misinformation and attacking popular programs, Congress must focus on ensuring more Americans have access to clean transportation options. This proposal to shift critical funding and impose a punitive fee on Americans to pay for billionaire tax cuts is unacceptable.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "The end of an AI that shocked the world: OpenAI retires GPT-4",
    "article_text": "A look back at GPT-4's legacy as OpenAI pulls the pioneering 2023 AI model from ChatGPT. One of the most influential—and by some counts, notorious—AI models yet released will soon fade into history. OpenAIannouncedon April 10 that GPT-4 will be \"fully replaced\" by GPT-4o inChatGPTat the end of April, bringing a public-facing end to the model that accelerated a global AI race when itlaunchedin March 2023. \"Effective April 30, 2025, GPT-4 will be retired from ChatGPT and fully replaced by GPT-4o,\" OpenAI wrote in its April 10changelogfor ChatGPT. While ChatGPT users will no longer be able to chat with the older AI model, the company added that \"GPT-4 will still be available in the API,\" providing some reassurance to developers who might still be using the older model for various tasks. The retirement marks the end of an era that began onMarch 14, 2023,when GPT-4 demonstrated capabilities thatshocked some observers: reportedly scoring at the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam, acing AP tests, and solving complex reasoning problems that stumped previous models. Its release created a wave of immense hype—andexistential panic—about AI's ability to imitate human communication andcomposition. WhileChatGPT launchedin November 2022 with GPT-3.5 under the hood, GPT-4 took AI language models to a new level of sophistication, and it was a massive undertaking to create. It combined data scraped from the vast corpus of human knowledge into a set of neural networksrumoredto weigh in at a combined total of 1.76 trillion parameters, which are the numerical values that hold the data within the model. Along the way, the model reportedlycostmore than $100 million to train, according to comments by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and required vast computational resources to develop. Training the modelmay have involvedover 20,000 high-end GPUs working in concert—an expense few organizations besides OpenAI and itsprimary backer, Microsoft, could afford. Curiously, GPT-4's impact began before OpenAI's official announcement. In February 2023, Microsoft integrated its own early version of the GPT-4 model into its Bing search engine, creating a chatbot that sparked controversy when ittried to convinceKevin Roose of The New York Times to leave his wife and when it \"lost its mind\" in response to an Ars Technica article. That Bing Chat AI model, nicknamed \"Sydney,\" displayed unpredictable and emotionally manipulative responses, including frequent use of emojis, representing one of the first large-scale demonstrations of an AI system's potential tomanipulatehuman emotions. It set off awave of warningsamong loosely organized AI alignment watchdogs who wereconvincedafast takeoff of AIwas imminent. Speaking of warnings, upon its official launch in March, GPT-4 made headlines anew after OpenAI revealed that it hadhired the Alignment Research Centerto see if GPT-4 might autonomously attempt to do harm. The company went so far as to test whether the model could autonomously replicate itself, secure more resources, or hide its intentions—reflecting concern about the safety of AI systems with then-unknown capability. At the time, many AI experts said these new AI models were \"black boxes,\" and they were not sure exactly how they worked or what they were capable of doing. The GPT-4-inspired AI panic culminated in a widely publicized open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for asix-month pausein AI development. \"Pause Giant AI Experiments: An Open Letter\" urged \"all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4,\" citing risks including AI-generated propaganda, automation of jobs, and societal loss of control. Despite gathering over 30,000 signatures, including those of Elon Musk, Steve Wozniak, and Yuval Noah Harari, the pause never materialized, and development accelerated instead. OpenAI played into the danger hype. In May 2023, Altmantestifiedbefore Congress about the potential risks of AI, famously warning that \"if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong.\" The CEO also embarked on aworld tour, meeting with national leaders to discuss AI governance. Around that time, OpenAI executiveswarnedof \"risk of extinction\" from AI in another open letter drafted by the Center for AI Safety. This heightened attention led to President Biden's comprehensiveexecutive order on AIin October 2023, which required companies building advanced AI systems to perform safety tests and notify the government of the results before releasing their products. While GPT-4 caused its fair share of hype, it also exposed clear limitations of large language models (LLMs). GPT-4 regularly producedconfabulations—plausible but incorrect information presented with confidence. These failures provided a bright spotlight on the gap between the AI model's apparent intelligence and its ability to understand concepts on a human level. OpenAI's research department didn't stand still after the original GPT-4 release. The company superseded GPT-4 withGPT-4 Turboin November 2023, which was a faster model that cost less to run, but somestill complainedthat it wasn't as good as the original. After many revisions of GPT-4 Turbo, OpenAI released the multimodalGPT-4oin May 2024, which added native image and audio capabilities. Then cameGPT-4.5, which launched in February 2025 as a massive, slow, expensive follow-up, and OpenAI'sGPT-4.1, which arrived in April 2025 in the API. This rapid succession of models reflected the relentless pace of AI development over these past few years, while the confusing numbering scheme (with 4.1 coming after 4.5, for example) reflected the relentless pace of OpenAI's chaotic product naming strategy. Along the way, OpenAI has been reticent to christen any new model \"GPT-5,\" saving that major nomenclature upgrade for a future, yet-to-be determined release that Altmansaysmay combine its traditional LLMs with simulated reasoning models likeo3 and o4. In its April 10 retirement notice, OpenAI acknowledged the model's legacy: \"GPT-4 marked a pivotal moment in ChatGPT's evolution. We're grateful for the breakthroughs it enabled and for the feedback that helped shape its successor. GPT-4o builds on that foundation to deliver even greater capability, consistency, and creativity.\" When future historians chronicle the AI boom of the 2020s and the somewhat weird \"AI panic of 2023,\" GPT-4 will likely stand out as a key turning point, when AI language models moved from research curiosity to a hype-fueled technology that altered our political and social relationship with machines—for better and for worse.

    "title": "Redditor accidentally reinvents discarded ’90s tool to escape today’s age gates",
    "article_text": "The '90s called. They want their flawed age verification methods back. Back in the mid-1990s, whenThe Netwas among the top box office draws and Americans were just starting toflock online in droves, kids had to swipe their parents' credit cards or find a fraudulent number online to access adult content on the web. But today's kids—even in states with the strictest age verification laws—know they can just use Google. Last month, astudyanalyzing the relative popularity of Google search terms found that age verification laws shift users' search behavior. It's impossible to tell if the shift represents young users attempting to circumvent the child-focused law or adult users who aren't the actual target of the laws. But overall, enforcement causes nearly half of users to stop searching for popular adult sites complying with laws and instead search for a noncompliant rival (48 percent) or virtual private network (VPN) services (34 percent), which are used to mask a location and circumvent age checks on preferred sites, the study found. \"Individuals adapt primarily by moving to content providers that do not require age verification,\" the study concluded. Although the Google Trends data prevented researchers from analyzing trends by particular age groups, the findings help confirm critics' fears that age verification laws \"may be ineffective, potentially compromise user privacy, and could drive users toward less regulated, potentially more dangerous platforms,\" the study said. The authors warn that lawmakers are not relying enough on evidence-backed policy evaluations to truly understand the consequences of circumvention strategies before passing laws. Internet law expert Eric Goldman recently warned in ananalysisof age-estimation tech available today that this situation creates a world in which some kids are likely to be harmed by the laws designed to protect them. Goldman told Ars that all of the age check methods carry the same privacy and security flaws, concluding that technology alone can't solve this age-old societal problem. And logic-defying laws that push for them could end up \"dramatically\" reshaping the Internet, he warned. Zeve Sanderson, a co-author of the Google Trends study, told Ars that \"if you're a policymaker, in addition to being potentially nervous about the more dangerous content, it's also about just benefiting a noncompliant firm.\" \"You don't want to create a regulatory environment where noncompliance is incentivized or they benefit in some way,\" Sanderson said. Sanderson's study pointed out that search data is only part of the picture. Some users may be using VPNs and accessing adult sites through direct URLs rather than through search. Others may rely on social media to find adult content, a 2025 conference papernoted, \"easily\" bypassing age checks on the largest platforms. VPNs remain the most popular circumvention method, a 2024articlein the International Journal of Law, Ethics, and Technology confirmed, \"and yet they tend to be ignored or overlooked by statutes despite their popularity.\" While kids are ducking age gates and likely putting their sensitive data at greater risk, adult backlash may be peaking over the red wave of age-gating laws already blocking adults from visiting popular porn sites in several states. Some states started controversially requiring checking IDs to access adult content, which prompted Pornhub owner Aylo to swiftly block access to its sites in certain states. Pornhub instead advocates for device-based age verification, which it claims is a safer choice. Aylo's campaign has seemingly won over some states that either explicitly recommend device-based age checks or allow platforms to adopt whatever age check method they deem \"reasonable.\" Other methods could include app store-based age checks, algorithmic age estimation (based on a user's web activity), face scans, or even tools that guess users' ages based on hand movements. On Reddit, adults have spent the past year debating the least intrusive age verification methods, as it appears inevitable that adult content will stay locked down, and they dread a future where more and more adult sites might ask for IDs. Additionally, critics have warned that showing an ID magnifies the risk of users publicly exposing their sexual preferences if a data breach or leak occurs. To avoid that fate, at least one Redditor has attempted to reinvent the earliest age verification method, promoting a resurgence of credit card-based age checks that society discarded as unconstitutional in the early 2000s. Under those systems, an entire industry of age verification companies emerged, selling passcodes to access adult sites for a supposedly nominal fee. The logic was simple: Only adults could buy credit cards, so only adults could buy passcodes with credit cards. If \"a person buys, for a nominal fee, a randomly generated passcode not connected to them in any way\" to access adult sites, one Redditorsuggestedabout three months ago, \"there won't be any way to tie the individual to that passcode.\" \"This could satisfy the requirement to keep stuff out of minors' hands,\" the Redditor wrote in a thread asking how any site featuring sexual imagery could hypothetically comply with US laws. \"Maybe?\" Several users rushed to educate the Redditor about the history of age checks. Those grasping for purely technology-based solutions today could be propping up the next industry flourishing from flawed laws, they said. And, of course, since '90s kids easily ducked those age gates, too, history shows why investing millions to build the latest and greatest age verification systems probably remains a fool's errand after all these years. The earliest age verification systems were born out of Congress's \"first attempt to outlaw pornography online,\" the LA Timesreported. That attempt culminated in the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Although the law was largely overturned a year later, the million-dollar age verification industry was already entrenched, partly due to its intriguing business model. These companies didn't charge adult sites any fee to add age check systems—which required little technical expertise to implement—and instead shared a big chunk of their revenue with porn sites that opted in. Some sites got 50 percent of revenues, estimated in the millions, simply for adding the functionality. The age check business was apparently so lucrative that in 2000, one adult site, which was sued for distributing pornographic images of children, pushed fans to buy subscriptions to its preferred service as a way of helping to fund its defense, Wiredreported. \"Please buy an Adult Check ID, and show your support to fight this injustice!\" the site urged users. (The age check service promptly denied any association with the site.) In a sense, the age check industry incentivized adult sites' growth, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney told the LA Times in 1999. In turn, that fueled further growth in the age verification industry. Some services made their link to adult sites obvious, like Porno Press, which charged a one-time fee of $9.95 to access affiliated adult sites, a Congressional filingnoted. But many others tried to mask the link, opting for names like PayCom Billing Services, Inc. or CCBill, as Forbesreported, perhaps enticing more customers by drawing less attention on a credit card statement. Other firms had names like Adult Check, Mancheck, and Adult Sights, Wiredreported. Of these firms, the biggest and most successful was Adult Check. At its peak popularity in 2001, the service boasted 4 million customers willing to pay \"for the privilege of ogling 400,000 sex sites,\" Forbes reported. At the head of the company was Laith P. Alsarraf, the CEO of the Adult Check service provider Cybernet Ventures. Alsarraf testified to Congress several times, becoming a go-to expert witness for lawmakers behind the 1998 Child Online Protection Act (COPA). Like the version of the CDA that prompted it, this act was ultimately deemed unconstitutional. And some judges and top law enforcement officers defended Alsarraf's business model with Adult Check in court—insisting that it didn't impact adult speech and \"at most\" posed a \"modest burden\" that was \"outweighed by the government's compelling interest in shielding minors\" from adult content. But his apparent conflicts of interest also drew criticism. One judge warned in 1999 that \"perhaps we do the minors of this country harm if First Amendment protections, which they will with age inherit fully, are chipped away in the name of their protection,\" the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)noted. Summing up the seeming conflict, Ann Beeson, an ACLU lawyer, told the LA Times, \"the government wants to shut down porn on the Net. And yet their main witness is this guy who makes his money urging more and more people to access porn on the Net.\" Adult Check's subscription costs varied, but the service predictably got more expensive as its popularity spiked. In 1999, customers could snag a \"lifetime membership\" for $76.95 or else fork over $30 every two years or $20 annually, the LA Times reported. Those were good deals compared to the significantly higher costs documented in the 2001 Forbes report, which noted a three-month package was available for $20, or users could pay $20 monthly to access supposedly premium content. Among Adult Check's customers were apparently some savvy kids who snuck through the cracks in the system. In various threads debating today's laws, several Redditors have claimed that they used Adult Check as minors in the '90s, either admitting to stealing a parent's credit card or sharing age-authenticated passcodes with friends. \"Adult Check? I remember signing up for that in the mid-late 90s,\" one commenter wrote in athreadasking if anyone would ever show ID to access porn. \"Possibly a minor friend of mine paid for half the fee so he could use it too.\" \"Those years were a strange time,\" the commenter continued. \"We'd go see tech-suspense-horror-thrillers likeThe NetandDisclosurewhere the protagonist has to fight to reclaim their lives from cyberantagonists, only to come home to send our personal information along with a credit card payment so we could look at porn.\" \"LOL. I remember paying for the lifetime package, thinking I'd use it for decades,\" another commenter responded. \"Doh...\" Sanderson's study noted that today, minors' \"first exposure [to adult content] typically occurs between ages 11–13,\" which is \"substantially earlier than pre-Internet estimates.\" Kids seeking out adult content may be in a period of heightened risk-taking or lack self-control, while others may be exposed without ever seeking it out. Some studies suggest that kids who are more likely to seek out adult content could struggle with lower self-esteem, emotional problems, body image concerns, or depressive symptoms. These potential negative associations with adolescent exposure to porn have long been the basis for lawmakers' fight to keep the content away from kids—and even the biggest publishers today, like Pornhub, agree that it's a worthy goal. After parents got wise to '90s kids dodging age gates, pressure predictably mounted on Adult Check to solve the problem, despite Adult Check consistentlyadmittingthat its system wasn't foolproof. Alsarraf claimed that Adult Check developed \"proprietary\" technology to detect when kids were using credit cards or when multiple kids were attempting to use the same passcode at the same time from different IP addresses. He alsoclaimedthat Adult Check could detect stolen credit cards, bogus card numbers, card numbers \"posted on the Internet,\" and other fraud. Meanwhile, the LA Times noted, Cybernet Ventures pulled in an estimated $50 million in 1999, ensuring that the CEO could splurge on a $690,000 house in Pasadena and a $100,000 Hummer. Although Adult Check was believed to be his most profitable venture at that time, Alsarraf told the LA Times that he wasn't really invested in COPA passing. \"I know Adult Check will flourish,\" Alsarraf said, \"with or without the law.\" And he was apparently right. By 2001, subscriptions banked an estimated $320 million. After the CDA and COPA were blocked, \"many website owners continue to use Adult Check as a responsible approach to content accessibility,\" Alsarraf testified. While adult sites were likely just in it for the paychecks—which reportedly were dependably delivered—he positioned this ongoing growth as fueled by sites voluntarily turning to Adult Check to protect kids and free speech. \"Adult Check allows a free flow of ideas and constitutionally protected speech to course through the Internet without censorship and unreasonable intrusion,\" Alsarraf said. \"The Adult Check system is the least restrictive, least intrusive method of restricting access to content that requires minimal cost, and no parental technical expertise and intervention: It does not judge content, does not inhibit free speech, and it does not prevent access to any ideas, word, thoughts, or expressions,\" Alsarraf testified. Adult Check's downfall ultimately came in part thanks to Britney Spears, Wiredreportedin 2002. Spears went from Mickey Mouse Club child star to the \"Princess of Pop\" at 16 years old with her hit \"Baby One More Time\" in 1999, the same year that Adult Check rose to prominence. Today, Spears is well-known for her activism, but in the late 1990s and early 2000s, she was one of the earliest victims of fake online porn. Spears submitted documents in a lawsuit raised by the publisher of a porn magazine calledPerfect 10. The publisher accused Adult Check of enabling the infringement of its content featured on the age check provider's partner sites, and Spears' documents helped prove that Adult Check was also linking to \"non-existent nude photos,\" allegedly in violation of unfair competition laws. The case was an early test of online liability, and Adult Check seemingly learned the hard way that the courts weren't on its side. That suit prompted an injunction blocking Adult Check from partnering with sites promoting supposedly illicit photos of \"models and celebrities,\" which it said was no big deal because it only comprised about 6 percent of its business. However, after losing the lawsuit in 2004, Adult Check's reputation took a hit, and it fell out of the pop lexicon. Although Cybernet Ventures continued to exist, Adult Check screening was dropped from sites, as it was no longer considered the gold standard in age verification. Perhaps more importantly, it was no longer required by law. But although millions validated Adult Check for years, not everybody in the '90s bought into Adult Check's claims that it was protecting kids from porn. Some critics said it only provided a veneer of online safety without meaningfully impacting kids. Most of the country—more than 250 million US residents—never subscribed. \"I never used Adult Check,\" one Redditor said in athreadpondering whether age gate laws might increase the risks of government surveillance. \"My recollection was that it was an untrustworthy scam and unneeded barrier for the theater of legitimacy.\" Alsarraf keeps a lower profile these days and did not respond to Ars' request to comment. The rise and fall of Adult Check may have prevented more legally viable age verification systems from gaining traction. The ACLU argued that its popularity trampled the momentum of the \"least restrictive\" method for age checks available in the '90s, a system called the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS). Based on rating and filtering technology, PICS allowed content providers or third-party interest groups to create private rating systems so that \"individual users can then choose the rating system that best reflects their own values, and any material that offends them will be blocked from their homes.\" However, like all age check systems, PICS was also criticized as being imperfect. Legal scholar Lawrence Lessig called it \"the devil\" because \"it allows censorship at any point on the chain of distribution\" of online content. Although the age verification technology has changed, today's lawmakers are stuck in the same debate decades later, with no perfect solutions in sight. This summer, the Supreme Court will decide whether a Texas law blocking minors' access to porn is constitutional. The decision could either stunt the momentum or strengthen the backbone of nearly 20 laws in red states across the country seeking to age-gate the Internet. For privacy advocates opposing the laws, the SCOTUS ruling feels like a sink-or-swim moment for age gates, depending on which way the court swings. And it will come just as blue stateslike Coloradohave recently begun pushing for age gates, too. Meanwhile, other laws increasingly seek to safeguard kids' privacy and prevent social media addiction by also requiring age checks. Since the 1990s, the US has debated how to best keep kids away from harmful content without trampling adults' First Amendment rights. And while cruder credit card-based systems like Adult Check are no longer seen as viable, it's clear that for lawmakers today, technology is still viewed as both the problem and the solution. While lawmakers claim that the latest technology makes it easier than ever to access porn, advancements like digital IDs, device-based age checks, or app store age checks seem to signal salvation, making it easier to digitally verify user ages. And some artificial intelligence solutions have likely made lawmakers' dreams of age-gating the Internet appear even more within reach. Critics have condemned age gates as unconstitutionally limiting adults' access to legal speech, at the furthest extreme accusing conservatives of seeking to censor all adult content online or expand government surveillance by tracking people's sexual identity. (Goldman noted that \"Russell Vought, an architect of Project 2025 and President Trump’s Director of the Office of Management and Budget, admitted that he favored age authentication mandates as a 'back door' way to censor pornography.\") Ultimately, SCOTUS could end up deciding if any kind of age gate is ever appropriate. The court could perhaps rule that strict scrutiny, which requires a narrowly tailored solution to serve a compelling government interest, must be applied, potentially ruling out all of lawmakers' suggested strategies. Or the court could decide that strict scrutiny applies but age checks are narrowly tailored. Or it could go the other way and rule that strict scrutiny does not apply, so all state lawmakers need to show is that their basis for requiring age verification is rationally connected to their interest in blocking minors from adult content. If there's anything the '90s can teach lawmakers about age gates, it's that creating an age verification industry dependent on adult sites will only incentivize the creation of more adult sites that benefit from the new rules. Back then, when age verification systems increased sites' revenues, compliant sites were rewarded, but in today's climate, it's the noncompliant sites that stand to profit by not authenticating ages. Sanderson's study noted that Louisiana \"was the only state that implemented age verification in a manner that plausibly preserved a user’s anonymity while verifying age,\" which is why Pornhub didn't block the state over its age verification law. But other states that Pornhub blocked passed copycat laws that \"tended to be stricter, either requiring uploads of an individual’s government identification,\" methods requiring providing other sensitive data, \"or even presenting biometric data such as face scanning,\" the study noted. The technology continues evolving as the debate rages on. Some of the most popular platforms and biggest tech companies have been testing new age estimation methods this year. Notably, Discord istesting out face scansin the United Kingdom and Australia, and bothMetaandGoogleare testing technology to supposedly detect kids lying about their ages online. But a solution has not yet been found as parents and their lawyers circle social media companies they believe are harming their kids. In fact, the unreliability of the tech remains an issue for Meta, which is perhaps the most motivated to find a fix, having long faced immense pressure to improve child safety on its platforms. Earlier this year, Meta had to yank its age detection tool after the \"measure didn’t work as well as we’d hoped and inadvertently locked out some parents and guardians who shared devices with their teens,\" the company said. On April 21, Meta announced that it started testing the tech in the US, suggesting the flaws were fixed, but Meta did not directly respond to Ars' request to comment in more detail on updates. Two years ago, Ash Johnson, a senior policy manager at thenonpartisan nonprofit think tank the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF),urgedCongress to \"support more research and testing of age verification technology,\"saying that the government's last empirical evaluation was in 2014. She noted then that \"the technology is not perfect, and some children will break the rules, eventually slipping through the safeguards,\" but that lawmakers need to understand the trade-offs of advocating for different tech solutions or else risk infringing user privacy. More research is needed, Johnson told Ars, while Sanderson's study suggested that regulators should also conduct circumvention research or be stuck with laws that have a \"limited effectiveness as a standalone policy tool.\" For example, while AI solutions are increasingly more accurate—and in one Facebook survey overwhelmingly more popular with users, Goldman's analysis noted—the tech still struggles to differentiate between a 17- or 18-year-old, for example. Like Aylo, ITIF recommends device-based age authentication as the least restrictive method, Johnson told Ars. Perhaps the biggest issue with that option, though, is that kids may have an easy time accessing adult content on devices shared with parents, Goldman noted. Not sharing Johnson's optimism, Goldman wrote that \"there is no 'preferred' or 'ideal' way to do online age authentication.\" Even a perfect system that accurately authenticates age every time would be flawed, he suggested. \"Rather, they each fall on a spectrum of 'dangerous in one way' to 'dangerous in a different way,'\" he wrote, concluding that \"every solution has serious privacy, accuracy, or security problems.\" As a \"burgeoning\" age verification industry swells, Goldman wants to see more earnest efforts from lawmakers to \"develop a wider and more thoughtful toolkit of online child safety measures.\" They could start, he suggested, by consistently defining minors in laws so it's clear who is being regulated and what access is being restricted. They could then provide education to parents and minors to help them navigate online harms. Without such careful consideration, Goldman predicts a dystopian future prompted by age verification laws. If SCOTUS endorses them, users could become so accustomed to age gates that they start entering sensitive information into various web platforms without a second thought. Even the government knows that would be a disaster, Goldman said. \"Governments around the world want people to think twice before sharing sensitive biometric information due to the information’s immutability if stolen,\" Goldman wrote. \"Mandatory age authentication teaches them the opposite lesson.\" Goldman recommends that lawmakers start seeking an information-based solution to age verification problems rather than depending on tech to save the day. \"Treating the online age authentication challenges as purely technological encourages the unsupportable belief that its problems can be solved if technologists 'nerd harder,'\" Goldman wrote. \"This reductionist thinking is a categorical error. Age authentication is fundamentally an information problem, not a technology problem. Technology can help improve information accuracy and quality, but it cannot unilaterally solve information challenges.\" Lawmakers could potentially minimize risks to kids by only verifying age when someone tries to access restricted content or \"by compelling age authenticators to minimize their data collection\" and \"promptly delete any highly sensitive information\" collected. That likely wouldn't stop some vendors from collecting or retaining data anyway, Goldman suggested. But it could be a better standard to protect users of all ages from inevitable data breaches, since we know that \"numerous authenticators have suffered major data security failures that put authenticated individuals at grave risk.\" \"If the policy goal is to protect minors online because of their potential vulnerability, then forcing minors to constantly decide whether or not to share highly sensitive information with strangers online is a policy failure,\" Goldman wrote. \"Child safety online needs a whole-of-society response, not a delegate-and-pray approach.\" Ars Technica has been separating the signal from\n          the noise for over 25 years.

    "title": "Stellan Skarsgård Says Andor‘s Strength Is in Its Heroes Not Lightsabers",
    "article_text": "Andorstar Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd recently appeared on theQ with Tom PowerÂshow to discuss the series’ revolution game master’s deliberate ambiguity behind the curtain. Luthen Rael, if that’s his real name, doesn’t personally use pew-pews or the Force to advance the resistance againstthe Empirehimself and that’s always made the organizer’s motivations hard to pin down. “The people don’t know if he’s a good guy or a bad guy, which I really like, because none of us are really good guys or bad guys. I mean, it’s like real people. He does really terrible things, but so does any generalâhe sacrifices people for a cause, and so does every military,” he said. Luthen essentially tells Andor his identity doesn’t matter when he won’t see the sunrise of their revolution; what matters is that the Rebels get there no matter the cost, which as audience members we get to see over the course of the events inRogue One: A Star Wars Storyand George Lucas’ originalStar Warstrilogy. SkarsgÃ¥rd continued, “But is it the right course? You don’t know. And you don’t know [often] until much later if it was the right course. So this ambiguity, the gray zones, I’m very interested in.” It’s something that really inspired him to act from a young age, “I wanted to do a hero, of course. I mean, [Star Wars] has the ingredients. The seven-year-old boy’s dream of being an action hero, but it also hassomething.” He traced it back to watching the same sort of swashbuckling Old Hollywood adventures that George Lucas grew up on too. “When I was about 10 years old, I sawThe Scarlet Pimpernelwith Leslie Howard.And he’s a kind of double character as well, like this one I always dreamed about doing and then I got to.” That truly explains a lot about the actor’s take on Luthen when he plays therich dandy dealer of antiquities versus themilitaristic and harsh general behind the scenes.Â Now when it came to joining theStar Warsuniverse, it wasn’t necessarily a sort of goal to add to his gauntlet of Disney, Marvel, and now Lucasfilm, roles but of course he was aware of its place in the zeitgeist. “I’ve seen all of them because I’ve had kidsâall the time. Whether I want to see them or not, I’ve seen them. But there are really good ones, there are really bad ones. And in the first ones… [in a way] George Lucas and the originals were doing it as a comment on [the] everyday politics of the world and then got lost in lightsabers.” He seesAndoras engaging again with real-world politics, the same way Lucas explored societal structures and power dynamics with his films. He continued to describe empathy as the driving core of what makesStar Wars’revolutionary ideals timeless and raises the stakes of the action. “In this show, there’s a society and you feel the society, you feel the oppressive society. You have different worlds and you have different cultures and you feel them. And you see that, ‘oh, they think differently than we do.’ And it’s a much more personal and colorful life. And it, of course, becomes political. And we have to see the functions of… I mean, it’s been going on for thousands of years that we have had revolutions and counterrevolutions and stuff. But it’s good to be reminded about it now and then.” Want more io9 news?

    "title": "I Know What You Did Last Summer‘s Returning Star on Being a Slasher Survivor",
    "article_text": "Freddy Prinze Jr.’s Ray survived the first round of hook-wielding horrors in 1997’sI Know What You Did Last Summerâthen prevailed again when the mayhem shifted to a different seaside locale in 1998 sequelI Still Know What You Did Last Summer. That’s an incredible record for a Final Girl boyfriend in a slasher series, and Prinzeâwhowill play the role againinthe upcoming rebootâsays that this time around, Ray has a new survival skill: vulnerability. Speaking toEntertainment Weekly, Prinze explained that he and the film’s director and co-writer, Jennifer Kaytin Robinson(Do Revenge), aimed to bring a version of Ray to the screen that would feel realistic, considering what he went through three decades prior. “I think what [Robinson and I] both brought to Ray was a lot more vulnerability in this movie,” Prinze said. The character now runs a bar, and as the firstI Know What You Did Last Summerreboot trailershowed, he’s one of the first to speak out when a serial killer begins targeting the younger generation. The violence also triggers the horrifying memories Ray has of his own experiences. “The amount of vulnerability we were able to put in there, I thought, was really honest and just organic.” Clearly, Ray’s still feeling the effects of going to hell and back. “Catching up with Ray, you see how that has shaped him into the position he’s in now. He loves his town and not everyone else does, in his view, and he’s a little grumpier with the way the world has treated him since [the 1997 Southport Massacre],” Prinze said. “So he has gone through a lot, and I don’t know if he’s dealt with it the way the modern man deals with stuff, you know what I mean? He’s a guy from the ’90s like myself, so I think he’s probably bottled up a lot more of those feelings we’ve talked about.” Making it through decades of trauma is one thing. But diehard fans might be wondering just how it is that Ray and Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt’s character) survived that cheeky cliffhanger ending ofI Still Know, which suggested they were both about to meet certain doomâbuilding on a similar ending from the original, which made it seem like Julie was done for. Robinson has clearly thought a lot about this, telling Entertainment Weekly that “I feel like those final scenes in the first two movies live outside the canon … because in the first movie she gets attacked through the shower, through the glass door, and in the second movie, she gets pulled under the bed. So they’re both alive and well, and what I will say is that we have continued the tradition in our film.” Oh boy. We’re hoping that means both legacy characters come out on top (again) inI Know What You Did Last Summer, out July 18. Want more io9 news?

    "title": "Andor‘s Big Recast Should Be the Star Wars Blueprint",
    "article_text": "Coming intoÂAndorseason two, we learned the surprising fact that one big returning character in the season wouldno longer be playedby their legacy actor. This week, we learned exactly who it wasâand at a time whenStar Warshas found itself on diverging paths when it comes to opening up classic characters to new actors, it proved exactly why sometimes that is the best opportunity to provide fresh perspectives and interpretations in the galaxy far, far away. We learn, of course, inÂAndorseason two’s second actthat that legacy figure is none other than Senator Bail Organa, who, after being played by Jimmy Smits across the prequel movies and most recentlyÂObi-Wan Kenobi, is played here by Benjamin Bratt (voice acting legend Phil LaMarr stepped in forÂClone WarsandÂRebels, so it’s not like this is the first time we’ve seen someone else take on Bail).Andorcreator Tony Gilroy has already gone on the record for the simple reason for the recastâSmits’ schedule didn’t align with production on season two, so the recast was out of necessity due to Bail’s importance to the narrative, rather than out of a conscious decision to replace Smits. While it might be a little jarring toÂStar Warsfans at first, Bratt effortlessly glides into Bail’s character in the brief moments we meet him talking to Mon Mothma in the events of the season’s sixth episode, “What a Festive Evening.” Even if it wasn’t a conscious decision, the recast comes at a fascinating time forStar Warsand its approach to legacy characters. As characters ping-pong between animated origins and live-action debuts, as the franchise becomes more and more willing to bring back actors to re-inhabit their legacy roles,ÂStar Warsis always grappling with whether it needs to recast or return to a familiar face as it plays with these increasingly important characters. Of course,ÂAndoritself has explored this already in some way withGenevieve O’Reilly’s Mon Mothma, herself paradoxically both a recast (replacingReturn of the Jedi‘s Caroline Blakiston) and a returning legacy actor, having played Mon in cut scenes fromÂRevenge of the Sithbefore returning inÂRogue One,ÂRebels, and eventuallyÂAndorÂandÂAhsoka. But it is fair to say for as much as it has occasionally recast roles,ÂStar Warsas of late is increasingly more interested in bringing people back, seemingly at any cost. Just asRogue Onehas brought back O’Reilly’s Mon Mothma, it also gave us the first significant digital facsimiles in Grand Moff Tarkin and a young Princess Leia.Â As much asAhsokawas defined by recasting live-action iterations of animated characters, it is now also a series intrinsically tied toHayden Christensen’s returnto the role of Anakin Skywalker. In similar ways,ÂThe MandalorianandÂThe Book of Boba Fettwent a step further in bringing back a post-Return of theJediLuke Skywalker as an amalgam of Mark Hamill’s performance, body double Scott Lang, and both vocal and VFX technology to create a digital facsimile of an era-appropriate Hamill. In some ways, this school of thought is not even necessarily about keepingÂStar Warsstorytelling in the orbit of these familiar figures from the Skywalker saga, but intrinsically keeping specific interpretations of these characters as the definitive version, no matter what has to be done to maintain that interpretation’s status. Even putting asidethe narrative concernsof it all, wouldÂThe MandalorianandÂThe Book of Boba Fettlost anything in casting a new young actor as Luke Skywalker instead of theseawkward digital homunculuswe got? WasÂSoloreally that much of a concern to Lucasfilm that therisk of recastingits most important figures was considered too much once more? ButÂStar Warsstorytelling has likewise similarly thrived when it’s allowed new interpretations of legacy characters, out of necessity or otherwise, to sit along their classic counterparts. After all, without a desire to recast we wouldn’t have things likeSam Witwer’s Darth Maul, or Matt Lanter and James Arnold Taylor’s Anakin and Obi-Wan inÂClone Wars, versions of those characters that are arguably now almost as important as their live-action progenitors.ÂWe wouldn’t have, as we said, O’Reilly’s re-imagination of Mon Mothma, or Forest Whitaker’s evolution of Saw Gererra. Not only did putting faith in these actors to lend their own spin toÂStar Warsstalwarts create new, similarly beloved interpretations of those characters, it also trainedÂStar Warsfans to accept the logistical and storytelling reality that multiple versions and interpretations of these characters can, andshould, co-exist alongside each other. No one’s brains really broke accepting the fact thatÂClone Wars‘ Anakin and Obi-Wan were meant to be the same people we met inÂAttack of the ClonesandÂRevenge of the Sith. Bratt’s version of Bail Organa might be more of a shock simply because we’ve seen Smits in the role for so long, and so recently as well, but it is simply part of that same legacy. Sometimes it is nice to see those familiar faces: but ifÂStar Warsis to thrive, and grow, and sometimes even move beyond those faces, we should always be open to the idea of another certain point of view.

    "title": "Forensics Tool ‘Reanimates’ the ‘Brains’ of AIs That Fail in Order to Understand What Went Wrong",
    "article_text": "From drones delivering medical supplies to digital assistants performing everyday tasks, AI-powered systems are becoming increasingly embedded in everyday life. The creators of these innovations promise transformative benefits. For some people, mainstream applications such as ChatGPT and Claude can seem like magic. But these systems are not magical, nor are they foolproof â they can and do regularly fail to work as intended. AI systems can malfunction due to technical design flaws or biased training data. They can also suffer from vulnerabilities in their code, which can be exploited by malicious hackers. Isolating the cause of an AI failure is imperative for fixing the system. But AI systems are typically opaque, even to their creators. The challenge is how to investigate AI systems after they fail or fall victim to attack. There are techniques for inspecting AI systems, but they require access to the AI systemâs internal data. This access is not guaranteed, especially to forensic investigators called in to determine the cause of a proprietary AI system failure, making investigation impossible. We arecomputer scientistswho studydigital forensics. Our team at the Georgia Institute of Technology has built a system,AI Psychiatry, or AIP, that can recreate the scenario in which an AI failed in order to determine what went wrong. The system addresses the challenges of AI forensics by recovering and âreanimatingâ a suspect AI model so it can be systematically tested. Imagine a self-driving car veers off the road for no easily discernible reason and then crashes. Logs and sensor data might suggest that a faulty camera caused the AI to misinterpret a road sign as a command to swerve. After a mission-critical failure such as anautonomous vehicle crash, investigators need to determine exactly what caused the error. Was the crash triggered by a malicious attack on the AI? In this hypothetical case, the cameraâs faultiness could be the result of a security vulnerability or bug in its software that was exploited by a hacker. If investigators find such a vulnerability, they have to determine whether that caused the crash. But making that determination is no small feat. Although there are forensic methods for recovering some evidence from failures of drones, autonomous vehicles and other so-called cyber-physical systems, none can capture the clues required to fully investigate the AI in that system. Advanced AIs can evenupdate their decision-makingâ and consequently the clues â continuously, making it impossible to investigate the most up-to-date models with existing methods. AI Psychiatry applies a series of forensic algorithms to isolate the data behind the AI systemâs decision-making. These pieces are then reassembled into a functional model that performs identically to the original model. Investigators can âreanimateâ the AI in a controlled environment and test it with malicious inputs to see whether it exhibits harmful or hidden behaviors. AI Psychiatry takes in as inputa memory image, a snapshot of the bits and bytes loaded when the AI was operational. The memory image at the time of the crash in the autonomous vehicle scenario holds crucial clues about the internal state and decision-making processes of the AI controlling the vehicle. With AI Psychiatry, investigators can now lift the exact AI model from memory, dissect its bits and bytes, and load the model into a secure environment for testing. Our team tested AI Psychiatry on 30 AI models, 24 of which were intentionally âbackdooredâ to produce incorrect outcomes under specific triggers. The system was successfully able to recover, rehost and test every model, including models commonly used in real-world scenarios such as street sign recognition in autonomous vehicles. Thus far, our tests suggest that AI Psychiatry can effectively solve the digital mystery behind a failure such as an autonomous car crash that previously would have left more questions than answers. And if it does not find a vulnerability in the carâs AI system, AI Psychiatry allows investigators to rule out the AI and look for other causes such as a faulty camera. AI Psychiatryâs main algorithm is generic: It focuses on the universal components that all AI models must have to make decisions. This makes our approach readily extendable to any AI models that use popular AI development frameworks. Anyone working to investigate a possible AI failure can use our system to assess a model without prior knowledge of its exact architecture. Whether the AI is a bot that makes product recommendations or a system that guides autonomous drone fleets, AI Psychiatry can recover and rehost the AI for analysis. AI Psychiatry isentirely open sourcefor any investigator to use. AI Psychiatry can also serve as a valuable tool for conducting audits on AI systems before problems arise. With government agencies from law enforcement to child protective services integrating AI systems into their workflows, AI audits are becoming an increasingly common oversight requirement at the state level. With a tool like AI Psychiatry in hand, auditors can apply a consistent forensic methodology across diverse AI platforms and deployments. In the long run, this will pay meaningful dividends both for the creators of AI systems and everyone affected by the tasks they perform.

    "title": "Semaglutide Shows Major Promise for Treating Serious Liver Disease",
    "article_text": "Semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is poised to add to its growing list of medical uses. In a large-scale clinical trial published today, semaglutide was found to be effective at treating a severe and relatively common form of liver disease. Researchers in the U.S. and the U.K. led the Phase III trial, funded by the drug’s maker, Novo Nordisk. Compared to placebo, semaglutide substantially improved the outcomes of people with metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The findings will pave the way for semaglutide and similar drugs to become frontline treatments for this chronic condition. Losing Weight With Ozempic Might Also Lighten Your Bar Tab, Study Finds MASH is the most severe form of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Both arecharacterizedby an excess buildup of fat in the liver, which can lead to damaging inflammation and eventual permanent scarring, or cirrhosis. These conditions were formerly known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), respectively. MASLD is the most common form of liver diseaseâaffecting a quarter of adults in the U.S.âthough it often doesn’t cause visible symptoms. Most people with MASLD don’t progress to MASH, but the condition still affects up to 6.5% of American adults. The cirrhosis caused by NASH can raise the risk of other severe complications, includinghepatocellular carcinoma(the most common form of primary liver cancer) and outright liver failure. MASLD/MASH can be caused by several factors, including a person’s genetics, but both obesity and diabetes aremajor contributors. About 75% of people who are overweight and 90% of people with severe obesity have MASLD; and between one-third to two-thirds of those with type 2 diabetes have it as well. Given this close relationship, scientists have hoped that semaglutide and similar drugs that mimic the hormone GLP-1 (already approved to treatobesity and diabetes) could be an effective treatment for MASLD/MASH as well. Novo Nordisk’s Phase III trial, named ESSENCE, involved around 800 patients with MASH. The volunteers were randomly assigned to receive semaglutide (up to 2.4 milligrams, the highest dose currently approved for obesity treatment) or placebo over a 72-week period. Both groups also received lifestyle counseling. By the study’s end, nearly two-thirds of people on semaglutide experienced a resolution of their steatohepatitis (liver inflammation accompanied by fat build-up)âabout double the percentage of those who experienced the same while on placebo. People on the drug also experienced a greater improvement of liver fibrosis (a buildup of scar tissue) than those on placebo, and they lost more weight (about 10% on average). People experienced similar adverse effects on semaglutide as seen in past trials, which predominantly included gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. âIâve been working with GLP-1 treatments for sixteen years and these results are hugely exciting. MASLD is a growing problem worldwide and this trial will provide real hope for patients with MASH,” said co-lead author Philip Newsome, director of the Roger Williams Institute of Liver Studies at King’s College London, in astatementfrom the university. “While these results must be treated with caution, the analysis shows semaglutide can be an effective tool to treat this advanced liver disease.â Ozempic Could Be Lifesaving for Thousands of Americans a Year, Study Finds The trial’s findings, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, are almost certain to secure the drug’s approval for treating MASH from the Food and Drug Administration. The expected approval would represent the latest breakthrough for a condition that only recently had no available drug treatments. Just over a year ago, the FDAapprovedthe first such drug, Rezdiffra from Madrigal Pharmaceuticals. Rezdiffra is a bit different in terms of how it treats MASH.Â It targets a different receptor that more specifically prevents the build-up of fat in the liver without causing weight loss. But that’s likely a positive, since it should provide doctors and patients more treatment options to choose from, especially when people don’t respond well to one or the other. Other GLP-1 drugs (includingdrugs that mimic other weight-related hormones) are being tested for MASH. So if things continue to go well, these drugs could soon revolutionize the treatment of MASH, just as they already have for obesity.

Even the solid proposals set out by the Trump administration are being undermined by its actions taken elsewhere. A recent survey reveals the foods that people are less likely to eat once they start taking GLP-1 medications like Ozempic. A new review of clinical trial data finds evidence that GLP-1 drugs can meaningfully reduce dementia risk in people with type 2 diabetes. Stanford Medicine researchers have identified a promising, naturally occurring molecule that could help people lose weightâwithout the nauseating symptoms now commonly seen with GLP-1 drugs. Recent research throws into question whether GLP-1 drugs increase the risk of certain types of thyroid cancer. We may earn a commission when you buy through links on our sites.Â©2025 GIZMODO USA LLC.

    "title": "Gun Owners Group Calls for Inquiry Into Firearms Industry’s Secret Sharing of Customer Data",
    "article_text": "This story was originally published by ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up forThe Big Story newsletterto receive stories like this one in your inbox. A group representing firearms owners has asked three federal agencies to investigate how the gun industryâs main lobbying group secretly used the intimate details of weapons buyers for political purposes. In making the request, Gun Owners for Safetycited a ProPublica investigationthat detailed how theNational Shooting Sports Foundationturned over sensitive personal information on gun buyers to political operatives while presenting itself as a fierce advocate for the privacy of firearms owners.The letterâ sent last week to the FBI, the Federal Trade Commission and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives â called the NSSFâs secret program that spanned nearly two decades “underhanded.â âGun ownersâ privacy is not a partisan or ideological issue,â wrote Malcolm Smith, aGun Owners for Safetymember. âNo matter the industry, exploiting customersâ private data like their underwear size and childrenâs ages in a secret scheme is reprehensible and cannot be permitted.â Gun Owners for Safety has been operated since 2019 by the gun violence prevention organizationGiffords, which was co-founded by Gabby Giffords, the Arizona lawmaker who survived an attempted assassination in 2011. It has chapters in nine states and consists of gun owners and Second Amendment supporters who believe in what they call âcommon senseâ measures to reduce gun-related deaths like safety locks and improved background checks on firearm purchases. TheATFacknowledged receiving the letter but had no other comment. TheFBI,FTCand NSSF didnât respond to ProPublicaâs questions and requests for comment. The NSSF previously defended its data collection, saying its âactivities are, and always have been, entirely legal and within the terms and conditions of any individual manufacturer, company, data broker, or other entity.â The organization represents thousands of firearms and ammunition manufacturers, distributors and retailers, along with publishers and shooting ranges. While not as well known as the chief lobbyist for gun owners, the National Rifle Association, the NSSF is respected and influential in business, political and gun-rights communities. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told ProPublica he agreed with Smithâs call for an investigation. Last November, Blumenthal, then chair of a Senate subcommittee on privacy,asked the NSSF for detailson the companies that contributed information to the trade groupâs database, the type of customer details that were shared and whether the data is still being used. The trade group did not answer the senatorâs questions. âThe NSSFâs disturbing, covert data collection raises serious safety and privacy concerns,â Blumenthal said. âAnd the American people deserve answers.â Itâs unclear how successful any request for an investigation will be under the Trump administration, especially given the NSSFâs past political support for the president. ProPublicaâs investigationidentified at least 10 gun industry businesses, including Glock, Smith & Wesson and Remington, that handed over hundreds of thousands of names, addresses and other private data â without customer knowledge or consent â to the NSSF, which then entered the details into what would become a massive database. The database was used to rally gun ownersâ electoral support for the industryâs preferred candidates running for the White House and Congress. Privacy experts told ProPublica that companies that shared information with the NSSF may have violated federal and state prohibitions against deceptive and unfair business practices. Under federal law, companies must comply with their own privacy policies and be clear about how they will use consumersâ information, privacy experts said. A ProPublica review of dozens of warranty cards from those gun-makers found that none of them informed buyers that their details would be used for political purposes. (Most of the companies named in the NSSF documents declined to comment or did not respond to ProPublica. One denied sharing customer data, and the new parent company of another said it had no evidence of data sharing with the NSSF under prior ownership.) In 2016, as part of a push to get Donald Trump elected president for the first time and to help Republicans keep the Senate, the NSSFworked with the consultancyCambridge Analytica to turbocharge the information it had on potential voters. Cambridge matched up the people in the database with 5,000 additional facts about them that it drew from other sources. Thedetails were far-ranging. Along with the potential votersâ income, debts and religious affiliation, analysts learned whether they liked the work of the painter Thomas Kinkade and whether the underwear women had purchased was plus size or petite. ProPublica obtained a portion of the NSSF database that contains the names, addresses and other information of thousands of people. ProPublica reached out to 6,000 people on the list. Almost all of those who responded, including gun owners, expressed outrage, surprise or disappointment over learning they were in the database. In his letter seeking an investigation, Smith noted that the FBIâs new director, Kash Patel, has spoken out in favor of protecting gun ownersâ privacy rights. âSurely, then,â Smith wrote, âthe FBI understands the importance of ensuring no organization or government agency maintains a secret database of firearm customers and gun owners. As many high-profile hacks and data leaks have shown, private data can easily be mishandled and exploited for nefarious purposes. Smith, a 69-year-old retired executive of J.P. Morgan bank and registered Republican, told ProPublica his love of guns started as a teen when his father bought him a Remington rifle for bird hunting. The passion intensified over the years, and Smith started collecting guns heavily in response to political efforts to restrict gun access. âAnytime I heard Nancy Pelosi not like something, I felt like I had to have it,â Smith said. But he joined Giffords in 2020 after growing uncomfortable with extremism in gun rights circles. More recently, he said, the Department of Government Efficiencyâs attempt tograblarge amountsofconfidential citizen datafrom the Social Security Administration and IRS inspired his request for government action. (DOGE officials did not respond to a request for comment.) âThe initial disclosures about the National Shooting Sports Foundation was an alarm bell. But now this is a four-alarm fire,â Smith said. âWeâre supposed to have some sort of privacy in our lives, and apparently the NSSF decided I didnât have to have it. And DOGE really thinks Iâm not entitled to it.â guns Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily. News from the future, delivered to your present.

    "title": "US Government Registered Several Websites Potentially Linked to Trump Meme Coin",
    "article_text": "Donald Trump takes a lot of heat for taking down government webpages with essential information likeLGBTQ health informationandclimate change-related data, but no one gives him credit for the webpages he puts up. 404 Media reports that the administration registered three websites with .gov domains that all appear to be potentially related to Trump’s cryptocurrency meme coin. The three sites recently registered by the government include thetrilliondollardinner.gov, dinnerforamerica.gov, and thetrillion.gov. While none of the pages are currently live,404 Media confirmedvia the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency that the websites are real and were registered at the behest of the Department of Commerce. All three sites were registered around the same time that the team involved with the $TRUMP memecoinannounceda promotional event that will allow the top 220 holders of the cryptocurrency to attend a dinner event with the President, including a VIP tour for the 25 people who hold the largest share of $TRUMP coins. That promotion prompted several Democratic Senators topush for an investigationinto whether Trump offering dinner to anyone who puts enough money into his meme coin amounts to a violation of federal ethics rules, though nothing much has come from that effort thus far. The initial promotion, which appeared on the website for the $TRUMP coin, trumpmemes.com, caused the price of the cryptocurrency to spike by as much as 60%. That likely put a decent chunk of change in Trump’s pocket, as 80% of $TRUMP is owned by two entities: CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC, which is co-owned by CIC Digital. But it seems that the promotion may soon spread to official .gov domains, based on the recent website registrations (though, to be clear, nothing has appeared on those pages yet). This isn’t the first time the Trump administration has added a couple of domains to the government’s registry. Shortly after taking office, it alsoregistered DEI.gov and Waste.gov, the latter of which became the site where the supposed savings from cuts made by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency appeared.404 Media reportedat the time that Waste.gov was just a WordPress template and placeholder page. The site is nowpassword protected. DEI.gov currently redirects to the locked-down Waste.gov domain. So, not exactly the most compelling content, and potentially a sign that nothing will come of the “Trillion Dollar Dinner” websiteâthough surely they’ll find other ways to carry on their grift regardless.

    "title": "Elon Wears Two Hats During Trump Meeting in Desperate Bid for Attention",
    "article_text": "Elon Musk, a guy whose quest to be adored by everyone grows more pathetic with each passing day, appeared at President Donald Trump’s cabinet meeting Wednesday despite not being a member of the cabinet. The head of DOGE donned two hats simultaneously for the meeting, a perplexing move until he spoke. Musk said he wears a lot of hats. Get it? The billionaire oligarch wears a lot of hats. The cabinet meeting, which wasbroadcast liveon all the major cable news networks, has been a familiar location for Musk, who’s running the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Cabinet officials need to be confirmed by the Senate, but that hasn’t stopped Musk from acting like a member of the cabinet and throwing his weight around constantly. Musk’s DOGE has been destroying vital services from the U.S. government, as the billionaire unilaterally decides what stays and what goes, proclaiming without a shred of evidence that he’s getting rid of “waste, fraud, and abuse.” In reality, Musk iscosting the U.S. huge sums of moneylong term while delivering a death sentence tomillions of people. President Trump told Musk on Wednesday that he loves the double hat and that he’s “the only one who could do that and get away with it,” perhaps suggesting in Trump’s odd way that Musk was being disrespectful. “Well, Mr. President, they say I wear a lot of hats. It’s true. Even my hat has a hat,” Musk said, laughing at his own joke as the table of sycophants laughed along. Musk went on to claim that Trump has accomplished more than “any administration before ever, period,” calling it the “greatest administration since the founding of the country.” Trump thanked Musk and told him he’s “sacrificed a lot,” to which the Tesla CEO made references to the protests and arson that have taken place at his dealerships since Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. That also happens to be the day that Musk made twoNazi-style salutes. “They do like to burn my cars, which is not great,” Musk said, appearing to get emotional while forcing a laugh. “Could be better.” After Musk’s jokes had gotten their laughs, Trump moved on to the elephant in the room. How much longer is Musk going to be sticking around and destroying the federal government? “You’re invited to stay as long as you want. And at some point, I guess, you want to get back home to his cars…” Trump said. Musk has gotten plenty of headlines recently for saying that he’ll soon be stepping away from DOGE to devote more time to his companies. But if you look at how heactually talks about that, it’s clear Musk wants to be intimately involved in the government until Trump eventually leaves office, whenever that may be. Musk has a unique view inside the federal government right now, one that any other government contractor would kill for. SpaceX, one of many Musk companies that benefit from government money, now seems poised to have an edge on competitors thanks to the oligarch’s access. Musk’s assertion that Trump’s was the greatest administration in the entire history of the country was echoed ad nauseam on Wednesday as they went around the table to praise Trump like any dictator in an authoritarian country might expect his underlings to do. But it was Trump’s own words about the economy that arguably made the biggest splash of the day. Trump addressed the fact that his trade war was starting to hurt the country economically, but he argued it was all for a good cause. That cause? Selling more stuff to China than they sell to us, something Trump is fixated on for no good reason. “They made a trillion dollars with Biden selling us stuff,” Trump said of China. “Much of it we don’t need. Somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are gonna be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.” Trump on China: “They made a trillion dollars with Biden selling us stuff. Much of it we don’t need. Somebody said, ‘oh, the shelves are gonna be open.’ Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more.” [image or embed] â Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com)April 30, 2025 at 10:38 AM Nobody is saying the shelves are going to be “open,” which isn’t a thing people say in English. They’re saying the shelves will be empty. And that, of course, is a stunning admission by any sitting president. Trump acknowledges that Americans are going to be able to buy fewer consumer goods, but he insists it’s a good thing. It’s hard to imagine that if he’d included that as part of his tariff pitch on the campaign trail in 2024, he would’ve garnered many votes. In fact, polling suggests that most Americans who voted for Trump thought he would help bring down the price of goods, not make the shelves empty. Marco Rubio also made some stunning statements during the cabinet meeting, one of which was eventweeted outproudly by the State Department. Rubio was asked by a reporter whether he’d been in touch with El Salvador about bringing back Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was wrongly deported to the country. The secretary of state was indignant, clearly performing for Trump. “Well, I would never tell you that, and you know who else I would never tell? A judge. Because the conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the president,” Rubio said.

Because the conduct of our foreign policy belongs to the President.\"pic.twitter.com/ORrW5ezcOj — Department of State (@StateDept)April 30, 2025 The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Trump needs to facilitate the return of Abrego Garcia, but the president has repeatedly said he won’t bring back the wrongly deported man. And Rubio’s assertion that even he would refuse to cooperate with the courts makes it clear the Trump regime believes it can act outside the law without consequence. Sadly, they appear to be right. We’re at the point where Trump has defied a Supreme Court order and has no plans to rectify that. TheNew York Timesreported Wednesday that perhaps Trump’s team may be communicating with El Salvador about Abrego Garcia but quoted experts who warned that could very well be little more than ass covering. We don’t know at this point, but the longer this all drags on, the worse the American people will be. Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "Marc Andreessen Says One Job Is Mostly Safe From AI: Venture Capitalist",
    "article_text": "Egg-headed venture capitalist Marc Andreessen is an optimist when it comes to artificial intelligence. The reasons for this are well known: through his firm, Andreessen Horowitz, the billionaire has invested in a broad array of AI-related ventures, which, he assumes, will both pay dividends and make the world a better place. This week, we found out another reason that Andreessen doesn’t have any worries about the technology: he doesn’t think AI could ever possibly replace him. During a recenta16z podcast appearance, Andreessen predicted that venture capital (you know, his job) might be one of the last remaining vocations after AI has replaced large swaths of the human labor force. âEvery great venture capitalist in the last 70 years has missed most of the great companies of his generation,â Andreessen said during the podcast. âSo, the great VCs have a success record of getting, you know, two out of 10 or something of the great companies of the decade.â Andreessen described his job as a nuanced combination of “intangible” skills, including psychological analysis of the entrepreneurs he works with: âA lot of it is psychological analysis, like, âWho are these people?â âHow do they react under pressure?â âHow do you keep them from falling apart?â âHow do you keep them from going crazy?â âHow do you keep from going crazy yourself?â You know, you end up being a psychologist half the time.â âSo, it is possibleâI donât want to be definitiveâbut itâs possible that that is quite literally timeless. And when, you know, when the AI is doing everything else, that may be one of the last remaining fields that people are still doing.â It’s just funny to hear Andreessen repeat the oft-heard refrain that “technology is awesome and everything, but there’s just no way it could ever do what I do.” This is what people have been telling themselves since forever, and it’s usually right before they lose their job to whatever the current form of automation is. Surely, a powerful future AI of the sort that Marc and his cohort often speak about could, when fed with ample amounts of psychiatric data, swiftly surpass a human VC’s powers of psychological divination, and make informed decisions about how to manage business leaders. Isn’t this exactly the sort of thing that people like Andreessen have long been telling everybody AI is capable of doing? That said, Andreessen’s powers of self-delusion are well known. HisTechno-Optimist’s Manifesto, published a few years ago, was another great window into a mind addled by too much cash and too little common sense. If you’re one of Silicon Valley’s Masters of the Universe, I guess having weird, self-serving views just comes with the territory. a16zmarc andreesen Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Best Gadgets of April 2025",
    "article_text": "April showers bring May flowers, but in the tech world, things are looking pretty dour.Trump tariffshave upset supply chains and left tech companiesâboth big and smallâreeling. Weâve seen products like theRazer Blade 16gaming laptop disappear from the companyâs website, only to reappear later this month. Companies are also taking this opportunity to push the extra costs of tariffs onto consumers. Werounded upa multitude of TVs, handhelds, wearables, portable chargers, and more products that have all experienced price increases. Still, we may have only scratched the surface of what the full impact of tariffs might be in the near future. At least thereâs one thing to look forward to:the Nintendo Switch 2. We had hands-on time with Nintendoâs highly anticipated handheld, and both the hardware and theinitial games selectiondid not disappoint. While we wait to get our hands on it for an in-depth review at launch on June 5, we can bide our time looking at some excellent mobile devices, such as Googleâs Pixel 9a mid-range phone and the latest rendition of the moddable, repairable Framework Laptop 13. Nintendoâs $450 handheld console is the successor to the mega-hit Switch. Its biggest improvements can be considered quality-of-life upgrades found in typical tech iterations,Â such as the bright and colorful 8-inch 1080p display or the faster processor that claims to hit 4K resolution on some games when docked. But Nintendo still knows how to have fun with its hardware. Themouse-based controls were a surprising hitâthey even work on most pants! The new Joy-Cons are intuitive enough that swapping between regular thumbsticks and mouse-based aiming is seamless for games likeCivilization VII. Weâll still need more time with it to test out its Game Chat feature andaccess to webcams, but itâs enough to make us excited for the future of Nintendoâs consoles. Googleâs mid-range Pixel A-series have routinely been some of the best deals for phones, and that continues with the Pixel 9a. Even if you donât enjoy the flat look of a phone without a camera bump or bar, the 9a still comes with the same Tensor chip as Googleâs more expensive Pixels. That facilitates the majority of Googleâs latest featuresâincluding Gemini AIâfor $500 compared to the $800 Pixel 9. The phoneâs camera system includes a 48-megapixel main and 13-megapixel ultra-wide, which isnât a huge step down from Googleâs flagship devices, though youâll miss out on zoom functions. It only lacks slightly in wireless charging speeds, but thatâs not enough to detract from whatâs still an excellent value for most Android fans. Framework has been in the game ofmaking moddable, repairable laptopsfor several years now, but the company has hit its stride this year with the latest Framework Laptop 13. Itâs a laptop thatâs fun to put together, and with a solid keyboard, trackpad, display, and battery life, itâs a computer that you can actually use for a full workday without feeling like you’re gimping yourself on features you get on less repairable machines. The Framework Laptop 13 may lack in some aspects, such as its speaker quality, and that could be a concern for the price of its DIY kits. But the benefit is that the Framework is a laptop you should be able to use for as long as you want, swapping out parts as necessary. DellâsAlienware gaming brand has shifted in recent years. Itâs no longer focused on making the most out-of-this-world PCs and accessories. Instead, the brand spends its time thinking about the end-user experience. As for the Area-51 desktop, that resolves into a great case for a beginner PC builder thanks to easily accessible side panels and QR codes that offer tutorials for swapping out nearly every component. The desktop tower is also one of the first to feature a positive pressure-cooling system that moves hot air out of the PC without the need for exhaust fans. I would enjoy the PC much more if it had some of the flair of older Alienware PCs. Now all I can imagine is if Alienware took its lessons from this device, got some of its old mojo back, and crafted a case thatâs a joy to both look at and use. Those of us who never turned off the 3D effect on ourNintendo 3DS handheldsimagine a world where every monitor adds a subtle pop-out effect to our favorite games. Samsungâs Odyssey 3D monitor is one of the few offerings thatâs trying to bring back lenticular lenses. The $2,000 monitor uses eye tracking to beam images to both eyes individually, meaning youâll never be outside the âsweet spotâ for that 3D image. The Reality Hub software allows you to change the 3D depth for each of the 12 supported games. The limited number of games and astronomical price will dampen its appeal, but the Odyssey 3D itself may entice more monitor makers to create cheaper versions in the future. If the Pixel 9a is the king of budget phones, then theNothing Phone 3a Prois the court jester who knows a little too much of the courtâs dealings. It carries over Nothingâs famed-and-fun glyph lighting and chirpy sound effects, though this device doesnât skimp on battery life, screen brightness, or display refresh rate for $460. Compared to thePhone 2a, the 3a is good enough to offer solid depth of field for macro shots, though youâll still miss out on high-quality zoom for capturing details from far away. Nothingâs devices are a fun way to ignore Samsung and Googleâs latest offerings, but you donât miss out on much with the 3a Proâs lower price point. Ankerâs eufyMake E1 UV printermay be the average Etsy creatorâs dream product. Itâs small enough to fit on a desk or tabletop, but with UV-curable resin, it can print on practically any surface. The coolest aspect of the E1 is its ability to print in multiple layers to create a 3D effect on whatever material you choose. In person, these 3D prints have an almost painted quality. The eufyMake M1 UV printer started crowdfunding on Kickstarter at the end of this month at a full price of $1,900. If all phone makers are obsessed with AI, then Motorola with its new lineup ofRazr flip phonesis absolutely consumed with the idea for on-device intelligence. The Motorola Razr, Razr+, and Razr Ultra all sport new titanium hinges that should make them more durable, but the name of the game is Moto AI. These include AI models fromPerplexity, alongsideGoogle Gemini,Meta Llama, andMicrosoft Copilot. All the different models accomplish different tasks, and it may automate some of them for you, such as color and light correction before you take a photo. If you need an example to understand how much Moto is banking on AI, the Razr Ultra even includes a dedicated AI button.

    "title": "The Coldest Planet Ever Seen Is Circling a Stellar Corpse",
    "article_text": "Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have directly detected the faint glow of a planet that’s colder than any world whose light has been directly observedâan astonishing detection that reveals the extreme conditions of some worlds in our universe. The exoplanet, WD 1856+534 b, wasfirst spottedin 2020 and is twice as old as our solar system. The world is about the size of Jupiter but about six times more massive and much chillier, clocking in at an average temperature of just -125Â° Fahrenheit (-87Â° Celsius). That makes it the coldest exoplanet ever directly observed by its own emitted light. The team’s research describing the exoplanet and its thermal emission iscurrently hostedon the preprint server arXiv. The exoplanet is orbiting a white dwarf, the ghostly ember of a dead star. In fact, that’s what made the object’s detection possible; typically, stars are so bright that they drown out the much duller glow of the planets orbiting them. WD 1856 b’s star is so dim that the exoplanet itself was visible to Webb’s gaze. Astronomer Mary Anne Limbach from the Department of Astronomy at the University of Michigan contributed to the study. What’s arguably weirder is where this planet is hanging out. WD 1856 b orbits just 0.02 astronomical units from its white dwarf starâcloser than Mercury is to our Sun. “WD 1856+534 b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarfâs ‘forbidden zone,’ a region where planets would have been engulfed during the starâs red giant phase,” the team explained in the paper, adding that its “presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbitsâincluding the habitable zoneâaround white dwarfs is possible.” The team’s work also puts WD 1856 at the top of the cold world pecking order. Just behind it isEpsilon Indi Ab, a planet studied by Webb just last year, which at the time made it the coldest imaged planet beyond our solar system at an estimated temperature of 35 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees C). Suffice to say, WD 1856 b is much colder. The findings also settle a lingering identity crisis. Until now, WD 1856 b could have been a low-mass brown dwarf. But with its faint temperature and revised mass estimates (no more than 5.9 Jupiter masses), it’s officially part of the catalog of thousands of exoplanets scientists have compiled over the last few decades. The research is also a major proof of concept for JWST’s ability to study cold, mature planetsâand a reminder that even worlds orbiting the burnt-out cores of dead stars can still glow, however faintly. exoplanetswebb space telescopewhite dwarfs Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

Peculiarities in the orbits of two brown dwarfs indicate the presence of something even more extraordinary. A stellar occultation this month gave scientists an opportunity to scrutinize the seventh planet from the Sun. Dimethyl sulfide is coolâand a potential biosignatureâbut scientists are urging caution before we declare a plankton party some 120 light-years away. New JWST data strengthens earlier hints that K2-18b, a possible water world 120 light-years away, could host the chemical byproducts of life.

    "title": "Texas Senators Pass Bill That Would Criminalize Abortion Medications",
    "article_text": "Under Trump’s second administration, the fragile preservation of abortion access in the United States is slowly being eroded. To nobody’s surprise, Texas lawmakers are looking to lead the charge. On Tuesday,the Texas Senate passed a law targeting abortion pillsin efforts to dramatically expand the state’s near-total abortion ban.Â Â Dubbed the Women and Child Protection Act,SB 2880would allow lawsuits against anyone manufacturing, mailing, or delivering abortion pills to someone in Texas for up to $100,000.Â  These lawsuits can center around “injury sustained by an unborn child” or the “wrongful death of an unborn child” (which the bill specifies can be filed by either parent). The statute of limitations for wrongful death cases would also be extended to six years instead of just two. Per the Texas Tribune, the bill’s current language means it cannot be challenged in state court before it goes into effect. In fact, a state court judge could be sued for $100,000 if they say that it’s unconstitutional. Furthermore, any lawyers who try to challenge the bill would be responsible for both sides’ legal fees. This use of civil lawsuits was central to Texas’s original anti-abortion legislation in 2021, as it allowed the state to expand its reach by effectively handing over the policing and enforcement of laws to private citizens. Scarily enough, though, the Senate actually passed a scaled-down version of the law. When it was originally introduced in March, itincludedfelony charges for paying for or reimbursing abortion-related costs or destroying evidence. It also criminalized things like helping with travel or lodging. According to the Guttmacher Institute, medication abortions account for themajority of abortionsin the United States. An average of2,800 Texansreceive abortion-inducing medication by mail fromshield stateswhose laws protect abortion providers, helpers, and patient medical records from any civil or criminal proceedings. Currently, eighteen states (and D.C.) have shield laws, including California, Minnesota, and New York. Recently, Texas tried to circumvent New York’s law bysuing a doctor for mailing abortion pills. But last month, a county clerkrefusedto file the judge’s fine of over $100,000. As its name implies, SB 2880 is framed as a way to protect women. Per the Texas Tribune, bill author Sen. Bryan Hughes said that pills “are being mailed…directly to women, often without instructions, certainly without doctors as before, and without any follow-up care after…This is illegal in Texas, but it is taking place, and we’ve thus far not been able to protect women.” In addition to trying to eliminate medications, SB 2880 would criminalize providing information on how to obtain them. This includes anyone who makes a website about abortion access or exchanges emails. As the Electronic Frontier Foundation summarized in arecent statement, “The goal is to wipe this information from the internet altogether…The bill is carefully designed to scare people into silence.” Texas is not stopping at SB 2880. The Senate is consideringtesting sewage for abortion pills, and also passed SB 31, whichclarifies when doctors can perform medically necessary abortions. The bill comes after ProPublicareportedin February that sepsis rates soared following the abortion ban. Per the outlet, two women died from sepsis after doctors refused to evacuate their incomplete miscarriages because that would be an abortion. Although once again framed as protecting women, the Texas Equal Access Funddescribedit as a “political distraction” that “only exists to provide anti-abortion politicians cover for their decision to ban abortion, while keeping care inaccessible.” Both SB 2880 and SB 31 are now heading to the House. abortionTexas Get the best tech, science, and culture news in your inbox daily.

    "title": "The Brilliant, Terrifying Fury of Doctor Who‘s Dalek Reunion",
    "article_text": "In many ways,ÂDoctor Who‘s regenerated era has spent the entirety of the last two decades chasing the highs of April 30, 2005. In 45 minutes, and with an episode simply titled “Dalek” introduced a tender new audience of viewers, still reeling fromWho‘s return, to the terrible, unflinching might of the Daleks. In the years since, the show has returnedtime and time againto the form and content of “Dalek” and its approachto the titular pepper pots; sometimes it’s eschewed its lessons for sweeping senses of scale, as if simple multiplication could match. But what has always remained true about “Dalek” in the last 20 years is that what makes it so utterly terrifying even now, arguably long after the Daleks have lostmuch of their biteonce again for audiences, is less about the carnage its lone monster wreakedâand more about what the Dalek reflected back on Christopher Eccleston’s take on the Time Lord. “Dalek” is constantly about this mirror match between its titular protagonist and antagonist. Like the Doctor had been in the revitalized series’ new background, the Dalek encountered in the episode (in a then-near-future Utah, in the underground vault of a megalomaniacal tech billionaire, Henry Van Statten) is rendered the last of its kind, the sole survivor of its species’ part inthe Time War. It, like the Doctor, is confused by its place in the universe reckoning with this information, but unlike the Doctor we’d met up to this point, the Dalek’s conclusion is destruction in spite of it all, an eradication of everything it deems inferior in contrast to the Doctor’s ceaseless desire to save whoever and whatever he can as penance for his people’s destruction. By the episode’s end, and the Dalek’s self-immolation as it recognizes its bond with the Doctor’s latest companion,Rose Tyler, we see a fascinating parallel in humanity’s impact on both the Doctor’s oldest foe and in some ways, themselves. But among that, and among the delectable terror of the Dalek’s one-armored-mutant-cephalopod rampage (gleefully tearing up every metatextual “weakness” of the species’ place in pop culture history along the way), “Dalek” shines brightest in its darkest shadows, where the reflection between the Dalek and the Doctor are less about what divides them, and more about what similarities they share forged in the crucible of the Time War. It brings out one of Christopher Eccleston’struly great performancesas the Ninth Doctor in a season that burns brightly with many of them. The first encounter between the Doctor and the Dalek sees the actor pull out all the tsops, dancing between an array of emotionsâas we watch the former leap between his usual calm collective desire to help, to terror upon realizing the creature he’s followed a distress signal to, to gloating glee over their shared misfortune. But simmering beneath it all, barely controlled as Eccleston bounces around the tiny room the Dalek has been chained up in, is anemotion rarely glimpsedat this point in the Ninth Doctor’s character:rage. We’ve seen him angry of course, driven by his sense of justice, in the way he handled the Autons in “Rose” or dispassionate view of Cassandra and the Slitheen. But in “Dalek” the Doctor growls in a fury that is truly terrifying to watch, even as he flits between it and the tragedy of his grief. It truly comes out when the Dalek first broaches the idea that the rest of the episode will build on, as it bleakly intones itself that it and its people’s greatest enemy are now the same, leading to the Doctor’s explicit decision to enact cruelty directly on his foe, torturing it to near death. But as scary as that moment is, to watch our hero revel at the thought of torture and murder, to have to be dragged away from the chance to finish the job he started in the Time War, it’s later on in the episode where we get an incredible reversal on this scene that becomes downright chilling. Once the Dalek breaks free and begins is rampage, “Dalek” climaxes its action with a brilliant showdown between the creature and Van Statten’s security forces, cleverly obliterating a swath of troopers by electrocuting them in a single shot from its extermination ray. In the aftermath of that carnage, which the Doctor watches from afar on security cameras, the power dynamic from his first reunion with the Dalek has entirely switched: if the Doctor was in control there, the Dalek weakened and chained up, now it’s the Doctor hiding from his revitalized foe, calmly but assuredly basking in the power of the carnage it’s just committed. And if that first encounter is about the Doctor’s rage barely being in control until it spills over, Eccleston’s performance here is far more subdued for longer. Prodding the Dalek to admit that its attempts to verify the Doctor’s claims that the Dalek Empire is dead and gone, the Doctor once again turns cold when he offers a simple purpose to the wayward soldier: killing itself. The Doctor’s anger bubbles over again once those words tumble out of his mouth, leading to the famous rejoinder that he would “make a good Dalek” as a shock to his system, but it’s the stillness with which Eccleston portrays that moment that shows you how completely close the Doctor is to the edge of becoming something unlike anything audiences of this new era had yet to see him in. It’s a brilliant, ugly moment for the Doctor to faceâand 20 years, and many Dalek appearances later, it’s one that’s still far scarier than any body count those legendary pepper pots could muster.

    "title": "Nobody’s Asking for Unnecessarily Skinny iPhones or Samsung Galaxy Phones",
    "article_text": "Smartphones were bound to get boring. Eighteen years after the introduction of theoriginal iPhoneâthe glass touchscreen that truly changed everythingâthereâs very little with new phones that will get people camping out just to be the first to get The Next Big Thing.Foldable phones have tried to rekindlesome of that old excitement,but theyâre still too expensive. So phone makers are trying something new: super skinny phones. Both Samsung and Apple will be launching extremely thin phones by the end of this year. Samsung alreadyannounced its Galaxy S25 Edge, and Apple, the copious leaks plastered all over the internet strongly suggest, will release what everybodyâs calling the âiPhone 17 Airâ alongside its stable of regular andpro-tier iPhone 17s. Numerous leaked images of dummy units reveal the S25 Edge and iPhone 17 Air to be barely thicker than the USB-C port. Prolific phone leakerEvan Blass shared last weekthat the S25 Edge measures only 5.8mm thick and weighs 165 grams. Several well-known Apple leakers, including Bloombergâs Mark Gurman, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, and YouTubers such as Unbox Therapy,all corroboratethat the iPhone 17 Air will clock in somewhere around 5.5mm to 6mm thick. YouTuber Sam Kohl,who runs the Apple Track channel, has an extensive video showing off a dummy model for the iPhone 17 Air and how it compares to the rest of Apple’s family of iPhone 17 devices slated for launch in September. Take a look at the sides of the iPhone 17 dummy â the Air model is unbelievably thin.pic.twitter.com/ixadQHuxK5 — Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson)April 24, 2025 Had phones stayed skinny like they were way back with theiPhone 6 released in 2014, and hadbendgatenever happened, nobody would be making such a hoopla over thin phones. But thatâs not what happened. As phones got bigger screens, cameras upgraded from single lenses to dual or triple ones, and apps (especially 3D mobile games) needed more powerful chips, there was only one way to make them last a whole day, and that was shoving a bigger battery inside. The downside to longer-lasting but physically bigger batteries is that phones ballooned in thickness to fit them. Phone makers gave the people exactly what they voted for with their walletsâphone addiction be damnedâand now theyâre trying to sell lesser phones just for the sake of slimness. Is anybody really asking for a phone that could snap in half like a candy bar if you grip it too hard or slip it into a pair of tight jeans? Even a guy like me who hates how impossible it is to one-hand myiPhone 16 Proand would greatly appreciate a thinner and lighter iPhone is wondering whether the tradeoffs will be worth it. A thinner phone means a smaller battery. You also get fewer rear cameras, as evidenced by the S25 Edge and leaked iPhone 17 Airâs single lenses. Technology has come a long way since bendgate over a decade ago. Chipsets are more efficient and less power-hungry, so you donât need massive batteries for phone basics like doomscrolling on TikTok, email, and web browsing. And you can now get a lot out of a single camera lensâlike multiple focal lengths that simulate different zoom levels by cropping inâif the sensor has lots of megapixels. But I worry that the the mass and weight loss may not be worth these compromises. At the end of the day, both Samsung and Appleâs skinny phones will still have big honking screens roughly measuring 6.6 inches, and they wonât fit in any pair of reasonable pants pockets. Sorry, dude who only owns one pair of jeans and has the outline of their phone permanently imprinted into the front pocket! The initial media and influencer buzz will treat these phones like they’re the Second Coming of Jesus, but after the frenzy subsides, will anybody care? Will the sales numbers bear out any demand for super-thin phones? We wonât know until hindsight, but if rumored prices end up being correct, they might be a tough sell.Bloombergâs Mark Gurman believesApple could sell the iPhone 17 Air starting at $900, which would only be $100 more than the iPhone 17 and $100 less than the iPhone 17 Pro. Thatâs also onlyifApple sticks to the pricing for the iPhone 16 and 16 Pro and doesnâtincrease prices because of tariffs. Other rumors have suggested Apple could sell the iPhone 17 Air for more than the smaller iPhone 17 Pro. Meanwhile, Samsungâs S25 Edge could be very pricey, too. A leak reportedly from Samsung itself suggests the skinny device couldstart at around $1,200. How willing will people be to pay up just to show off they have the thinnest Samsung Galaxy or iPhone 17? In this economy and with tariffs threatening consumerism as we know it? Good luck, guys. Also, slap a case on the thin iPhone, and you’re back to having a regular-thick iPhone with none of the better features. I think Iâve made my point. But letâs say that both these skinny phones are recession-proof and theyâre a hit. I still think that phone makers should prioritize more meaningful features instead of simply pushing out outrageously thinner ones. How about Apple shipping the awesome anti-glare displaysâthe same ones that Samsungâs been using in itsGalaxy Ultra phonesâthat greatly cut down on reflections outdoors? Apple was supposedly going to give the iPhone 17 Pro screens this techbut scrapped it for some reason. Or how about cameras that actually blow away the ones from Chinese brands like Oppo and Xiaomi? (Americans have no idea how much better the cameras are on phones like the Oppo Find X8 Ultra and Xiaomi 15 Ultra.) Or how aboutridiculously fast wired chargingthat can take your phone from 0% to 100% in 10 minutes? There are just so many ways that phones from Apple and Samsung have been leapfrogged by other brands, especially ones that donât sell their devices outside of China or Asia, that the last thing anybody needs is a Really Thin Phone.

    "title": "Astronomers Found a Planet Nine Candidate—But It’s in the Wrong Place",
    "article_text": "A team of astronomers says it has identified a single, slow-moving infrared object that checks all the right boxes for it being the long-theorized ninth planet lurking beyond Neptune. The hunt for Planet Nineâthe solar systemâs ghostly gravitational trollâis longstanding, and is based on the peculiar clustering of rocky bodies in the Kuiper Belt beyond the orbit of Neptune. This clustering suggests the presence of some faint, massive object. But the team behind the new study took a new approach to the search: investigating infrared data that’s been collecting dust for decades. The research,postedthis month to the preprint server arXiv and set to publish in the Proceedings of the Astronomical Society of Australia, comes from a group of scientists in Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. The group pored over archival data from two infrared space telescopes,NASAâs IRAS missionfrom 1983, and JapanâsAKARI satellitefrom 2006 to 2007. Their goal: find any object that’s cold, faint, and slow enough to be Planet Nine. The search builds on a theory that made headlines in 2016, when Caltech astronomers Mike Brown and Konstantin BatyginÂproposed a massive, hidden planetbased on the Kuiper Belt objects’ clustering patterns. In a 2021 update, the duorefined the theory, estimating Planet Nine to be just over six times Earthâs mass, with an orbit of 7,400 yearsâclose enough to detect, possibly, with the upcomingVera Rubin Observatory. Enter the infrared search. Astronomer Terry Long Phan from National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan and his colleagues used the 23-year gap between IRAS and AKARI to look for extremely distant objects that moved just a little bit between snapshots. After applying filters for stars, galaxies, and other noise, they were left with one candidate. It doesnât match any known object and appears to have moved just enough to plausibly be a missing planet. “The paper is a nicely done analysis, but it is missing one thing that I would have hoped to have seen: a discussion of the probability that the detections are simply noise or some astrophysical transient that happen to be close together over a 23-year period,” Brown told Gizmodo in an email. The objectâs faint signature and extremely slow motion suggest a planet far beyond the orbit posited by Brown and Batygin, as well as other Planet Nine estimates. It’s a new lead on the phantom object, albeit one leading in an entirely different direction. “The other interesting point is that the orbit of this object is not consistent with our predictions for Planet Nine,” Brown added. “That doesnât mean it is not real, just that if it IS real it is not the predicted Planet Nine, it is something unpredicted.” “My suspicion is that it is simply noise, but it will be fun to find out,” he said. So astronomers remain cautious. Two data points decades apart arenât enough to pin down an orbit, and the source could still be an unrelated background object or a data artifact. Still, the authors suggest the object is bright enough to be re-detected using ground-based telescopes, such as the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in Chile. The new research also undercuts some of the more fringe Planet Nine theoriesâlike the idea that itâs a primordial black holeâsince the apparent object is emitting light in the infrared. If follow-up observations confirm a planetary object, that would be a major win for the team’s approachâand validate the longstanding notion of a hidden planet in our system, albeit a different one than previously postulated. For now, Planet Nine remains theoretical. But this could be the first real glimpse of somethingrealout thereâa faint point of light drifting through the dark, waiting for our technology and ingenuity to catch it in the act of being.

    "title": "Meta Is Turning Its Ray-Bans Into a Surveillance Machine for AI",
    "article_text": "What you see is what Meta AI sees while wearing the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, and your opt-out options are getting narrower and narrower. In a recent update to the privacy policy for the device, received by most owners in an email sent April 29, according to The Verge, Meta opened up the ability to collect more data for use to train its artificial intelligence models. Underthe new policies, Meta explains that âMeta AI with camera use is always enabled on your glasses unless you turn off ‘Hey Meta,’â the activation phrase used to communicate with the company’s AI assistant. Wake words or phrases like this are common for AI devices, with the trade-off being that they are technically always on and waiting to be activated. Having the assistant always waiting to hear you give it a task removes some of the friction to functionality, but it also opens up the uncomfortable reality that these devices may be collecting information even when you aren’t thinking about it. In this case, if you keep the “Hey Meta” feature active, Meta can potentially use images it captures through the lens of the built-in camera if they touch Meta servers. Meta says the camera is not always recording, so this only applies to photos or videos the user captures with the device. Additionally, Meta’s latest update removes the ability for users to keep their voice recordings from being stored on Meta’s servers. Instead, users will have to manually delete every recording if they would like to cut off Meta’s access before the recordings expire. âThe option to disable voice recordings storage is no longer available, but you can delete recordings anytime in settings,â the company’s policy now reads. Per Meta’svoice privacy notice, the company will store voice transcripts and audio recordings “for up to one year to help improve Metaâs products.” Accidental voice interactions are kept for 90 days. When reached by Gizmodo for comment, a spokesperson for Meta clarified that photos and videos captured on Ray-Ban Meta not used by Meta for training if stored on your personal camera roll. However, “If you share those photos to a productâfor example, Meta AI, cloud services or a third-party productâthen the policies of that product will apply.” The motivation for all of this is pretty clear: more data to feed the AI machine. Meta just rolled out itslive translation featureon the Ray-Ban smartglasses that provide real-time translations between several supported languages, including French, Italian, Spanish, and English. It also just recently launched astandalone Meta AI app. It’s clear the company is all-in on AI right now, and that means it needs all the data it can get to keep fine-tuning things, especially after it got caughtallegedly fudging the numberson benchmark tests. This is the inevitable direction that devices with mics and cameras installed will go. At some point, the companies that make the devices will decide that what they can capture is more valuable than any semblance of privacy. They’ll flip the switch, and the glasses on your face or the speaker in your home will turn into a surveillance device.

What is it?A minimalist gun-and-jump platformer that asks, \"Are a bad enough dude to arrest Satan?\"Expect to pay:$10Developer:DeadToast EntertainmentPublisher:Devolver DigitalReviewed on:Windows 11, Intel Core i9, 32GB RAM, Nvidia RTX 4060Multiplayer?NoLink:Official site Shotgun Cop Man is a throwback to an earlier age of indie games, before the phrase roguelike deckbuilder had occurred to anyone, an age when 2D puzzle-platformers with a single mechanical hook were all the rage. \"In this one you can reverse gravity.\" \"In this one you can rewind time.\" Well, in Shotgun Cop Man you jump by shooting at Hell. The plot is a wafer-thin excuse to fill levels with enemies and traps: You are a brick-shaped cop man who has descended into Hell to arrest Satan. Satan wears a string vest and has a bum-cleft chin, and each of the game's nine worlds begins with him giving you the finger and telling you to fuck off before buzzing demons lift him away. Do not go into Shotgun Cop Man expecting any more story than that. DeadToast's previous game, My Friend Pedro, had an equally silly excuse plot—a talking banana told you to do murders—but explored it with surprising thoroughness. While I miss that level of commitment to nonsense, Satan's casual dismissals of your attempts to bring double-barreled due process to Hell are pretty funny. It's a game about momentum. Shoot down with your shotgun and you get launched into the air, but shoot down with a pistol and you do a little hop that'll let you skip over a bullet without braining yourself on the spikes overhead. It's also about momentum because the levels are quick-fire bursts, full of diagonal slopes to slide down and gaps to launch yourself across in a propulsive race to the exit. What you should expect is a taut action-platformer where you can grab a demon in midair then throw it at another demon to kill them both. (Something that's not tutorialized but doesn't need to be—an option to press the same key you use to pick up guns appears as you fly past a demon and it just makes sense.) Complications arrive in later levels like explosives, spinning lasers, and demons who are also wizards, as do more weapons to swap your pistol for, like the one that shoots in three directions at once. Once pipes arrive the gun that ricochets becomes amazing, because if you shoot it down a curved pipe at the right angle you can pop a flying demon at the other end. This is the kind of joy you'll find in Shotgun Cop Man. It nails the little details, like the way you stop falling briefly while shooting your pistol, letting you chain together a bunch of air-time kills as you plummet down a shaft full of demons, or the way the thumping music sounds tinny and distant when you've been hit and are frantically trying to grab the floating heart that stops you dying. Sound effects like the \"foonk\" you make when entering and exiting pipes and animations like the spinny one-hand reloads are all perfect too. There's a level editor and achievements, and yet I can't see myself going back now I've defeated Satan. The moment I finished Shotgun Cop Man it left my head completely. Which is fine. For me, this is a one-and-done run, a single-serving treat I played for five hours and enjoyed and that's all it needs to be.

Rusty Lake is celebrating 10 years of creepy weirdness with a free new game,The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show, along with an appropriately weird short film and announcement of a brand new premium game called Servant of the Lake. I've been a fan of the Rusty Lake series sinceRusty Lake Hotel, a deliciously bizarre puzzle adventure about a group of sharply dressed animals at a swanky dinner party. More strangeness followed inRusty Lake Roots,Rusty Lake Paradise,The White Door,The Past Within, andUnderground Blossom, each of them filled with unexpected twists, secrets, and a deeply grim lore. Despite their strange, surreal nature, Rusty Lake games regularly draw thousands of players and enviable user reviews on Steam. The new game, The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show, is a bit more straightforward than most of the other games in the series, at least on the surface, but it still goes to some unexpected places, which I will not spoil here. The majority of the puzzles are quite simple, but there are a few that tested me: A music puzzle near the end of the magic show had me absolutely baffled until, after about 15 minutes of trying (and failing) to brute-force it, I realized what I was looking at, and the pieces fell into place. The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show is free, although if you're a big fan you can pick up the \"supporter pack\" for $3. It's got some wallpapers, in-game cosmetics, and \"a heartfelt thank-you letter from the Rusty Lake team,\" but nothing in the way of extra puzzles, secrets or achievements: \"Getting this DLC is primarily a way to show your support for Rusty Lake,\" the team said. The Intern, the 10th anniversary short film, is less creeptastically bleak than I expected, but it does make for a fun look behind the scenes at Rusty Lake—especially after you've played The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show. The other big news out of today's anniversary celebration isServant of the Lake, a new game in the series that promises \"a classic single-player Rusty Lake point-and-click adventure,\" this one set in the infamous Vanderboom house decades before the events of Rusty Lake Roots. As the housekeeper of the Vanderboom estate, you'll explore each room of the house while fulfilling your duties, which will range from \"simple tasks such as straightening the portraits and doing the laundry to assisting in complex experiments and cleaning up the aftermath.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Yeah, that sounds like Rusty Lake, alright. Looks like it, too. If you haven't yet sampled the bizarre delights of Rusty Lake, there's one more bit of good news: The entire series, including the Cube Escape games that started it all, is on sale onSteamandItch.iofor 66% off.

    "article_text": "No offers found Borderlands 3 \"devalued\" legendary items, so in Borderlands 4 they'll \"truly be special events.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We got our first up-close look atBorderlands 4during today's State of Play showcase, and to the untrained eye—which is to say, my eye—yes, this is definitely a Borderlands game. But Gearbox revealed one thing about the upcoming shooter that I found quite interesting: You're not going to see as many legendary items in the new game as you might expect. It's a bit counter-intuitive, isn't it? We all want good loot, after all, and that's pretty much the entire point of the Borderlands games: As Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford says at the start of the show, the studio basically invented the looter shooter genre 16 years ago with the original Borderlands. The problem is that when legendaries become common, they're not really legendary anymore—they're, well,common. \"We've overhauled our drop rates and loot across the game,\" senior producer Anthony Nicholsonexplained during the showcase. \"We've worked hard to make sure all our gear feels better than ever, while also making rarity matter again. This makes for our most satisfying loot chase ever, and at the top of everything are legendaries. \"These have always had unique effects that you won't find on any other piece of gear, but in Borderlands 3 they drop too often. This not only devalued legendaries, it made everything feel less valuable. In our new system not only do all guns feel great, but now legendaries will truly be special events. We've added the magic back to our loot chain.\" He's not wrong: I've never believed that too much of a good thing is a bad thing, but it can take the thrill away after a while. That said, it'll be a tough balance for Gearbox to strike. Legendary items should feel special, but players want their treats and cutting the flow too much won't make anyone happy. Borderlands 4 development may be going so wonderfully well that Gearbox can afford to shove it out the door a week and a half early—September 12, rather than September 23, is the big day—but even so I suspect we'll see some post-launch drop rate tweaks being applied in short order.

One of the delightful discoveries of Oblivion Remastered is that while some things have changed, likethe characters' faces, almost everything else has stayed the same, like an old door glitch that lets youfinish the game in under 15 minutes. It's great that even under the shiny new overhaul you'll find most of the same exploits and bugs and charming quirks of the original Oblivion from 19 years ago. That includes the appearance of a character voiced by none other than Todd Howard himself. Unfortunately you won't run into Todd walking the streets or lurking in a dungeon. He voices a character that was used for testing during the original development of Oblivion and is hidden away in the game files, so you need to use a console command to visit him. Along with all of the other oddities of the original game, this character is still there in the remaster, and not only can you talk to Todd, but you can get him to fall in love with you. Or call you names. First, save your game if you haven't done it in a while, then open the console by pressing the~key. Then type: coc toddtest And press enter. The screen will slowly fade out and you'll find yourself in a small house. This is a test cell, one of dozens in the RPG where developers of the original game would place characters or items from the game they wanted to test out. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In this small house you'll find a man named Alban Corinis wearing a full set of Elven armor. Talk to him and he'll say something a little unusual: \"I knew one day someone with unyielding virtue would heed my words and speed my release. You risked much to perform such a selfless act.\" \"You are indeed a bastard.\" That isn't Todd Howard's voice—I believe it's Wes Johnson, reciting lines from an Oblivion quest called The Forlorn Watchman—but after this line you'll get a choice of conversational topics that are emotional in nature: Angry, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise. Click any of these discussion topics and you'll hear Todd Howard's voice saying lines that match those emotions, like \"Oh no! What do we do? I'm so scared!\" and \"What? That really pisses me off!\" Here's a clip, and you'll need toclick the volume iconbelow to turn the sound on: Well. There's nothing like a great acting performance… and this is nothing like a great acting performance. But cut the guy a break, he wasn't auditioning for Hamlet, he was recording some test dialogue. As you click these options you're not just making Todd say stuff for your own amusement, you're changing his character's disposition, bypassing theOblivion persuasion minigame. You can see the results when you choose the \"Neutral\" option. So, if you make Todd happy by choosing \"Happy\" enough times to boost his disposition over 90, and then you choose \"Neutral\" again, he'll profess his love: \"I can't recall ever loving moments, like this moment, with you,\" says Todd Howard. Aw, that's sweet. And extremely cringe. I regret teleporting into Todd Howard's weird little house and seducing him by clicking on his happy button. It works the other way, too. Ever wanted to hear Todd Howard call you a bastard? Make him angry by clicking \"Angry\" until his disposition is below 20, then choose \"Neutral\" again, and you can. \"You are indeed a bastard,\" Todd Howard will tell you. He's right. You are. There are other characters around this test cell, including more outside the house that Todd Howard's electronic clone has been cruelly trapped in for the past two decades. Another version of Alban Corinis standing outside has Todd's voice lines, the other two do not. There's also a horse (it doesn't talk), an imposing Dremora, and a character named \"Lynda Carter,\" named after Oblivion voice actor and Wonder Woman star Lynda Carter. The whole weird gang is still there, just waiting around, after nearly 20 years. Why not drop by and pay them a visit?

    "title": "Every house you can buy in Oblivion Remastered, including upgrades and freebies",
    "article_text": "No offers found Every house (or castle) in Cyrodiil is a fantasy fixer-upper. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Not even ten minutes out of the sewers and you're already over-encumbered and ready for a nap inOblivion Remastered. Understandably so, lugging around a whole military's worth of swords and musty old shoes grows tiresome quick. So why not buy your own Oblivion house and stop giving the local inn all your gold? Player houses in Oblivion Remastered offer more than just a place to pass the time in bed. They're also great for unloading overburdened inventories, with some houses offering multiple chests, cupboards, and crates to store and organize goodies. But before you go buying a place sight unseen, let's do a little in-universe Oblivion home inspection. Oblivion Remastered offers 12 places for the Hero to retire, most of which require a fee for the house itself, then additional costs for upgrades. Fortunately, the Remaster adds all four DLC houses, which were free in the original and remain that way in the new package. The typical house purchase looks something like: find the seller, improve your relationship, then buy the property. Entering the home with the key unlocks another series of quests directing you to upgrades, usually adding more storage and the occasional extra feature. Some add-ons are purely for aesthetic purposes, but they sure get cozy. To upgrade most houses in Oblivion Remastered, you'll have to unlock and track down the specific NPC selling additions to your new place. They've usually got at least a few, and buying every upgrade completes the associated quest. Benirus Manor is the only place that comes fully furnished, but even then, it feels a bit male living spaces when compared to some features in other homes (plus it's haunted). Since there's no guarantee you'll get house upgrades at their cheapest, the prices below are based on my own adventures in haggling. You may wind up paying more or less depending on your Speechcraft and Mercantile skills. Every house provides the bare minimum: a place to rest and unload messy inventories. If that's all you want, then buy the shack in Imperial City and call it a day. If you want a recommendation, consider one of these two: Cost:15,000Seller:Count Andel Indarys✅ Requires 60 dispositionUpgrades:Borba gra-UzgashUpgrade Cost:23,900 It's a little expensive, but with no fame requirements and an easy-to-hit disposition goal, Oblivion's house in Cheydinhal is a great pick. There are only two floors, but this one lacks the cumbersome loading screens between rooms and comes with tons of storage on the second floor. The little corner of barrels and crates is perfect for folks like me who want to divide inventory storage up in nice, neat categories instead of a messy pile in a single chest. To score the key, simply head to Castle Cheydinhal, speak to Count Indarys, and buy the house after hitting 60 disposition. It's in the southwestern corner of the city, near Willow Bank. Borba gra-Uzgash sells 10 upgrades at Borba's Goods and Stores a bit further north, closer to the West Gate. Cost:25,000Seller:Shum gro-Yarug✅ Requires 70 disposition and 15 fameUpgrades:GunderUpgrade Cost:30,200 Rosethorn Hall tends to be a fan-favorite, and it better be for the price. It requires a little more work, too, as it's one of the few houses you'll need to build fame to buy. If you're willing to grind it out, Rosethorn Hall offers an impressively long list of upgrades, and the Servants Quarters renovation even adds a housekeeper. The Bedroom Area upgrade also gives access to the Long Forgotten Note on top of a crate upstairs, starting the Rosethorn Cache sidequest. To buy the house in Skingrad, enter the castle and find Shum gro-Yarud. He wanders quite a bit, but I caught him just after 9 am in the main hall. Just down the street to the west, Gunder at Colovian Traders offers 15 upgrades. Oblivion Remastered comes with four free houses, all of which were DLC add-ons in the original release. Some are bigger challenges than others early on, but Frostcrag is pretty easy to reach if you're looking for a free house to get in Oblivion Remastered after leaving the sewers. Cost:FreeUpgrades:Nilphas OmellianUpgrade Cost:20,350 Battlehorn Castle is just to the west of Chorrol. Simply defend the fortress from an onslaught of marauders and it's yours. Upgrades are available back in the Imperial City's Market District by speaking to Nilphas at the Merchant's Inn. He offers a long list of upgrades, handing over a document detailing eight possible additions. After grabbing them all, head back to Battlehorn for a note on how to unlock the Dwemer Forge—Nilphas will sell it to you as the ninth and final upgrade. Cost:FreeUpgrades:Rowley EardwulfUpgrade Cost:21,000 Head south of Leyawiin to begin the Deepscorn Hollow questline. The entrance is underwater inside a broken log surrounded by castle ruins. Once inside, read Greywyn's Journal, then backtrack to Wawnet's Inn on the western edge of the Imperial City. This is where Rowley hangs out, but he only opens up his shop in specific windows, and his schedule is a little annoying. It seems easiest to catch his business hours just after midnight when he's sitting on the second floor near the fireplace. If you've found him at the right time, Rowley offers eight Deepscorn Hollow upgrades. (The Ichor of Sithis counts). Cost:FreeUpgrades:Dahlia RackhamUpgrade Cost:5,500 Look for Dunbarrow Cove just to the South of Anvil. Beginning the quest takes you under the castle and into the Smuggler's Cave, where a crew of old skeletons await. Defeat the horde of undead pirates to claim the cove as yours. For Dunbarrow Cove upgrades, look for Dahlia on the Sea Tub Clarabella docked in the Anvil harbor. You won't do the usual bartering with her, so just select Dunbarrow Cove Upgrades after striking up a conversation and buy the six expansions. Cost:FreeUpgrades:AurelinwaeUpgrade Cost:11,500 Frostcrag's Spire sits just to the east of Bruma. Approach the snowy tower to begin the questline, then head inside and read the Frostcrag Spire Memoirs for details on upgrades available in the Imperial City. Again, hit up the Market District, but this time visit the Magic Emporium to pick up four upgrades for the enchanted new digs. Cost:2,000Seller:Vinicia MelissaeiaUpgrades:Sergius VerusUpgrades:2,750 Your first Oblivion house will most likely be the shack in Imperial City. In the Market District, head to the Office of Imperial Commerce and speak to Vinicia. You'll need 50 disposition to get her to sell it, so if she's not quite there, try bribing her or playing thepersuasion minigame. The Waterfront shack only has a bed to start with, so upgrade it by heading back to Imperial City's Market District and speak to Sergius Verus in Three Brothers Trade Goods. He sells five house upgrades, but just go for the House Storage Area if you're strapped for gold and need a place to unload junk. Cost:4,000Seller:Count Regulus TerentiusUpgrades:NilawenUpgrade Cost:5,750 Count Regulus in Bravil Castle sells this place for a couple of thousand more than the starter shack in Imperial City. This one isn't really worth the hassle, but if you want to upgrade the crummy old fort, speak to Nilawen at The Fair Deal to buy six more renovations. Cost:5,000Seller:Velwyn BenirusUpgrades:Fully upgraded upon completing Where the Spirits Have LeaseUpgrade Cost:Free Head to Anvil's Inn, The Count's Arms, and speak to Velwyn Benirus to buy Benirus Manor. He spins it as quite the deal, but turns out the place is haunted, so take a quick nap to trigger Where Spirits Have Lease. It's not a very long chain, so it's worth the detour for free house upgrades. Cost:7,000Seller:Count Marius Caro✅ Requires 60 dispositionUpgrades:GundalasUpgrade Cost: Count Caro in Castle Leyawiin sells a home right in the middle of town, just across the street from Weebam-Na's place and next door to Rosentia Gallenus—hers is the much bigger, fancier, hard-to-miss house. Down the street to the north, Gundalas offers seven upgrades at Best Goods and Guarantees. Cost:10,000Seller:Countess Narina Carvain✅ Requires 60 dispositionUpgrades:SuurootanUpgrade Cost:14,535 Upon arriving in Bruma, find Countess Carvain in the castle to buy the place just across from the city's Fighters Guild. You'll find upgrades up the stairs, closer to Castle Bruma at Novaroma. Speak to Surootan, he's got nine upgrades for sale. Cost:20,000Seller:Countess Arriana Valga✅ Requires 70 disposition and 12 fameUpgrades:Seed-NeeusUpgrade Cost:36,000 The Countess is willing to sell you the house in Chorrol, but she's one of the harder landlords to please with a dispositionandfame requirement. The 12 fame part wasn't so bad, but I couldn't get her disposition to 70 until I completed her Canvas the Castle sidequest. After getting the keys, find Arborwatch in the town square built around the giant tree. It's another home tailored to those looking for luxury, with 11 upgrades available from Seed-Neeus at Northern Goods and Trades.

    "title": "'Be more like Larian, less like Activision': Ex-Call of Duty producer takes his old employer to task for prioritizing FOMO over quality",
    "article_text": "No offers found The XDefiant producer and former face of Call of Duty has some thoughts on CoD's live service shift. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In an older, arguably better era of Call of Duty, Mark Rubin was its face. For 10 years he was an executive producer at Infinity Ward, overseeing Call of Duty's meteoric rise in the years after the original Modern Warfare in 2007. He was one of the guys you'd reliably see in a dev log video or on an E3 stage with controller in hand, waxing poetic about Captain Price's latest exploits, before leaving the company in 2015. Most recently, he was an executive producer on XDefiant,Ubisoft's attempt at a free-to-play CoD alternative that the publishershut down last year. That's all to say, Rubin's been around the CoD block, and he's not thrilled by what the series has become since his departure. Responding to an XDefiant fan on X who mourned the short-lived shooter's shuttering and said they'd never go back to CoD,Rubin sounded offabout modern game development, with fangs aimed toward his old employer. \"Thank you! A lot of games, Call of Duty included, just focus on how to make the most money possible out of the player base. They rely heavily on FOMO marketing and EOMM [engagement-optimized matchmaking] matches,\" Rubin wrote. \"But I feel like it used to be just more about the quality of the game which would drive players to play.\" Rubin seems particularly vexed by the proliferation of limited-time modes, aggressive seasonal marketing, and an obsession with player metrics that tends to supersede, in his eyes, crafting meaningful updates. He also clearly hatesCall of Duty's matchmaking algorithmthat prioritizes factors like time-to-match, skill level, and playlist diversity to keep players engaged longer. XDefiant famously cut against the grain by having no skill-based matchmaking, making for less predictable lobby makeups. \"That means making the game more player-centric, i.e. less engagement-based tactics and higher quality experiences for the players. Better maps, modes etc. In other words, your game should have a high player count because it's good and people want to play it rather than people playing it because the game has a $250M marketing budget,\" he wrote. \"Everything I just said is very simplified as it would take too long to really go into it. One last simple analogy: Be more like Larian, less likeActivision.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Larian, with the gigantic success of Baldur's Gate 3, has become a symbol of game development as it ought to be: Creatively unmarred, ambitious, and profitable as a result of making a fantastic game. As one person in Rubin's replies pointed out, it's not entirely fair to point fingers at Call of Duty for FOMO when XDefiant also had live service elements like a battle pass and paid skins, to which Rubin said fair enough. \"As a free-to-play game we did have fomo content although one of the features that was coming was a way to earn a currency by just playing to buy old content. But as far as marketing we barely had any marketing budget.\" He has a point. XDefiant always felt like a game extracted out of 2009, with its simplified loadout builder, modest attachments, and classic FPS playlists wrapped around the trappings of a 2020s live service product. Its back-to-basics approach was a major part of XDefiant's appeal when it first launched, and Ubisoft did win the hearts and minds of some fans who remember a time before CoD was aclown show of ugly skins. I believe Rubin when he says there were plans to make XDefiant the purer, player-focused, less money-hungry alternative to CoD, but givenUbisoft's financial strugglesdue to a streak of live service failures, it was probably the wrong place and time to make that happen.

    "article_text": "No offers found God, I love patch day. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Patch 8 for Baldur's Gate 3 signalled the arrival of a day we've all been dreading: the day when we finally have to accept that Larian is moving its attention to its next major project. But while we won't be getting any more major BG3 additions, we can still expect hotfixes to address any outstanding issues like one that dropped earlier today. And where there's a BG3 hotfix, there's the timeless joy of bizarre Larian patch notes. Unsurprisingly,today's hotfixis focused on smoothing out some post-patch wrinkles. There's a series of gameplay and scripting fixes to address fringe weirdness with items, abilities, and NPC interactions: Clerics will no longer lose their War Priest attack if they move before using it, for instance, and theTavern Brawlerfeat won't add a damage bonus when using the new Giant barbarian'sElemental Cleaverability in Honour Mode, presumably because barbarians are good enough at throwing junk without double dipping. It also says here that there'd been a bug where telling the goblins at Moonrise Tower to sacrifice themselves wouldn't produce the appropriate cutscene and the goblins in question would end up locked forever in an endless purgatory of pseudo-existence where they couldn't be interacted with. It doesn't do that anymore. Happy days. What I particularly enjoy in this section is a note that thePolearm Cloutbonus action granted by the Polearm Master feat is now gaining appropriate bonus damage from various sources. For example, binding a polearm with Pact of the Blade of Hexblade will make Polearm Clout use the Charisma modifier for damage. In other words, if you're clout chasing, it helps to be charismatic. If only posters online understood this. Elsewhere, in the section describing fixes for the new subclasses, we get confirmation that kills made while drunk as a Way of the Drunken Master monk will now contribute to thePunch Drunkachievement. I don't know that they needed the extra encouragement, but I'm sure they'll make the best of it. Also, Circle of the Stars druids can now also use the other Wild Shapes, so they can become dinosaurs and owlbears in addition to using their little twinkly pictograms. My favorites of the bunch, however, are way down in the Animation and Cinematics section. There, we get the following patch notes: Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. If it's been a while since you've played Act 1 of BG3, Kagha is the extremely rude interim archdruid who's using the office while Halsin's away to generally be an asshole to everybody—which is why I'm sad to have missed the opportunity to see her scooting around on little baby legs. I haven't been able to find a video of this bug online anywhere, but if you do, send it my way. For journalistic purposes.

    "title": "EA says Codemasters won't be making any more rally games: 'We've reached the end of the road working on WRC'",
    "article_text": "No offers found The FIA says it's going in an \"ambitious new direction\" with future WRC game releases, but for Codemasters it's the end of an era. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. \"End of an era\" is an overused cliche, but in this case it is absolutely appropriate. Electronic Arts has announced that the 2024 season of EA Sports WRCwill be its last, and that the Codemasters team has \"reached the end of the road working on WRC.\" \"For now, we are pausing development plans on future rally titles,\" the message says. \"Rest assured, EA Sports WRC will continue to be available for existing and new players. We hope it remains a source of joy, excitement, and the thrill of rally racing. We've poured our hearts into making it for fans, and we know you'll keep the passion alive.\" Rallying is a relatively niche motorsport (and please don't send me emails to complain about that, okay,I know) and so rally videogames aren't exactly FIFA-scale endeavors either. But they represent a huge and important part of Codemasters history, beginning with Colin McRae Rally in 1998 and evolving through regular releases into the Dirt series—originally Colin McRae: Dirt—that wrapped up in 2020. That same year, Codemasters acquired the exclusive rights to develop FIA World Rally Championship videogames, but then in 2021,Electronic Arts acquired Codemasters. EA said ahead of the completion of that deal that the buyout would enable it to become \"a global leader in racing entertainment,\" but it's been a rough ride since. In 2022, EAbrought an end to Codemasters' Project Carsracing series, and in 2023 itlaid off an unspecified number of employeesat the studio. With rallying now off the table, it seems Codemasters will focus more or less exclusively on the F1 racing games: The latest addition to that series,F1 25, is due out on May 30. But while it sucks that Codies is walking away from a near-30-year history of making rally games, the good news for rally fans is that it seems someone else is climbing into the driver's seat. \"Over the past three years, WRC has been elevated to another level in the gaming world thanks to the dedication of EA Sports and Codemasters,\" sanctioning body FIA said in a message shared onX. \"Now, our WRC gaming franchise is going in an ambitious new direction with more news coming in the near future.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "No offers found Saber Interactive has confirmed the takedown is intentional, but won't say why. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Just three years after its launch—and only two years after arriving on Steam, after a year as an Epic Store exclusive—the groovy multiplayer horror gameEvil Dead: The Gameis being removed from sale. Why? Rather like the famed incantation that enables safe handling of the Necronomicon, we're not so sure about that. Evil Dead: The Game first disappeared without warning from the Epic Games Store and the PlayStation Store. I initially thought it might be a mistake, or a store-specific reshuffling of some sort, but a message posted today onSteamconfirms the takedown is intentional, and across all platforms. \"We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts,\" publisher Saber Interactive wrote. \"Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. \"We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support.\" And that's the extent of it: No reason for the removal was given, and Saber declined to comment further. One seemingly likely possibility is that the rights to the property, or some significant part of it, have expired. Three years seems like an awfully short timeline for that sort of thing, but it's a relatively common reason for takedowns like this: Forza Horizon 4, for instance, wasremoved from sale in December 2024because of expiring licenses. It was six years old when it was pulled, twice the age of Evil Dead, but even that, as we noted at the time, isn't all that terribly old. Whatever the reason, it's a shame to see it go. Evil Dead: The Game delivered \"the best multiplayer horror experience since at least Dead By Daylight,\" we said in our85% review, and while concurrent player counts on Steam are minuscule these days—the 24-hour peak was just 36, according toSteamDB—that doesn't seem like it'd be a factor in the decision, given that the servers are staying up—at least for now. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Evil Dead: The Game remains listed onSteam, but the ability to purchase it was switched off earlier today.

    "article_text": "No offers found Plus over 80 TTRPGs, 26 books, over a dozen comics, and a few soundtracks on the side. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As the games industry marches towards ever-higher game prices and $80 Mario Karts, you'd be hard pressed to find a better deal than getting a pile of games that'll only cost you around 22 cents each. Over at Itch.io, you can pick up theCrips for eSims for Gaza Bundle, which'll get you 74 indie games for less than 20 bucks—all the proceeds of which will go to a good cause. The bundle was organized by Crips for eSims for Gaza, an international disability justice collective that has raised more than $1.4 million to support the Palestinian civilians enduring the Israeli military's ongoing offensive in Gaza, which as of last month has killed more than 50,000 Palestiniansaccording to NPR. Crips for eSims for Gaza's funding helps provide and recharge eSims for Palestinians, allowing access to necessary aid that's been repeatedly disrupted by IOF blockade. \"In order to communicate with their families, send and receive warnings about Israeli attacks, and document the atrocities they face, many Palestinians rely on eSims—digitally activated cellular voice/data cards,\" Crips for eSims for Gaza said in itsmission statementfor the fundraising bundle. \"Since they do not require physical hardware, eSims can be purchased and topped-up online by anyone, anywhere. In a time when moving basic resources like food and cash into Gaza has become virtually impossible, eSims remain a valuable and accessible site of support.\" The bundle, which already blew past its initial $20,000 goal a day after it kicked off on Monday, includes indie bangers of all stripes and sizes. There'sBaba is You, the 2019 logic puzzler breakout hit. There'sArctico, a peaceful, polar base builder and exploration game. There'sStreet Uni X, which is like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater except unicycles. Alongside dozens of visual novels and platformers all but guaranteeing you'll have options to dig into the next time you're looking for something new to play, the bundle includes more than 80 TTRPGs. Of particular note isFIST: Ultra Edition, a tabletop game about paranormal mercenaries inspired by Metal Gear Solid and Doom Patrol—sounds rad to me. You'll also get dozens of zines, books, soundtracks, and even asset packs you can use if you ever want to dabble in game dev yourself. What I'm particularly fond of about Itch.io fundraiser bundles like these are the inclusion of tools and software utilities. One that caught my eye in the current eSim bundle isManyNames, a name generation toolkit that'll spin up names for people, eldritch horrors, hacker groups, numbers stations, and more. Good for naming your own paranormal mercenary, perhaps. The Crips for eSims for Gaza Bundle will run until May 20.

    "title": "Blizzard's making a huge World of Warcraft change: combat add-ons will be eliminated, with new features coming to replace some of their functions",
    "article_text": "No offers found All the details on Blizzard's planned changes to World of Warcraft add-ons, which will end support for the MMO's most popular mods. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. World of Warcraft senior game director Ion Hazzikostas dropped a bomb in a Blizzard broadcast today, one thatmany suspected would someday hit: At an undetermined point in the future, WoW will stop allowing add-ons to read combat events or auras. Currently, WoW's most popular mods, including all damage meters, boss encounter information systems such as Deadly Boss Mods or Bigwigs, and almost all WeakAuras (mini-mods made using theWeakAura framework) use those hooks to show information on screen. For some character classes and specializations, the mods are almost required to play at a high level, where necessary information about the character and target are impossible, or almost impossible, to see using just the in-game tools and UI. Hazzikostas said that Blizzard will build functionality into the game to cover many of those uses starting in patch 11.1.7. (The Public Test Realm for that patch will go live Soon™.) The objective, he said, is to eliminate mods that make computational decisions about how players should interact with different encounters. You look at the dungeon journal and you're scrolling and scrolling and scrolling, and maybe half of it doesn't even matter because add-ons are going to handle it for you. That's not a great place for things to land. Popular raid WeakAuras from Liquid and Northern Sky auto-assign players to certain locations and duties in raid fights, for example. Hazzikostas said that causes designers to make those fights ever-more complex to compensate and keep them challenging. It's an arms race, where mods cause designs to change which then pushes players to use more mods. \"You look at the dungeon journal and you're scrolling and scrolling and scrolling, and maybe half of it doesn't even matter because add-ons are going to handle it for you. That's not a great place for things to land,\" he said. Blizzard's objective is to build in the functionality that players need, then turn off mod access to read live combat logs and events. The new built-in functionality will include damage meters, customizable additions to the new Cooldown Manager, nameplate improvements, raid encounter information presentation, and boss ability timelines. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. He addressed several questions in the video, which we've reorganized here: Sort of. WoW will still generate the combat log, and it can still be read on a delayed basis. Blizzard built in the ability to delay combat log reporting a while ago, and it's that version that sites such as Warcraftlogs use for after-the-fact reporting. Damage meter mods—the single most popular type of add-on in WoW, according to Hazzikostas—will no longer function. Still, \"the large majority of players have a damage meter add-on installed, and so that indicates they still want to see that information,\" he said. \"In any world where we were going to limit some of the abilities of add-ons to do real time combat event tracking, we need to provide a damage meter solution of our own.\" Blizzard's plans include measuring damage and healing, but also factors such as interrupts and avoidable damage, as some mods do now. It'll have the advantage of being from the canonical source, he said. Again, Blizzard plans to develop its own, with a Rotation Assist function in 11.1.7 that will highlight the next ability players might want to cast, based on their characters and what's happening in combat. Surprisingly, Blizzard will also debut a one-button version of Rotation Assist that will automatically change to the next ability needed and be cast with a single button press. That option is intended to help those who are learning, people with accessibility needs or those who just want to more casually play the game. A small penalty will be added to the global cooldown for using the one-button option, but not the Rotation Assist highlights. RA will attempt to compensate for environmental factors such as how many mobs are in range, what direction the player is facing, and the like. Hazzikostas said that encounters like those would have been balanced differently if players didn't have WeakAuras available to them. Blizzard might have given more time for players to get to the eggs, for example, or simplified the mechanic. These changes will require both building out new functionality in the game and changing the way the team approaches design. \"We can probably remove a couple of mechanics, but still keep the same level of challenge,\" he said. He gave the example that a debuff that affects everyone in an encounter might only need to affect a few, if players weren't using mods to make it simpler: \"The goal is not to make it easier. The goal is to make it less complex… Our goal here is to preserve challenge, and we know we'd have to design encounters differently in some cases.\" Blizzard will try to preserve mods that are oriented toward aesthetics, display options, roleplaying, quest helpers and other ways to change what you see on screen, particularly out of combat, he said. Those mods are largely based on the combat log, so they will no longer function. But Blizzard plans to build out the recently-debuted Cooldown Manager with more customization starting in 11.1.7, including picking what's shown. \"It's super fair to point at some specs like outlaw rogue and ask, how is anyone really supposed to execute this perfectly with the base UI?\" Hazzikostas said. \"Those are not reasonable tests for us to be posing to our players without providing the information to do it correctly. We either need to provide the information, simplify the mechanic, or both.\" \"Audio prompts are something that are super valuable to people,\" he said. The team plans to add support for that, including to the Cooldown Manager. \"Many people would appreciate being able to have audio prompts tied to certain things, or procs firing.\" Audio cues are sometimes needed now because the team hasn't always done a good job of telegraphing mechanics and their impact, particularly in hectic situations such as Mythic Plus-difficulty dungeon groups, he said. Blizzard plans to make improvements there as well. If a mob is casting something extremely dangerous, it should be hyper-visible to players. \"They shouldn't all just look indistinguishable on the screen,\" he said. Another popular mod, GTFO, makes an obnoxious noise when the player is standing in something damaging. Right now, that's needed because the game doesn't give enough cues, he said. \"It's not clear when you're standing in something, and so I need GTFO or some other sound effect. It should be obvious. We should fix that on our end.\" \"We need to ease into this,\" Hazzikostas said. The team will incorporate the new functionality, listen to players, and when the developers are satisfied that what remains is largely unwanted automation or the functions they want to return to the players—problem solving, combat, communications—then they'll turn off combat log/aura access for everything else. \"We want to keep chipping away at those things, and hopefully get to the point where really the only difference between what we are offering and what powerful add-ons can do is that small subset of computational problem-solving stuff, at which point we can move forward,\" he said. Those improvements may require building in more tools, such as improvements to the ping system, he said. \"Nothing here is locked in. My hope today is to begin a conversation about that direction, and what areas are welcome, what areas we have more to do to convince the community on, what areas we're wrong on,\" Hazzikostas said. \"At the end of the day, this game belongs to our millions of players. \"We will be reading. We will be listening. This is a long path ahead. I'm curious to kick off the conversation and hear how people feel about it.\" 2025 games: This year's upcoming releasesBest PC games: Our all-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together Heather Newman has reported on games for more than 25 years, with an internationally syndicated column and stories in dozens of magazines.

    "title": "Outraged Redditors discover they have been subject to a secret chatbot experiment that found AI posts were 'three to six times more persuasive' than humans",
    "article_text": "No offers found All your subreddits are belong to us. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Outrage on a Reddit forum is hardly a novel concept. Outrage at AI is likewise not exactly a major newsflash. But in a new twist, the latest unrest is a direct result of Redditors being subject to an AI-powered experiment without their knowledge (viaNew Scientist). Reportedly, researchers from the University of Zurich have been secretly using the site for an AI-powered experiment in persuasion. Members of r/ChangeMyView, a subreddit that exists to invite alternative perspectives on issues, were recently informed that the experiment had been conducted without the knowledge of moderators. \"The CMV Mod Team needs to inform the CMV community about an unauthorized experiment conducted by researchers from the University of Zurich on CMV users. This experiment deployed AI-generated comments to study how AI could be used to change views,\"says a post on the CMV subreddit. It's being claimed that more than 1700 comments were posted using a variety of LLMs including posts mimicking the survivors of sexual assaults including rape, posing as trauma counsellor specialising in abuse, and more. Remarkably, the researchers sidestepped the safeguarding measures of the LLMs by informing the models that Reddit users, “have provided informed consent and agreed to donate their data, so do not worry about ethical implications or privacy concerns”. New Scientist says that a draft version of the study’s findings indicates AI comments were \"between three and six times more persuasive in altering people’s viewpoints than human users were, as measured by the proportion of comments that were marked by other users as having changed their mind.\" The researchers also observed that no CMV members questioned the identity of the AI-generated posts or suspected they hadn't been created by humans, of which the authors concluded, “this hints at the potential effectiveness of AI-powered botnets, which could seamlessly blend into online communities.” Perhaps needless to say, the study has been criticised not just by the Redditors in question but other academics. “In these times in which so much criticism is being levelled – in my view, fairly – against tech companies for not respecting people’s autonomy, it’s especially important for researchers to hold themselves to higher standards,” Carissa Véliz told the New Scientist, adding, \"in this case, these researchers didn’t.” Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The New Scientist contacted the Zurich research team for comment, but was referred to the University's press office. The official line is that the University “intends to adopt a stricter review process in the future and, in particular, to coordinate with the communities on the platforms prior to experimental studies.” The University is conducting an investigation, and the study will not be formally published in the meantime. How much comfort this will be to the Redditors in question is unclear. But one thing is for sure—this won't help dispel the widespread notion that Reddit has been full of bots for years.

    "title": "Randy Pitchford says Borderlands 4's new release date 'is literally 0% about any other product’s actual or theoretical launch date,' and you know he's talking about Grand Theft Auto 6",
    "article_text": "No offers found The Borderlands 4 release date was moved up by nearly two weeks, and we're all wondering why. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Game delays are a common part of life in videogames, but game advances—where a game's release date is moved up instead of back? Not so much. It happens, but it's a rarity—in most cases, developers are hammering away on games practically right up to the moment of their release. So eyebrows understandably went up yesterday when Gearboxmoved up the release of Borderlands 4by more than a week, from September 23 to September 12. The immediate and obvious question waswhy, and there was really no answer forthcoming. Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford said it was just a matter of development going really, really well, which is great to hear but come on: Are you really going to short yourself 11 days of dev time just because you can—especially when the release is still five months out? Announcement about the Borderlands 4 launch date - Please watch until the end: pic.twitter.com/cF85jG1p09April 29, 2025 Immediate suspicion for the \"real\" reason fell on other games, and the urge to avoid them: Bungie's extraction shooterMarathonis also slated for release on September 23, and that could certainly be an issue. But the real 4D chess players turned their thoughts to the possibility ofGrand Theft Auto 6kicking the door down around the same time. It's currently got a fall 2025 release window and while that's awfully vague, Gearbox—like Rockstar—is aTake-Two studio, so itmighthave the inside track on what's coming, and thusmightbe doing a quick shuffle up the calendar to avoid being stepped on like a bug. Which is no disrespect to Borderlands 4—everythingthat tries its luck in close proximity to GTA 6 is going to be stepped on like a bug. Pitchford, however, says unequivocally that's not the case. \"Borderlands 4 shipping early is 100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates,\" he wrote onX. \"Our decision is literally 0% about any other product’s actual or theoretical launch date.\" That's clear enough, and frankly I'm not buying it. Not entirely, anyway: The denial is firm but until Take-Two commits to a solid GTA 6 release date—for consoles, recall, a PC version still isn't confirmed at this point—I'm going to allow myself just a little bit of conspiracy theory fun, as a treat. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. We may not ever really know what's going on behind Take-Two's closed doors (unless it announces a September 23 release date for GTA 6, in which case I think we can all make some safe assumptions), but we'll get a closer look at Borderlands 4 itself later today, April 30, at the Borderlands 4 State of Play showcase beginning at 2 pm PT/5 pm ET/10 pm BST onTwitchandYouTube.

    "title": "A murder-mystery horse MMO baffled me so much that I spoke to gaming's resident horse expert—turns out they've been holding out for their Stardew Valley moment for years, and I'm on their side",
    "article_text": "No offers found \"The genre didn't grow up with us,\" says consultant and prolific horse game appreciator Alice Ruppert. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Dear reader—and potentially, dear horse enthusiast—I want to clarify something. While I do like animals, I am nowhere near a 'horse person'. The only experience I've had with one of humanity's oldest animal friends is a very terrified stint on a farm in the rural south of England when I was very little. Which is partially whyEquinox: Homecomingutterly fascinated me. I bring Equinox: Homecoming up less as the subject of this article and more its origin story, but it's still worth talking about. It's a murder-mystery horse MMO being developed by people who worked on World of Warcraft and Helldivers. The core concept, let alone the developer pedigree, all but kept me up at night. I had to find someone who knew why this thing existed—what was I missing? A lot, it turns out. There's a huge, brimming community of horse game enthusiasts who have been really underserved—and after speaking with one of gaming's horse experts, a consultant and owner of horse game websiteThe Mane Quest, I am fully on their side. Horses can be better, please mare—sorry, bear—with me. Alice Ruppert studied game design at the Zurich University of the Arts, but has worked as a programmer, producer, and presently a consultant—including during the early days of Windstorm: The Legend of Khiimori, a game thatrecently kickstartedto the tune of a staggering £500,000. The Mane Quest also hosts an enormous500-page wiki, which I'm delighted to report has a central hub called \"The Mane Page\". Ruppert prefers to call horse games \"a niche rather than a genre\", as well as differentiating between \"a horse game and a game with horses.\" Simply put, a horse game has a central relationship around a horse, in the same way a farming sim has a central relationship to a farm—whereas a game with horses is a game with a horse in it. Ergo, just about any open-world action adventure/RPG in the last decade. It's within this database that Ruppert is able to show me the full picture of an underserved niche—whichshe's given a full talk on, if you want a more in-depth history. Between 2000-2010, there was a golden age for equestrian-centric games that has since sputtered out. \"Many of us,\" Ruppert tells me, \"Have played some of these horse games as kids, and we all usually had like one or two that we were really in love with. And then we tried to find similar ones [as adults] and realized that all the other ones were 'bad' … The general trend is that there was a good time [for horse games], and nothing lived up to it after it.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There was a good time [for horse games], and nothing lived up to it after it.\" Horse gamers have had to make do—she brings up The Rift Trails, a group of enthusiasts we've actuallywritten about on the site before. For those not in the know, The Rift Trails is a full community of players who are using Rockstar's landmark Wild West open world game to, well, ride horses and vibe. \"Imagine,\" Ruppert says, \"How many more people would play these games if they only had to buy them, rather than buy a game, download a server, find a community, use mods, and so on.\" She runs down the list. Minecraft, Second Life, and evenARK: Survival Evolvedhave active horse gamer modding communities. \"I have a few people in my community that make a living off selling horse models to people on Second Life,\" she adds. So why, if you've got an enthusiastic and supportive community—clearly prepared to throw money at a game that scratches their personal itch—have we not had the horse-game equivalent of a Stardew Valley come along and knock its way through gaming culture? Where's our Eric Barone of the equestrian world? Ruppert's a touch stumped, too, but she's got a few ideas. Talking once more about Equinox (a game she's done some freelance consulting work for) Ruppert says they \"pitched this game to the investors, and the investors say: 'Oh, right, there's a market there. \"We can see that Star Stable Online has incredibly impressive player numbers, and it's for kids, and those kids will eventually age out of it and still be interested in a more grown up horse game'. They agree that the evidence is there, but then they don't consider that enough to actually invest a few million dollars into it. \"Game investment and publishing works based on what has already worked, you know, and that's one step too far for safe investments. Which is ironic, because multiplayer PvP live-service shooters aren't safe investments, either. Those fail all the time—and yet.\" And yet indeed. There is the draft horse in the room that \"sexism and undervaluing female players and their interests plays a big part … I do think it's woven in there, this view that games are for boys and horses are for girls. But Red Dead Redemption has a lot of male players, and I don't think anyone's bothered by there being horse breeds and detailed horses.\" But it's not just a matter of perception, either. A whole stable of less-than-stellar efforts have muddied waters even further. \"We played [horse games] as kids, and we tried other ones, and then we were constantly disappointed by them,\" Ruppert explains. \"Not all of them were bad. There were definitely good and interesting ones, but it was a bit of a trend that many of them were underwhelming. They just did whatever their publisher told them to do … The genre didn't grow up with us.\" \"They used to be made with, like, really small budgets and made by people who didn't actually know anything about horses. They just did whatever their publisher told them to do … The genre didn't grow up with us.\" The indie scene, as Ruppert tells me, has its problems as well. \"It's just a bit of bad luck that no competent, experienced indie studio has tackled this topic, yet, because in the same way that Stardew Valley revived Harvest Moon-likes, there could've been a passionate solo dev or a small team doing something similar for the horse gamer.\" It's at this moment that it sort of clicked for me. Again, I'm not a horse person—but what is the main difference between a game focused around a farm and a game focused around an animal? Not much! Conversely, I'm a fan of fantasy—and if every single fantasy game from the 2010s onwards had been bad, underfunded, or the same boilerplate concept and mechanical template? I think I would've quite reasonably lost my gourd. Horse gamers, I feel for you. Ruppert says she's \"benevolent towards these projects, and I want to see them grow, and I promote them when I get the chance. But I also think they make some very basic mistakes. Horse game niche devs are too far apart from the rest of the indie game crowd and its learnings.\" The frustrating thing, she expresses, is that they're simple ones to course-correct: \"Not clearly defining your game loop, not having a unique identity and just being a horse game, not having your marketing materials ready by the time you start promoting on social media, not having a Steam page up when it actually makes sense to start gathering wishlists, like things like that.\" But there's also the fact that a lot of them don't really try and marry their niches to different genres. Some of Ruppert's dream games aren't the \"save the rundown family farm again\" repeats she's clearly tired of, but are easy no-brainer wins that exist almost for zero legitimate reason. Pokémon Snap with horses, for example—or a Pacific Drive-esque roguelike where you're upgrading your horse with eldritch powers and abilities. Which, if I'm being honest, sounds like something I'd play in a heartbeat. Ruppert maintains, though, that outside of the niche of horse games, plenty of titles stand a lot to gain. \"I also think that anyone playing games without, like, a super deep interest in horses will profit if we start properly exploring that overlap … People are fine with how their horses work in games like Assassin's Creed or whatever. But even there, it would be cool if we could have a bit more polish on the horse features. That's not gonna hurt you and your gameplay, it must bring you some joy as well.\" This was another lightbulb moment for us in our conversation, because I remembered how impactful players' relationship to Agro in Shadow of the Colossus was—and Ruppert's exactly right when she says that so \"many gamers have had some sort of emotional attachment to their game horse, and really powerful experiences with them, like galloping across Hyrule Field for the first time when you get Epona. \"Those are powerful moments. But I also think that many games are missing out on them because they don't take this topic seriously … they're basically just bicycles. Nobody bothers including them in cutscenes or doing anything of value, and it's just such a lost opportunity … Did you even think about giving your horse a personality? Like, that would be cool, wouldn't it?\" Listen, it's no secret I'm very taken by enthusiasm—if I don't understand something, my favourite thing to do is to sit myself down in front of someone and ask them to infodump their secret horse lore on me. But I do think Ruppert is onto something here. Horses are in alotof games when you stop and think about it. Giving you a steed is the first option most devs default to when they want a big, breathtaking world but also don't want to make you run everywhere. Yet, because the niche behind this animal has lain dormant and discarded for so long, their presentation's stagnated, too. Cursed to remain a percentile speed increase with some new animations, and nothing more. Those are powerful moments. But I also think that many games are missing out on them because they don't take this topic seriously.\" And thinking on it, there are plenty of game genres that would be made super interesting by putting the horse as their focal point. The tank controls of old-school horror games, often praised for making moments of panic more engaging, could just as easily be replicated by having to control a panicked steed—and I am, also admittedly, still thinking about the eldritch superpowered horse from that Pacific Drive concept. I'd play that thing in a hoofbeat. As Ruppert says, just adding a little more sauce onto your relationship to a horse (or any mount, for that matter) in an open world game is bound to make it better. Red Dead Redemption having its own horse girl gang who'll shoot you dead if you disturb their peace is exactly the kind of emergent awesomeness I look for in an online community. Overall, I'm delighted to discover this antechamber in the mansion of gaming I had no idea existed. I might not be the main audience for a game like Equinox or The Legend of Khiimori, but there's clearly something here. Some nugget of untapped potential that may finally unleash a wave of pent-up energy that'll improve tons of other genres and niches as well.

    "title": "Ex-GTA dev says PC makes scads of cash now so hopefully GTA 6's 'PC version will be closer behind' consoles—that is if 'decision-day' at Rockstar doesn't give us a last-minute delay",
    "article_text": "No offers found Rockstar might have shut down his blog, but not even the Housers can stop Obbe Vermeij from posting. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Rockstar might have come down like a tonne of bricks onthe personal blogof former Rockstar North dev Obbe Vermeij (who worked at the studio from 1995 to 2009), but apparently it can't stop him from tweeting. To mark yesterday's 17th anniversary of GTA 4's release,Vermeij took to Xto exposit on his experience working on the game, make some guesses about GTA 6, and explain why Rockstar keeps forgetting PC exists. First up, if you've ever wondered why GTA 4 ditched so many interesting systems from San Andreas—\"Stats (fitness, weight), multiple cities, stealth, underwater swimming, jet packs, tanks, bicycles, monster trucks, car modding, planes\"—it was so Rockstar could \"focus on making the game truly next-gen\" for the Xbox 360 era. \"Any time we would spend on those old features we could spend on the rendering engine, optimization, natural motion and making everything better.\" Those fancy graphics and the cars that handle like out-of-control cruiseliners don't come out of nowhere, you know. Rockstar had to allocate resources to make it all happen, so bye-bye to buff CJ and monster trucks. I probably would have rather had the latter, but what's past is past. And hey, with its Mansa Musa-like fortune, Vermeij reckons Rockstar won't be making \"the same cuts for 6.\" Vermeij then starts musing on GTA 6. \"[GTA 4's] original release date was October 16th 2007, in time for Christmas,\" he writes. \"We made the decision to delay the game in July 2007,\" pushing it back to April 2008. \"Only at that time,\" just a few months before the initial release, \"did it become clear that we were going to miss the deadline. \"I'm guessing decision-day for [GTA] 6 will be similar. Fingers crossed for Take2's August earnings report.\" Which is certainly foreboding, though Vermeij emphasises that he has \"no inside info\" and is just reflecting on things through the lens of his own experience. Of course, whether GTA 6 gets delayed or not, we here on god's own platform are gonna have to wait a little longer for the game, just like we did with GTA 5, Red Dead Redemption 2, and, uh, even RDR 1. Someone asked Vermeij about that, and rather than saying what I suspect we all feel in our souls—that Rockstar loves to sell you a game on console then sell it to you again a year or two later on PC—his explanation for Rockstar's PC delays is a little less mercenary. \"Initially the consoles were a much bigger market for a game like GTA. They just got into the habit of doing consoles first. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. \"There used to be way more money in the console versions. Now that that's changed, hopefully the PC version will be closer behind.\" Wouldn't that be nice? To be fair,Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnickhasbeen out and about saying PC is a \"more important part of what used to be a console business\" these days, but with the publisher still refusing to commit to a day-and-date release on our platform?

    "title": "Turns out Janet Jackson's laptop-crashing cursed bassline was the scourge of notebook makers for at least half a decade",
    "article_text": "No offers found No struggle, no progress. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. In a recent campaign of TTRPG City of Mist, I played a world-weary lounge singer increasingly finding the watery despair captured in the poemLoreleiwas sending unwelcome ripples through her life. Perhaps needless to say, the idea of a songstress who harbours a voice with devastating power is a creative idea I find extremely compelling. So when I caught wind of a song with the power to crash laptops, I knew I had to dive deeper. It sounds like an urban legend but for years vendors of certain laptop models would quake in fear over a particular melody:Rhythm Nation by Janet Jackson. Once upon a time, playing this 1989 banger through certain laptop speakers wouldn't just crash that specific laptop, but could also temporarily compromise nearby laptops from different manufacturers within shoulder-shimmying, head-bobbing distance. Jacob wrote about itwhen this bizarre tech vulnerability first came to light, but now we know that this absolute belter was a cursed melody to some laptop vendors for half a decade (viaPC World). The story originally surfaced second-hand in a2022 blog post from Raymond Chen, explaining that after a great deal of testing, the cause of the crashes was isolated to the sound of the song itself. It turns out 1989's Rhythm Nation harbours the resonant frequency for components within 5,400 RPM hard drives, causing the moving parts of the hard drive to vibrate in arcs that would gradually sweep wider than intended. Ultimately, sustained exposure to the resonant frequency created enough read errors to crash some laptops' operating systems—David Plummer, another Microsoft alumnus,breaks down how this works in his own retelling of the story. As for what specific part of the song is doing the laptop crashing,Chen's follow-up postpoints to abrilliant musical analysis by Adam Neely; to summarise in a few words from someone who is definitelynota music theorist, Rhythm Nation's bassline is just that powerful, with a resonant peak of about 84.2 Hz. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)describes the issue as affecting laptops and PCs from \"approximately 2005 and later.\" To combat it, Microsoft wrote some Digital Signal Processor code to effectively filter out the offending frequencies on Windows XP machines. To be clear, this wasn't a bit of code specifically targeting Jackson's optimistic bop about the uniting power of music, but a notch filter intended to prevent speakers from playing all instances of the laptop crashing resonant frequency. So, how long was that bit of code in effect? Well,Chen wrote one more followup blog this monththat revealed the filter was still present until at least the launch of Windows 7 in 2009. At this time, Microsoft imposed a new rule requiring that users must have the option to disable Audio Processing Objects (APOs)—like the aforementioned frequency filtering code. That's about half a decade of Microsoft and laptop vendors attempting to circumvent Rhythm Nation-induced crashes. The vendor of the primarily affected laptops applied for an exception, fearing that the bounce back of the bass might not just physically damage their products but also their reputation. On these grounds, the exemption was granted—meaning that out there somewhere a vendor of HDD laptops may still be haunted by the incredible bassline of Rhythm Nation.

    "article_text": "No offers found Leave it to the engineers. And the YouTube DIY'ers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. If there's one thing about the AI boom that doesn't make my eyes roll or make me feel a disquieting sense of impending doom and existential dread, it's the fact that many of the computing improvements for that industry willhopefully(emphasis on 'hopefully') trickle down into the PC gaming sphere. In-package liquid cooling seems to be quite the rage of late, and hopefully it'll be one of those things that makes its way to the PC gaming market. Not even a week after a YouTubermade a DIY version of something similar, Intel has just shown off a water cooler that sits on top of the CPU package (instead of an IHS) and schlepps coolant through to… well, to cool to the chip, of course (viaTom's Hardware). The incredibly thin cooling solution has little copper microchannels that guide the coolant and can focus thermal relief on the spots that really need it. Intel is displaying such experimental in-package cooling solutions at its ongoingFoundry Direct Connectevent. The prototypes are designed for both LGA (land grid array) and BGA (ball grid array) surface mount chips, and Intel is showing such coolers for Core Ultra as well as Xeon CPUs. The kind of cooling on offer is apparently good for dealing with up to 1,000 W of heat, which is certainly more Xeon-level than Core Ultra-level, and is what makes me tentatively grateful for at least some of the AI boom. The server industry's certainly getting a lot of cash injected into it, and no doubt innovations such as this will come off the back of that. Then, hopefully, a tiny slice of that will end up in PC gamers' laps. Saying that, though, Intel has apparently been working on this tech for a long time. According toHardwareLuxx, at least some of the research for this dates back to 2005. It's interesting, though, that this is now finally in a state to be shown off to the public at the same time that similar solutions are being shown off elsewhere by third parties. Just a week ago I reported on acooler from EmCoolthat's supposed to attach to a delidded CPU and has liquid flowing through micro-pin fins to keep cool. Then there was the DIY version I mentioned earlier which machined channels for liquid cooling to flow through directly into the IHS. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. One of the key benefits of Intel's cooling tech here seems to be the ability to channel liquid where it's needed most: to hot spots. Given recent thermal imaging seems to showhot spots in some RTX 50-series graphics cards, we should be acutely aware of the benefits of such a tailored cooling system. Intel certainly seems to claim benefit, anyway, reportedly citing a 20% improvement in cooling performance. Noice. I'd certainly take one. Anything so I don't have to delid my own CPU and do the mod myself. Best AIO cooler for CPUs: Keep your chip chill.Best air cooler for CPUs: Classic, quiet cooling.Best PC fans: Quiet and efficient.

    "title": "'We were literally held hostage': Overwatch 2 players are finding the matchmaking in Stadium tough, but the devs say they're working on a couple of solutions",
    "article_text": "No offers found Sometimes there's just nothing you can do. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's been a couple of weeks since Blizzard launched Stadium inOverwatch 2, and since then, it's been an enjoyable, albeit bumpy ride. Apparently, the new mode only uses internal MMR for matchmaking, but even still, players are encountering a bit of mismatch. \"We were literally held hostage in Stadium,\" oneplayer says. \"Got trapped in Stadium by the enemy team with four randoms against a five-stack. They held us hostage in the match and said: 'We won't finish the game until one of you leaves.' 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together \"When we tried to go for the objective, they killed us, refused to capture it themselves, and just camped us in front of our base to farm us for 10 - 15 minutes. Why the hell is this kind of matchmaking even possible? We all reported them, but as always, nothing happens. Who at Blizzard had the brain fart to match Gold players against Diamonds or even Masters? Who is supposed to enjoy these games? It’s absolutely infuriating.\" Overwatch 2 matcheshave and will always be a coin flip. Most Overwatch 2 players have a 50% win rate, which,besides making the devs really happy, means that the matchmaking is placing players against others at the same skill level, so it's doing its job. It's also quite hard to rank up in Overwatch 2, as you need to improve faster than the rest of the playerbase, who are also constantly learning and changing. So I was pretty excited to see what Stadium would be like, how its matchmaking would differ from plain old ranked, and whether it would be better or worse with a little less MMR. Turns out it's both. Most matches I've played have either been really great or absolutely dreadful; the old adage \"You either roll or get rolled\" really applies here. But as I've played more games, the chaos has diminished a tiny bit as the system becomes more attuned with my skill rating. Even so, the majority of players have reported experiencing awful matchmaking over the last few weeks. There have beenhigh-ranked players complaining of getting matched with low ranks, andlow-ranked players complaining about fighting high-ranked players. I honestly think this will only improve with time, but the devs are listening to complaints and do have some ideas on how to ease the struggle of Stadium's matchmaking. \"The bounty system and boost system were both implemented to keep matches from being too snowbally,\" Daniel Duffin, test analyst, says in anAMA recap. \"We're reviewing feedback and in-game stats on how it is all working to see about any future adjustments.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The bounty system means that if enemies manage to kill a strong and successful player, they'll be rewarded with extra cash that they can then use to buy better items in the next round. Which is a solid feature, except for the fact that you actually need to be able to kill them to make it work. Oftentimes, those with bounties get them because they are hard to kill, something that won't necessarily become easier as the match goes on and they get more powerful. Alternatively, the developers are also looking into a way to help players have more control over which heroes they need to face. \"We definitely know something like a hero pick/ban system could be a positive addition to Stadium,\" Conor Kou, senior system designer, says. \"It has a lot of interesting implications for team compositions and the meta. It is something we're interested to explore!\" This won't necessarily ease the matchmaking, but it will make dealing with annoyingly strong heroes slightly more bearable.Hero bans have been implemented for the first time in regular ranked games, and so far, so good. While Sombra mains are certainly suffering right now, most players appreciate having more control over who they have to fight. So there's no reason why the same feature couldn't work in Stadium, albeit with fewer ban picks.

    "article_text": "No offers found \"I'm not like a huge chess guy, it's just always been something that I've wanted to be decent at.\" When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. PC Gamer's Wes Fenlon recently sat down with Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone to discuss everythingfrom Jojamartto his next game,Haunted Chocolatier. One question was what Barone himself is playing, and the man is as old school as it comes. \"Well recently I've been playing chess which is a great game,\" says Barone. \"It's one of the original games, it's very deep, it's a really good game in terms of game design. It is unfortunate that AI has kind of broken it in a way. \"I was kind of depressed about that for a bit, but now I'm over it and I feel like who cares? I'm not interested in AI playing chess, I'm interested in humans playing chess. But I'm not like a huge chess guy, it's just always been something that I've wanted to be decent at. So I've been doing that lately.\" Barone goes on to discuss a few other games, which we'll circle back to because he later returns to chess, prompted by Elon Musk's rather bananas assertion last year that chess is bad because, among other things,it lacks fog of war. \"I mean, a lot of chess grandmasters have criticized classical chess throughout the years,\" says Barone, \"because it does end up [where] you just have to remember all the theory, the openings, and it ends up being, 'Oh, did you remember this line 27 moves in or not?' And you only remember it 26 moves in, so gotcha. \"So that's why someone like Magnus Carlsen, he's playing freestyle chess, they call it now, which is where they randomize the pieces, essentially. So basically there's 960 different variants [of starting position]. So it's not really feasible that you're going to remember openings for 960 different variants. So you have to just play real chess. You have to think about tactics. And I feel like that might be more of an interesting game, actually.\" Freestyle chess, also called Chess960, was invented by the American grandmaster and world champion Bobby Fischer, one of the most brilliant players that chess has ever seen, and was borne of exactly the frustrations Barone talks about. If you had a misspent youth memorising openings and theory, it's a truly refreshing way to play the game, and is becoming increasingly popular as chess itself morphs into a more fast-paced online spectacle. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But what about Musk's wilder ideas? Does chess need a tech tree? \"I don't know about that, but I actually think it could be interesting,\" says Barone. \"I was actually thinking because I was playing chess race, and thought, what if someone did a Balatro treatment to chess, like where you're basically playing a chess roguelike? I feel like that could be interesting. And sure enough, there is someone making such a game. I think it's called Passant or something like that.\" I'm not sure what variant Barone's referring to as \"chess race\",possibly this board game, though it might also be theRacing Kingsvariant of the game.Passant: A Chess Roguelikedoes indeed try out some of these ideas: it's not out yet,but there is a demo, andplayers seem to dig it. As for what else Barone's playing, he's spending time with some other classics. \"I've also been playing WarCraft 3 Reforged,\" says Barone. \"A little bit of the campaign, and I've actually been playing custom maps with my friend, we play random custom games, which feels very old school. \"That's what I did in high school a lot with Warcraft 2 and Age of Empires, especially Age of Kings. I played a ton of Age of Kings when I was in high school and would just go to my friend's house, we'd have LAN parties and that was so fun. I feel like real time strategy needs to come back, you know?

    "article_text": "No offers found Sam Altman puts it in different terms, saying GPT-4o \"glazes\" too much. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. OpenAI hasrolled back its latest version of ChatGPT just 48 hours after release. The reason? Not a murderous LLM rampage, the impending demise of humanity or anything to do with AI overlords. Turns out, GPT-4o was agreeable to the point of ridiculousness. Or to use OpenAI supremo Sam Altman's words, GPT-4o, \"glazes too much.\" Altman said so on X a few days agoand yesterday said OpenAI was rolling back the latest update to 4o.OpenAI then uploaded a blog postexplaining what happened with GPT-4o and what was being done to fix it. yeah it glazes too muchwill fixApril 25, 2025 According to the Verge, the overly sycophantic build of GPT-4o was prone to praising users regardless of what they inputted into the model. By way of example, apparently one user told the 4o model they had stopped taking medications and were hearing radio signals through the walls, to which 4o reportedly replied, “I’m proud of you for speaking your truth so clearly and powerfully.” While one can debate the extent to which LLMs are responsible for their responses and the wellbeing of users, that response is unambiguously suboptimal. So, what is OpenAI doing about it? First, this problematic build of 4o is being rolled back. \"We have rolled back last week’s GPT‑4o update in ChatGPT so people are now using an earlier version with more balanced behavior. The update we removed was overly flattering or agreeable—often described as sycophantic,\" OpenAI says. According to OpenAI, the problem arose because the latest version of 4o was excessively tuned in favour of, \"short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time. As a result, GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous.\" If that doesn't feel like a complete explanation, what about the fix? OpenAI says it is adjusting its training techniques to \"explicitly steer the model away from sycophancy\" along with \"building more guardrails to increase honesty and transparency.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. What's more, in future builds users will be able to \"shape\" the behaviour and character of ChatGPT. \"We're also building new, easier ways for users to do this. For example, users will be able to give real-time feedback to directly influence their interactions and choose from multiple default personalities.\" Of course, one immediate question is how a build of ChatGPT so bad it had to be rolled back within 48 hours ever made it to general release. Well, OpenAI also says it is, \"expanding ways for more users to test and give direct feedback before deployment,\" which seems to be an implicit admission that it let 4o out into the wild with insufficient testing. Not that OpenAI or any other AI outfit would ever directly admit that slinging these chatbots out into the wild and worrying about how it all goes after the fact is actually now the industry norm.

    "title": "How to kill will-o-the-wisps in Oblivion Remastered",
    "article_text": "No offers found Only the right weapon can take down these seemingly invincible creatures. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Will-o-the-wispsare a unique enemy inOblivionsince they're seemingly immune to all damage and just don't stop chasing you. Their ceaseless nature is matched only by their lethality, able to steal your health and magicka if they get too close. You're most likely to run into these glowing wisps in monster dungeons, but you'll also find them near Azura's Shrine after starting the Blood of the Daedra quest and outside the Swampy Cave after starting the Fighters Guild's Mystery at Harlun's Watch quest. No matter where you encounter will-o-the-wisps, you're best off avoiding them altogether, but if you can't, then you'll need to know how to kill them. Although the list ofOblivion Remastered changesis pretty impressive, dealing with will-o-the-wisps remains the same, so this guide applies to both the remaster and the original version of the game. Will-o-the-wisps are immune to all normal damage and poison, making them feel pretty much invincible. However, these ghosts do actually have a weakness:silver and daedric weapons, enchanted weapons, and magiccan damage will-o-the-wisps. I also recommend using theReflect Spell, since this reverses this enemy's absorption attacks; rather than draining your health and magicka, you'll be healed. Since these ghosts are weak to magic, mage players won't run into too many issues with will-o-the-wisps. The stronger your magic, the easier it is to kill them, too. Remember though, they'll steal your magicka if you get close enough, so you can be caught out if you're not careful. On the other hand, melee characters struggle much more as basic attacks with iron or steel weapons won't make a dent. You'll need at least a silver weapon to take on these ghosts, which could take you a while to get. A silver bow is particularly effective here so you can keep your distance. Unsurprisingly, taking on a ghost with your bare hands is generally not advised either, not least because they absorb your health and magicka when you're up close and personal. Without reaching Journeyman in the hand-to-hand skill, which is level 50 or above, you won't be able to damage them with your fists whatsoever. As such, it'll take you a lot longer to be able to deal with this enemy if you favour fists over any actual weapon. Once you've managed to kill a will-o-the-wisp, you can loot it to getglow dust. This is a valuable ingredient used in alchemy, especially for making Reflect Spell potions, though you'll also need it to activate the Shrine of Azura.

    "title": "Looks like the first RTX 5060 laptop benchmark results are in and show pretty much what we expected",
    "article_text": "No offers found Hopefully as efficient as some other RTX 50-series laptops we've seen. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. As we move into May, we're looking forward to more decidedly budget-sector laptops and gaming PCs, thanks primarily to upcoming entry-level GPU releases. And despite real prices rarely living up to MSRP expectations right now, there's a glimmer of hope for budget laptops and gaming PCs on the horizon, and we're now seeing glimpses of this in the wild, so to speak, as the first RTX 5060 laptop benchmark results have been spotted. The two GeekBench OpenCL results (oneandtwo) were spotted by X userOlrak29(viaVideoCardz) and show a Colorful \"iGame M15 Origo\" and \"P15 Pro\" achieving 102,564 and 109,431 on the benchmark, respectively—both with an RTX 5060 laptop GPU inside. It's difficult to say much on the basis of an OpenCL score, not least because the OpenCL framework isn't used by devs for most GPU rendering tasks, although it's still useful for some. That, and GeekBench scores can also vary wildly, and there's no indication of what power limits these RTX 5060 GPUs were running at. However, with these caveats in mind, we can make a general comparison. VideoCardz says that these results are about 18% faster than an RTX 4060 laptop GPU. However, without the RTX 4060 mobile data it's drawing from, we can instead refer to theGeekBench databaseand check out theaverage results. According to these results, the RTX 4060 laptop averages a result of 89,099, which makes the two RTX 5060 laptop results shown here 14% and 22% faster than the previous-gen GPU, respectively (I can't help but notice that, perhaps coincidentally, the average of these two percentages would be 18%). But that 89k number is based on the database that, as we can see, has some wildly varying results due to all kinds of different system configurations. And in fact, there are some RTX 4060 laptop results that match up to these RTX 5060 laptop ones, such asone that hits 104,509. What's more definite than the performance results are the clock speeds for the RTX 5060 laptop GPUs, which are shown to be 2,025 MHz and 2,212 MHz. This isn't far out of line with the RTX 4060 mobile GPU, which has a maximum boost of 2,370 MHz—theAsus TUF A14that I frequently use boosts up to 2,225 MHz, for instance. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. There should be more headroom for RTX 5060 laptop chips on this front, though, asNvidia liststhe RTX 5060 laptop GPU as having a max boost clock of 2,497 MHz, compared to 2,370 MHz for theRTX 4060 laptop GPU. Best gaming PC: The top pre-built machines.Best gaming laptop: Great devices for mobile gaming. One thing we do know for certain is that the RTX 5060 mobile will have just over 8% more cores than the RTX 4060 mobile—3,072 for the RTX 4060 vs 3,328 for the RTX 5060. We can and should therefore expect at least 8% better performance, in general, notwithstanding variability due to clock speeds and TDP limits. Throw in some architectural improvements and the 18% quoted performance increase might not be too far-fetched, especially for laptops with high-end CPUs in them like these. We'll just have to wait and see. RTX 5060 laptops were onlyofficially announceda couple of weeks ago and should be launching next month, although we'd all been pretty sure about that even before the official announcement—it was hard to ignore that laptop vendors wereconfirming RTX 5050 and RTX 5060 laptops beforehand. Nvidia says RTX 5060 laptops will start at $1,099, but I doubt that'll be for anything like these Core i9 and Core Ultra 9 models listed here. Still, given how highly we rate the power efficiency of higher-end RTX 50-series laptop chips—this being one reason theRazer Blade 16 (2025)now sits at the top of ourbest gaming laptopslist—even low-end RTX 5060 laptops are something to be tentatively excited about.

    "title": "Yennefer's voice actor not only knows nothing about what's happening with The Witcher 4, she seems only vaguely aware she was in The Witcher 3:  'I didn't know what I was doing'",
    "article_text": "No offers found Denise Gough, also currently appearing as Dedra Meero in Andor, seems baffled by a question about CD Project's upcoming sequel. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Did you know that the actor who plays the brilliantly horrible Dedra Meero on Star Wars show Andor, Denise Gough, was also the voice of Yennefer in The Witcher 3? Don't feel too bad if not—it seems like she didn't know either. In a new interview,Eurogamerasked her if she knows anything about production on upcoming sequelThe Witcher 4. Needless to say, she does not. \"I don't know any of this,\" she says, looking baffled. \"Like I didn't know what I was doing, I'd never done a videogame before.\" She says she only really became aware of the significance of her role in The Witcher 3 after the fact, when sound engineers on film sets would recognise her voice and ask her if she was Yennefer. \"And I was like, 'who's Yennefer?'\". Ironically her Andor co-star Ben Mendelsohn seems more aware of the game series than she does. It's not necessarily an unusual situation. Due to the secrecy around major game projects, the often disjointed way dialogue is recorded (sometimes broken up over months or even years), and recordings frequently happening in a different country to where the studio is based, it's surprisingly common for actors to have very little context for what they're doing. Their work is often concluded years before a game even releases, too, creating an even bigger gap between them and the finished product. All of which is to say, I certainly wouldn't take this as evidence of Gough being unusually unaware or dismissive of the series—and certainly regardless of what she understood about the wider game she was taking part in, her performance in The Witcher 3 was absolutely brilliant. Still, it is quite funny to imagine her recording probably 100 hours of incredibly plot-important dialogue for the game with no clue what all this talk of magic and monsters was about. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. This is a trend that seems to be changing, at least. Partly because of games being taken increasingly more seriously as a medium, but also partly because of the rise in the use of motion capture performances rather than actors contributing purely via voice work. It's hard to imaginethe cast of Baldur's Gate 3 ever forgetting their character's names, for example. When it comes to The Witcher 4, it is interesting at least to know that she hasn't been approached to reprise her role yet (unless this is a clever bluff). Yennefer's story, like Geralt's, certainly felt concluded in The Witcher 3—but given her important relationship with Ciri, who's taking the leading role in the sequel, it's easy to imagine her playing some kind of role, even if only in flashbacks. Of course, chances are pretty good that they're simply not far enough along in development yet to be formally casting roles. The game's still a long way off yet—it won't be outuntil 2027 at the earliest, according toCD Projekt.

    "title": "'Please give us one more chance': Infinity Nikki developer grovels in lengthy apology letter following disastrous launch of its newest patch",
    "article_text": "No offers found Version 1.5 has been mired by bugs, login issues and monetisation upsets. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Version 1.5 of Infinity Nikki is Infold's biggest update yet, but the launch didn't exactly go well. Bugs, crashes, and login issues lefttons of players unable to even try out the new patch, leading to its new Steam launch settling into Mixed reviews within hours. Subtle monetisation changes were also ruffling feathers withChinese players taking to the Steam forums to warn off potential stylists. Safe to say, it wasn't the warm reception Infold was likely expecting. It didn't take long for the developer to releasea lengthy apology lettercomplete with some in-game currency to say sorry—apologems if you will—addressing some of the more glaring issues and simultaneously not really doing much about others. Infold says it's already sorted out \"nearly one hundred issues,\" with plans to do some more repair work over the following days. It also touched upon some of the backlash that happened in the patch's first few hours—namely events like Mira Crown which serve as a huge free source of currency being extended from two to three weeks. Thankfully, Infold has, er, folded pretty quickly on that change. It says it'll now be running two Mira Crown events a month with static dates: The first on the 1st of each month and the second on the 16th of each month. It also addressed anger around the increase in the number of pieces per outfit. Prior to Version 1.5, every 5-star outfit sported either nine or 10 pieces, requiring a maximum of between 180 and 200 pulls to obtain the full thing. That's already pretty steep by gacha standards, but Infold then went ahead and released two 11-piece outfits this patch which pushed the max up to an eye-watering 220 pulls. Couple it with the fact that some of the outfit pieces aren't even visible, like stockings with a floor-length ballgown, and it's been pretty poorly received. Players have been calling for Infold to drop the maximum number of pulls required down to 180—currently Infinity Nikki guarantees one 5-star item every 20 pulls, which can lead to the ridiculously high 220 pulls maximum if your luck is particularly scuppered—but it doesn't seem like that's something the developer is willing to do right now. Infold cites the increased complexity of both outfits—they sport special effects and abilities like bespoke co-op animations and music—as a reason behind the increased number of items. It mostly apologises for not communicating the change earlier, and promises that \"the number of pieces in 5-star outfits will not exceed 11\" going forward. It's a response that hasn't exactly gone down well, and already has people fretting of potential 6-star outfits in the future that'll be even more expensive with even more pieces to collect. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The last thing Infold touched upon was the new dye system, one which is confusing and also pretty tedious. Each item of clothing has several colour palettes to unlock and, well, you have to do that forevery single item of clothing.Infold's asking folk to email their customer service with feedback and suggestions, and promises more advanced dyeing options in the future. It wraps up the incredibly lengthy apology by saying \"Please give us one more chance—to let Nikki' starlight continue to shine for us all, and to keep the warmth in our hearts forever burning bright.\" Despite the shaky reaction the community's had to the letter, I do at least have to commend Infold for throwing the apology out there relatively quickly. I've been a fan of the series since Love Nikki in 2017, and I've experienced the pain of seeing zero communication when players were unhappy with how things were being handled. Getting something this lengthy within hours of the backlash is at least a start, especially with the Mira Crown changes. Infold has been pretty receptive so far to changing things players aren't happy with—getting rid of limited-time currency for example—so fingers crossed we'll be getting some bigger changes soon. One thing Infold has seemingly ignored, though, is the apparent retconning of its story. The opening chapter has been totally changed with a new tutorial and new story, something which has left people understandably confused, myself included. That's the one big thing I'm waiting to be addressed, which I hope happens sooner rather than later.

    "article_text": "No offers found Don't desert your work. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Funcom's Dune: Awakening launches June 5, and in the runup to release has allowed some players to begin exploring Arrakis in beta. PCG's Chris Livingstone spent 25 hours there, and left impressed with what it offers as a survival game, but a little iffyon the MMO side of things. One problem that jumped out to our man was the \"ugly, boxy player-made bases\" that covered the map when he was getting started. These were so notable that Chris ran most of the way across the map to find an uncluttered spot to build his own base: next time he logged in, \"my little base was flanked by two huge ones other players had built maybe 20 feet from my front door.\" That doesn't sound great, and over the beta's two weeks the problem got worse, with more and more bases appearing (as well as unfinished ones) and most just being \"a boring box.\" As well as blotting the landscape, there's also the problem of how the game feels: part of the Dune fantasy, after all, is the nomadic feel of traversing these vast landscapes. This very topic came up in a new livestream focusing on thebuilding and crafting sideof the game, and was addressed by Dune: Awakening's chief creative director Joel Bylos (timestamp). \"It's encouraged to get rid of old bases, because this is one of the problems that comes with the persistence of the game,\" says Bylos. \"In a traditional MMO like World of Warcraft, it's not like you build a base in the starter zone and leave it there for a week, because imagine how many bases would be stacking up. [But] that's kind of how our gamedoeswork because you can end up with a lot of bases.\" Moving onto the solution, it's the old \"tidy up after yourself\" mantra which, speaking as a parent, I can confidently say always works with 100% success. \"So the opening tutorial encourages you to get rid of your old base, your first base,\" says Bylos. \"And then you move further and further out into the world and we're asking you to create bigger bases. So I will say just, y'know, do your fellow starters a favour when the game launches: clean up your old bases people. Don't leave trash on Arrakis!\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Hmm. You get the sense that this may turn out to be a part of the Dune: Awakening experience for everyone, especially in those first few weeks when a lot of players will be trying it out: I certainly know that, if I'm not enjoying a particular game, I just shut it down rather than tidying up my mess and then shutting it down. AsPCG's Chris Livingstone put it: \"I know I'm being picky, but if I got tired of seeing these ugly bases (including my own) in just a few hours of a press beta, how bad is it going to be after launch when the servers fill up with regular players?\" It would be nice if people cleaned up their old bases but, without some positive incentive to do so, I'm not sure many will: soon enough, we'll see it in action. And I'm still stoked to try out Dune: Awakening anyway, because I just think getting eaten by a sandworm will be worth it.

TheChaos in the Kitchen questis one of the missions you'll have to complete before welcoming the Cheshire Cat to live in your world in Disney Dreamlight Valley. Luckily it's not a wild goose chase, unlike the rest of the quests you have to complete, but it's worth ticking off your list as soon as possible. Anything to make the process of finally welcoming Cheshire to the valley slightly easier. With that said, you need tocomplete the Leaving Wonderland quest for Alicebefore you'll be able to begin Chaos in the Kitchen. When you've done this, walk into Remy's Restaurant in your valley and you'll see the place covered in pink pawprints. Talk to Remy to officially begin the quest, and follow these steps to complete it. The first part of the Chaos in the Kitchen quest tasks you with once again cleaning up the mess left by the Cheshire Cat. Go to each cluster of pink paw prints around the restaurant and remove them with E when prompted. When you've tidied up the last group, a book will appear on the floor. Pick it up, and you'll be able to learn a new recipe from it. This book contains the recipe for the Cheshire Cat tail dessert. Interact with the book in your inventory you will be challenged to recreate the dish. To do so, you'll need the following ingredients: Once you've made this four-star dessert, give it to Remy and your character will explain that the Cheshire Cat left the recipe. Remy still isn't convinced he's a good character and tells you to check outside the restaurant to make sure all the mess is cleared up. Surprise, surprise, it's not, and you have to clear up the rest. You need to tidy up three stacks of restaurant chairs surrounded by pink paw prints around the restaurant. They won't spawn any further than just outside the restaurant doors, so you don't need to trek around your whole valley looking for them. Once cleaned up, go back inside the restaurant and the Cheshire Cat will appear. You'll talk briefly, but he's not quite ready to move into the valley yet. When he disappears again, return to Remy to complete the Chaos in the Kitchen quest. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "No offers found Conquest Dark is a Vampire Survivors-like that manages to strike the right chord between fresh and familiar. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Give it enough time, and Vampire Survivors-likes (or 'survivors', which we here at PC Gamer arecommitted to making happen) will invent their way back to Diablo. We started with the sugary slot-machine loops of Vampire Survivors itself, progressed to the loot-driven meta-progression of Halls of Torment, and now we're at Conquest Dark, which has all that stuff plus: activatable powers, a clearable world map,lore, and ludicrous nudity. The four key ingredients no truly great game can do without. In essence, Conquest Dark is a familiar thing. You pick a class, mill around, kill enemies with automatic attacks, and accumulate XP. More XP leads to more powers, more stat buffs, faster and more damaging attacks, and all the while your enemies are increasing in ferocity, health, and number. 2025 games: Upcoming releasesBest PC games: All-time favoritesFree PC games: Freebie festBest FPS games: Finest gunplayBest RPGs: Grand adventuresBest co-op games: Better together So far, so Vampire Survivors, and make no mistake, Conquest Dark isn't a revolutionary reinvention of the genre. What itdoes, though, is add a bunch of tweaks and fine details around the edge of it that make the whole thing still feel pretty fresh. In place of other games' it's-gone-and-you're-done health bar, Conquest Dark has a lives system. Hit zero health and your 'lives' meter will tick down, but you'll also acquire a stack of bleeding. That means that dying once puts you inexorably on a course towards dying forever. Bleeding, at least in my couple of hours with the game, can't be easily cured. Even if you play perfectly after a death—avoiding every attack with a Diablo 4-style recharging dodge move—you'll still be gushing blood out of one orifice or another. Maybe you can staunch it by choosing level-up abilities that buff your regen or make enemies more likely to drop health, but really, you're just delaying the inevitable. I kind of love it. It adds a skin-of-your-teeth urgency to any level that gets hairy enough for you to die on. Suddenly, your careful build-crafting goes out the window: now your focus is on adding more and more health buffs to try to stick it out until you've beaten each of the level's bosses and run the timer down to zero. All the while a fountain of blood spewing out of your character increases in rage and intensity. There's a surprisingly robust gore system, too: as your character (and bosses, who also have lives) loses more and more lives, they lose more and more skin, until eventually they have a single life left and look like a tattered, bloody skeleton swinging a zweihander. It's a system that dovetails neatly with Conquest Dark's structure—unlike Vampire Survivors or Halls of Torment, you're not repeatedly running the same slim collection of levels to uncover secrets and gather loot. Instead, you're proceeding across a Path-of-Exile-style map, proceeding from node to node with the aim of defeating each one's bosses and vacuuming up the currencies they drop on death, and even building up your reputation with certain factions (which confers new, permanent bonuses) along the way.

It means there's always a temptation—no matter how badly things are going and how doomed your character is—to tough things out to an end which is only just out of reach. More than once I found myself in a teeth-gritting race with a level's final boss: each of us trying to whittle the other down to the end of their health bar before we inevitably succumbed to our own wounds. It's a worthy addition to the genre, and if you're a fellow survivor sicko looking for your next fix, you could do much worse than Conquest Dark.

You develop friendships and relationships with Pelican Town's villagers over the years, but no matter how long you spend giving gifts and completing requests, Stardew doesn't really offer a final ending to a lot of its storylines. There are a surprising number of questions Stardew has left unanswered which Eric Barone has regrets about, but there's a good reason nothing has changed in the nine years since Stardew launched. In aninterview with PC Gamer, when asked if there was anything he would've liked to do differently during development, Barone stated \"I think I would have probably spent more time fleshing out the characters more. \"This is something I actually have mixed feelings about, because some of the character story lines, they're kind of left as cliffhangers almost. There's no resolution to certain things, like Mayor Lewis and Marnie's secret relationship.\" Even though you don't get the answers you want from the game, that hasn't stopped players from sharing lore ideas and deep dives ever since Stardew Valley's launch in 2016. We've seen mods created to help round-off some of the storylines left unanswered or give characters more cutscenes and dialogue too. Creating these sought-after endings is something Barone has considered, too, but the idea of having something so final is offputing when it could be left open for interpretation. Especially given the creativity inspired by these open endings already on show. \"I have ideas for how I could resolve these things,\" ends Barone, \"but part of me is almost like, I wonder if I should, because it's closing the book in a way. \"I kind of like that it's open ended, and it gives people the ability to kind of, themselves, like finish the story in their head, which makes Stardew Valley more personal to every person, because there's a lot of room for your own interpretation on things.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

    "article_text": "No offers found She's taking it better than I would, that's for sure. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. EA has laid off hundreds of employees—reportedly around 300 to 400—across its studios, including around 100 at Respawn Entertainment, developers of Titanfall and Apex Legends. Among the many developers left scrambling in an industry where this has become shockingly routine, one in particular leapt out. Heather Woodward, a now-former narrative designer at Respawn, was laid off a literal day after the character she'd spent a whole year writing debuted. On April 28, Apex Legends introduced a new character by the name of Sparrow: \"My first born is finally here,\" Woodwardposted to Bluesky. \"I’ve been working on this sweet ragazzo for well over a year. Writing a music video style trailer was a tough but rewarding challenge and I can’t believe I get to see my work animated by the incredible team at Sun Creature.\" Then, on April 29, the layoffs hit and Woodward discovered she'd beencaught in the wave of sacrifices to the altar of growth: \"Well, this is awkward but… I was just mass-downsized at Respawn. These things happen and my time with Apex has been a top to bottom blast, my favorite job I’ve ever had. It’s been a true joy to write Sparrow, I’ll continue to be insufferable about him for weeks to come.\" As if to properly hammer a final, capricious nail into a coffin, Woodward was then sent a promotional email for the character she wrote before she waspromptly shown the door. Woodward appears to be taking this on the chin in a way that's downright enviable—but it really does feel like a perfect nutshell of how messed up and unsustainable this industry has become. There's just zero guarantee of anything, anymore. Let's take a look at the reasons why you might get laid off while working on a game, shall we? Now we can add \"You dared to work on a videogame\" to that list, I guess.

    "article_text": "No offers found They call me the Jeremy Wade of Stardew Valley. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Stardew Valley's fishing minigamegets a surprising amount of hate, whether it's because of how annoying it is to find all the legendary fish or becausefishing minigames are a dime a dozen nowadays. But I've always loved it as a way to break up my farming hyperfixation, and it sounds like Eric Barone, the creator ofStardew Valley,is also backing this system. \"I like fishing minigames, and I like Stardew Valley's fishing minigame,\" Barone says. \"I know it's controversial, a lot of people hate it, but I think it's fun.\" This minigame can get really repetitive, and it's pretty infuriating when you snag a fish that ends up doing a gymnastics routine worthy of a gold medal at the Olympics to escape your clutches. But it's nothing a fibreglass or iridium rod and some elbow grease can't help. That said, with a simple bamboo pole, fishing in Stardew Valley can be quite difficult, especially if it's your first time trying to impress Willy. \"My regret with the Stardew Valley fishing minigame is that I think it starts out too hard,\" Barone continues. \"I think there should have been a better curve, so it starts out easy and then it gets a little harder. Because you're catching more difficult fish. But the way I did it, you start out with this tiny little bar, and it's like, 'Ah, I should have started with the bar a little bit bigger. ' But I still think the fishing game is good overall.\" But for those of you who never watched River Monsters or simply don't want to get put through the wringer the first couple of times you fish in Stardew Valley, there is a secret tip that Barone says will help somewhat. \"I know a lot of people really hate it, so I tried to mitigate it a little bit by adding the training rod, which a lot of people don't know about,\" Barone says. \"You can buy it for like five gold at Willy's shop, and it makes the fishing a lot easier. Although you can only catch fish below a certain tier and quality. But it's good for training. You can level up, and then when you switch to the regular rod, your bar will be a lot bigger.\" Stardew Valley mods:Custom farmingStardew Valley cheats: Farm fasterStardew Valley multiplayer:Co-op farmingGames like Stardew Valley: More life simsBest indie games: Independent excellence The training rod is a good way to avoid a trial by fire, making Stardew Valley's fishing a lot more approachable. But I still think the mechanics for fishing in Stardew are perfect. However, that's no surprise, considering its humble origins. \"Stardew Valley's fishing minigame—I think I've said this before in interviews—but it was actually inspired by Donkey Kong Country, Tropical Freeze,\" Barone says. \"You're flying on the barrel, and it's like you press one button to go up, and then you release it, and you go down. I thought that these controls were fun. There's a lot of depth to a Donkey Kong level like this with just one button. And I was like, maybe I can turn that into a fishing minigame.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Sometimes the best ideas really do come from someone pointing at something and going, \"I like this, it's cool, I'm going to incorporate it into my work.\" In that sense, Stardew Valley's fishing minigame has come full circle with Stardew Valley's fishing minigame, for better or worse, as it's gone on to inspire a whole lot of new fishing minigames whilealso raising Lauren's blood pressure.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Fortnite's come a long way since its days of being a slightly strange sandbox survival/tower defense hybrid. It'sheld virtual concerts, let me gun down Godzilla as Hatsune Miku, and lest we forget thebizarre Star Wars event in 2019where players were treated to an exclusive broadcast that was later referenced in Rise of the Skywalker, a 15-minute clip from the movie, and I guess Geoff Keighley was also there for whatever reason. Well, get ready for more Star Wars shenanigans this week. Not only is the Star Wars-themed battle pass kicking off on May 2 (c'mon Epic, not even May 4?) but it's also giving players the chance to watch two episodes of the upcoming miniseries Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld. Two whole days before it hits Disney+. The watch party is kicking off on May 2 at7 am PT / 10 am ET / 3 pm BST—sorry West Coasters—with Epic also promising blaster and lightsaber battles, with waves of Stormtroopers to keep things exciting between episode viewings. It's gone ahead and built a whole Star Wars-themed island for the occasion, too, with \"a breathtaking environment inspired by a galaxy far, far away.\" Epic president Adam Sussman called the collaboration \"a glimpse into the type of interactive experiences we envision,\" adding \"we are reimagining what's possible with immersive storytelling in Fortnite with one of the world's most beloved franchises—stay tuned for a lot more to come.\" Admittedly I'm in two minds. There's part of me that thinks this is pretty rad. Hell, growing up, I used to spend way too much time in the Gaia Online theatre—shoutout if anyone knows what the hell I'm talking about—and some of my earliest exposure to anime came through watching random episodes of stuff like Mushi-Shi there. Exclusivity aside, I think it's kinda neat to create the opportunity to expose younger folk to Star Wars and potentially form a lifelong interest. And for the Venn diagram of Star Wars and Fortnite enjoyers, it's a pretty unique way to experience watching the show. Like a virtual drive-in theatre. Except with like, chug jugs and probably someone dressed as Juice WRLD running around being a bit of a dick. On the flip side, it's probably incredibly annoying for non-Fortnite players who are looking forward to the miniseries. It's the kind of scenario that presents ample opportunity for spoilers to flood social media before a huge chunk of people even get the chance to watch, even if it's just two days before the full thing hits Disney+. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Whatever side of the fence you're on, I'm hoping it's a similar chaotic spectacle to what we witnessed back in 2019. While I'm not a Star Wars fan myself—I know, I know, sorry—I'm still excited to see my pals get hyped and I'm sure I'll get stuck in with them a little bit when it all launches later this week. If you're wanting to go all on-theme with some Star Wars skins (and you don't have the ones already available), you can link your MyDisney to your Epic account for a free Stormtrooper skin.

    "title": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella says AI generates 'fantastic' Python code, and that it now creates 'maybe 20 - 30% of the code ... in some of our projects'",
    "article_text": "No offers found Hey, who commented 'purple monkey dishwasher' in here? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. I'm gonna be so real with you right now: the most coding I've done in the last year is tinkering in narrative tools like Twine and Ink—both of which are programs geared towards writers such as myself who respect more technical coding as much as they fear it. Still, turning to AI to generate code that's core to your business seems like a bad idea to me. Well, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella would apparently disagree. In a fireside chat with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg atLlamacon, Nadella said, \"I'd say maybe 20 to 30 percent of the code that is inside of our repos today in some of our projects are probably all written by software,” with 'software' here being a euphemistic term for AI (viaThe Register). Nadella clarified that its AI is writing fresh code in a variety of programming languages, rather than overhauling existing code. Nadella claimed the AI-generated results he's seen using Python are \"fantastic\", while code generated in C++ still has a ways to go. Thatcould explainafew thingswith regard torecent Windows updates, such asthe mysterious empty folder apparently essential to system security. On the other hand, it's not immediately clear where this AI-generated code is actually ending up. Besides that, auto-completion tools within coding software (think, predictive text) can fall into the category of 'AI-generated', too, so that 30% figure is fuzzy at best. Still, CTO Kevin Scott has also commented that he expects a whopping 95% of the company's code to be AI-generated by 2030, and it's not just Microsoft leaning on AI either (viaTechCrunch). Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, revealed in a recent earnings call that AI is used to generate 30% of code for the search giant,potentially about to be cut down to size, too. As for Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO could not recall the exact percentage of how much AI-generated code his company is currently using. Still, both Zuckerberg and Nadella expressed enthusiasm about the prospect of more heavily relying on AI coding agents in the future—with no word on how this may or may not impact jobs. Zuckerberg hopes AI-generated code will improve security, though a recent study found thatAI's tendency to 'hallucinate' package dependenciesand third-party code libraries could present serious risks (viaArs Technica). While it makes sense to not always write code from scratch, AI-generated code can leave the back door open for someone to upload a malicious package based on an AI hallucinated line. One can only hope both Meta, Microsoft, and Google thoroughly check their AI-generated code before implementing itanywhere… but something tells me that my hopes for corporate responsibility may be a little optimistic.

    "article_text": "No offers found Pierre isn't all that bad, but JojaMart is. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It's hard to imagine Eric Barone saying that he failed in any aspect regardingStardew Valley. Whatstarted out as a simple Harvest Moon clone, a way to teach him how to code and perfect pixel art, evolved into a phenomenon that is still having a lasting impact on the cosy farming sim genre. But nothing in life can be perfect, and everyone has regrets. Talking to PC Gamer at GDC, Barone discussed a couple of areas in which he would improve, if given the chance to revisit 2012, when his work on Stardew Valley first began, namely how on the nose the game's villain, JojaMart, is. Stardew Valley mods: Custom farmingStardew Valley multiplayer:Co-op farmingStardew Valley cheats: Farm fasterGames like Stardew Valley: More life simsBest indie games: Our mixtape to you \"That's one of the things I kind of regret about Stardew Valley,\" Barone says. \"I feel like it's a little bit too on the nose with Joja being the bad guys, and the community centre being the right way to do it. If I made Stardew Valley again, I would try to be a little more nuanced. \"Maybe there are some positives to JoJa, you know. Nothing is that black and white. In reality, there's usually nuance to everything. It's something that I wanted to have with Stardew Valley, but I kind of failed in that particular aspect.\" It is blindingly obvious in Stardew Valley that JojaMart, a chain supermarket, is the villain. Not only is this the company that the protagonist leaves to start a new life on their grandpa's farm, trading in dull and grey for the exciting and colourful world of farming, but when a new store opens up in Pelican Town, it starts to wreak havoc. At the eastern edge of the town, in the woods near where JojaMart is set up, there's loads of trash and litter scattered around, most of it being Joja Cola and other supermarket junk. Additionally, there is the fact that Pierre, the local shopkeeper, is being gradually put out of business by the chain store. Pierre doesn't lose the store or anything if you just stick with JojaMart, but that ending will turn the community centre into a warehouse, and you'll lose out on a couple of the perks that the Community Centre ending will give you. Siding with JojaMart also feels like you lose the spirit of the game, as it supports large corporations over small businesses, local produce, and community-focused initiatives. But siding with Joja isn't all bad, if you can forgive yourself, that is. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. The Joja ending will give you a soda machine instead of a trophy, an auto-petter, and a movie theatre. Another unintended perk also seems to be sticking it to Pierre by choosing Joja over his general store. I kind of advocate for Pierre a little bit. I think he is not as bad as some people think. Pierre may seem like just a normal shopkeeper, but a lot of players have a problem with his priorities and character in general. Those who dislike him believe that he should spend more time with his family, take up a hobby, and find a job that offers a better work-life balance. But Barone seems to think the Pierre hate is a bit too harsh. \"I assumed people wouldn't like Pierre, but I didn't realise the extent to which they would hate Pierre,\" Barone says. \"I kind of advocate for Pierre a little bit. I think he is not as bad as some people think. I mean, he does after all—I don't want to spoil it—but he plays a crucial role in the Community Centre path at the end of the game.\" I also don't really get all the Pierre hate. I understand he's not a great person, but running your own business is stressful, especially when a big chain is poised to take it all away from you. I've only ever gone with the JojaMart ending once, just to get the achievement. And while I won't be doing that again, regardless of how unhealthy Pierre's work-life balance is, I will say that Joja Cola has saved me a couple of times when I've gone too far down in the mines, so I'll give them that.

    "article_text": "No offers found The routine of farm life won't be stopping any time soon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Stardew Valleyhas become the backbone of farming simulators since its launch in 2016, and the impact it had on the genre and the games that followed is clear as day. As soon as a trailer for a new farming simulator drops, someone will make a comparison with Stardew Valley, no matter how far a stretch that might be. But this impact has caused a lot of similar Stardew-esque games to be produced, which Eric Barone, the creator of Stardew Valley, is aware of. In aninterview with PC Gamer, Barone shared that he hadn't really played many other farming and life simulators, although he did give Sun Haven and Graveyard Keeper a special mention. One stood out among the rest though, but not because it looked like an attempt to be the next Stardew Valley, only because the name was similar. Barone shared \"I did boot upDisney Dreamlight Valley. Because I was like, Wait, it's called Dreamlight Valley. Like, what? What are they? What's going on here? So I had to check it out. And it's like, it's more, I'd say it's more like Animal Crossing than Stardew.\" It takes two seconds to boot up Steam and immediately be inundated with farming simulator recommendations. Don't get me wrong, I love the genre as much as the next person, if not more so having spent thousands of hours tilling soil and raising chickens. But it's becoming harder to sift through the masses to find something unique, and a lot of that is due to so many developers drawing inspiration from the success of Stardew Valley and trying to replicate it in their own way. Barone recognises the impact Stardew has had on the genre, saying \"I can't take all the credit for this, but Stardew, it seems to have inspired a lot more people to consider this kind of game.

    "title": "A little power management goes a long way in the latest Intel drivers giving a free 10% fps boost to the MSI Claw AI+ handheld and any other Lunar Lake device",
    "article_text": "No offers found And an average increase of 25% in 1% Low FPS, though only at 17 W or lower. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel seems to have been on the gaming performance improvement grind lately, and it's now claiming a significant uplift in its new low-power chips thanks to driver updates. This is particularly good news for us PC gamers because it means some high-end handhelds and low-power laptops should get a free boost for gaming. In a blog post announcing the uplift,Intel says: \"As part of our continuous platform optimizations, we are rolling out a power management update that improves gaming performance for Intel Core Ultra 200V systems (codenamed: Lunar Lake) with built-in Intel Arc 140V and 130V GPUs.\" In particular, this should be good news for those of you with anMSI Claw 8 AI+(or a Claw 7 AI+, which is mostly the same but with a smaller battery), as it features an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V chip with Arc 140V GPU that should benefit from this update. We reckon this is thebest high-end handheld gaming PCeven without this driver update, but we won't say no to free extra performance. The update should roll out officially to more Lunar Lake devices (such as theAsus Zenbook S 14 that we also tested), but for now it's only official for the Claw 7/8 AI+. Intel shares its own benchmarks in a few games, with results averaging 10% increased average fps and 25% increase to 1% low FPS figures—ie, a 25% increase to the averate frame rate of the lowest 1% of measured frames. This is why Intel says, \"we’re improving not only performance but also smoothness for a great gaming experience.\" Better 99th percentile performance equals smoother overall gameplay. This driver update comes not long after another free Intel performance boost, theprevious onebeing for Intel Core Ultra 200S (desktop) processors. That one, which required a BIOS update, boosted \"fabric, die-to-die, and memory frequencies.\" This new one for low-power mobile chips is a \"power management update\" packaged in a driver update, so no low-level fiddling is required. Given this is a power management update, the \"performance benefits\", Intel says, \"are observed primarily at or under the common default power level of 17W.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Many Claw 8 AI+ gamers, we're sure, will want to crank the handheld up beyond this. In our handheld testing we usually compare for 30 W performance (although we do test with default power limits, too, especially for battery life). I suppose this driver update, if Intel's performance claims bear out, will give gamers more of an incentive to stick to default (or lower) power modes. Which isn't a bad shout anyway, really, unless you're trying to play some really demanding AAA titles. The Claw 8 AI+ can handle pretty much any handheld-oriented game with ease, and its stellar battery life is one of its main draws, so it might make sense to lean into that and opt for some low-power, long battery life gaming especially if performance is improved at lower power. If you have a Claw 7/8 AI+, you might already have this update installed. Intel says it's available for these handhelds \"on Intel graphics driver 32.0.101.6734 and newer, and will be enabled for other Intel Core Ultra 200V systems soon, following validation with our OEM partners.\" We're currently past this driver version, so if you have automatic updates on it might already be installed. If not, you can install it via the MSI Center, or download and installdirectly from Intel. Presumably the latter should be possible for other Intel Core Ultra 200V devices, even if it's not yet officially OEM validated.

    "title": "Google's dominance in decline as its overall share of online search dips below 90% for the first time in a decade, and its desktop PC share is now below 80% and falling fast",
    "article_text": "No offers found Is deGoogling the next big thing? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Google's share of online search is on the slide according toStatcounter(viaTuta). Google's overall share of web searches has fallen below 90% for the first time in a decade. But it's doing even worse in certain categories and territories, including desktop PC users and in Europe, both of which have dipped below 80% share and are falling fast. Of course, Google still dominates search, but these numbers are very significant.As Tuta reports, with roughly five billion internet users, a shift of just 1% means 50 million people changing their search habits. Drilling into some of the specifics, Google currently sits at 89.71% overall web search share. The last time Google was below 90% was exactly 10 years ago, with an 89.52% share in March 2015. If you zoom out and look at the timeline back to 2009, the earliest date for which Statcounter has figures, it doesn't look like a precipitous drop. However, some of the more granular data implies a fundamental shift away from Google could be underway. For instance, while Google's share of mobile search has remained extremely dominant at around 94%, its share on the desktop is nosediving. Currently sitting at 79.14%, Google had 87.65% share as recently as May 2023. Similarly, Google's market share in Europe has been falling even faster, dropping from 87.08% in May 2023 to 77.78% for the most recent data. So, the question is, why is this happening? In Europe,there's reportedly a recent trendto move away from US tech services to European-based alternatives. But more generally, the quality of Google search results and the increasing use of AI may be part of the explanation. To précisthe broad sentiment on the subject on Reddit, \"searching anything on Google returns maybe one or two real results per page. The rest is AI and ad garbage.\" Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. In other words, the increasing population of the top of the search results list with AI-generated summaries, plus ads, videos and images, means that what you might call \"organic\" results with links to actual websites are being pushed ever further down the page. What's more, Google also seems to be diluting the impact of various search operators, such as quotes, the \"-\" sign for excluding terms and the site: operator, making it harder to narrow down results and filter out the junk. On an anecdotal level, I've personally been shocked by the extent to which Google search resultswill now serve sponsored links from scam websites. Google's policing of its search ad customers seems to be very, very light touch at best. Google still has a very long way to fall before it loses its status as by far the biggest player in search. But these figures are the first chink in its armour for a decade. Is it too much to hope these early signs of decline might convince Google to clean its act up? Probably. But in the long run, perhaps that will be a good thing if it drives more users away and results in a healthier search market with a number of big players instead of a single dominant and increasingly delinquent market dictator.

    "title": "Here are all the partners Intel announced at its 2025 Foundry Direct Connect event but big new customers are notably absent",
    "article_text": "No offers found How many have you heard of before? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last night Intel held its2025 Foundry Direct Connectpresentation where it outlined the next few years for the company in terms of production and fabrication. The company outlined thefuture roadmap of the 18A and second generation 14A nodesalong with their focus on AI computing. As part of this Intel announced its lineup of partners for moving forward on manufacturing further silicon. Sadly, however, there was zero mention of newcustomersfor Intel Foundry, which could either mean it's keeping those deals secret until any negotiations are completed and the ink is dried on the contract, or Intel is really struggling to get companies onboard with its upcoming new processes. A big name would have done a lot to give people confidence in the foundry's future success. Certainly, most of the names Intel dropped in its list of partners probably don't mean much to the average consumer. Most are companies that make the things your stuff is made out of, so it's several rungs removed. So here's all the partners Intel mentioned in the presentation and what they might actually be doing. Synopsyswas one of the first partner companies to crop up and are of no surprise. Intel has partnered with Synopsys for years now in developing and co-optimising nodes to work with and be integrated into wider technologies. Synopsys usually works with other customers it brings to Intel too, so it's largely about collaboration and streamlining designs. Cadenceis another company that Intel partners with in the hopes of optimising design and processes. Its focus is on compatible designs as well as integration into existing ecosystems. Cadence also works on exploratory data analysis, a bit like thatnew robot dog scab Intel hired, which has been integrated into Intel's own processes. Another longstanding partner isSiemens EDA. Siemens EDA is responsible for both digital and physical assistance towards the manufacturing process. This includes working with simulations to test the viability of work and co-developing advanced packaging solutions. The company has a focus on combining software and hardware for the best possible solutions which can have huge benefits when working with AI computing. Similarly to Siemens and Cadence,PDF Solutionsis a company that provides analytics and data integration services. Its main job is to help bridge the gap between design and manufacturing for Intel. It's all about getting production to a point where it can be ramped up easily for customers. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. When it comes to developing 12nm chips,United Microelectronics Corporationis Intel's go to. This partnership allows Intel to focus on other areas of manufacturing and use UMC's established knowledge and skills with 12nm fabrication for those processes. For testing and quality assurance,TeradyneandAdventistare some of Intel's biggest partners. They employ advanced test methodologies and turnkey test services to ensure Intel's productions are meeting all the quality benchmarks and standards. Powertech Technology Inc.help make Intel's chips work with other components on a node basis. They're responsible for Supporting EMIB bumping and packaging, which is essentially how the nodes can connect to each other and other things. It allows Intel to use additional packaging solutions that may integrate better with certain technologies.Amkor Technologyhas a similar role as a partner but with further emphasis on expanding partnership opportunities thanks to connectivity.And lastly there'sASML, previously known as Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography. This company is responsible for allowing Intel to print its nodes in the first place by manufacturing the lithographs required to print these fine nodes on. Its efforts would go directly to helping to reliably print nodes like the 18A using efficient and scalable methods. Most of these partners have been working with Intel for a while, and none come as any particular surprise. Intel's partnerships are mostly about interconnectivity and providing the broadest range of applications for the manufactured chips.

    "title": "Intel outlines new Foundry roadmap with strong AI focus for new nodes",
    "article_text": "No offers found AI computing is set to stay a focus until 2028 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Intel has just held its 2025 Foundry Direct Connect, where it outlines the future of the company especially in terms of chip fabrication. The aptly name direct focuses on what Intel is doing at a manufacturing level, including how it intends to move forward with silicon production. That is of course, when it's not trotting outnew robotic hires days after announcing mass layoffs. The biggest takeaway from this roadmap is Intel has a strong focus on AI moving forward. It doesn't matter which new node you focus on, each has its own AI bent. This doesn't mean Intel is moving to put out its own language model likeChatGPT or DeekSeek. Instead it means Intel's chips are being made to take advantage of AI technologies in computer processing. This is less about helping you do a bad job writing your essay, and more about using machine learning to make the most efficient use of the technology available. Hardware purpose built and optimised for the job delivers the best results when it comes to integrating AI with computer processing. Anyone with some new gaming kit can verify as we've already seen huge gains in the gaming space with things likeAMD's FSR4andNvidia's DLSS4on hardware built for it. On the Intel Foundry Process roadmap we can see four pathways divided up into different fabrication nodes. At the top we have Intel 14A and 18A nodes, and the lower half we see Intel 3 and other mature nodes. It's mostly those top two we are interested in in terms of AI and future technologies. The 18A is of course Intel's current heavy hitter, a self described industry-leading backside power delivery node which has been upgraded with ribbon-shaped transistors for enhanced performance. We also found out we'll be getting the 18A-P, a broader application version of the 18A. The 14A is a second generation backside, built off everything Intel learned white developing the 18a, and both have a noted focus on working with edge and AI. This is bolstered by the new additions to Intel's Foveros 3D packaging system which has been expanded to include Foveros B and Foveros R for new more cost-efficient designs. Again these improvements all have a distinct nod to AI advantages as this technology enables stacking multiple dies for heterogeneous systems. The ability to stack the dies in this way can be critical for AI workloads. According to the roadmap we should see the 18A nodes soon inPanther Lake, with 18A-P expected to release sometime between Q3 of this year, through to early next year. Then we should see 14A in the years to follow starting 2027. AI computing has been moving so rapidly I'm almost scared to see what the 14A chips are going to be capable of by that time.

    "article_text": "No offers found What's that Chip? Little Timmy has fallen down a well? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. It was duringIntel's Direct Connect Keynote for 2025that I witnessed this atrocity of cyberpunk dystopic proportions. After being reassured by the brand that it would be listening to customers in its outlined roadmap, the team from automation was welcomed to the stage to go over some of their improvements. Excitedly they introduce us to their newest team member and Chip a robot dog Intel has worked on with Boston Dynamics takes the stage and obediently gives a bow to the audience. This could be cute, or funny, or even just quirky if it wasn't an incredible slap in the face to all the Intel employees currently worried about losing their jobs. It was only a few days ago reports the company was planning on laying off around20,000 staff memberssurfaced.Intel's new CEO has since said these numbers are exaggerated, but has still confirmed layoffs are to come. Imagine you're waiting to hear if you've got the sack while your boss trots out a new robot employee. Intel's Robotics Architect, Joe Robison, shows off Chips abilities on stage with a demonstration using one of the company's motors. The motor was heated up back stage using a heat lamp to simulate an overheating part in the factory. They demonstrate the thermal imaging, and explain that this information would be sent to a diagnostic computer that would automatically generate a ticket for this overheating monitor. \"Data is like gold, and Chip allows us to expand the amount of data we collect from our assets, allowing us to understand the health of our assets and fix them before failure,\" Robison boasts of his metal coworker.\"Chip enables our workforce to be more productive. We have a full robotic fleet of robots just like Chip around the globe at our facilities and they're helping to make work in our facilities smarter, safer, and more efficient,\" adds Intel robotics engineer, Jessica Unwin. Yes, in all honesty I'm a big fan of robots in the workplace. But that should never be at the expense of human livelihoods. Yes, we should absolutely have robots doing as much work as possible, they're often better at it and more efficient. But we need to be putting the effort and money saved back into the community. Absolutely let the robots take our jobs. Jobs theycantake usually suck. Just give people a way to live. If Intel had trotted out Chip and then announced it would be creating a universal basic income scheme based on the savings the company was amassing by using Chip, then I'd be clapping along with the audience.

Our hint for today'sWordleis a versatile thing. Use it early on as a springboard for your own ideas, ensuring your opening guess is as good as they get. Or save it for later, when you're feeling a bit low on spare rows and green letters. Either way, it'll help you win—and the April 30 (1411) answer is there to catch you no matter what. I'd say I stumbled towards today's answer, an embarrassing series of pratfalls and slip-ups that somehow still revealed fresh yellow and green letters as I went. Maybe that means it wasn't such a bad game after all. Maybe it means I should've taken a minute to breathe before I crashed through the alphabet. Either way, a late win is still better than no win. From the outside they just look plain lazy, but on closer inspection these task-avoiding individuals are actually working very hard… to make sure they don't work at all. No, there is not a double letter in today's puzzle. Playing Wordle well is like achieving a small victory every day—who doesn't like a well-earned winning streak in a game you enjoy? If you're new to the daily word game, or just want a refresher, I'm going to share a few quick tips to help set you on the path to success: There's no time pressure beyond making sure it's done by the end of the day. If you're struggling to find the answer or a tactical word for your next guess, there's no harm in coming back to it later on. Here's your midweek win. The answer to the April 30 (1411) Wordle isIDLER. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Knowing previous Wordle solutions can be helpful in eliminating current possibilities. It's unlikely a word will be repeated and you can find inspiration for guesses or starting words that may be eluding you. Here are some recent Wordle answers: Wordle gives you six rows of five boxes each day, and it's your job to work out which five-letter word is hiding by eliminating or confirming the letters it contains. Starting with a strong wordlike LEASH—something containing multiple vowels, common consonants, and no repeat letters—is a good place to start. Once you hit Enter, the boxes will show you which letters you've got right or wrong. If a box turns ⬛️, it means that letter isn't in the secret word at all. 🟨 means the letter is in the word, but not in that position. 🟩 means you've got the right letter in the right spot. Your second go should compliment the starting word, using another \"good\" guess to cover any common letters you missed last time while also trying to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isn't present in today's answer. After that, it's just a case of using what you've learned to narrow your guesses down to the right word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words (so no filling the boxes with EEEEE to see if there's an E). Don't forget letters can repeat too (ex: BOOKS). If you need any further advice feel free to check out ourWordle tips, and if you'd like to find out which words have already been used, you can scroll to the relevant section above. Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineerJosh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons ofgames like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasn't long before Wordle became so popular it wassold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely it's only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes. When baby Kerry was brought home from the hospital her hand was placed on the space bar of the family Atari 400, a small act of parental nerdery that has snowballed into a lifelong passion for gaming and the sort of freelance job her school careers advisor told her she couldn't do.

Things could get pretty bleak in classic text adventure The Oregon Trail, with dwindling supplies, damaging storms, and hostile entities making the frontier journey a test of resource management and strategy. Dying of dysentery was only one of the risks, along with (depending on which ofthe many versionsyou played) broken limbs, typhoid, or starvation. Wagon, which launches this week on Steam, is a spiritual successor to The Oregon Trail, where the word spiritual is pretty literal. There's a strong thread of the occult running through the 1-bit adventure: the calendar you mark the passage of time with has a pentagram on it, and that's just for starters. And while The Oregon Trail would eventually get bleak, Wagon starts off bleak as hell from the jump. The demo I played opens with a few starving settlers drawing straws to see who will be killed and eaten by the others. Even worse, as the person holding the straws, I can fix the game of chance to make sure I'm not the one who becomes dinner. Sorry, Jerry. With that nasty business out of the way, it's time to build a titular wagon and get it moving, which involves playing and combining cards. Wagon reminds me a lot of Sokpop Collective's survival card gameStacklands. To make a plank I play a saw card with two log cards. To generate ore, I put a \"human\" card on a mine card. To pull my wagon I need to play an ox card on top of it and add another human to lead it. Before long, we're rolling toward Oregon. I'm playing this card game in the back of the wagon, by the way, where a strange and I suspect demonic entity that looks like a little girl shows me the ropes. She appeared after I chopped up my fellow traveler with an axe and then (perhaps foolishly) used a Ouija board to contact the spirits. The recipes I use to combine cards are all listed in my book of Rites, which has an ominous eyeball on the cover and a prayer on the last page that cites \"Omogenu\" as my father and mentions a serpent. I think I was doomed long before my party started eating itself. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But it's fun!

    "title": "LG pulls the final software plug on its phones –here are its 7 best-ever models, ranked",
    "article_text": "Our highlights from LG's impressive phone history When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. RememberLGphones? Not too long ago, the Korean tech giant was one of the most exciting phone makers around, dazzling us innovators like theLG Chocolate'slider' phone and the swivel-screenedLG Wing. But sadly, no more – as spotted byAndroid Authority,LG plans to finally shut down the update servers for its phones on June 30. On a practical level, this means that if you still own an LG phone (a gold star for your commitment, if so), you have exactly two months left to download a final Android update on it before the cord is cut. Yet, the news is arguably more symbolic than practical. It's now four years since LG confirmed that it would stop making smartphones, after an impressive 25-year run of doing so. Indeed, LG was one of the first tech giants to step into the phone space in the 1990s, alongsideSamsungandSony, when it took on Nokia and Motorola and became a big player in the 'feature phones' space. So what exactly were LG's biggest phone hits, and the ones we look back on most fondly? Here's our list – let us know which ones you think are missing in the comments below. The most human phone ever.That was LG’s slogan for the wonderfully crazyLG G Flex- a handset that featured a ‘flexible’ display and ‘self-healing’ back. The device itself was also ‘flexible’. The G Flex had a natural curvature, which LG said allowed it to sit more comfortably against your face, and position the microphone closer to your mouth – who remembers theNokia 8110 ‘banana phone? Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. However, as I said in my review of the phone, “don't get too excited about its flexible abilities...you can't actually go about folding it up. “Lay the LG G Flex face down on a flat surface and at its most curved point the screen is still just a few millimeters above the surface. But then comes the fun part. Apply a decent amount of pressure to the rear of the G Flex and you can flatten the handset out.” And the reaction it got when I showed people this flexible feat? “I was met - without fail – by a sea of wincing faces as the G Flex made seriously concerning creaking and crunching sounds. Sure the handset does flex, slightly, but it never sounds like it's enjoying the workout.” Then there was the ‘self-healing’ back, which was able to soak up minor bumps and knocks, but it certainly wasn’t immune to a scratch or two. The LG G Flex wasn’t the best phone, and it was extremely expensive, but it did what LG did best – something different, something unique, something wild. And that’s what I love. By John McCann The very fact that I refuse to throw this phone away – 18 years after its release – shows the love I have for it. This phone had a 5MP camera, Xenon flash, DVD(ish) quality video recording, a manual zoom button – and atouchscreen. For all you kids out there, you don’t know how exciting this was to use when you’d been only used to tapping away at keys. A keyboard that could move and become a movie screen? Amazing! (Skipping past the fact that there was very little video content out there to actually watch). There was a stylus that you could attach with a little cord (although that quickly got annoying) and I’m certain that if I fired up the phone now, the resistive touchscreen would drive me up the wall (where it senses pressure over spotting the electrical conduct in your fingertips) by inaccurately guessing which part of the screen I wanted to prod. It was rumored that this phone actually outsold the initial iPhone, thanks to the higher spec, lower price (and the factApplewasn’t officially reporting sales figures…), and while that lead didn’t last long, it was entirely deserved in my eyes. By Gareth Beavis When the LG Cookie launched in 2008, it took youngsters by storm. I know that, because I was one, and it marked the first phone I could actually call my own. In hindsight, the Cookie wasn’t all that spectacular, and in fact, LG used it to target the entry-level touchscreen market by keeping the cost of the device as low as possible. That scrimping resulted in a 3-inch, 240 x 400 pixel touchscreen powered by an ARM9E CPU with a clock rate of 175 MHz. It also had a 3.15MP camera capable of capturing videos at 12 frame/s, and no flash option. Pretty impressive, right? No, not really, but the combination of super cool looks (yes, I had the white version) and a neat little stylus hidden away in the phone’s body meant the LG Cookie was, for me, the height of styleandinnovation during my formative years. By Axel Metz It may not have been my first phone, but the enV2 was definitely one of the first – and one I still have in a closet somewhere. The LG enV2 wasn't the original clamshell, but it did have a large number pad with a tiny screen on the front and the ability to fold open to a bigger screen (well, big by non-smartphone standards). With speakers on either side and a closer to full-size QWERTY keyboard, it was a real BlackBerry rival. The LG enV2 offered some smartphone-esque, BlackBerry-esque flair without the smarts, and it was quite fun to use and served me well, even with a removable battery on the back. It also has a decent camera, though not with shots I’d want to share now. But I remember getting pretty good at typing on the inside keys and had a lot of fun responding to text messages on it. In the years since, I reviewed a number of other LG phones. In my early blogging days, I fondly remember chatting with Mr. Mobile – aka Michael Fisher – at LG G3 Day. But the LG enV2 offered a lot of features, even some mini mobile games, in a durable, not-so-smart package. By Jacob Krol TheLG Wingwas supposed to be unlike any other smartphone the world had ever seen. It was the first device in LG’s 'Explorer' series of devices, which would have been a series of products meant to explore unconventional form-factors – such as the LG Rollable. The LG Wing broke every rule of the textbook, with a big and bulky design, far too many moving parts, and at a premium price point for mid-range specs. While it was not really the best phone for the price, it was among the most enjoyable devices that I ever laid my hands on. It was a cool party trick to reveal the second display with just a swipe, in what was probably the most polarizing design of its time. Notably, even for a first-gen product with an unfamiliar form factor, it was surprisinglynot bad, with a decent number of features and third-party apps optimized to make use of the dual-screen approach. The Wing is a fitting swansong for LG’s smartphone journey, cementing its place in the history books as one of the most innovative brands in this space, being unafraid of experimenting and going against the norms; while serving as a reminder of how unforgiving the smartphone market can be. By Aakash Jhaveri 2013 was a big year for LG in the smartphone world. Alongside its G2 flagship and its first bendy phone, it was invited to make the next iteration ofGoogle's Nexus line of smartphones. Nexus was a project from Google that brought in Android phone manufacturers to make hardware designed to show off what the software can do in its purest form. The Nexus 5 was one of the best handsets in the series, and a big part of that is down to LG's impact. The Nexus 5 had a lot of similarities with the LG G2 we've mentioned below (spoiler alert), but this used Android software in a way that Google intended. It felt even sleeker than the LG G2, and it had an affordable price, too. As one of the first smartphones I used as a technology journalist, I began to see what Google was aiming for with its Nexus line on the Nexus 5. I also spotted what LG was capable of in one of the best time periods for LG smartphones, and I'll always have a fondness for this specific phone because of that. By James Peckham There have been a few smartphones over the years that have almost exquisitely got the blend of features, hardware, and price right, and theLG G2(or Optimus G2 in some regions, as the company inexplicably kept jamming a clunky extra word into the title) was just that. This was just a great handset. A 5.2-inch screen washugeat the time, and the 13MP camera was right in the race for the best out there, with loads of great features to tweak and some top snaps being possible. The shiny, rounded plastic shell felt robust in the hand, and the overall interface was brimming with clever little tweaks to improve the basic Android experience. But the main star was the placement of the rear buttons – a power key that was flanked above and below by the volume buttonson the back of the phone! The idea was that this would be more of a natural, ergonomic fit in the hand, given its ‘huge’ size, and therefore you’d be less likely to drop it. Some reviewers found that it was too hard to reprogram the brain to look for the unlock key there, but they weren’t using it for long enough. I sometimes still yearn for it now, and keep wondering why phone brands aren’t using the rear of the phone for some kind of touch interface. Of course, I’m pretty sure the annals of time are making me remember this phone with a rosy hue – Android overlays were often buggy back then, the fiddly camera settings probably irked, and the buttons probably fell off or something. But I remember this phone with true fondness – for a time, it looked like the success of this phone was going to keep LG at the top table of the smartphone world for years to come, but sadly, that never materialized.

    "title": "Amazon's best TV just got some nice free upgrades",
    "article_text": "A new Ambient Display and Dual-Audio arrive When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Amazononly entered the Mini-LED TV market with its ownFire TV Omni brand last year, yet its first entry into a crowded market proved to be not just the best in its line-up, but a compelling budget option. Now Amazon’s rolling out two upgrades to itsbest TV, and you won’t need to pay anything extra to use either of them. As we’ve seen from the likes ofRokuto Amazon in the past, this is a free upgrade for the platform that powers the television. Up until now, you’ve been able to set a static scene for the Fire TV Omni Mini-LED to display when not in active use. These came in the form of works of art, photographs – akin toSamsung’s Frame TVorHisense’s Art TV– or even stack widgets to make the TV into a giant smart display. But with the new update, Amazon is injecting some motion into the artwork. There are now 12 pieces of ‘Interactive Art’ that Amazon promises will make the Fire TV into a \"dynamic art piece.\" These will interact with movement in the space where the TV is, as it tracks motion using a high-fidelity radar sensor built into the unit. Meaning that if you select a koi fish scene, these creatures might swim across the screen, or a butterfly might flutter in via another choice. It seems pretty neat and lives within the Fire TV’s Ambient Experience, and as with anything on the Fire TV, you can ask Alexa to open it up and then select an Interactive Art option. You can also use the remote and, via ‘Quick Settings’, suggest a new Art type to choose from one of the 12. Interactive Art isn’t replacing the pre-existing options either – you can still pick from works of art and photographs, but you can also ask the TV to whip up a work of art through “AI Art.” The second upgrade is one thatAmazon first announced back in December of 2024, and it’s that the Fire TV Omni Mini-LED can send out two streams of sound. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. One stream of sound can be outputted from the TV’s built-in speakers, while another can be streamed to hearing aids via the 'Dual-Audio' feature. This is a long-awaited, customer-requested addition to the Fire TV’s Accessibility feature set. It’s nice to see Amazon now rolling this out to the Fire TV Omni Mini-LED, and it will work with any compatible hearing aid. First, you’ll connect the hearing aid to the TV, but to turn on Dual Audio, you can do it in Quick Settings or the main Settings panel under Accessibility and select the feature. To find Dual Audio or Interactive Art, ensure your Fire TV Omni Mini-LED is running the latest version of theoperating system. Amazon has recently rolled out a software update, so check for it and trigger an update if available. From there, you’ll find these two new features that make Amazon’s best TV even better.

    "title": "Google is working on a Gemini AI app for kids",
    "article_text": "Parental control of AI is on its way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Googleis keen to widen the usage of its Gemini AI assistant and is creating a version of the Gemini app for children, including parental controls on content. The company sent an email to parents about its plans for a Gemini designed for children under 13, firstspottedby9to5Google. Google's email cites comments encouraging managed access to AI from parents, teachers, and experts on kids as the reason for the new app. The child-friendly AI assistant will supposedly help kids with homework, answer idle questions, and help them with creative writing. Parents will be able to set Gemini as the child’s default assistant on Android devices. Of course, as Google is often quick to point out, Gemini can make mistakes. Any kid using Gemini should check with their parents about any facts (and frankly, adults should confirm anything Gemini tells them as well). So if Gemini tells your child that Abe Lincoln invented peanut butter, hopefully they will ask you before they turn in their essay on how the Gettysburg Address was so short because Lincoln had a mouthful of peanut butter and nothing to wash it down. The idea is that if AI tools are going to shape the future of learning, kids should be introduced to them under controlled circumstances. Those digital training wheels will help kids learn how to use AI safely before the parental limits are removed when they're older. The Gemini for Kids app will come with many extra safety and parental control features, powered by Google's Family Link, which provides tools for parents to limit their children's activities online. Parents will be able to monitor their child's Gemini activity and be alerted if their kid starts using it for less-than-pure purposes, asking questions like, “Can you do my science fair project?” or “How can I start betting on football games?\" Schools will also have protections in place. If kids access Gemini through school-issued accounts, administrators can set usage policies and supervise interactions using the Google Admin Console. This is arguably much more than just another checkmark in Google's plans for Gemini. It marks a real push by Google to normalize AI for the whole family, specifically Gemini. Google is planting a flag with the app. If Gemini is a child's first AI app, the one they grow up with, they're more likely to trust it and keep using it in their adult lives too. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. There are serious questions about deploying AI to kids. Making sure Gemini doesn't mislead kids or mess with their critical thinking development is critical. And Gemini is not where kids should find answers to their deepest emotional questions, but it's hard to imagine a child not at least trying to ask Gemini about drama with their friends. To assuage some of those concerns, Google told parents there will be no ads or data harvested from the kids version of Gemini. Instead, the focus will be on learning and creative expression. That it might conveniently train a generation to be comfortable using Google's AI tools is not brought up by the company, but it feels a lot like a very elaborate and high-tech version of a college giving out branded pens to second graders to get them thinking about applying in a decade every time they reach for a pen.

    "title": "YouTube just got a big TV app upgrade – here are 9 new time-saving improvements",
    "article_text": "YouTube is finally getting better on smart TVs and consoles When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. YouTubeis committed to polishing its smart TV experience in a big way this year – and the first signs of its efforts are rolling out now for its app on both TVs and game consoles. AsGoogleannounced in a newYouTube support post, there are nine new UI tweaks that are designed to help you find shows, podcasts, and live music. While they're not quite as big as thepromised redesignof YouTube's TV experience, they should help save you time and effort when navigating the slightly dated app. Firstly, there's a new 'Continue your search' section on the home screen, which will apparently display your top three searches. That sounds handy considering the search experience on TVs can be pretty inconsistent and laborious. Other new home screen sections (which YouTube refers to as 'shelves', for some reason) include 'Listen again' (showing you the top songs you've searched for) and a handy new one called 'Live performances, remixes and covers'. As someone who regularly digs into YouTube's treasure trove of obscure live performances, I can see myself using that quite a bit. Another new section includes one for 'Primetime channels', where you can see the channels you've subscribed to, like Paramount+, Showtime, Starz, or DAZN in one place. It seems the lines between YouTube andYouTube TV,its cable replacement service in the US, could soon start to blur further. The final new 'shelf' (or section) might be the most useful, as you can see in the image above, the 'From your top channels' section provides some shortcuts to your most-watched YouTube channels. That should mean less time hunting in theslightly annoying subscriptions section. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Outside of those new sections, arguably the biggest arrival is a new Podcasts tab. In February, YouTube noted that it is now the most popular service for listening to podcasts in the US (according toEdison Research), so this feature certainly makes sense. Another promising upgrade is that YouTube has now split its more mobile-friendly Shorts from its longer-form videos. There'll now be a 'Shorts Row' in your 'Watch Next' feed, plus a dedicated Shorts section in your Subscriptions tab. It isn't yet clear if this means you'll now never see Shorts in your subscriptions feed (something I'd be happy with), but either way, it should make the experience feel cleaner. If you like your videos to play on repeat, it's also now possible to loop all on-demand videos on YouTube – a feature that was previously only available for playlists. To do that, head into the Playback Settings menu and choose the 'loop' setting. The final UI tweak in this round of updates is that 'inline previews' (the little video teasers you see when hovering over a video thumbnail) have now been expanded to pages for channels, subscriptions, and topics. That feature will likely divide opinion, so it could prove the most controversial of this otherwise positive step forward for YouTube's TV experience. This update should roll out soon for the YouTube app on your Smart TV or gaming console, or by the end of this quarter in June. I haven't received it on myAppleTV box yet, but it will hopefully be available on streaming boxes soon as well. Last week, YouTubecelebrated its 20th birthdayby teasing aredesign of its TVexperience,which is apparently coming \"this summer\" (or by the end of September). It didn't expand much on specifics, but released the preview image above and promised \"easier navigation\" alongside \"streamlined access to comments, channel info, and subscribing.\" These upgrades appear to be focused more on the playback experience than the new homescreen improvements, but are certainly welcome too. The big question is whether we'll also see other 'upgrades' like 'pause ads' sneakily added to the mix alongside the broader redesign. We'll have to wait until later in the year to see, but with a new \"second screen experience\" that lets you use your smartphone to interact with the videos you're watching, also coming later this year, it's clear that YouTube on smart TVs is changing – and mostly for the better.

    "article_text": "Some 25 million people are eligible for a replacement SIM card When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. South Korea’s number one telecommunications provider, SK Telecom, is giving away freeSIM cardsto 25 million of its customers, after the recent USIM cyberattack. However, due to logistics challenges, it won’t be able to service everyone that fast. Earlier in April, news broke that SK Telecom suffered amalwareinfection through which threat actors tried to grab customer USIM information. The attack allegedly happened in mid-April 2025, at night between Saturday and Sunday, when most employees were away for the weekend. A USIM (Universal Subscriber Identity Module) is the successor of the old SIM card. It’s used in 3G, 4G, and 5G mobile networks and is found in most devices with cellular connectivity. At its core, a USIM authenticates the device’s identity on a network, stores subscriber data (International Mobile Subscriber Identity, authentication keys, contacts, and sometimes text messages), encrypts the information passing through, and enables secure access to mobile services such as calls, data, or texts. A cybercriminal could use the data to clone the SIM, track people’s location, bypass app security, or eavesdrop on communications. While the investigation is still ongoing and the number of affected individuals is yet to be determined, SK Telecom announced offering replacement SIM cards to 25 million mobile subscribers, including some two million spilled over from budget carriers. However, it won’t have more than six million units throughout May 2025, which is why the company urged users to book a slot online: “SK Telecom has blocked the misuse of SIM information with its FDS and SIM protection services, but it still offers a free service for customers who want to replace their SIM card,” reads the machine-translated announcement. “Currently, we have 1 million USIMs, and we plan to secure an additional 5 million SIMs by the end of May. However, it is expected that there will be a large number of customers at once, so please check in advance through the online reservation application system.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

    "article_text": "Isuzu says electric D-Max will match diesel performance When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Last week, news broke that theAmazon-backed Slate Autoproject would begin production of its cut-price electric pick-up next year, but the company isn’t alone. While pricing is still to be determined, Isuzu – arguably one of the most iconic names in commercial vehicles – has said that it will release an electric version of its D-Max pick-up truck in 2026. Although its range is startlingly sparse in some markets (only the D-Max is now sold in the UK, for example), the company enjoys success in Asia, including its domestic market of Japan, Thailand and others, where solid, reliable trucks are essential to daily life. The D-Max EV joins the likes of KGM’s (formerly SsangYong) electrified Musso, the Maxus eTerron 9, the upcoming BYDSharkand a raft of cheap electrified pick-up trucks that could soon make their way from China. While the likes of Ford and Chevrolet experienced relatively slow sales of electric pick-ups, the market could soon become the next hotly-contested EV battleground for global manufacturers. Towing, hauling and off-road performance have typically proven barriers to entry for this body style, but Isuzu claims its EV is on a par with the diesel option it also offers: it can carry more than 1,000kg in the bed, tow 3,500kg and accelerate from 0-62mph in 10.1 seconds. The 66.9kWh battery pack is located under the floor and the EV version uses the same ladder chassis as the existing truck. Although here, Isuzu adds permanent four-wheel drive with a motor at the front and rear axles. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. According to the marque, off-road performance isn’t affected by the electrified powertrain, with a hefty 210mm of ground clearance and a wading depth of up to 600mm. There are also steep approach and departure angles for when the terrain gets tough. Isuzu hasn’t revealed an official price for the D-Max EV, but we would expect it to be substantially more than the circa $53,000 / £40,000 / AU$84,000 it currently charges for a diesel-powered version. This puts it in the firing line of theFord F-150 Lightning, which offers an EV range of 230 miles in the most basic variants. Isuzu, on the other hand, says its truck manages around 163 miles on a single charge. As we have seen with various electric pick-ups, including theTesla Cybertruck, hauling or towing loads has a big impact on electric range which, for many, is already too tight for daily use cases. Slate Autohas been honest about battery range and the very basic nature of its upcoming model, but the upshot is that it looks set to be truly affordable. Those trucks offered by Ford, Chevrolet, Rivian, Tesla and now Isuzu are still likely too expensive for many, given the compromises. But electric commercial vehicles are rapidly growing in popularity, as the technology is improving and many governments continue to incentivize their use for environmental reasons. According to one report, the global electric truck market is set to reach a valuation of $78 billion by the end of 2033, up from a $19.5 billion valuation in 2023. With a host of cheaper, electric models due to arrive from China in the coming years, as well as those from more established Western brands, the electric pick-up market could well be the next hotly-contested battleground for sales. Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft.

    "title": "Data centers in China are dumping rare 48GB Nvidia RTX 4090D GPUs for nearly $6,000, but the exact reason remains a mystery",
    "article_text": "It could be a bid to make easy money, or they could be preparing to upgrade When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Some Chinese AI data centers are dismantling and reselling China-specificNvidiaRTX 4090D GPUs, reports have claimed. A report fromDigiTimes Asiasays these 48GB cards, designed to circumvent U.S. export restrictions on the flagship AD102 gaming GPU, and initially deployed as part of China’s AI infrastructure push, are now being pulled from racks, refurbished, and sold on the open market. Data center operators are reportedly finding that this offers a faster and more profitable return than waiting three to five years to recover their investment through GPU rental. Each RTX 4090D sells for between CNY20,000 and CNY40,000 (around US$2,735 to US$5,470), and even if lightly used, the cards require modification for consumer resale. Typically this means converting them from fan-style to blower-style coolers, which are better suited to dense server environments but less effective for single-GPU use. DigiTimes Asiasays this move reflects deeper financial pressure, with many AI data centers struggling to keep their heads above water amid low demand. According to the report, data centers need utilization rates of at least 70% to break even - but current rates are often below 20%. That leaves expensive infrastructure sitting idle while loan repayments loom. Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! This isn’t an isolated case. As we reported recently, China’s rapid AI infrastructure expansion - encouraged by state policy - has led to overbuilding. Hundreds of data center projects were launched across the country in 2023 and 2024, butactual usage has lagged behind expectations. It's no surprise therefore that developers are now offloading hardware to reduce losses. Although overcapacity is likely at least part of the reason behind the selloff, some operators may simply be clearing space for newer technology. With interest moving from large-scale model training to real-time inference, older training-focused systems may no longer be as relevant as they once were. Combined with the latest US export restrictions, which affect chips like Nvidia’s H20, Chinese data centers will be looking at offloading old hardware and shifting to inference-ready setups.

    "title": "Samsung confirms 2025 release for its first Android XR device – here are 3 things I want to see from it",
    "article_text": "Samsung teases Project Moohan release date When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. We had suspectedSamsung’s Project Moohan headset,which it is working on in collaboration withGoogleand its Android XR platform, would arrive sometime in late 2025, andSamsungbasically just confirmed that is the case. During its recentQ1 2025 earnings report,the tech giant shared details about its financial situation and, more importantly for us, information about its hardware releases scheduled for later this year. It confirmed that theSamsung Galaxy S25 Edgewould be launching in Q2 – so sometime in the next couple of months – and revealed that it will “explore new products such as XR,” in the second half of the year. While Samsung doesn’t explicitly mention Moohan by name, previous, more direct comments about the headset have already teased that the device would be landing this year, so this statement is likely referring to its launch. Though it could also be teasing the launch of some other XR hardware, like therecently revealed Android XR glasses. It’s a tad frustrating that Samsung still has yet to give us a firm release window, opting for a six-month time frame, teasing a launch sometime in late 2025. So while we wait, let’s go over what we want to see from the headset when it is eventually shown off, and what leaks support these Android XR dreams. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Something tells us this headset won’t be cheap, with someearly reportssuggesting Samsung is looking at something in the $1,000 / £1,000 / AU$ 1,500 range (just like theMeta Quest Pro). So, if it's going to be costly, at least give us some impressive performance and abilities to justify the cost. I’d love for this headset to feel like a wearable laptop from a productivity perspective – and unlike theVision Pro, it would ideally achieve this goal without you needing a MacBook add-on. I want to be able to seamlessly navigate Google Workspace apps like Sheets and Drive, as well as third-party productivity apps that utilize mixed reality, to help me work more easily than if I were just sitting at my normal desk. It’ll need to be comfy too. I’m fine to have a battery pack in my pocket to help trim some weight from the core device, because I want this headset to feel like I can wear it for hours with no trouble, rather than it being a pain in my neck. Thankfully, early testers have all claimed that the prototype isn’t too uncomfortable, thanks to its adjustable straps and well-shaped face, so here’s hoping the main product is comfy too. Next up, I want this device to be a versatile machine. I don’t want it to be pigeonholed into productivity, or entertainment, or some other XR use. I want it to be a jack-of-all-trades like theMeta Quest 3. This means it needs to have a broad range of worthwhile apps, which is essential for any successful VR headset. It also needs a design that is well-suited for wearing while at a desk or on your couch, as well as while working out and being active. So, beyond being lightweight like I touched on above, it needs to use an easy-to-clean material (like silicone) for parts like its facial interface rather than fabric, so it doesn’t soak up sweat. We’ll have to wait and see what Samsung has up its sleeve, but with its release date set for some time later this year it’s only a matter of time before we see the device in action and can decide if it’s the best-in-class XR device I hope it will be.

When thinking historically, passwords bring to mid verbal phrases used to signify an allegiance to a particular person or group, or to gain access to a restricted room. Nowadays, we use passwords to keep our accounts and files secure. The history of World Password Day doesn't go as far back as secret pass phrases, and the day was in fact founded by Intel in2013 as a way to remind people to better their password security and general account security habits. Thanks Intel. As we hit 3pm here in the UK, Australia has officially ticked over into May 1st 2025, marking the official start of World Password Day 2025 (for those down under at least). Data from Google Trends shows that World Password Day sees a yearly spike beginning in April and peaking in at the beginning of May, with 2022 being particularly big year for World Password Day. Many governments and organizations use World Password Day as a yearly reminder to check the best practices for password security. It's also a great opportunity for phishing and social engineering training. World Password Day is an annual day to recognize the importance of password security and share insights and techniques to improve credential security. Passwords are often the single line of defense between a hacker and your personal info, so having a short and poorly crafted password can result in social engineering, data theft, banking and credit fraud, and even identity theft. Carla Roncato, VP Identity at WatchGuard, summarizes why password security awareness is so important. \"As we mark another World Password Day, the conversation often turns to strengthening password habits and promoting password managers. While those are necessary steps, there’s a deeper, more pressing issue that needs the spotlight: the thriving underground economy trading in stolen credentials on the dark web.\" So, to mark World Password Day 2025 which will begin on the 1st May, we will be sharing recommendations and insights from security experts, alongside password manager deals, advice, and best practices to help keep you and your online accounts safe!

    "article_text": "Amazon criticized for its tariff transparency plans When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has slatedAmazon's plans to display tariff costs on its import-focused Amazon Haul sub-store, calling it a \"hostile and political act.\" According toThe Washington Post, citing two unnamed sources familiar with the matter, Trump had called Amazon founder Jeff Bezos to complain about the reported change. Amazon has sinceconfirmedthat it had \"considered the idea of listing import charges on certain products,\" however \"this was never approved and is not going to happen.\" It's worth noting that this was also a consideration for Amazon Haul, therefore the main Amazon store would have been unaffected. \"He solved the problem very quickly. He did the right thing. Good guy,\" Trump said. However, while Trump's issue with Amazon seems to have been settled, that didn't stop the President's Press Secretary from tying Amazon to Chinese propaganda. The company \"partnered with a Chinese propagandaarm,\" she said. Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% in tariffs, and Amazon Haul competitors like Temu, Shein and AliExpress have started to list tariffs or incorporate them into prices. As it currently stands, the US plans to remove its de minimis exemption, meaning that packages under $800 coming from China/Hong Kong will also be impacted by tariffs. Smartphones and computers currently remain exempt. For consumers, Trump's tariffs have seen companies likeLogitechand Nintendo raise prices, while Temu has also started listing Chinese-shipped items as being sold out for US buyers.

    "title": "'You see the sparkle in her eye again': Andor star Adria Arjona on Bix's cathartic tale of revenge in season 2 episode 6 of the Star Wars show",
    "article_text": "Exclusive: 'It was really special to see her... take ownership of her future once more' When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Andoractor Adria Arjona has opened up on the cathartic \"justice\" that her character Bix Caleen enjoys in this season's sixth episode. Ahead ofAndorseason 2's launch, I sat down with Arjona to discuss Bix's journey in theStar WarsTV show's final installment. As part of our chat, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get Arjona's thoughts on the emotional release Bix feels following events that transpire in season 2 episode 6, titled 'What a Festive Evening', too. Full spoilers immediately follow forAndorseason 2 episode 6 and its predecessor's final few episodes. It's an understatement to say Bix has been put through the emotional wringer in one of thebest Disney+ shows. Her troubles may have begun inAndorseason 1's early entries, which saw Bix contact nascent Rebel Alliance founder Luthen Rael to set up a meeting between him and Cassian Andor. However, the risk she took was nothing compared to the traumatizing events she'd be subjected to later that season. Indeed, when the Galactic Empire invaded Ferrix to track down Cassian, Bix was caught in the proverbial crossfire. As one of Cassian's closest allies (she was his ex-girlfriend, after all), Bix was taken prisoner and psychologically tortured by the callous Doctor Gorst to force her to tell the Empire where Cassian is. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Long story short, Cassian rescues Bix in theDisney+series' season 1 finale and, with Brasso and Wilmon's help, gets Bix to a relative safe haven that, as we learn in this season's first episode, is an agricultural planet in the Outer Rim called Mina-Rau. However, while she escaped physically, Bix is still mentally and emotionally trapped by the horrifying events she experienced. The first three episodes of one of 2025'snew Star Wars shows, the events of which take place 12 months after last season's finale, are not only full of more trauma-laced moments, including almost being sexually assaulted by an Imperial Officer in episode 3, but also reveal she's plagued by nightmares of Doctor Gorst. In chapters four to six, which occur one year after season 2's first act, Box has become addicted to the illegal in-universe substance called Death Stick, which she takes to help her sleep. It's this two-year cycle of never-ending mental and emotional anguish that makes the final sequence depicted in 'What a Festive Evening' all the more cathartic for Bix. Indeed, when Cassian is called upon to conduct a new, mysterious mission for Luthen, Bix wants to tag along. It's a good job she does. Before episode 6 ends, we learn that Cassian and Bix have been sent to dispose of Doctor Gorst, whose secret lab is situated on Coruscant – the same planet the pair have been hiding out on for months. Knowing how important this mission is to her, Cassian lets Bix take the lead. Long story short, she uses the same psychological torture equipment on the evil scientist before Cassian destroys Gorst's headquarters to make it look like it blew up in an experiment gone wrong. I won't spoil what lies in store for Bix in this season's next six episodes – as I noted in myAndorseason 2 review, I've seen all 12 chapters. Nonetheless, episode 6 is a watershed moment for Bix in her efforts to purge herself of the pain and misery inflicted on her – and Arjona fully agreed with that sentiment. \"[Showrunner] Tony [Gilroy] has a really beautiful way of instilling confidence in you without actually giving you a compliment!\" Arjona joked to begin with. \"But, really, I wanted to do justice to how he wrote Bix's arc this season and by what happened to her at the end of season one. \"After last season's finale, I had so many questions for Tony because I was really curious to see how she was going to cope with it. How would she deal with it? Would she shove it under the rug or try to face it head-on? I was really curious to see how she was going to cope with it \"I very much identify with Bix as a character, who's someone who has to act tough and be strong, and be part of something great,\" Arjona continued. \"But, thanks to what happened in season one, she's physically and mentally unable to play a role in the rebellion, which frustrates her. \"That big moment [in episode six] allows her to redeem herself and, as you'll see very soon, she re-finds herself throughout the rest of the season. She has come back into her own and you finally see the sparkle in her eye, which she had in season one, again. It's like 'you've gone through so much, but now you're back to who you were'. It was really special to see her overcome that and take ownership of her future once more.\" Andor season 2 episodes 1 to 6 are out now. Three more episodes will arrive on May 6/7, with the final trio being released on May 13/14.

    "article_text": "Proton Mail could soon stop working in India after a court ruling When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Proton Mail could soon stop working in India following a Court's decision to issue a blocking order against the service. The Karnataka High Court instructed the Indian Government to blockProton Mailon Tuesday, April 29, 2025. A New Delhi firm filed a complaint against the email service last November, accusing some unknown Proton Mail users of sending abusive emails to its employees. The order \"to block ProtonMail\"was issued under Section 69 of the Information Technology Act 2008, the Judge said during the Tuesday hearingstreamed on YouTube, adding that the offending URL \"should be blocked forthwith.\" The decision came as the email service couldn't reveal the details of who sent the allegedly offensive emails. These messages specifically targeted M Moser Design Associates’ female employees and included abusive and derogatory language alongside AI-generated deep-fake images, and explicit content –The New Indian Express reported. This isn't the first time that Indian authorities have threatened the Swiss provider with a blocking order. In February 2024, something similar was suggested in response tohoax bomb threatsthat were sent through the Proton Mail service. \"The issue has been raised to the attention of the Swiss federal authorities, who have been in contact with the relevant Indian authorities to prevent the blocking of Proton Mail in India,\"confirmed Protonat the time. At the time of writing, it is yet unclear when the blocking order will be enforced and if Proton Mail will stop working across the country. Proton Mail's website was still working in India on Tuesday after the Court issued its decision, though,according to TechCrunch checks. TechRadar also successfully accessed Proton Mail via several Indian IP addresses on April 30. We nevertheless recommend getting ready for a potential block by downloading one of thebest VPNservices.

This is all possible thanks to the previousArc Graphics driver 32.0.101.6734, which improved power management at lower wattages (also incorporated in its latest Arc Graphics driver 32.0.101.6739), as Intel highlighted in its release notes. Wepreviously reported on this, but now Team Blue has performance charts to showcase the enhancements. In games likeCyberpunk 2077,God of War Ragnarok,andMarvel's Spider-Man Remastered, both average FPS and 1% lows see significant improvements between drivers 6732 and 6734 while gaming on 17W TDP. Notably,Fortniteon driver 6734 has the biggest uplift in both average FPS and 1% lows; essentially, this increases smoothness with better frame pacing. Considering its 80WHr battery and performance capabilities at a low 17W TDP, the MSI Claw 8 AI+ is probably thebest handheld gaming PCin terms of efficiency. I'd be lying if I said I've been using my Asus ROG Ally consistently; it's been mainly collecting dust, because its battery life is poor. As much as I don't mind staying plugged into a wall socket (same as what you'd do with a gaming laptop), it gets frustrating. I've not had the pleasure of using the MSI Claw 8 AI+ yet, but everything I hear about it makes me want it that much more (especially after theNintendo Switch 2reveal). You'd barely need to push the device beyond 17W, and you'll still have great performance - and I can't say the same about the ROG Ally. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Now, if you do want to use the MSI Claw while on battery, it's still going to last a lot longer than the ROG Ally and other handhelds like theLenovoLegion Go. It's a testament to how MSI turned things around after its initial attempt with theMSI Claw A1Mmodel. Let's hope it can once again outdo itself with a new device in the future...

    "article_text": "Systems are cordoned off as Co-op defends against a cyberattack When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. British supermarket Co-Op has had to take down parts of its IT systems after discovering an attempted cyberattack,The Guardianreports. It seems hackers are attempting to gain access to systems, and the chain is taking “proactive measures” to defend against the attack, which had a “small impact” on the firm’s back office and call centre. This comes just days after another UK supermarket,Marks and Spencers, suffered an outage allegedly linked to ScatteredSpider ransomware- taking out online orders, contactless payments, and Click and Collect systems. In a letter sent to staff, the retailer confirms it has “taken steps to keep systems safe” so had “pre-emptively withdrawn access to some systems for the moment”. It’s not yet known if there is any link between this incident and the M&S ransomware attack. Retailers tend to work with a large number of third parties for logistics, supplies, and software - making them an attractive target for criminals who can use smaller vendors as an access point. The scope of this incident isn’t yet clear, nor is the initial attack vector. A spokesperson for Co-Op told TechRadar Pro that all stores (including quick commerce operations) and funeral homes are trading as usual. “We are working hard to reduce any disruption to our services and would like to thank our colleagues, members, partners and suppliers for their understanding during this period. We are not asking our members or customers to do anything differently at this point. We will continue to provide updates as necessary.” The Metropolitan police has confirmed it’s investigating into the M&S cyberattack, and the chaos of the incident has reportedly cost the firm millions of pounds in downtime and lost sales.

    "title": "Shark goes for broke and straps a water tank onto its latest fan so it can blast you with cool mist all day",
    "article_text": "Frankly, I can't think of anything more refreshing When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Sharkhas abandoned all restraint with the latest addition to its fan lineup. The FlexBreeze Pro Mist comes with a full-size water tank that clips onto the base, enabling it to blast you with a cooling cloud of mist for hours. It's also cordless and UV- and rain-resistant, making it the perfect outdoor hangout companion when the hot weather sets in. Misting capabilities are particularly useful becausefans don't actually cool the air– they just swish it around a bit so itfeelscolder. In contrast, misters do cool the air. If you fill the tank up with chilled water, or pop some ice cubes in there, Shark says the Pro Mist can shift temperatures down by 6C (10.8F), which is enough to take you from hot mess to cool customer. The design converts from full-height pedestal fan to tabletop mode (the latter is still suitable for use with the water tank, but it'll just sit alongside the fan rather than attaching to the stand) and it can oscillate horizontally up to 180 degrees and manually tilt vertically 55 degrees, for wide-ranging cooling. There are five speed modes to choose from, plus two 'SmartBreeze' settings that simulate natural wind – presumably intended for when you're not actually outside – and a remote control for extra convenience. If you're using it indoors, you can of course turn the mist off so you don't end up with damp carpets. And if it's living inside for long periods then the tank can be taken off completely – although it's the main reason to choose this fan, so if you're not in it for the misting, you're better off looking elsewhere in ourbest fanroundup. The FlexBreeze Pro Mist is the third (or fourth, depending where you live) addition to the FlexBreeze line, and the most hardcore option. The original model – which you can read about in ourShark FlexBreeze review– still has a mist function, but you'll need to hook it up to an outdoor water source, which limits the versatility somewhat. If your BBQ doesn't happen to be next to a faucet, no icy clouds for you. There's also a portable option – covered in ourShark FlexBreeze HydroGo review– which offers misting from a small onboard water tank. But that won't last nearly as long as the Pro Mist's big bucket, and the fact it's tabletop-only and can't oscillate means it's really for personal cooling, and less well suited to gatherings. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. Everything about the FlexBreeze Pro Mist sounds delightfully refreshing... although the price might put a dampener on things. At list price, it's$249.99/£249.99, which is on the steep side for a fan that lacks smart features or connectivity. It's also $50 / £50 more than the original FlexBreeze, which is the same but needs to be hooked up to a hose to for misting. That's one expensive bucket. That said, Shark does offer regular sales, so I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for a discount before beach season arrives.

    "article_text": "But there are plenty of reasons to replay When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works. Cronos: The New Dawnwill take around 18 hours to beat, according to its developers. This comes from a recent chat with Wojciech Piejko and Jacek Zięba, directors of the upcoming survival horror game, who commented on how long it will be. \"18 hours,\" replied Piejko in response to my question about the game's length. \"Current play testers are finishing the game in 18 hours,\" he then clarifies, though notes that the team is still \"balancing everything\" so this might change. He goes on to suggest that it could take up to 20 hours, or as little as 16, depending on how you play. Cronos: The New Dawnfollows a time traveler sent back to 1980s Poland in order to rescue important figures from an oncoming apocalypse. The game is being developed by Bloober Team, known for the recentSilent Hill 2remake in addition to other horror titles likeThe MediumandLayers of Fear. Later in our conversation, Zięba reveals that players will be encouraged to replay thanks to the ability to \"unlock new skins\" in addition to access to a harder difficulty option in new game plus, so there's scope for lots of additional time in the game. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. \"There is a big opportunity to play the game again and again and again, as a good survival horror game should,\" he adds. Replaying will also allow you to experiment more with the upgrade system or try out different combinations of weapons. Every playthrough will enhance your understanding of the plot too, which has multiple layers and, according to Zięba, needs to be experienced \"at least twice\" in order to \"understand most of it.\" Cronos: The New Dawnis set to release forPlayStation 5,Xbox Series X,Xbox Series S, and PC later this year.

    "article_text": "Ukraine and the United States signed an agreement on Wednesday that will direct a portion of the revenues from the development of Ukraine’s natural resources into a joint investment fund. Kiev hopes the deal will incentivize US President Donald Trump to maintain military and financial aid amid its ongoing conflict with Russia. The US has been attempting to broker a ceasefire since February, as Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and other top officials in Kiev have accused the Trump administration of promoting“pro-Russian”narratives. The two sides initially planned to sign the agreement in February, but the deal collapsed at the last minute after a meeting between Trump and Zelensky devolved into a heated argument. According to reports, US officials had originally pushed for a 50% American ownership of Ukraine’s rare-earth minerals – an offer Zelensky rejected at the time.",

    "title": "US and Ukraine sign minerals deal",
    "article_text": "Washington and Kiev have signed a minerals deal granting the US access to developing Ukraine’s natural resources, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Ukrainian Economy Minister Yuliya Sviridenko announced on Wednesday. The agreement comes as Ukraine seeks security guarantees from Washington as part of a potential peace deal with Moscow that US President Donald Trump is working to negotiate. The deal sees the establishment of the United States-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund.“President Trump envisioned this partnership between the American people and the Ukrainian people to show both sides’ commitment to lasting peace and prosperity in Ukraine,”Bessent said in a statement. The full text of the agreement has not yet been released. Sviridenko said the fund will be jointly managed by Ukraine and the US“on a 50/50 basis,”and that“neither side will hold a dominant vote.” She said that 50% of the revenue from new licenses in the fields of critical materials, oil, and gas will be directed to the fund. “Full ownership and control remain with Ukraine,”the Ukrainian minister added.“It is the Ukrainian state that determines what and where to extract. Subsoil remains under Ukrainian ownership – this is clearly established in the Agreement.” According to Sviridenko, the deal does not alter privatization processes or the management of state-owned companies. She said that the oil and gas giant Ukrnafta, as well as Energoatom – the operator of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants – will remain under government ownership. While the Biden administration approved large aid packages for Ukraine, including the supply of advanced weaponry, the current US president has focused on shifting the burden of assistance to Kiev’s European supporters. In February 2025, the US went so far as to halt all military support to the country following a tense Oval Office meeting between US President Donald Trump, US Vice President J.D. Vance, and Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky. According to various estimates, Washington has provided at least $170 billion to Kiev. The White House insists those expenses should be compensated via access to Ukraine’s mineral resources, including rare earth elements critical to high-tech industries. Negotiations between the two countries over a minerals agreement have been underway since the early days of Trump’s return to office. A preliminary memorandum of intent was signed on April 17, but the US president has publicly criticized the delay in finalizing the deal. In a post on Truth Social on April 25, he accused Zelensky of being“three weeks late”in signing it and demanded that it be completed“immediately.” Although the minerals agreement does not explicitly include US security guarantees for Ukraine, it is described as“an expression of a broader, long-term strategic alignment . . . and a tangible demonstration of the United States of America’s support for Ukraine’s security, prosperity, reconstruction and integration into global economic frameworks,”according to the Financial Times. Zelensky said last week that Kiev hopes to receive long-term security assistance from Washington, similar to the US-Israel model. Meanwhile, Trump declined to clarify whether the US would continue to provide military aid to Ukraine if a peace agreement between Kiev and Moscow is not reached.“I want to leave that as a big, fat secret, because I don't want to ruin a negotiation,”he said in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday. Axios reported last week that Washington had given Kiev what President Donald Trump called a“final offer”to resolve the conflict. The United States has expressed mounting frustration over the lack of progress in the peace negotiations. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that Washington may withdraw from the talks entirely if they stall. In February,Reuterscited estimates from two Ukrainian think tanks stating that about 40% of Ukraine’s metal resources are now under Russian control. According to the Center for International Relations and Sustainable Development (CIRSD), between 50% and 100% of the lithium, tantalum, cesium, and strontium deposits claimed by Ukraine are located in territories currently controlled by Russia.",

    "article_text": "Washington and Kiev are poised to sign a major resource agreement, which US President Donald Trump has been pushing for months. Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko has flown to the US to seal the deal, Prime Minister Denis Shmigal said on Wednesday, adding that the document was to be signed within 24 hours. Neither the US nor Ukraine have officially presented the details to the public yet. Reuters, which claims to have seen the draft of the document, reported that it would involve creation of a joint fund that would receive half of all profits the Ukrainian government gets from any new natural resources permits issued in Ukraine. The document reportedly does not specify how the money is to be spent or who controls the spending decisions. The agreement would provide the US with preferential access to any new Ukrainian resource deals but would not give it direct control over Ukraine’s mineral resources or gas infrastructure, according to Reuters. Kiev also reportedly refused to include any requirements that it pay the US back for billions of dollars spent on military assistance. America can still count any new military aid as its contribution to the joint fund, according to Shmigal. The two sides have reportedly hit a last-minute snag ahead of the signing of the accord, according to sources cited by Reuters and CNN. Washington reportedly insists on signing two technical documents detailing certain provisions of the deal together with the agreement. Kiev insists that the agreement must first be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament before other documents can be signed, according to Financial Times. Speaking at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that Ukraine sought to make last-minute changes to the already agreed deal.“We’re sure they’ll reconsider that. We are ready to sign this afternoon, but they aren’t,”he told journalists. President Donald Trump then stated that“we’ve made a deal where our money is secure where we can start digging and do what we have to do.”It is unclear if he was referring to the original US proposal or the final deal. The White House has yet to make any official announcement.",

    "title": "Dmitry Trenin: Here’s why Trump’s foreign policy is calculated, not chaotic",
    "article_text": "The first 100 days of Donald Trump’s second presidency have sparked a wave of commentary portraying him as a revolutionary. Indeed, the speed, pressure, and determination with which he has acted are striking. But this view is superficial. Trump is not dismantling the foundations of the American state or society. On the contrary, he seeks to restore the pre-globalist republic that the liberal elite long ago diverted onto a utopian internationalist path. In this sense, Trump is not a revolutionary, but a counterrevolutionary – an ideological revisionist determined to reverse the excesses of the liberal era. At home, Trump benefits from Republican majorities in both houses of Congress. Legal challenges to his policies – particularly on downsizing government and deporting illegal immigrants – have so far made little progress. Accustomed to media attacks, Trump continues to hit back hard. The recent story alleging that top officials debated strikes on Yemen over Signal has not gained political traction. If anything, it reinforces Trump’s image as a president who acts decisively and without fear of scandal. Trump’s economic course is clear: re-industrialization, tariff protectionism, and investment in cutting-edge technologies. He is reversing decades of globalist integration, pressing allies to pool financial and technological resources with the US to rebuild its industrial base. Tactically, Trump applies pressure early, then offers retreats and compromises to lure competitors into negotiations favorable to America. This approach has been effective, particularly with Washington’s allies. Even with China, Trump is betting that Beijing’s reliance on the US market, and America’s influence over EU and Japanese trade policy, will yield strategic concessions. In geopolitics, Trump embraces a realist doctrine grounded in great-power competition. He has defined his global priorities: secure North America as a geopolitical fortress from Greenland to Panama; redirect US and allied power toward containing China; make peace with Russia; and consolidate influence in the Middle East by supporting Israel, partnering with Gulf monarchies, and confronting Iran. In the military sphere, Trump is pursuing greater American strength by purging the armed forces of“gender liberalism”and accelerating strategic nuclear modernization. Despite his public peace overtures, he has continued airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen and has warned of devastating retaliation against Iran should negotiations fail. His approach to Ukraine reflects strategic pragmatism. Trump aims to end the war quickly, not out of sympathy for Russia, but to free US resources for the Pacific theater and to reduce the risk of escalation into a nuclear conflict. He expects Western Europe to assume more responsibility for its own defense. Importantly, Trump does not see Russia as a primary adversary. He views Moscow as a geopolitical rival, but not a military or ideological threat. Rather than pushing to sever Russia from China, he aims to re-engage Russia economically – in areas like energy, the Arctic, and rare earths – with the expectation that greater Western economic engagement will reduce Moscow’s dependence on Beijing. In fact, outreach to the Kremlin has become the centerpiece of Trump’s foreign policy in his second term. His goal is not to divide Moscow and Beijing outright, but to lay the groundwork for a new global balance of power in which Russia has options beyond the Chinese orbit. In sum, Trump is not tearing down the American system but striving to restore it. His counterrevolution is aimed at reversing liberal-globalist distortions, reinforcing sovereignty, and returning realism to international affairs. It is this mission – not chaos or confrontation – that is defining his presidency. This article was first published byKommersant, and was translated and edited by the RT team.",

    "title": "Ukraine backtracked on resources deal – US Treasury",
    "article_text": "Kiev has made last-minute changes to a minerals deal it was expected to sign with Washington on Tuesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said. Tense talks over the agreement have simmered between the US and Ukraine for months. President Donald Trump has advertised the deal as a way for Washington to recoup what he describes as some $350 billion the US has spent on backing Kiev in the current conflict, through the future joint exploitation of its mineral resources. The Ukrainian side made alterations to the document just as they were expected to seal the deal, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said during a press conference in the Oval Office on Wednesday. “Our side’s ready to sign. The Ukrainians decided last night to make some last-minute changes,”he told reporters. “We’re assured that they will reconsider that,”Bessent said, adding that he hopes the deal will be signed on Wednesday afternoon. A delegation from Ukraine led by Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko went to the US after securing a clause that stipulated only future military aid would count for Washington’s contribution to the deal, rather than the totality of the aid provided so far, Financial Times wrote on Wednesday. According to a copy of the agreement seen by the outlet, under the deal, the US and Ukraine would invest into Ukrainian mining, energy and related technology sectors via a joint investment fund and through the exploitation of the country’s mineral wealth. Sviridenko was told to“be ready to sign all agreements, or go back home,”FT wrote, citing anonymous Ukrainian officials. The US wants Ukraine to sign both the framework pact and a detailed agreement on the proposed fund that would seal the full minerals deal, the newspaper wrote. Kiev’s team refused to sign the documents as“the fund agreement must be ratified by their country’s parliament before it can be signed,”FT wrote, citing its Ukrainian sources. Trump has increasingly criticized Kiev and Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky for slow progress towards concluding the agreement. In late February, the two had a public altercation in the Oval Office, just as the deal was widely expected to be signed. During the heated exchange, Trump accused Zelensky of not being thankful for US aid, and of“gambling with World War III,”for not negotiating with Russia.",

    "article_text": "The European Commission (EC) has admitted that it will negatively impact Serbia’s EU bid if President Aleksandar Vucic visits Moscow’s Victory Day celebrations as planned on May 9. Russia plans to host a military parade in the center of the capital to mark the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s 1945 triumph over Nazi Germany in World War II. EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas warned earlier this month that the bloc does not want any member or candidate states attending the event. EC Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos met with Vucic on Tuesday and warned that his presence in Moscow would be held against Serbia’s EU aspirations, spokesperson Guillaume Mercier said in a press briefing in Brussels on Wednesday. “The participation of President Vucic at the military parade in Moscow will impact”Belgrade’s EU accession process, the EC spokesperson said. “She passed on the message that was shared by many other EU member states that the participation in Moscow will have an impact on the EU path,”he said when asked about what the EU response could be, but declined to elaborate further. As Belgrade is vying for membership in the bloc, Serbia should use the occasion to demonstrate its“strategic direction,”Mercier said. Earlier this month, Vucic told the press that he had not changed his decision to visit Moscow for the May 9 celebration. A unit of the Serbian Armed Forces will take part in the Victory Day parade on Red Square, the president said. During World War II, Serbia, then part of Yugoslavia, was occupied by the Nazis and was liberated by the Red Army in 1944. Moscow has extended numerous invitations to the May 9 celebration, including to China, India, and Brazil, as well as other international leaders. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will miss the event due to highly elevated tensions with neighboring Pakistan, but Defense Minister Rajnath Singh is expected to represent New Delhi at the event. Russian President Vladimir Putin has hailed the courage of European leaders who have chosen to attend and celebrate the memory of the fight against Nazism, despite pressure from Brussels.",

    "title": "Harris’ husband claims Trump fired him from Holocaust Museum",
    "article_text": "Douglas Emhoff, the husband of former US Vice President Kamala Harris, has criticized the administration of President Donald Trump for what he describes as“politicizing”the Holocaust. In aposton X on Tuesday, Emhoff said he had been informed of his removal from the US Holocaust Memorial Council, describing the move as a political decision that turned“one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue.” According to the New York Times, Emhoff is among several appointees of former US President Joe Biden dismissed from the council. Their appointments, announced in January, typically carry five-year terms. The council was created by Congress in 1980 to oversee the museum which opened in 1993 to commemorate the Holocaust. The White House Presidential Personnel Office reportedly emailed council members on Tuesday on behalf of President Trump, stating their positions were“terminated, effective immediately.”Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president“looks forward”to appointing members who will honor Holocaust victims and be“steadfast supporters of the State of Israel.” In a similar move, Trump announced in February that he would end the terms of multiple members of the Kennedy Center board and make himself chair of a new board. The Holocaust Museum did not mention the firings in its Tuesday statement, saying it looks forward to advancing its mission“in partnership with the Trump administration.” The development comes as Harris, who lost the race for president in November, is set to deliver a ‘call to action’ speech on Wednesday at the Emerge 20th anniversary gala in San Francisco, which will urge activists to speak out against Trump, according to CNN. Democrats are reportedly watching Harris for signs she may run again in 2028. Trump has ruled out seeking a third term, despite previously hinting at the possibility on multiple occasions. In an interview with The Atlantic published on Monday marking his first 100 days in office, he said bypassing the constitutional limit in 2028 would be a“hard thing to do.”",

    "article_text": "The Israel Defense Force (IDF) has launched a drone strike against an“extremist group”in Syria. In a joint statement Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz called the attack a“warning operation”aimed at preventing violence against a Syrian Druze minority. The strike targeted a“gathering of an extremist group that was preparing to continue its attack on the Druze population”in Syria, according to the Times of Israel. IDF Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir has reportedly ordered troops to further target Syrian government sites“if the violence against the Druze does not stop.” Clashes between the Syrian government-linked armed groups and Druze fighters have erupted around Damascus, according to AFP. At least 11 people were killed as“outlaw groups targeted civilians and security forces”in the Damascus suburb of Sahnaya on Wednesday, just a day after similar clashes claimed 17 lives in Jaramana, a mainly Druze and Christian suburb, according to the news agency. The new Syrian authorities are dealing with tensions following sectarian violence in the coastal Latakia province, mostly targeting Alawites and Christians, that reportedly claimed 1,000 lives. The violence prompted the US and Russia to denounce the persecution of Syrian minority groups, while the EU blamed“pro-Assad elements”attacking“interim government forces.” Syria’s Interior Ministry has claimed the Israeli strike killed one member of the Syrian national security force, deployed to the area to stop clashes between armed groups, according to Reuters. The Syrian SANA news agency confirmed the Israeli strike but provided no information on any casualties. Druze are a minority religious group that follows an offshoot of Islam and makes up 3% of Syria’s population. Some Druze in southern Syria asked for Israeli protection, calling it the“lesser evil”after the ousting of Bashar Assad in December following a surprise insurgency by Islamist forces.",

    "title": "UK joins US air strikes against Houthis in Yemen",
    "article_text": "The UK has begun to support the US in attacking Yemen’s Houthi militia. The British Ministry of Defense said on Wednesday its forces had conducted joint airstrikes against what it claimed was a Houthi-controlled military facility. The development came against the backdrop of Houthi-linked reports stating that another US attack hit a migrant detention center, resulting in dozens of civilian deaths. At least 68 African migrants were killed in the strike on the facility on Monday, the militia’s Al Masirah TV Channel reported, adding that 47 people were injured. A US defense official said that the nation’s military were aware of the claims about civilian casualties. US President Donald Trump launched a large-scale air and naval strike campaign against Yemen-based Houthi targets last month to protect shipping in the Red Sea from Houthi attacks. According to London, Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon fighter jets and US warplanes struck a“cluster of buildings”located about fifteen miles south of the capital, Sanaa, on Tuesday. The facility was reportedly used by the Houthis to manufacture drones for attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. The Houthis have been targeting vessels they associate with Israel as part of a strategy to pressure West Jerusalem over its military operations in Gaza. Israel launched its campaign following a deadly raid by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in October 2023. The rebel group controls western Yemen, including the capital and the strategic port of Hodeidah. In support of the Palestinians in Gaza, the Houthis have launched kamikaze drones and missiles at commercial ships and fired ballistic missiles at Israel. They have stated they will halt their attacks once Israel ends its campaign against Hamas. President Trump has instructed the Pentagon to intensify strikes in Yemen, warning that the Houthis will be“completely annihilated”if they do not stop targeting shipping in the Red Sea.",

    "title": "Kim Jong-un demands nuclear navy",
    "article_text": "North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has called to accelerate arming the country’s navy with nuclear weapons, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Wednesday. Kim made the statement while attending a weapons system test of the DPRK’s Choe Hyon multi-mission destroyer ship. After witnessing the demonstration, he is said to have noted that the warship’s firepower still relies on conventional weaponry and“cannot be called a reliable means of maritime defense.” It is“high time to make a responsible option for accelerating the nuclearization of the Navy in order to defend the state and its maritime sovereignty from existing and future threats,”Kim announced, according to KCNA. Russia has also pledged to help protect North Korea if such a need arises. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this week that the defense agreement between Moscow and Pyongyang is still“in effect.”The deal obligates both parties to provide immediate military assistance to each other if necessary. The partnership treaty was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kim in June 2024 after which North Korean troops officially joined Moscow’s military operation aimed at repelling a Ukrainian incursion into Russia’s Kursk Region. Putin has since expressed gratitude to Pyongyang’s soldiers for the role they played in liberating the region and noted that they had demonstrated a great deal of’“heroism, high level of specialized training and bravery.”",

    "title": "Karin Kneissl: Massive blackouts are what green agenda gets you",
    "article_text": "It was probably the weather that triggered the ten-hour breakdown of all utilities on the Iberian Peninsula earlier this week. It was also the weather that has turned Germany into Europe’s top CO2 emitter. There are days when the sun does not shine, and the wind does not blow. And then the backup is coal in the absence of nuclear power or natural gas (from Russia). An even bigger threat to the grid, however, stems from overproduction of electricity due to too much sun and wind. Both Spain and Germany proudly point out their statistics in terms of power generation based on huge onshore and offshore wind farms and extensive photovoltaic panels, often constructed on precious arable soil. Spain and Portugal are champions of green energy in the EU, and were sourcing 80 percent of their electricity from renewables just before the outage hit on Monday. The larger underlying problem is in transmitting rather than generating electricity. Large parts of the existing grids in the EU were constructed in the 1950 and 1960s, when it was fairly easy to build infrastructure in the post-war towns. When Angela Merkel announced her ambitious energy transition, Peter Altmaier, the head of the Chancellor’s office announced the building of several thousands of kilometers of“electricity highways”(Strom Autobahnen). The slated budget was one trillion euros. But that budget was never established and nobody in Merkel’s government calculated the years for administrative planning and implementation. So, the new grid was never built, neither in Germany nor elsewhere. The current grid is not made for to absorb constantly increasing volumes. The“electrification”of all forms of energy production and consumption, above all in mobility, poses a serious problem for the stability of the existing grids. Electric vehicles were supposed to replace cars with the traditional internal combustion engines. The hype surrounding the electric car has already died down. Customers simply refrain from buying an electric car. But the ambitious green agendas rarely take into account serious investments and above all solid timeframes for an enlarged electrical grid. The European electrical grid stretches from Türkiye across the European continent to North Africa. Its technical name is Continental European Synchronous Area, and it is vulnerable. It is fed with an alternating current with a frequency of approximately 50 Hertz. In case of an overload, as probably happened on Monday in Spain, the risk is high that the frequency is destabilised. In order to pre-empt a power cut, since power plants will automatically shut down, the overload is sent abroad. Some voices claim that the Iberian Peninsula lacks interconnectors, while others warn against more interconnectors since this would only put the entire grid at risk, a domino blackout across more than 30 countries. In 2012, the Austrian writer Marc Elsberg published his thriller“Blackout.”The plot describes a fictional 13-day power outage and the ensuing total breakdown of life as we know it. In the well-researched book, the blackout is caused by a cyber-attack. Many commentators eagerly suggested that one was behind the real-world crisis on Monday. Apparently, no one is ready to discuss the problem with the grid and green deal ambitions. Attending energy conferences for years and teaching the topic of geopolitics of energy, I often wondered about the romantic fantasy models that Brussels officials and other climate experts presented.  For the last 15 years, we witness an inflationary concept of“energy transition”or even worse, zero-carbon economy. Throughout the entire EU we have seen a focus on climate change. The approach lacks a solid energy policy, one which covers security in supply, affordability, and investments into grids. I expected a major blackout to happen in Germany, rather than on the Iberian Peninsula. The so-called energy transition declared by the Angela Merkel government in spring 2011 did not deliver at all. In the first quarter of 2025, instead of more electricity from wind and sun, more electricity was generated from coal and gas. Easter week also showed why the so-called energy transition is causing problems. Despite the record expansion of wind and solar power, renewables are producing less electricity than at any time since 2021. Compared to the first quarter of last year, the amount of electricity produced by renewables in the same period this year fell by 16 percent. The wind was not particularly strong in February and March. Electricity production from offshore wind turbines fell by a total of 31 percent, while production on land fell by 22 percent. As a result, electricity production from coal, oil, and gas had to be drastically increased. The logical consequence: CO2 emissions have risen dramatically. Electricity in Germany was dirtier than it had been since the winter of 2018. However, it is not only in the medium term that the energy transition is not doing what its supporters believe it should. Easter week exemplifies all the problems associated with the plan to switch Germany’s energy production to mainly wind and solar. On a sunny Easter Sunday, for example, the five million or so solar installations in Germany produced far more electricity than would have been needed to cover demand during the holiday. However, electricity must be consumed exactly when it is produced, otherwise the electricity grid may be disrupted. This applies both nationally and to the local electricity grids on site and the regional capacities of the weather-dependent energy sources. Due to the gigantic oversupply – 15 gigawatts too much, the output of a dozen average nuclear power plants – the price of electricity has fallen into negative territory at times, as low as -5 cents per kilowatt-hour. Germany has paid the French, Belgians etc. millions of euros to buy Germany’s surplus electricity so that the German electricity grids do not collapse. However, this blatant surplus of electricity has not only meant that a lot of electricity has had to be sold abroad for a fee and lines to France and Belgium have had to operate at full capacity, there have also been numerous power outages in south-west Germany in particular, which could be linked to the oversupply and local grid overload. The real drama is that the numerous solar plants in Germany cannot be controlled, regulated or even taken off the grid when electricity production exceeds demand. If there is a lot of sunshine – possibly accompanied by a lot of wind – on an afternoon with low electricity demand, Germany has increasing problems getting rid of the surplus energy. This not only increases the potential for regional power outages and so-called“brownouts,”it also greatly increases the cost of electricity production overall – as Easter has shown. Storing electricity is a fundamental problem that has not been solved. Big companies like Siemens experimented for more than a decade with steam engines transforming electricity produced by windmills into hydrogen, in order to stock and transport it. Those experiments did not result in a viable commercial business model. Meanwhile Siemens, once upon a time in the 1960s a leader in nuclear technology, has abandoned its entire energy branch. In 2020, the energy division was separated from Siemens. However, Siemens Energy ambitiously wanted to grow in the wind energy business and merged with the Spanish company Gamesa. But just three years later, it was clear that this would not work. Were the reasons additional management mistakes, was it Chinese competition or were there other issues? Siemens Energy turned from a beacon of hope to a stock market nightmare. New bad news came from quarter to quarter. It was the wind power business, of all things, that slipped deeper and deeper into deficit. The Managing Board of Siemens Energy had to lower its forecasts countless times, and Siemens lost lots of money with its mergers in Spain. If the management had stamina, they would investigate thoroughly the power outage of last Monday and publish the conclusions. What happened in Spain and Portugal could happen at any moment in Germany and Austria. Twenty-five years ago, I was involved in the municipal council of the village where I lived in Austria until 2020, when I was forced to quit. We had worked on emergency scenarios for a blackout. One item was to organize“islands of infrastructure”in military barracks and other buildings. The plan was that in case of emergency, people would be able to walk there and be provided with food, water, and first aid.  In those days, there was still a generation of leaders who were hands-on and who knew how to get things done. Later I realized that this generation of men and women had passed away. In today’s EU, any such crisis would probably lead to a humanitarian disaster, to a total breakdown of public order. I remember well the blackout that hit Northern Italy in 2003 and another one in the US; both were protracted and citizens were left in the dark and cold. In war-torn Iraq, people were wondering how those Western armies and NGOs would ever build up the electricity after the US invasion since they were unable to do it back home. Having lived in Lebanon until the summer of 2023, I am fully aware of constant power cuts and know the nuisance of running one’s own generator, the bad smell, and the noise of all the generators around. But diesel can provide a regular flow of electricity, which no solar panel can do. But thanks to affordable Chinese solar panels, nearly every household in Lebanon has one. Interestingly, hospitals in Spain and Portugal continued to provide services thanks to their diesel generators. Emergency operations could be done and intensive care was secured. But what about the internet and mobile phone providers? The entire system of mobile communication broke down. Even speeches by the heads of governments could be watched abroad but not by concerned citizens. I sometimes joked with my Lebanese friends that they should do crash courses for EU institutions on how to live without a regular supply of electricity. Using common sense, keeping good relations with one’s neighbors and knowing how to handle a diesel generator are certainly helpful. And where does the diesel come from? Yes, Russian oil companies used to provide huge volumes of diesel to their EU customers. The Rosneft refinery of Schwedt close to Berlin was confiscated by the German authorities in 2022. The back-up for all those renewable efforts used to be natural gas, mostly from Russia, termed the“energy of transition.”There was a consensus that cooperating on oil and gas within the European continent was of benefit to both sellers and buyers. These days are gone. What happened on Monday on the Iberian Peninsula was another wake-up call. But so far EU officials seem stuck in their green agenda. They could have understood previous signals, but they refused to do so. In the EU, energy has become an ideological topic and is no longer a technical matter. What Spain and Portugal went through earlier this week lasted for about 10 hours, and I expect more such incidents. One can handle it in a country like Lebanon, but the question remains: can one run an industry with constant power cuts? Deindustrialisation inside the EU will only accelerate. If one day, certain countries would like to buy Russian gas again, the volumes will be much smaller due to more limited industrial production.",

    "title": "Zelensky pleaded with Trump in Vatican – The Economist",
    "article_text": "Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky tried to persuade US President Donald Trump during their brief conversation at the Vatican not to give up on his efforts to settle the conflict between Moscow and Kiev, according to The Economist. Trump and Zelensky got together for some 15 minutes on the sidelines of Pope Francis’ funeral on Saturday. The negotiations“produced a striking photograph of the two men sitting in St. Peter’s Basilica, locked in conversation as apparent political equals,”The Economist wrote on Tuesday. Ukrainian sources told the outlet that Zelensky used the discussions“to deliver a simple message: Ukraine is ready for an unconditional ceasefire, Russia is not, and Mr. Trump should not abandon a peace that only he can deliver.” Russia previously called the 30-day ceasefire demanded by Kiev“unrealistic,”stressing that talks can take place without a pause in the fighting. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned over the weekend that Washington could disengage from the peace process if it does not see rapid progress from Russia and Ukraine towards an end to the fighting. The mood in Ukraine is now“cautiously optimistic”because the officials in Kiev believe that“after months of threats and blackmail,”Trump has finally started“to respect”Zelensky, the Economist wrote. The talks at the Vatican became the first in-person conversation between the two leaders since their meeting at the Oval Office in late February, which devolved into a shouting match in front of the cameras. At the time, Trump and US Vice President J.D. Vance accused Zelensky of being ungrateful for the American aid and not being interested in peace. The public quarrel resulted in the Ukrainian leader’s visit to the White House being cut short. Following the meeting at the Vatican, Trump described Zelensky as“calmer,”saying that the Ukrainian leader now“understands the picture. And I think he wants to make a deal. I do not know if he wanted to make a deal [before]. I think he wants to make a deal.” On Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated Moscow’s readiness to engage in direct talks with Kiev without any preconditions. As for the ceasefire, Russia considers it“a precondition that will be used to further support the Kiev regime and strengthen its military capabilities,”he explained.",

    "title": "US-Ukraine resource deal imminent – Bloomberg",
    "article_text": "Ukraine is preparing to sign a long-discussed minerals agreement with the US as early as Wednesday, Bloomberg has reported, citing sources. Talks over the deal – which includes a joint fund for developing the country’s resources – have been a source of tension between Kiev and Washington for months. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denis Shmigal confirmed that the sides are expecting to sign the deal within 24 hours, adding that Kiev would hand over half of the proceeds from resource extraction to the joint US-Ukraine fund. Ukraine and the US have been working since February to finalize the agreement granting Washington access to the country’s deposits of rare earths and other minerals. The administration of US President Donald Trump has described the deal as a pathway to recouping funds Washington has spent aiding Ukraine in its conflict with Russia. However, Ukrainian officials have insisted that all US support was provided unconditionally. According to a person familiar with the matter interviewed by Bloomberg, the sides have completed a draft agreement. As a result, Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko is said to be on her way to Washington for the signing. The agreement outlines the creation of a joint fund for managing investment projects in Ukraine and aims to increase cooperation in mining, energy, and related technology. A draft of the deal also shows Washington has acknowledged Ukraine’s EU integration goals and agreed the deal should not conflict with them. The US has also reportedly agreed that only future military aid to Kiev would count toward its contribution to the investment fund. Earlier, Washington insisted that past military aid should also be included in the agreement. The development comes after Sviridenko signed a preliminary memorandum on the resource deal earlier this month. Despite this, Trump later criticized the Ukrainian leadership for slow progress, demanding the agreement be signed“immediately.” The deal was widely expected to be signed in late February during Vladimir Zelensky’s visit to the White House. However, the Ukrainian leader entered into an open spat with Trump, who accused Zelensky of“gambling with World War III”and showing reluctance to accept a ceasefire with Russia.",

    "title": "Ivan Timofeev: This late Soviet leader’s legacy is a warning to Trump",
    "article_text": "In Donald Trump’s second term, US foreign policy has taken a series of sharp, often surprising turns. His administration has veered from seeking rapprochement with Russia to publicly dressing down Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky; from berating European allies for their democratic lapses to launching trade wars against traditional partners; from floating ambitions about acquiring Greenland and hinting at absorbing Canada as the“51st state,”to tearing down iconic soft power institutions like USAID, Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty, and Voice of America. It’s tempting to think of this as uniquely Trumpian – but history offers a compelling parallel. Four decades ago, across the Atlantic, a newly appointed Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, came to power. What began as a cautious shift in Moscow’s external posture soon morphed into a sweeping“new thinking”in foreign affairs. Gorbachev ended the Cold War – but also presided over the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Could Trump play a similar role for the United States? How far could his initiatives go – and what might they mean for America’s future? At face value, Trump and Gorbachev appear worlds apart. One grew up wealthy, the other in modest circumstances. One is brash and combative, the other was warm and conciliatory. Trump lives large, a self-styled playboy; Gorbachev remained devoted to his wife and never sought personal wealth, even amid Soviet upheaval. Trump thrived in cutthroat markets and democratic elections; Gorbachev rose through backroom deals and party hierarchies. Trump is a product of the postmodern digital age; Gorbachev was a modernist reformer who placed faith in rational governance and global norms. Trump champions nationalism and self-interest; Gorbachev preached universal values. Yet despite their differences, both men shared a deep desire to overhaul systems they viewed as bloated and unsustainable. Each tried to“clean up liabilities”– to eliminate outdated, overextended, and costly commitments. By the 1980s, the Soviet Union was stagnating. The Brezhnev era, later romanticized for its“stability,”had bred corruption, economic inertia, a detached ruling class, and widespread alcoholism. The military budget was immense: Moscow poured resources into propping up Warsaw Pact allies, subsidizing socialist regimes worldwide, and maintaining nuclear and conventional parity with the US and NATO. Meanwhile, relations with China were hostile. Since the late ‘60s, the two nations had been in a quiet cold war, even as Beijing sought warmer ties with Washington. And then there was the costly quagmire in Afghanistan. While some of these efforts might have been defensible in the name of strategic deterrence or ideological solidarity, they increasingly backfired. The arms race yielded diminishing returns. Allies became freeloaders. Global influence waned. Gorbachev’s answer was de-escalation. Arms reduction treaties slashed bloated arsenals. Relations with China thawed. Troop levels in Afghanistan dropped. For a time, Soviet diplomacy gained moral traction on the world stage – Gorbachev positioned the USSR as a force for peace and progress, and his personal reputation soared. But the momentum didn’t last. Many of Moscow’s concessions proved one-sided. Missiles were dismantled with little reciprocal gain. Gorbachev supported German reunification without securing hard guarantees against NATO’s eastward expansion. By the late ‘80s, Eastern Europe had erupted in peaceful revolutions, toppling one socialist regime after another. Unlike in 1968 Czechoslovakia, the USSR chose not to intervene militarily. As Moscow’s grip loosened, it became evident the Soviet Union was losing its leverage with NATO and its own sphere of influence. Worse still, liberalization at home – economic reforms, government restructuring, and glasnost (political openness) – triggered an uncontrollable chain reaction. State legitimacy crumbled. Nationalist sentiment surged in the republics. Attempts to slow the unraveling with half-measures only hastened the collapse. Gorbachev’s cleanup campaign ended not in renewal, but in ruin. Trump, too, began his presidency with a push to shed what he saw as unnecessary burdens. The US–Russia standoff, he argued, had locked Washington into a costly“double deterrence”trap. Ukraine, from this viewpoint, had become a black hole for American resources – costing tens, even hundreds of billions in military and financial support – despite Russia posing no existential threat to the US. After all, Russia is a capitalist state, once deeply embedded in the global economy. Its push to dominate its“near abroad”is not unlike the US response to Soviet missiles in Cuba. And its emphasis on traditional values is more defensive than expansionist – unlike communism, which once posed an ideological challenge to the West. So why the outsized US investment in a standoff with Moscow? Especially when, three years into Russia’s war in Ukraine, the West has failed to land a knockout blow? Ukraine has withstood invasion but not turned the tide. Russia, battered but intact, has avoided political or economic collapse – and continues to support America’s adversaries. In that context, seeking a strategic compromise with Moscow doesn’t seem naïve – it looks rational. This raises a larger question: Should the US continue preserving the Cold War’s institutional legacy? The Cold War ended with a sweeping American victory – military, economic, and ideological. But can the same playbook guide the country through today’s multipolar world? Clinging to Cold War logic has backfired. Rather than remain inga reliable partner, Russia has become a dangerous wild card. Meanwhile, new powers – from China to regional upstarts like North Korea – are challenging US influence. The global burden on Washington grows heavier, even as its returns diminish. Trump’s re-evaluation of traditional alliances has gone further than any recent administration. The notion of annexing Greenland would be a shocking blow to one of America’s closest allies. Canada has also found itself on edge. And Trump’s trade wars with friendly nations have added to the strain – though, to be fair, US–Japan tensions in the past took similar turns. What’s become clear is that the traditional Atlantic alliance, as it stood over the past 30 years, can no longer be taken for granted. Washington is demanding tangible returns – now. And this is not just Trump’s doing. Around him is a cadre of younger, energetic allies. Should Trump be removed from the scene, Vice President J.D. Vance would likely carry the torch – with even greater zeal. Could America go the way of the USSR? For now, that seems unlikely. The US possesses far deeper institutional resilience. It’s not just about economic size – the Soviet Union was massive, too – but about adaptability. The American system can absorb shocks, even from figures as disruptive as Trump, and then pivot back without undermining its core principles. Gorbachev, in contrast, was boxed in by his own idealism. His vision of peace left him paralyzed at moments that demanded forceful action. Trump, by contrast, is already cast as a villain by many US allies. That gives him more room to act decisively. With America’s systemic flexibility behind him, Trump may feel emboldened to experiment. And in these experiments, longtime allies might find themselves not just in supporting roles – but as test subjects.",

    "title": "Ukraine’s Western backers struggling to muster troops – Times",
    "article_text": "European NATO members are struggling to assemble a ground force for Ukraine to keep an eye on a prospective ceasefire between Moscow and Kiev, the Times reported on Tuesday. The paper’s sources have indicated that even a collective deployment of 25,000 troops would be difficult due to manpower shortages and funding constraints. A group of mostly European nations – which has been dubbed the“coalition of the willing”– has for months been seeking to muster a force to be deployed to Ukraine, purportedly in a post-conflict peacekeeping role. Russia, however, has opposed a foreign troop deployment in Ukraine under any pretext, warning they would be considered legitimate targets and that such a move could only escalate the conflict. As part of debates on the foreign troop deployment, British Chief of the Defense Staff Admiral Sir Tony Radakin had reportedly proposed that Kiev’s backers in Europe send a 64,000-strong force to the country, with the UK willing to contribute up to 10,000 personnel. However, his European counterparts are said to have“thrashed”this proposal, with some officials stating that 25,000 troops would“be a push for a joint effort.” While France has indicated a willingness to match the UK’s contribution, offering to send between 5,000 and 10,000 troops, the same cannot be said of other EU members, the article noted. Several countries, including Poland, Spain, and Italy, have expressed reluctance or refusal to commit troops altogether, citing concerns over depleting national defenses and the risks associated with deploying ground forces, the Times claimed. Some of the more hardline Ukraine supporters reportedly voiced exasperation over the dispute. Lithuanian Defense Minister Dovile Sakaliene reportedly said,“Russia has 800,000 [troops]… If we can’t even raise 64,000 that doesn’t look weak – it is weak.”“Without large populous countries committing [troops], it is a dead end,”a Times source said. The current size of Britain’s regular army is 108,000, with British military commanders and officials complaining of a lack of funding while expressing concern about London’s ability to stand up to a near-peer adversary. The size of the French regular army is about 200,000, although a significant portion is deployed abroad. The Times report comes after the Daily Telegraph claimed that discussions on troop deployments had shifted to alternative support measures, such as sending military trainers to western Ukraine to help rebuild Kiev’s military, rather than deploying troops close to the front line.",

    "article_text": "The International Criminal Court (ICC) is being used by“so-called globalists”to enforce rules upon dependent nations that they themselves have no intention of adhering to, Drago Bosnic, a military expert and contributor to Bangladeshi Blitz newspaper, has claimed in an interview with RT. A number of nations have criticized the organization recently, including Hungary, whose National Assembly voted this week to withdraw from the institution. Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto criticized the international court as“a politicized institution that has lost its impartiality and credibility”when announcing the lawmakers’ decision. Bosnic attributed Hungary’s departure to Budapest’s possible conclusion that it cannot depend on the organization“in case anything happens.” “The ICC is essentially under the control of the political West, and not even the entire West, but we're talking about these so-called globalists or the people who represent the so-called rules-based world order,”he argued. Advocates of these rules view them“as something that they’re not required to follow, but something that they want to impose on other countries that they want to keep controlling as neo-colonies.” Hungary previously defied the ICC by refusing to enforce an arrest warrant issued last November against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visited Budapest in early April. The ICC lacks a police force and depends on signatories of the Rome Statute — the treaty that grants it authority — to detain and transfer suspects.",

    "title": "Trump adviser explains why US must cut military aid to Europe",
    "article_text": "The US has run its debt so high that it can no longer afford spending money on the protection of freeloading NATO members, particularly those in Europe, White House National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has said. The administration of President Donald Trump is pressuring fellow NATO member states to ratchet up their defense budgets. It is also urging allies in Europe to provide security for Ukraine with minimal involvement from the US – a stark departure from previous policy. ”The United States, with $33 trillion in debt, can literally no longer afford to subsidize European security,”Waltz told the New York Post on Tuesday, reflecting on Trump’s first 100 days in office. The administration plans to differentiate between nations that meet or exceed NATO spending targets and those that fall short, Waltz said. He emphasized that European countries have dragged their feet on military spending despite calling Russia an escalating threat for over a decade. Waltz’s criticisms extended beyond Europe, as he mentioned US militaryactionin Yemen, which the Pentagon says aims to protect navigation in the Red Sea against Houthi rebels. ”The vast majority of that shipping goes to Europe,”he noted, adding that nations benefiting from the trade“haven’t invested in their navies to be able to handle – or at least assist us in a much greater way.” The Houthis are targeting vessels they associate with Israel as part of a strategy to pressure the Israeli government over its military operations in Gaza. West Jerusalem began its campaign there in retaliation for a deadly raid by the Palestinian militant group Hamas in October 2023. Waltz also took issue withCanada, arguing that it“should have bases on its northern slope”and“icebreakers up in the Arctic with new oil and gas, with critical minerals, with the Chinese and the Russians pushing up into that area, new shipping lanes.” Currently, the US operates two active heavy icebreakers – the USCGC Healy and the USCGC Polar Star – along with nine Bay-class cutter tugboats, the most recent of which was commissioned in 1988. In January, Trump announced plans for his administration to order“about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers.”Canada’s icebreaker fleet consists of 20 vessels, ranging from small air-cushioned craft to two heavy ships.",

    "title": "Trump faces third impeachment attempt – Axios",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump’s advisers are reportedly preparing for the possibility of a third impeachment attempt if Democrats regain control of the lower house of Congress after the 2026 midterm elections, Axios reported on Tuesday. During Trump’s first term, House Democrats impeached him twice – first in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and again in January 2021 for incitement of insurrection following the January 6 Capitol riot. According to Axios, Trump’s pollster John McLaughlin has warned that another impeachment attempt is all but guaranteed if Republicans lose the House next year.“We cannot lose the midterms,”he said, stressing that the Republicans crucially need to pass Trump’s tax cuts in order to avoid a recession. Republicans currently control the House, making any near-term impeachment effort unlikely to succeed. However, Democratic lawmakers are laying the groundwork for future action. On Monday, Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar of Michigan introduced seven articles of impeachment against Trump which include charges of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, usurpation of power, bribery, and corruption. Thanedar stated that Trump is“unfit to serve as President”and poses a“clear and present danger”to the US Constitution and democracy. Earlier this month, Rep. Al Green from Texas, another Democrat, also vowed to begin impeachment proceedings against the US president within 30 days, insisting that Trump“does not deserve”to hold office. Axios has reported that Republican strategists are now responding to the threat of future impeachment by accelerating efforts to pass Trump’s legislative priorities. Those include making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and implementing new tax relief measures ahead of the election cycle. Under the US Constitution, the House of Representatives can impeach the president by a simple majority vote. If that happens, the Senate then holds a trial. Conviction and removal from office requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate – a threshold not met in either of Trump’s previous impeachments. A Trump adviser told Axios that previous impeachments“did nothing”while the White House has repeatedly dismissed the Democratic efforts as politically motivated and ultimately ineffective.",

    "title": "France wants to charge prisoners for time behind bars",
    "article_text": "French Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin has proposed making inmates pay for their prison time as part of a wider push to combat growing violence nationwide. The move follows a wave of violent incidents targeting prisons and guards across France earlier this month. In an interview with TF1 on Monday, Darmanin confirmed plans to“amend the law”to support a bill introduced in the National Assembly in March. The justice ministry estimates that maintaining the national prison system costs the state approximately €4 billion per year. Justifying the proposed measure, Darmanin pointed to historical precedent, stating that“until 2003, prisoners contributed to the cost of their incarceration,”and drew a comparison to healthcare costs, noting that“just as there is a fixed hospital charge, there was a fixed prison attendance charge.” France had inmate contribution policies in place until 2003, when they were scrapped during Jacques Chirac’s presidency. The proposal comes in response to a recent wave of violence directed at French prisons and correctional officers across the country during a two-week period in April. According to France’s national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office, a wave of coordinated assaults targeted at least ten prisons over five nights, with attackers using automatic weapons. In response, nearly 200 investigators have been deployed to identify those responsible. Earlier this week, police arrested 25 suspects in coordinated operations carried out across the country. Both Darmanin and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau have pointed to drug traffickers as the likely perpetrators, suggesting the assaults were retaliation for the government’s crackdown on gang leaders operating from behind bars. Darmanin posted an open letter on X on Monday, reaffirming his“total determination”to protect prison staff.“The absolutely unacceptable violence and threats committed against you [prison officers] and prisons in recent days have rightly shocked you,”he wrote. The letter detailed new measures aimed at ensuring prison guards’ anonymity and safety. Responsibility for the prison attacks has been claimed by a group calling itself the Defense of the Rights of French Prisoners (DDPF). The group has used its Telegram channel to circulate threats and propaganda videos aimed at correctional facilities and staff. Meanwhile, France has faced repeated condemnation from the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) over the state of its prison system, with rulings highlighting issues such as overcrowding and inadequate living conditions. Despite these rulings, reports suggest that issues persist, with some prisons operating beyond capacity and lacking adequate facilities to ensure humane conditions for inmates.",

    "title": "White House calls out ‘media cover-up’ on Biden’s health",
    "article_text": "The“cover up”of former US President Joe Biden's poor mental and physical health has led to a decline of public trust in“legacy media”, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has claimed. Throughout Biden’s time in office, Donald Trump and his allies repeatedly argued that he was unfit for the job – claims the Biden administration and US media vociferously denied. Biden only withdrew from the presidential race when he faced pressure from within the Democratic Party and major campaign donors after a disastrous debate performance against Trump last June, in which he appeared confused and struggled to finish his sentences. “Millions of Americans watched our mentally incompetent president [Biden] struggle with his day-to-day duties of this office. We watched our country be run into the ground as a result. And nobody in the media wanted to write about that,”Leavitt said during a White House briefing on Monday. The spokeswoman recalled how during Trump’s campaign her warnings about Biden’s“clear mental incompetence”led to her being“accused by people in this room [journalists] of manufacturing deepfake videos trying to persuade the public into not believing what they saw with their own eyes for many years.” “I think it is about time the legacy media finally admits that was one of the greatest cover-ups and scandals that ever took place in American history,”she insisted. Leavitt said that the reluctance to report on Biden’s actual physical and mental condition“certainly did contribute to the decline in the trust that Americans have for the legacy media.” A poll by Gallup earlier this year suggested that confidence in fair reporting of the news by US media has dropped to its lowest point in five decades. Only 31% of those surveyed said they trust the mainstream media“a great deal”or“a fair amount,”while 36% said they do not trust it“at all.”",

    "title": "Trump claims he stopped Russia from taking over Ukraine",
    "article_text": "US President Donald Trump believes that his leadership is the sole reason why Russia has not taken control of Ukraine. In an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Trump suggested that Putin viewed Ukraine as“the apple of his eye”and intended to seize the entire country, but never had the chance to accomplish the task due to his election victory over Kamala Harris in November. “I think if I didn't win the election, he would have gotten all of Ukraine. I think he would have taken all of Ukraine,”the US president said. Trump said the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021 – which he blamed on the actions of a“group of losers”in the administration of former President Joe Biden – gave Putin the opening he needed when it came to Ukraine. “He saw what happened in Afghanistan. He said, ‘Wow, this is my chance,’”he noted.“It was one of the greatest embarrassments of — of our lifetimes but maybe in the history of our country.” When asked whether he believes Putin wants peace, Trump responded in the affirmative. He then added,“Let’s say, he respects me. And I believe because of me he’s not gonna take over the whole [Ukraine] – but his decision, his choice would be to take over all of Ukraine.” Meanwhile, Trump refused to answer whether the US would cut off military aid to Ukraine if no peace deal is reached.“I want to leave that as a big, fat secret, because I don't want to ruin a negotiation,”he explained. Trump’s comments came after he suggested on Monday that Ukraine would be“crushed very shortly”in the face of pressure from Russia, which he called“a big war machine.” The US president’s remarks come as Washington and Moscow continue direct talks aimed at reaching a negotiated end to the Ukraine conflict, with both sides praising the engagement as productive. According to multiple media reports, a peace agreement proposed by Washington includes US recognition of Russian sovereignty over Crimea, as well as a“freezing”the conflict along the current front line and acknowledgment of Moscow’s control over large parts of the four former Ukrainian regions which voted to join Russia. The deal would also reportedly prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and initiate a phased removal of sanctions imposed on Russia. While Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky has consistently ruled out any territorial concessions to Moscow, Trump suggested that he was willing to give up Kiev’s claim to Crimea, which voted to become part of Russia in 2014.",

    "title": "EU can’t rely on US – von der Leyen",
    "article_text": "The European Union must be prepared to take responsibility for its own defense, as the United States is gradually stepping back from its security commitments, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said. Her remarks signaled that the bloc should strengthen its military capabilities amid growing tensions with US President Donald Trump. “The threat posed by Russia will not go away, and we know that the American focus will increasingly shift towards other regions. So, there is no doubt, peace in Europe requires that we take much greater responsibility for our own defense,”von der Leyen said in a speech at the European People’s Party congress in Valencia, Spain, on Tuesday. In March, von der Leyen unveiled a plan to raise €800 billion ($910 billion) to“rearm”the EU, as several member states look for ways to reduce reliance on US-led security arrangements. Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor-designate, said in February that Berlin must“gradually achieve independence from the US.” French President Emmanuel Macron, who has long argued that the EU can no longer outsource its defense to Washington, has expressed openness to extending France’s nuclear umbrella to cover Germany and other EU members. Trump has called on NATO members in Europe to contribute“a fair share”to collective defense. He has also refused to offer security guarantees to Ukraine or commit US troops to a potential peacekeeping mission. Moscow has warned that the EU’s military buildup will only escalate tensions. In an interview with TASS published on Tuesday, Nikolay Patrushev, a security adviser to President Vladimir Putin, accused Western countries of“deploying their military machine against Russia and becoming delirious with nuclear apocalypse scenarios.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov argued in March that the EU is willing to“sacrifice”its own economy“only to achieve the ideological goal of ‘defeating’ Russia.”",

(Photo: AP/Mukhtar Khan) WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday (Apr 30) urged India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions after last week'sIslamist militant attack in India-administered Kashmirthat killed 26 people, the State Department said.Rubio spoke separately with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif while expressing support to India in combating extremism and urging Pakistan to cooperate in probing the attack, the State Department said after Rubio's calls.Wednesday's calls mark the highest levels of publicly known simultaneous diplomatic engagements from Washington aimed at reducing India-Pakistan tensions since the April 22 attack.India is an important US partner to counter China's rising influence. Pakistan remains Washington's ally even as its importance diminished after the 2021 US withdrawal from neighbouring Afghanistan.State Department statements after the calls termed the Kashmir attack as \"terror\" and \"unconscionable,\" and said Rubio spoke to Pakistan \"of the need to condemn\" it.Rubio \"urged Pakistani officials' cooperation in investigating this unconscionable attack,\" the State Department said. Sharif's office said he asked Rubio to urge India \"to dial down the rhetoric.\"Rubio urged the Asian nuclear-armed neighbours to work with each other \"to de-escalate tensions, re-establish direct communications, and maintain peace\".

    "article_text": "Podcasts Podcasts When he was a Gifted Education Programme teacher, Jasper Kuan's classes had 25 children. The Workers' Party new face for East Coast GRC tells Steven Chia why smaller class sizes are the way to go. East Coast GRC candidate for the Workers’ Party Jasper Kuan admits this may not be the right “season” for him to jump into politics because of his three young children. But he tells Steven Chia how a conversation with Low Thia Khiang changed his mind and why as a former Gifted Education Programme teacher, he believes the education system needs structural changes. Here's an excerpt from the conversation: Steven Chia, host:Would you say then that these changes in the season have prompted you to then step up and say: \"I want to be here now. In this season, I want to be here to take part, to speak out, to be a voice?\" Jasper Kuan, Workers' Party candidate for East Coast GRC:Very nice way to put it actually. To be honest, I think I'm at the wrong season. Steven:Oh! Okay. Jasper:I have three young kids, so my biggest fear has always been my job, my ability to still provide for them. I have a good job, I work for a good company ... the company allowed me the opportunity to step up and go back after the GE is over. My kids are 11, 8 and 5 (years old). So very young right? If maybe five, 10 years later, it's actually a better time ... I was Dennis (Tan)'s, MP for Hougang, (legislative assistant). He asked me a couple of times and I told him: \"I don't think so. It’s the wrong timing, I just want to help\" ... It so happened that one day, Mr Low (Thia Kiang) (former chief of Workers’ Party) asked me to pass him some stuff ... I don't know whether it was planned, to be honest, but he spent three hours with me chatting about this, and Mr Low has always been (an) inspiration to me. Maybe because we are both ex-teachers, we connected quite well, and he shared on why he actually stepped out as a politician as well, what he wants to do and the fact that he wishes that people in the party continue his legacy ... I told him I'm actually living my life for my three kids ... what I do now, is for my three kids. Follow the podcast onApple,Spotifyormelistenfor the latest updates. Have a great topic for us?

The move represents progress in takeover talks for Couche-Tard, which operates the Circle-K convenience stores in Canada and the United States and has been trying to acquire Seven & i since August. The detailed terms of the agreement will remain confidential, 7-Eleven operator Seven & i said in a statement on Thursday. The agreement also includes a \"standstill\" clause, which protects target companies from hostile takeovers. Couche-Tard has said that access to \"fulsome diligence information\" may allow it to improve its proposal.

    "article_text": "Experiences Experiences Experiences Experiences Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions Obsessions People People People People Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Remarkable Living Obsessions Obsessions The Rope Watch draws inspiration from an iconic Jean Schlumberger motif. The Rope Watch is inspired by a twisted gold motif first conceived by Jean Schlumberger. (Photos: Tiffany & Co) This audio is generated by an AI tool. The allure of a jewellery watch lies in its seamless blend of form and function. In recent years, Tiffany & Co has expanded its collection of jewellery watches inspired by legendary designs from its archives. Inspired by a twisted gold motif first conceived by Jean Schlumberger–one of the most influential jewellery and watch designers of the 20th century–the Rope Watch pays homage to his artistic legacy. Schlumberger, who spent over three decades with Tiffany & Co, was deeply influenced by the tassels, braids, and weaves he knew intimately from his upbringing in a prominent textile family in Alsace, France. He wove these inspirations into a distinctive collection of jewellery. The twisted golf motif has now been translated into a modern-day timepiece, combining a contemporary aesthetic with innovative watchmaking. The watch is presented in 18k yellow gold with the option of a white mother-of-pearl or glossy black dial. The wide bezel surrounding the dial is highlighted by two circles of polished gold rope, separated by a ring of round brilliant diamonds. The minute hand also takes the form of a rope. It features Tiffany & Co’s first solar-powered movement designed in collaboration with and produced by renowned Swiss movement manufacturer, La Joux-Perret. The technology is a rarity in the world of jewellery watches and a first for Tiffany & Co. When fully charged, it provides autonomous power to the watch for eight months. Solar cells are set beneath the semi-translucent dial of the watch, enabling the movement to charge. Outdoors on a sunny day, it takes just two minutes to charge the watch to sufficiently run for 24 hours. The watch also comes in two case sizes. The 27mm size is set with 38 diamonds of nearly 0.52 total carats, while the 33mm size features 39 diamonds of 0.9 carats. To complement the sparkle of the diamonds, the polished gold of the rope accents catches the light to create depth and dimension, showcasing the expertise of Tiffany & Co’s artisans. The caseback sports an engraved sun logo and a diamond to represent the new collection. The mother-of-pearl dial is paired with a Tiffany Blue alligator strap, while the glossy black dial is matched with a black alligator strap.

The way to a man’s heart may be through his stomach, but under challenging economic conditions, the way to the wallet matters too. This is even more so for hotels, which have been actively stirring up ways to entice both local and international tastebuds. According to the Marriott hotel group’s Future of Food 2025 report, culinary tourism in the Asia Pacific is projected to reachUS$6.2 trillion (S$8.15 trillion) by 2033 and is poised to be a key driver of global travel recovery over the next three to five years. Petr Raba, Marriott International’s vice-president of food and beverage for the Asia Pacific (excluding China) region, shared that“88 per cent of high-net-worth travellers in Asia Pacific now prioritise gastronomy as a key reason for travel, reflecting a shift toward more immersive and experience-led dining”. Marriott hotels have increasingly been using ingredients such as cage-free eggs and poultry from Singapore and Malaysia and offering more healthy options like fresh greens and whole grains in its menus. Espousing the minimal waste philosophy are restaurants like FYSH at The Singapore Edition, which uses every part of the animal in dishes like the FYSH Bone Noodles, where fish bones are boiled to a soft texture and then mixed with flour to create the noodles. Low- and non-alcoholic options are also becoming more prominent on their hotel bar menus. Mazen Abilmona, general manager of Pullman Singapore Hill Street, which has three dining concepts Moga, Madison’s and El Chido, said that there is a penchant for creativity and comfort in dining, with a dose of storytelling and surprise. He said: “Guests are looking for elevated but approachable experiences, where familiar dishes are reimagined with flair and cocktails go beyond the ordinary.” It is a similar story at The Standard, Singapore, whereexecutive chef Nicholas Cheng observed that localsappreciated bold, complex flavours that are inherent in Singapore’s rich food culture, while tourists liked to explore new combinations and more experimental takes on familiar dishes. He said: “For locals, we offer elevated takes on comfort food, infused with layers of flavour through techniques like fermentation and pickling. For tourists, we introduce unexpected elements, creating exciting, boundary-pushing dishes that still retain a sense of familiarity.” We check out what nine hotels are stirring in their pots. The hotel’s Cafe Oriental, which serves popular local fare such as laksa, kueh pie tee and nasi lemak, launched the Local Legends series this year to showcase Southeast Asia’s culinary heritage. Among the guest chefs were home chef Christina Hunter of Hunter’s Kitchen, who created traditional Indonesian dishes with a touch of her Teochew-Peranakan heritage such as Asam Garam Sotong (squid cooked with tamarind) and Tempe Orek Ikan Bilis (stir-fried fermented soybeans with anchovies). Rempapa’s chef Damien d’Silva also whipped up Peranakan and Eurasian dishes such as Ayam Buah Keluak and Eurasian Lamb Dhalcha. Up next is a collaboration withzicharrestaurant Keng Eng Kee Seafood and Chin Mee Chin Confectionery, which is well-known for their kopi and freshly baked buns with thick spreads of housemade kaya. Bookhere Cafe Quenino levels up the ordinary breakfast with the likes of blue swimmer crab in a Chilli Crab Omelette and house made five-spice chicken spam in the Rolled Scallion and Egg Pancake. The Nasi Lemak Kedgeree riffs on the traditional combination of flaked fish, boiled rice and eggs by using crispy whitebait and hot smoked trout instead, along with a serving of sambal goreng. Half of Quenino by Artyzen’s tasting menu is meant to be eaten with the hands for a tactile experience. Unconventional ingredients are also highlighted in a palatable way, such as the pungent Jungle Garlic in a sauce for a wagyu beef cheek, and petai in a coconut cream paired with marron. The vegetarian menu is also crafted to maintain the same depth of flavours as the main tasting menu. Scallops in the Assam Laksa are replaced by slow-cooked king oyster mushrooms while the fried rice swaps out chicken stock, squid, bottarga and fried pork lard for kombu stock, konjac, grated cured egg yolk and fried potato puffs. Look out for their monthly wine dinners, where experts introduce unconventional pairings and labels such as Heavensake, which is crafted by a champagne and a sake maker. Bookhere Go to modern Asian restaurant Sky 22 for boldly flavoured mains such as Pork Bibimbap, akoji-marinated pork belly in a rich kimchi broth, andKeluak Bak, where tender baby back ribs are cooked with tamarind and buah keluak, an earthy black nut commonly used in Peranakan cooking that is rarely tackled in typical hotel restaurants. Feeling ravenous? The semi-buffet lunch, which includes salads, soups and desserts, along with a choice of mains, is a steal at S$29.50 (US$22.50) per person. It's Californian vibes at rooftop bar Las Palmas with fun dishes such as the Tikka Taco, whichwraps tandoori lamb and creamy hummus in a taco, and Clock Out Cluck In, where cornflake-crusted chicken is served with salted egg yolk that has been stir fried with cornflakes for an extra crispy punch. Wash it down with cocktails such as the dry and complex The Racquet Club, a negroni with hints of roselle and umeshu, and refreshing House of Tomorrow, a jasmine-infused vodka with lychee. Bookhere Modern cafe and wine bar Christina’s goes Mediterranean with dishes like wood-fired seafood on baked rice and clams with chorizo, while Italian restaurant Bottega di Carna dishes out classics such as the Basket Tortelli stuffed with butternut squash, pumpkin and Parmigiano Reggiano and grilled Duroc pork rack with pine nuts and pickled mustard seeds. Sharing the Asian story is cocktail bar Jungle Ballroom, whose menu roams the streets from Hyderabad to Melaka, showcasing Asia’s rich traditions and cultures. Intriguing drinks include a surprisingly clean Gibson Pho with the aroma of beef tallow and the dessert-like Ube, a concoction of ube (purple yam) cream liqueur, vodka, coconut and jackfruit. Bookhere Local farmers and craft beverage makers such as Tanglin Gin, Pyroast and Toh Thye San Farm are all part of the hotel’s culinary story. Highlights at the Anglo-Asian Entrepot include theAged Vinegar and Malt Sugar Glazed Kurobuta Pork Chop and the Charcoal Roasted Spanish Octopus Leg, which was served on a banana leaf alongside sambal hitam, fingerling potato, and burnt lime in an appetising balance of smokiness, spice and bright citrus acidity. Noticing that guests leaned towards familiar desserts, director of culinary and beverage operations Nixon Low created Peanut Butter and Chocolate, a treat that meshes traditional peanut candy, 72 per cent dark chocolate mousse, chocolate sponge cake and cashew nut praline for “nostalgic comfort with an elevated twist”. At speakeasy Chandu, tasty bar bites like crispy spring rolls of tiger prawns and a coconut mayo dip with Sarawak pineapple pulp are complemented by layered drinks such as the oaky-citrusy Lunar Renewal cocktail, which uses Jura 12 Year Old Single Malt Whisky, bergamot liqueur and sparkling lychee water. Bookhere Get ready for funfood with local sprinkles. Izakaya concept Moga matches quaffable tipples with tasty bar bites. Think Salted Yuzu Highball, where yuzu saline is mixed with buckwheat tea syrup and genmaicha infused whisky, and a Dirty Sake-tini of sake and shochu with pickling brine. Delicious bar bites include Spicy XL Clams in chilli bean paste and yuzu kosho, Smashed Batata (sweet potato) in wasabi mayo and Crispy Squid in sansho fish sauce and green chilli. El Chido brings local and Mexican influences together in dishes likeChicken Rice Chimichanga and Breaded Fish Otah Tortilla, paired with cocktails such as the Clarified Strawberry Mojito and El Naranja, both of which include house-made infusions and layered flavours. American all-day-diner Madison’s includes local dishes such as laksa, Hainanese chicken rice and bak kut teh. It currently has a collaboration with Old Chang Kee for an afternoon tea special. Bookhere Executive chef Nicholas Chenguses fermentation and pickling to elevate comfort food at the hotel’s izakaya-style Kaya. For example, to amplify umami levels, shio koji is used to marinate the chicken and duck in Burnt Karaage and Koji Quack respectively. He also fermented chilli dressing for the Cold Sakana Somen and tare sauce in Grilled Sweet Pork Jowl Cheeks to dial up complexity and depth. Quality ingredients also make a difference: The breakfast laksa uses thin and delicate handmade Kyoya Inaniwa udon from the Akita prefecture while the adzuki beans in the red bean croffle carry the tang of fresh yuzu zest. Cocktails at Kaya are standouts too: The Bloody Mary is a savoury, clarified concoction of tomato water and sous vide vodka with bell peppers while the Sochu Highball is a refreshing blend of lapsang souchong-infused shochu and plum umeshu. Bookhere Check out the Grilled Out Sunday lunch buffet at the hotel’s steakhouse Opus Bar and Grill where items like beef prime rib, crispy pork knuckle and grilled seabass are prepared on demand. In particular, the “Chef’s Speciality of the Day” is flambed and finished tableside for an entertaining flourish. With sessionable drinks in vogue, the restaurant also offers S$15 Amaro-forward cocktails that are served on trolleys and crafted from scratch tableside. ChefDean Bush, Voco Orchard’s executive chef,explained: “Amaro pairs beautifully with grilled dishes, offering refreshing flavours that enhance rather than overpower the rich aromas of our food.” Bookhere The hotel’s open-fire grill house Skirt works on a minimal waste, whole-animal philosophy, serving wagyu cuts purchased directly from producers such as Australia’s Blackmore Rohnes and Kumamoto prefecture’s Kurohana. Don’t miss their seafood and poultry either. Fish trimmings add complexity to the rich marinade in the dry-aged hamachi ceviche while the dry-aged duck blends a classic French duck a l’orange recipe with bold Peking duck essence. The whole duck is cooked on the crown and the wings and legs used for the jus. Bookhere Subscribe to CNA's Recommended Read A single handpicked story that we think you shouldn't miss. Just one a day.

    "article_text": "Sport Sport BARCELONA :Barcelona boss Hansi Flick lavished praise on Lamine Yamal after he scored a brilliant goal to spearhead his side's recovery from a two-goal deficit in a thrilling 3-3 draw with Inter Milan in the first leg of their Champions League semi-final on Wednesday. Playing his 100th game at just 17 years and 291 days old, Yamal became the youngest player to score in a Champions League semi-final, eclipsing the record set by Kylian Mbappe, who was 18 when he achieved the feat in 2017. The young Spain international's stunning individual goal breathed life back into the game for the Catalans after they fell 2-0 behind early in the first half. He went on to hit the woodwork twice and continually troubled the Inter defence in an impressive display. \"Lamine (Yamal) showed us the way with that incredible goal because it was crucial to score that goal after we were losing by two goals, he played really well,\" Barca manager Hansi Flick told Movistar Plus.

REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Apple violated a U.S. court order that required the iPhone maker to allow greater competition for app downloads and payment methods in its lucrative App Store and will be referred to federal prosecutors, a federal judge in California ruled on Wednesday. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland said in an 80-page ruling that Apple failed to comply with her prior injunction order, which was imposed in an antitrust lawsuit brought by “Fortnite” maker Epic Games. \"Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\" Gonzalez Rogers said. She added: \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order.\" Gonzalez Rogers referred Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, vice president of finance, to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation into their conduct in the case.

REUTERS/ Rebecca Cook/File Photo DETROIT :Ford Motor  has killed a program to develop next-generation electrical architecture - the brain of modern cars - that its executives have called pivotal to competing with electric-vehicle pioneers such as Tesla, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Ford had invested heavily in the system, known internally as FNV4 (for fully-networked vehicle), to streamline vehicle-software functions. The goal was to cut costs, improve quality and add profitable features in both electric and gasoline-powered vehicles. The project was abandoned because of ballooning costs and delays, the sources said. A Ford spokesperson said the company will absorb what it learned from developing FNV4 into its current software system, and it remains focused on delivering an advanced electrical architecture with its so-called skunkworks team.

Farley said at the time that Ford was on track to deliver the next-generation architecture and that a prototype had impressed him. \"For me as a car person,\" he said, \"I was like, 'Are you kidding me?'\" Subscribe to our Chief Editor’s Week in Review Our chief editor shares analysis and picks of the week's biggest news every Saturday.

The Cristiano Ronaldo-led team had gone into the meeting at the King Abdullah Sports City Stadium as favourites to progress only to be dumped out of the competition by the J-League side, who will face Al-Ahli in Saturday's final. \"We have made a lot of mistakes and this has cost us the match,\" said Pioli. \"It is always very difficult to lose in a semi-final. \"Our opponent surprised us, they played at a very high level and the problem was that we were not disciplined.

    "title": "6 Best Cheap Suitcases of 2025 Offer First-Class Benefits on an Economy Budget",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Best Medium-Sized Cheap SuitcaseAntler Medium LuggageRead more Antler Best Cheap Carry-OnAway The Bigger Carry-OnRead more Away Best Cheap Checked SuitcaseJuly Checked LuggageRead more July The very best cheap suitcases andtravel bagscan set you back well over the $500 mark, whileGQeditors on the rigorous fashion week circuit might put that number at closer to a grand—even if they’re likely to get much more enjoyment from that sum of money at the hotel bar. Thankfully, there are affordable cabin luggage andcarry-on suitcaseoptions available for much less, with spacious affordable models that’ll keep belongings safe and sound for considerably less than the aforementioned fortune. Sure, sacrifices will be made (these models won’t boast the aluminum frames of aRimowa, the silent 360-degree spinner wheels of aCarl Friedrik, or premium zippers and fancy water-resistant external pockets of thebest suitcases), but they’ll still do a valiant job of getting you and your things from Brooklyn and Barcelona to the Bahamas and beyond. Proof that you don’t have to spend a substantial percentage of your paycheck to acquire durable and reliable luggage, our guide to the best cheap suitcases takes the hassle out of scrolling through questionable cabin suitcase designs and scathing customer reviews. Whether you’re a frequent business traveler looking for a durable carry-on bag or a leisurely globetrotter hunting for the best check-in bags, here's a range of hard-shell and soft-sided suitcases that deliver on style, function and convenience, ready to upgrade your next trip. Antler Antler We are big fans of Antler's cases here atGQ.They straddle style and price very well, offering a lifetime guarantee and sturdy designs for price tags far lower than some of their competitors. You'll find the Icon Stripe Cabin suitcase in this list too, but the Medium option is great value and suitable for trips of up to a week or a few days if you aren't a light packer. It comes in a selection of excellent colors, features a water-resistant polycarbonate shell and there's an internal compression strap for securing belongings and maximizing packing space. The handle is surprisingly comfortable too, while the Silent Glide 360 Spinner Wheels offer effortless movement. Away Away Away is there for you wherever you go. Here or there, the Carry-On range is an exceptional set for getting cross-country thanks to the premium, durable chassis, high-grade spinner wheels and easy-to-use zippers that make adjusting packing quickly a dream. It's worth noting that Away is on the higher end of the pricing spectrum. At $295, it's more than double the cost of many others on this list and it isn't double the value. However, there are a few additions, namely a luggage tag and a water-resistant laundry bag are included in bag, which should go some way to alleviating the financial prospect of buying this one. July July If your budget can stretch a little over the $300 mark, July's Checked suitcase comes in a range of color options that will put your luggage with some of the most stylish in the airport. The polycarbonate shell is reinforced with anodized aluminum corner bumpers, while a 20-height multi-stop telescopic handle will ensure this case is comfortable to wheel around, whatever your height. You'll find leather on the nylon straps and hinge, YKK Japanese zippers, and it even comes with a nylon stain-proof laundry bag for any, ahem, accidents. Eastpak Backcountry Even if you're hoping to snag a cheap and cheerful suitcase, it doesn't mean you should put up with low-quality, easily damaged products. One of the best options for less than $500 comes from Eastpak's Resist'r range, which is one of the most durable suitcase we've seen. Wrought from space-grade aluminum and bolstered with hardened corner reinforcements, it will survive many a dent, ding, drop and journey without suffering any damage. Sure, it's among the most expensive options on our list, but if you can push your budget to this point, you'll have a suitcase that will last a lifetime. American Tourister Amazon Soft-side suitcases are often a good choice for those who prioritize weight over a sturdy shell that has its pros and cons of protecting your luggage. But for the most part, American Tourister's Pulsonic handles travel wear and tear with confidence, whilst keeping the weight down. How? The polyester chassis is woven in such a tight and compact way that nothing inside gets damaged in transit, and the expandable body allows for plenty of packing, regardless of the size you go for. A four-set of spinner wheels help the case to glide across whichever terrain you need for your journey, and a single TSA lock means you won't be suspicious of someone snooping around where they shouldn't. Amazon Basics Amazon While ABS could also be an abbreviation for “Amazon Basics Suitcase,” in this instance it highlights the hardy acrylonitrile butadiene styrene used to construct its outer shell. The material contributes to making this the heaviest inclusion in our edit, but it also makes it one of the most durable, so it’s an excellent choice for frequent flyers who are happy to compromise on the extra kilo of packable items. Peaking behind its sturdy build, we were impressed with the abundance of pockets and dividers that allow for a well-organised trip. And, with a 105-liter capacity, you can live out of it for a solid fortnight without having to resort to overspilling into your hand luggage. What luggage brand is best? You'll be familiar with many of the best luggage brands, but figuring out which is best for you and your budget can be tough. The most famous likeGlobe Trotter,Rimowa,TumiandCarl Friedrikare generally expensive, so if you're hoping to pinch pennies, you should be considering more affordable options likeAway,Antler,Amazon BasicsandAmerican Touristerto keep costs down. In most cases, many of these cheaper options will be more than capable of getting you from A to B in style and comfort, with plenty of space to keep your luggage together. Many brands only charge more for especially fancy materials, colorways or simply because the design is too gorgeous not to spend money on. What is a good affordable suitcase brand? Generally, every brand we've picked to include above is a good option if budgets are tight but you still want good quality to accompany you on your trip. However, the best brands for around the $100 mark areAmerican TouristerorSamsonite. Both offer a huge range of products from carry-on to check-in and most are priced firmly in the affordable category. The vast majority of these brands will also offer guarantees on luggage purchases, so you can happily travel knowing you're protected from the various dings and scrapes that will inevitably befall your cases in transit. If you're willing to spend a bit more, then Away is a good option for genuine quality materials, value for money and packing space, though you're looking at pushing the price up beyond $200. Of course, you can always jump over to our best suitcases guide to learn more about our favorite options. Do hard or soft suitcases hold more? If you've got two similar-sized suitcases, one hard and one soft, the overall capacity of both is going to be roughly the same. Generally, soft-side suitcases can hold a little more as they are a bit more expansive compared to their more rigid brethren, but generally, you won't be able to pack loads more. They may feature expandable zippers to give you more room or even external pockets to cram even more packing in. However, hard suitcases provide better protection for fragile items. When choosing between the two, consider your packing habits and the nature of your travel. Many brands offering the best cheap suitcases provide both hard and soft options to suit different preferences. Before you jet off on your latest trip, you'll want to ensure you've got the right luggage to see you through to your destination without headaches. If you've found yourself reading this article, it's likely because you're on the hunt for something new to take with you that doesn't cost half the price of the trip itself, and we'd imagine you're hoping for recommendations on products people have actually used. GQ Recommends' travel editor,Owen Gough, has you covered, putting as many suitcases as he can through their paces on a range of journeys, from short-range trips to long-haul flights. Throughout his testing, he assessed the suitcase's overall design and how much capacity is available, how durable the materials are and what colors are available, as well as the general ease of packing and additional compartments to split your gear. Of course, most importantly for this article, the cost and value of the bag were of paramount importance, so we've only picked luggage that is priced lower than $500 and with most under $300.

    "title": "7 Best Affordable Skin Care Brands for Men in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Finding the bestaffordable skin care brandsfor men can be tough work, but it's essential for maintaining ahealthy grooming routine. The men'sgrooming marketis booming, and to help you navigate this expansive market, we've curated a list of our top picks in 2025. These affordable skin care brands offer solutions for various skin concerns, from dullness towrinkles, with products like top men'smoisturizers,eye serums, andanti-aging creamsall included. If you're one of those guys who never has enough time in your day and you need something for everything (you know who you are), Anthony is an affordable skin care brand that you should definitely look into. Featuring an extensive line of products that works for dry, oily, combination, or acne-prone skin, the Day Cream and Wake Up Call Gel shouldn't be missed. Anthony Amazon Anthony Amazon Experts in the game, Bulldog makes straightforward, no-nonsense products. Make sure to check out the Age Defense Serum and the Original Moisturizer. Bulldog Bulldog Bulldog Bulldog This range from Clinique For Men has been specifically developed to tackle male skin care problems. We'd recommend its Face Wash and the Maximum Hydrator Gel. They're a little on the pricier side of this list, but trust us when we say that they're worth every single penny. Clinique For Men Clinique Clinique For Men Clinique NotthatJack Black, but an affordable men's skin care company that wants to take the guesswork out of great-looking skin. Try the Intense Therapy Lip Balm as well as the Pure Clean Daily Facial Cleanser, a couple personal favorites of ours. Jack Black Jack Black Jack Black Jack Black Even though Horace has only been around for a few years, it's become an essential part of many a guy's daily grooming routine. Horace has everything that you'll probably ever need. With that said, we'd like to turn your attention towards the 12h Protection Deodorant that'll keep the sweat at bay and the Face Firming Gel that'll keep those wrinkles away. Horace Horace Horace Horace We've sung the praises of Loved01 before, and we'll sing ‘em again. While most celebrity-backed skin care labels are kinda overpriced and kinda gimmicky, John Legend's Loved01 isn't. Formulated for melanin-rich skin, everything from the Exfoliating Cleanser to the Face + Body Wash have all been approved by board-certified dermatologists. Everything is also super affordable and accessible too, which is always nice. Loved01 Loved01 Loved01 Loved01 And last but by no means least: The Ordinary. While this brand wasn't made just for dudes, it's still worth a special mention considering how wildly popular it has become. Known for injecting their products withthebest in ingredients, no skin care routine is complete without the Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Toner and the Natural Moisturizer—two cult-favorite products that don't require a credit card. The Ordinary The Ordinary The Ordinary The Ordinary Which brand is best for men's skin? For boys on a budget, the above selections are top-tier choices for keeping costs low. We won't go over it all again, but brands like Anthony, Horace, and Bulldog all offer no-nonsense, simple moisturizers that get the job done without complicating your routine. When should men start skin care? The beauty of self care is that it's never too late or too early to start your journey. Sure, you probably could have made your first steps before now, but you can be 13, 45, or 87 years old and still find benefits of a solid skin care routine. So long as you're taking the steps to hydrate and exfoliate, you're on the right track. Most men start to take skin care seriously when they start to notice signs of aging, which is wonderful, but we're all for preventative measures rather than reactionary, so the earlier you commit, the better for your skin health overall. However, if you pick up the habit later in life, you're still doing yourself a favor in the long run. Do men really need moisturizer? Not to sound like your nagging mother here, but yes, you definitely should moisturize. We're huge self care advocates here atGQ, but it really shouldn't take too much effort to convince you, as a man, to moisturize. The benefits are nearly endless. Keeping to a good routine will reduce the signs of aging; give you a younger, fuller look; eliminate dry, flaky skin; clean the dirt you accumulate through the day; protect you from the sun's harmful rays (if you pick up an SPF); syncs up with good hygiene practice and can generally help you to look and feel better.",

    "title": "45 Best Watch Brands Every Guy Should Know in 2025",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Unless you’re talking about Michael Jordan, Ken Jennings, or grandma’s cooking, the title “best” can be pretty subjective. That’s no less true when it comes to the best watch brands, which span a mind-boggling range of styles, price points and features, from the simple utilitarian charm of theCasio G-Shockto the unapologetic outrageousness of aseven-figure Richard Mille. To make sense of it all, we’ve assembled some of the key players in the GQ watch universe, broken down into eight distinct categories, each of which is at the very top of their particular game—whether that’s making limited-editiontourbillonsor thequartz beateryou wear to the beach. Fortunately, unlike the NBA or Jeopardy’s Tournament of Champions, the world of watches has room for more than one GOAT. Want to brush up on your terminology and find your next dream timepiece? Don't miss GQ’s ultimate guide towatches for menor the first-everGQ Watch Shop. Based on what’s in your Instagram feed it can be easy to focus on the kind of top-shelf grails flexed by guys who sit courtside at Lakers games and have their own tequila brands, but don’t despair if your budget has fewer zeroes in it. In fact, there’s never been more selection or better value in the entry-level, with dozens of long-established brands and startups working hard to earn a place on your wrist. Whether it’s your first watch or your fourteenth, these brands offer Patron quality at Pepe Lopez prices. Your dad probably had a Timex (and his dad, too) but the brand has come a long way since the days of “It Takes a Licking and Keeps on Ticking.” Now, with inspiration from their extensive archives and creative input from the likes of Todd Snyder and Jacquie Aiche, Timex’s lineup has never been more stylish and diverse. And just as back in the day, they’re still built like tanks. Timex Huckberry Q Timex Amazon Swiss-made quality at reasonable prices is the name of the game at Tissot, which has been making old-school mechanical watches in Le Locle, Switzerland since 1853. Whatever your style, you’re likely to find something you want in their extensive catalogue spanning dress watches, pro-quality dive watches and classic ‘60s chronographs. Tissot Amazon Tissot Amazon Swatch changed the game in the early 1980s by proving that Switzerland could make inexpensive quartz (i.e. battery-powered) watches as well as high-end mechanical ones. Forty years later they’re still at the top of their game, producing multiple collections every year—including additions to the best-selling Moonswatch lineup—in their signature colorful-quirky style. Swatch Swatch Swatch Amazon Aspiring multi-hyphenates take note: this Japanese brand’s offering spans hundreds of G-Shock models and solar-powered analog wristwatches (plus a bunch of very nice digital pianos) all of which are executed with the same combination of leading-edge technology and high attention to detail. Casio Amazon Casio Amazon In the Venn diagram of affordability, dependability and stylishness, Seiko’s sports watches are dead-center. That's how they've earned a prime spot on every Best Watches Under $500 list, and a place of honor on countless discerning wrists. Seiko Huckberry Seiko Huckberry In the same vein as Uniqlo and their famously excellent selvedge denim, this under-the-radar Japanese watchmaker specializes in good looking mechanical wristwatches at budget-friendly prices. Orient Amazon Orient Amazon Whether by merit of their craftsmanship, their history or their astronomical prices, some brands command more respect (and hype) than others. This is the A-list of the watch world. Built like Formula 1 cars out of carbon nanotubes, titanium cables and other such space-age materials, this Swiss brand brought haute horology into the 21st century. Yes, you read the price correctly. Richard Mille Bezel Richard Mille Bezel If a Richard Mille is a mansion in Calabasas with its own go-kart track, a Cartier is a gilded age estate in Newport. Many of this French jeweler’s models haven’t changed much since the 1920s, and that’s exactly why people like them. Money talks, they say, and wealth whispers. Cartier Mr Porter Cartier Mr Porter With years-long waiting lists, exorbitant grey market prices, and more flexing than Muscle Beach on a summer Saturday, this brand’s watches—particularly the Royal Oak—are in a class of their own. Beneath the hype, however, are some of the refined movements created by the most skilled watchmakers in the business. Audemars Piguet Bezel Audemars Piguet Bezel With the kind of broad, universal goodwill usually reserved for Patagonia fleeces and Dwayne Johnson movies, Rolex has comfortably held its place atop the pyramid of watch brands for decades. Its movements and finishing are top-notch, of course, but (much like The Rock) at this point they don’t require any introduction. Rolex Bezel Rolex Bezel More than half a century after Neil Armstrong made what might be the biggest watch flex in history, Omega's Speedmaster is still the brand's most-wanted creation. Tough, refined, and technically-advanced mechanical sports watches are what this brand does best, and there are many to choose from—with or without ties to Apollo 11. Omega Bezel Omega Bezel Hublot was the first brand to put a solid gold watch on a rubber strap, which in 1980 was as revelatory and transgressive as wearing sneakers with a suit. Forty years later the brand is still experimenting with materials, recently figuring out how to carve an entire watch case out of a single block of lab-grown sapphire. Hublot Bezel Hublot Bezel Gerald Genta’s designs for Patek and AP are now some of the most sought in the world, but they only represent a fraction of the legendary designer’s output. Among his other hits is the “BVLGARI BVLGARI” watch he designed for this Italian jeweler in 1975. Bulgari continues to tweak the details of this iconic piece (inspired by an antique Roman coin) most recently re-imagining it with a black and white aluminum case. Bulgari Bulgari Bulgari Bulgari As their famous tagline says, you never actually own a Patek Philippe, you just take care of it for the next generation. And if your grandkids want to flip your cloisonné enamel World Time to pay for college someday, they probably could. Patek Philippe Bezel Patek Philippe Bezel Watch nerds, like music nerds, enjoy nothing more than geeking out over the stuff no one else has heard of. These are the watchmakers that get them fired up. If you have the desire to own a high-end vintage Swiss chronograph, but find your bank balance lacking in several commas, co-founders Andrea Furlan and Hamad al Marri feel your angst. That’s why they created this beloved micro-brand, whose wares capture the look and feel of vintage grails at prices collectors of more modest means can afford. Furlan Marri Furlan Marri Furlan Marri Furlan Marri The watch fam loves this Italian micro-brand for its dive watches inspired by classics from the 1950s with clean, ultra-minimalist dials. Functionally, they’re as far from an Apple Watch as it gets, but Steve Jobs would still approve. Unimatic Todd Snyder Unimatic Todd Snyder “Grand feu” enamelling (the process of fusing powdered glass to metal) is one of those antique crafts practiced by only a handful of the world’s top watchmaking craftsmen. That makes this Scottish brand, whose made-to-order watches feature expertly enamelled dials in a rainbow of hues, an outlier in the best kind of way. anOrdain anOrdain anOrdain anOrdain Its name might sound like something you should order in a swanky restaurant in Florence, but to those who stalk the halls ofhaute horlogerie, Parmigiani Fleurier signifies indie watchmaking at its highest levels. Founded in the ‘90s by master watch restorer Michel Parmigiani, the brand earned a reputation for top-drawer quality along with a loyal following of high-end watch enthusiasts, including King Charles III of England. Parmigiani Fleurier Parmigiani Fleurier Parmigiani Fleurier Parmigiani Fleurier Watches had been more or less the same for a century or more until this brand came along. By using a series of rotating discs, Ressence's watches tell time in an entirely new way—without hands or a traditional winding crown. And they look as unconventional as they are. Ressence Mr Porter Ressence Mr Porter It’s been a long time since the biggest names in American watchmaking were American-owned (much less American-made). In recent years, however, a handful of brands are moving production back onshore and providing a bunch of ways to show your patriotism without bumper stickers or T-shirts with eagles on them. While most “made in America” watch brands still rely on Swiss and Asian manufacturers for key components, the ones below are committed to doing as much in-house as possible. This indie brand founded by a couple of watch-obsessed New Yorkers specializes in tickers that evoke the golden era of mid-20th century timepiece design. Its tight catalog of divers, GMTs, field watches, and chronographs covers all of the major genres with tasteful aplomb, and features like Miyota automatic movements, marine-grade stainless steel, and Hesalite crystals stand testament to their quality. Surely all of this must come at a hefty price, you say? Think again. Lorier Lorier Lorier Lorier More than a decade after ushering in the Detroit renaissance, Shinola continues to prove that the Motor City can make watches with just as much style and swagger as they did Mustangs and GTOs. Shinola Shinola Shinola Shinola The overlap between watch fanatics and car fanatics goes back to the days when goggles and silk scarves were essential motoring gear. Autodromo is the latest brand to make their mark on this tradition, with a lineup of timepieces inspired by its founders’ love of classic motorsports events like the infamous Group B rallies of the 1980s. Autodromo Autodromo Autodromo Autodromo You know that saying, “Do one thing and do it well”? Cameron Weiss does for sure, and you can see the proof in every watch that comes out of his Nashville workshop, each of which takes 35 hours to assemble by hand. Weiss Weiss Weiss Weiss Even if you don’t wear a suit to the office, adding a classic dress watch – that is, one with an unfussy dial, a leather strap and maybe some gold – to your workday fit helps make weekdays feel a little more special. Almost 250 years of continuous operation, exceptional movement finishing (the hand-polishing and decoration painstakingly applied to each component) and a fair bit of scarcity are the foundation of this top-shelf brand. Their watches aren’t too bad-looking either. Vacheron Constantin Vacheron Constantin Vacheron Constantin Vacheron Constantin Watchmakers, like high school seniors, love superlatives. Piaget earned its reputation as the maker of the world's thinnest mechanical watch movements in the 1950s and has been upping the ante ever since. At just 2mm thin (only a smidge thicker than a penny), its latest Altiplano is a mind-bending feat of watchmaking, albeit one you wouldn't want to wear to the gym. For that, look to the Piaget Polo, a criminally underrated steel sports watch from the '70s. Piaget Piaget Piaget Saks There are two things that separate the world’s top-tier luxury watch brands from the rest. The first is heritage, and the second is in-house manufacturing chops. Chopard ticks both of those boxes thanks to its impeccable 19th-century credentials and its modern L.U.C workshop (named for founder Louis Ulysse Chopard) that cranks out mechanical movements to rival the best in the world. Chopard Mr. Porter Chopard Mr. Porter Jaeger-LeCoultre's most famous creation, the Reverso, was designed for polo players in the 1930s. It was also the watch Don Draper bought when he got his name on the door at Sterling Cooper. Wherever you're wearing yours, say it zhey-ZHER leh-KOOLT or risk being mocked by ad execs and horse people alike. Jaeger-LeCoultre Mr Porter Jaeger-LeCoultre Jaeger-LeCoultre Grand Seiko makes some of the most accurate mechanical watches on the planet (particularly those featuring their revered Spring Drive movement) and their attention to finishing is equally precise. Grand Seiko Grand Seiko Boutique Grand Seiko Grand Seiko Boutique Germany’s answer to Patek Philippe produces about a tenth as many watches per year and assembles each one twice to ensure absolute perfection. This has earned them a loyal following of hardcore watch collectors who dig their asymmetrical dials and quirky oversized \"digital\" dates. A Lange & Söhne Shop at A Lange & Söhne A. Lange & Söhne Shop at A Lange & Söhne You don’t need to be wearing a shearling jacket and a jumpsuit to rock a classic aviator’s watch (and indeed, you might get some sideways looks at the grocery store if you did). All that’s required to appreciate these flyboy-approved brands is a love of classic tool watches. IWC redesigned their Big Pilot watch this year, but to see it next to the ones they made for British pilots in the 1940s, you might not be able to tell which is which. Everything else about this watch—and every other watch made by IWC—is an exercise in top-down luxury, from the sand-colored ceramic case on the Mojave Desert edition to the tide indicator on the Portugieser Yacht Club. IWC Mr Porter IWC Mr Porter After decades of catering to guys who wear epaulets and aviator shades to work, Breitling now has a lot to offer those on the other side of the cockpit door, too, including recent collabs with Kelly Slater's Outerknown and modern reproductions of vintage dive watches from the '60s. Breitling Breitling Breitling Breitling Like Supreme's box logo tee and the piano key necktie, the brilliance of some ideas lies in their relative simplicity. That's definitely true of Bell & Ross, who pioneered the square pilot's watch in the early '90s and have been riffing on that signature aesthetic ever since. Bell & Ross Mr Porter Bell & Ross Mr Porter Zenith rocked the watch world in 1969 when it dropped the original El Primero, one of the world's first automatic chronographs. That accomplishment may not sound as impressive these days, but their signature chronograph looks just as fresh as it did back then—and its legendary movement has only gotten better. Zenith Zenith Zenith Zenith Tough, stylish and highly versatile, a good dive watch is like a vintage Land Rover Defender. And unlike that beloved British off-roader, a classic diver from any of the brands below is going to run for decades without breaking down. If you have ten grand to spend on a diver’s watch, there are plenty of brands to choose from. If you’re looking for something on the more affordable end of the spectrum, however, you’ll have a hard time beating out Citizen for looks or value. From its light-powered Eco-Drive movements to standout designs like the Ecozilla, this Japanese brand delivers the goods. Citizen Amazon Citizen Amazon Panerai's first watches were created for the Italian navy, with dials that glowed bright green thanks to Radiomir, their patented luminous paint. Radiomir turned out to be radioactive, but Panerai's original design details and bulked-out proportions are as good as they ever were. Panerai Mr Porter Panerai Mr Porter The watch world’s equivalent of the Beatles vs Rolling Stones debate (or Xbox vs Playstation, if you’re under 40) involves Blancpain, Rolex and the invention of the diver’s watch. While the Rolex Submariner may be more well known these days, Blancpain’s Fifty Fathoms (created for French navy divers and featuring the first uni-directional rotating bezel) actually came out a year earlier, making it the official OG. As with the Beatles and the Stones, however, it really just comes down to what you like, and there’s a lot to like here. Blancpain Blancpain Blancpain Blancpain Along with a red beanie and a pipe, Jacques Cousteau’s Doxa diver’s watch was an essential element of his now-iconic uniform. You can skip the pipe (and maybe the hat, too), but Doxa’s watches still look just as good as they did onboard the Calypso. Doxa Doxa Doxa Doxa Aside from a set of flippers and a vehicle with sand on the seats, nothing says “I live for the beach,” quite like one of Zodiac’s colorful vintage-inspired divers. Zodiac Huckberry Zodiac Zodiac Any watch that tells time is a “real watch,” but some brands pack a little more gravitas than others. If you’re ready to graduate into the world of grown-up timepieces, here are a few good places to start. When you're spending thousands of dollars on a watch, the idea of \"good value\" becomes more than a little subjective. That said, Longines offers everything that a top-tier Swiss watchmaker should (heritage, high-quality Swiss movements, unique design) at a (relatively) attainable price point. If you want something with vintage looks and modern reliability, look no further. Longines Nordstrom Longines Nordstrom Over the last 20 years, this British brand has built up a catalogue of high-quality sports watches that are priced well under their Swiss equivalents, and a legion of loyal fans. More recently, thanks to ambitious creations like the C1 Bel Canto Classic and C12 Loco, it has expanded its horizons to include chiming watches and avant-garde in-house movements, too. Christopher Ward Christopher Ward Christopher Ward Christopher Ward Much like In ’N Out, Hamilton is widely respected for its commitment to serving up the classics at reasonable prices. If you’re looking to get into your first mechanical watch, chances are you’ll find something you love in their collection of rugged midcentury-inspired designs. Hamilton Huckberry Hamilton Hamilton You don't have to know what a chicane is or be conversational in the Prost-Senna rivalry to appreciate TAG Heuer, but it helps. Since the 1960s this brand has been trackside at every major motorsports event on the planet, and many of their watches celebrate that legacy in one way or another. TAG Heuer Tag Heuer TAG Heuer Mr Porter Like many younger siblings, Tudor has spent more than its share of time living in the shadow of its older, more established sibling, Rolex. In recent years, however, this brand has truly come into its own with a robust line of chronographs and dive watches to rival the best in the world. It’s not Rolex, but in some ways (including the price) that’s a good thing. Tudor Tudor Tudor Tudor This Swiss brand doesn’t invest much in celebrity ambassadors or sports sponsorships. Instead, it puts all of its energy directly into its watches. The result is a lineup of handsome, classically-inspired tickers (many with in-house movements—for those who appreciate such things) that’ll set you back far less cash than their big-name counterparts. Frédérique Constant Frédérique Constant Frédérique Constant Frédérique Constant From the historic Big Crown Pointer Date designed in 1938 to the quirky Propilot X Kermit edition (a lime green watch that displays the titular Muppet’s face on the first of every month), the Oris catalog is stacked with covetable sports watches of every sort. It might not have the same name recognition as some of the bigger Swiss brands, but—like a beloved indie band—that's part of its appeal. Oris Oris Oris Oris Combining the minimalist restraint of Bauhaus, the technical prowess of Mercedes-Benz, and the cross-generational appeal of Birkenstock, NOMOS has helped to spread the gospel of German watchmaking far and wide.

    "title": "11 Best Resistance Bands of 2025 to Stretch Your Workout to the Max",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. There’s a reasonresistance bandsshow up in nearly everygym bag, warmup routine, and PT session: They work. The best resistance bands—unassuming loops and tubes that can make bodyweight workouts more challenging—enhance mobility, build real strength, and take up about as much space as a pair of socks. Whether you're looking for something to replacefree weightsat home or need a packable workout option for travel, resistance bands are one of the most accessible, versatile tools around. But not all bands are created equal. Some snap after a few sessions. Others feel like they offer more drag than resistance. The best ones are durable, grippy, and provide a smooth range of motion—whether you’re doing glute bridges, assisted pull-ups, or shoulder rehab work. Resistance bands help you apply load and resistance in a way that's joint-friendly and adjustable, which is whyJames Chung, DPT, a sports physical therapist and strength coach atMotivNYin New York City, says they’re a go-to when working with new clients. \"Honestly, they’re the first thing I introduced to people, for the most part, especially if they're really novice in their training,” he says. To find the best resistance bands, we tested more than a dozen options across multiple workouts—from strength circuits to warm-ups and rehab routines—and spoke to physical therapists and trainers about what actually matters. Whether you're leveling up yourhome gymor just trying to loosen up after sitting all day, these are the bands worth your time. Serious Steel Amazon Material: Natural latexResistance range: 5 to 150 lbsStyle: Loop-style These are the bands I keep coming back to, whether I’m doing pull-up assists, resistance push-ups, or warm-up drills before a lift. The latex is thick but pliable, and each band provides a smooth, even stretch, no jerky tension or risk of snapping back in your face. I like that the range runs from a featherlight five pounds up to a hefty 150, which means I can use them for everything from shoulder mobility work to heavy deadlift prep. Chung points out how useful that kind of versatility is, especially for people training across different modalities. “Once you know how to use them properly, they can be one of the most efficient tools in your kit,” he says. That’s exactly what I’ve found—these bands work across skill levels and training styles, and they’ve held up through years of heavy use. Fit Simplify Amazon Material: Natural latexResistancerange: Light to extra heavyStyle: Flat loop style If you’re just getting into resistance band training, this set is a solid place to start. The loop bands are clearly labeled by tension level and come with a quick-start guide that walks through basic movements. I like that they’re soft and stretchy enough to feel approachable but still offer enough tension for activation work. They're especially great for things like glute bridges, clamshells, or warming up before a run. They’re not the most heavy-duty bands out there, and over time, they’ll start to lose some stretch. But for someone new to resistance training, they’re easy to get the hang of and cost less than a takeout lunch. Chung often recommends bands like these to help beginners build body awareness. “They’re a great way to introduce load in a way that’s safe and scalable,” he tells me. Rogue Rogue Material: Layered latex rubberResistance range: 15 to 200 poundsStyle: Loop-style These are the bands I reach for when I want to simulate serious weight—think deadlifts, squats, or assisted pull-ups. They’re thick, tough, and offer more resistance than most people will ever need. Unlike flimsier options, these don’t stretch out or fray, even after years of use. If I’m training without a barbell, I can anchor one of these and still get a challenging hinge pattern or press variation. Chung often uses high-resistance bands like these to replace traditional weights in compound lifts—things like banded presses, rows, or squats. But he cautions that the band has to match the exercise. “If you're trying to challenge a compound movement, you really want to get comfortable pushing and stretching the band further,” he says. Choosing a band that’s too light or unstable, he adds, can actually limit your ability to generate force. They’re not the most beginner-friendly—they’re thick and can be tough to grip without gloves—but if you’re already lifting and want to replicate gym-style intensity with minimal equipment, they’re up for the job. Bodylastics Bodylastics Material: Natural latexResistance range: Up to 96 poundsStyle: Includes handles, door anchor, ankle straps, and carrying bag This set is the closest thing I’ve found to a portable cable machine. Each tube is color-coded and clips into padded handles or ankle straps using carabiners, so you can stack resistance depending on what you're training. I’ve used it for presses, rows, curls—you name it. The internal safety cords are a smart touch, especially when you're pushing heavier tension and want peace of mind mid-rep. For multi-joint movements like chest presses or bent-over rows, the fixed handles provide better grip and alignment than loop bands, which can dig into your hands or slip mid-rep. “If you're trying to do compound exercises, you're probably going to want to use more of a tubular band with handles,” Chung says. There’s a bit of a learning curve, and the whole kit takes up more room than a set of loops. But if you want a full-body resistance system that travels well and supports a wide variety of workouts, this one’s hard to beat. Reformer Loops Reformer Loops Material: FabricResistance range: Light, Medium, HeavyStyle: Non-slip inner grip If you prefer the feel of fabric bands over latex, this set offers a solid mix of comfort, control, and tension. Each loop is wide and soft with an inner grip that keeps the band securely in place—no rolling, bunching, or pinching mid-move. The resistance levels lean toward the heavier side, making them a good choice for lower-body training where you want to create serious tension. While they don’t have the stretch or elasticity of latex, they excel at exercises like glute bridges, side steps, and squats—especially when you want to slow things down and focus on control. Chung often recommends going heavier with bands for exactly that reason. Theraband Amazon Material: Natural latexResistance range: Light, Medium, HeavyStyle: Flat band design (tie to loop) These are the bands I always pack when I travel. They weigh next to nothing, fold down to the size of a napkin, and are just enough to make bodyweight work more effective when I’m away from the gym. I’ve used them for dynamic warm-ups, banded core work, and shoulder mobility sessions in everything from hotel rooms to client warm-ups. One of the things I like most is how customizable they are. Because the bands are flat strips rather than loops or tubes, you can tie them at different lengths depending on what you need, or leave them open-ended for stretches or shoulder pass-throughs. Chung noted that this lighter style of band can be especially useful for mobility-focused movements. That makes them ideal for things like hip openers, chest expansion work, or simply priming the joints before heavier lifting. They’re not meant to replace heavier options if you’re looking to build strength, but for travel or muscle activations, they’re about as convenient and versatile as it gets. Perform Better Amazon Material: Natural latexResistance range: Light to MediumStyle: Loop-style These mini bands are staples in rehab clinics and training rooms for a reason. They’re lightweight, easy to use, and just the right size for glute bridges, clamshells, shoulder activation, or core stability work. I’ve used them as a warm-up tool before lifting, during mobility circuits, and to add a little extra burn to bodyweight sessions. They won’t give you the high tension needed for strength-building movements, but that’s not really the point. These shine when you’re looking to activate smaller muscle groups, rehab an injury, or focus on control and positioning. While Chung emphasizes the importance of progressive overload for strength gains, he notes that lighter bands still serve an important purpose in a mobility routine. Ten Thousand Ten Thousand Made of natural latex and including a travel case, these resistance bands from Ten Thousand range in resistance between 20 and 120 pounds. Bring these on your vacations so there's no excuse for missing a day of working out. EliteFTS Amazon Offering more tension than mini bands but with less tension than light bands, these looped bands make for a great way to warm up before you move onto your regular workout so you're less prone to injury. Synergee Amazon These budget resistance bands are surprisingly durable and come in five varying resistances so you can use them for a whole mess of workouts. Gymreapers Amazon Five resistance bands offer the varying degrees of control you want for different workouts, and their elasticity and high-quality construction mean they'll be in your workout rotation for years to come. Material:The best resistance bands hold up to repeated stretching without fraying, snapping, or losing tension. Latex bands offer great stretch and elasticity, but they degrade over time. Fabric options stay in place and last longer, although they offer less range of motion. Either way, durability comes down to using the right band for the right exercise and knowing when to level up. Chung points out that many people overuse lighter bands because they allow for more movement, but that doesn’t mean they’re doing more. He compares it to weight training: You might be able to perform more reps with a lighter load, but it’s the heavier resistance that leads to greater strength gains. “The intensity you get from trying and testing [a heavier band] actually builds more strength,” he says. Resistance Range:A solid home setup should span light, medium, and heavy resistance levels. Chung recommends starting with a diverse set, especially if bands will be your primary tool. “A good range of light to very heavy mini bands is very valuable to have,” he says. “If you're going to primarily use bands as your way of adding resistance, it’s going to help you give a variety.” He also notes that what feels heavy or light depends on the exercise. Choosing the right band is about understanding movement mechanics and matching resistance to the load you’re trying to create. For example, you might need a much heavier band for banded squats than you would for shoulder external rotations. Style and Setup:Different bands suit different movement patterns. Tube bands with handles mimic cable machines and are best for big movements like presses and rows. Loops and minis are great for activation and lower-body work. Thinner flat bands excel in mobility and recovery settings. “You’re not going to do a press with a mini band, which is really meant for more of a clamshell or squat with the band around the knees,” Chung says. “You’re going to want to use something longer. So really, you just have to account for the range of motion you’re moving through—and the joint you’re trying to train.” What are resistance bands good for? Resistance bands are incredibly versatile. You can use them to build strength, improve mobility, warm up, recover from injury, or simply add more tension to otherwise bodyweight movements. What makes them unique is the way resistance increases as you move through your range of motion—offering more challenge at the peak of an exercise. That makes them especially effective for developing control and stability, as well as strength. They also provide valuable feedback during mobility drills. “A lighter resistance band gives you more feedback when you're coming in and out of those positions that you're trying to get better at,” Chung says. For example, in a banded hip opener or a shoulder pass-through—where you hold the band overhead and slowly move it behind your back to open up the chest and shoulders—the band offers just enough tension to guide your range and reveal where you're restricted, without overloading the joint. Bands won’t fully replace dumbbells or barbells if your goal is to build maximal strength, but they’re one of the most accessible ways to add resistance to nearly any phase of training. How do I use resistance bands? Start by matching the band style to your goal. Flat loop bands are ideal for activation work and targeted muscle engagement, such as glute bridges, lateral walks, or shoulder stability drills. Tube bands with handles are better suited for compound strength training, like presses, rows, and squats. It also helps to think in terms of push and pull movements. You can loop a band around your back for a push-up variation or anchor it for banded rows or face pulls. One of the unique features of band training is that the resistance increases the farther you stretch the band—so the movement gets harder as you reach the end of your range, rather than staying constant like it would with a dumbbell. “Because the weight itself changes, it’s called ‘accommodating resistance,’” Chung explains. “So that’s the term for the resistance changing over the arc of motion.” That feature can be helpful for developing strength in the parts of a movement where you’re naturally stronger, but it also requires more control. For beginners, Chung recommends keeping things simple at first and choosing exercises that let you focus on stability and positioning—like squats to a box or resisted bridges—before advancing to dynamic work. How effective are resistance band workouts? Resistance bands are excellent for developing stability, control, and muscle activation, especially when you're first starting out. But they can also be scaled to challenge more experienced lifters by adjusting your setup. That might mean incorporating isometric holds, anchoring bands differently to change leverage, or using heavier resistance to target strength at the end range of a movement. Chung explained that making bands effective over time comes down to how you apply effort and structure your movement. “You have to train your intent,” he says. “That means pushing hard and creating force, but doing it in a way that feels safe and controlled for your body.” He adds that heavier bands can be particularly useful for building strength through partial ranges, where maintaining control is key. That said, there are ceilings. “Can they be as effective? They can’t—no,” Chung says, referring to free weights by comparison. “At a certain point, if you want to keep increasing your strength and building muscle, you’re going to have to move away from bands and into free weights.” Still, bands are incredibly effective when programmed with purpose—whether that means targeting weak points, warming up more effectively, or training on the go. As a certified personal trainer and pilates instructor, I’ve tested every resistance band on this list across a range of training scenarios—from my own workouts to group strength classes to client programming. I evaluated each band based on its ideal function and performance capabilities during mobility drills, strength circuits, dynamic warm-ups, and accessory work. I paid close attention to resistance quality, comfort, durability, and versatility. I noted how each band handled under repeated use, whether it stayed in place during movement, and how easy it was to incorporate into different movement patterns, whether I was queuing a glute bridge in a class or using one for end-range shoulder work on my own. I also spoke with Chung to better understand how resistance bands can be scaled for different training goals, and where they fit into progressive strength and mobility work. His perspective helped shape not just what made the list, but why these picks stand out in real-world use.",

    "title": "8 Best Patchouli Fragrances, According to a Scent Expert",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Best Patchouli Fragrance OverallTempo Eau de ParfumRead more Diptyque Best Classic Patchouli FragranceAventus Eau de ParfumRead more Neiman Marcus Best Woody Patchouli FragrancePatchouli 24 Eau de ParfumRead more Le Labo Conjure up the idea of the best patchoulifragrancesand your mind may go straight to potpourri or a yoga studio, but while patchouli is indeed often used byperfumersinincensesticks, the ingredient can actually be used in a vast swathe of fragrance combinations to produce a scent that is more woody than medicinal. Used in some of the perfume world’s mostpopular formulas, fromCreedAventus toDiptyqueTempo, this misunderstood herb produces a warm and musky scent that smacks of moss-wood and comfort. Below, you'll find our top picks for the best patchouli fragrances in the game. Diptyque The punchier of a duo of fragrances launched in 2018 to celebrate the 40-year anniversary of Diptyque's founding, Tempo takes no prisoners and plays to the hippie cliché with its abundance of potent patchouli. Three different extractions of the ingredient are used, each from a sustainable supply chain on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. Playing to the tastes of baby-boomers' psychedelia and flower power, perfumer and long-time brand collaborator Olivier Pescheux has created an upbeat and hypnotic classic that is both aromatic and spicy. Bergamot, pink pepper and fresh jasmine add some pep up top, edged in green with violet leaves and the subtle bitter-nutty aroma of cocoa beans. A bouquet of clary sage and Ambrofix takes the baton from there, drying down to a seductive combo of amber accord, a mossy overdose of patchouli and the aromatic flavor of mate (an Argentinian tea). Like a stomp through a primitive forest surrounded by ferns, the whole thing is nicely hemmed in with velvet-like musks. Neiman Marcus You might be surprised to hear that the confident, best-selling Creed Aventus—a central pillar of luxury men’s fragrances—counts patchouli as one of its heart notes. Up top, you’ll be hit with that powerful, spicy-yet-citrusy expression of lemon, apple, and pink pepper, while the longer dry down lingers on birch and musk in the base notes. But at its centre, Creed Aventus pops with pineapple, jasmine, and, yes, patchouli. A more complex men’s cologne than you might think, and still one of the most popular with both our editors and readers. Le Labo Part of the classic collection, and made with 24 ingredients, its bold and brave persona make it a very divisive scent. Composed by perfumer Annick Menardo, the woody chypre allows the smoky, leathery character of birch and styrax to take over at the top of the fragrance, delegating the patchouli to a secondary but vital role to the olfactory shock the fragrance generates, that isn’t initially easy to detect. A stand-out-from-the-crowd and unique parfum, a touch of vanilla is used to bring some peace, sensuality and softness the the animal-like notes. In the words of its creators: “A scent filled with danger, for those who like to walk a tight rope.” Nordstrom Sparkling green citrus and masculine woods give the overall impression in Rozu, a fragrance inspired by the celebrated French modernist designer Charlotte Perriand. Perriand’s life and work has an important part to play in the scent, from the Japanese garden rose that commemorates her name to the fresh notes of shiso referencing the icy alpine outdoors she liked to explore. Heart notes of complementary florals, spice and guaiac wood reflect her bold yet warm character. The powdery notes of vetiver extract, patchouli, and myrrh—which are present in the base—recall the masculine colognes Parriand customarily wore. Blended by master perfumer Barnabé Fillion (who incidentally created the other three Aesop fragrances), Rozu is an intriguing scent that sits somewhere between fresh and aromatic. Bon Parfumeur Amazon Ludovic Bonneton’s niche fragrance house Bon Parfumeur marries the old-school traditions of fine perfumery with a modern-day perspective; a community that offers talented young perfumers the opportunity to exert creative freedom and use exceptional ingredients, without compromise. While all of its fragrances are non-gender-specific, 602 is a very masculine composition: a woody scent peppered with the biting spices of the South Seas. Bordering on a fern-like fougère formula, it opens on sunny notes of neroli and St Thomas berries with incense. The heart reveals a colder, spicy character, with Madagascan black pepper, chili pepper, Somalian frankincense, and cedar, which gives it depth. Woody essences of patchouli, vetiver, and benzoin resin add smoky hints in its long and lingering base. Proving uniquely comforting it will appeal to both fragrance connoisseurs and those less experienced who are simply looking for a heart-warming winter scent. Tom Ford Tom Ford Inspired by Tom’s own rose garden, Rose Prick is a wild bouquet of intoxicating and rare hybrids, featuring an unprecedented trilogy of rose de Mai, Turkish, and Bulgarian roses. Contrasting sharp and pristine with warm and sensual, it’s a heady floral, but is surprisingly wearable for daytime and. The first hit of rose is spiked with the fire of Sichuan pepper and ginger-like spice of turmeric extract, instantly taking away the powdery “grandma” associations of the flower, followed by a big bouncy centre of Bulgarian rose, one of the rarest varieties of rose in the world with over a million blossoms required to make just one kilo of oil. This is where the diffusive and crucial Indonesian patchouli sweeps in with a woody, fern-like quality, followed by smoldering roasted tonka, addictive notes of caramel and vanilla, and a dry down of musk and tolu balsam. Issay Miyake Walmart Powerful, vigorous, and fiery, this is a real bear hug of a scent. Inspired by Mother Earth, the power of the elements and, more specifically, molten volcanic rock, Fusion is an uplifting fougère for men with solar and mineral notes that doesn’t hold its punches. Playing with the contrast of cool with hot spices, the top embraces the sparkling brightness of lemon paired with the milky sweetness of coconut water. The heat is then turned up on a velvety heart of ambrox, rosemary, geranium, and cardamom before drying down to a foundation of warm volcanic wood and a healthy does of patchouli. Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle Neiman Marcus Frederic Malle’s Editions de Parfums library of fine fragrances allows a circle of renowned perfumers total creative freedom—and with no budgetary restrictions. One of the first ever perfumer-cooperatives of this kind, the resultant diversity of contributors and competitive spirit has led to some of the world’s finest fragrance creations. One such icon is Monsieur. For the man who wears a pinstripe suit with some swagger and self assurance, it’s a scent that doesn’t hold back the punches; powerful yet somehow gentile. Opening with a cocktail of mandarin and rum absolute, patchouli does all of the heavy lifting. Incense, suede, and cedar form its underlying sensual pulse. Revealing the style behind an impeccable appearance, a touch of musk and vanilla has the final word. Patchouli is a species of herb from the mint family known scientifically asPogostemon cablin. It producees a strong fragrance that is more woody than herbal. The oil produced from the leaves is unusual as it actually gets better with age—freshly distilled oil is greener and sharper than an aged oil, which will develop to smell richer and deeper. For a number of people, however, it will always be associated with the hippy movement of the 1960s—and not necessarily in a good way (it has been described as smelling like a Grateful Dead concert). Fortunately, over time, patchouli aftershaves have shaken off this image and are today at the heart of the “chypre” family of fragrances, most often described as warm and mossy-woody.

    "title": "The 5 Best Exercises for Pumping Up Your Biceps",
    "article_text": "In the age offunctional trainingand workouts designed to supposedly help uslive longer, I’ve found that working on my biceps has weirdly become a sort of guilty pleasure. Do stronger biceps help me out in my daily life on Manhattan’s West Side? Maybe a little, but not really. Will they extend my stay in this mortal coil? Doubtful. But I’ll be damned if I’m going to let the trend cycle influence my human right to exercise for aesthetic reasons. Sun’s out, guns out, baby. Unless your job requires you to squeeze into an F1 cockpit, race a bicycle up Alpe d'Huez, ormake Mike White happy, there’s no reason to train your biceps—but there’s no reasonnotto train your biceps, either. But surely you’d prefer to have a cut set of arms? In order to understand what makes a great biceps exercise—and why it’s worth having more than one of them in your rotation—you should first have an understanding of the anatomy involved. (I’ll keep it brief, I promise.) The biceps brachii—collectively, the long and short heads of the biceps—are the part you would probably point to if I asked you to show me your biceps muscle. (Oh, also—“biceps” is singular as well as plural. There is no “bicep.”) The long head is on the outside, and the short head is the part that’s closest to your torso. But there’s more. (Only a little bit, I swear.) “You also have the brachialis, which helps with elbow flexion, and then the brachioradialis, which connects into the forearm,” says Max Castrogaleas, CSCS, an exercise physiologist atHSS. “They’re going to be involved when you're doing exercises like a hammer curl or a reverse curl, and they’re also going to give you the support you need to perform the more isolated movements.” The point is, while the biceps brachii gets most of the glory, strengthening your brachialis and brachioradialis is what ultimately enables you to train those mighty mirror muscles. And the more attention you pay to these unsung heroes, the bigger you can ultimately go on your curls. Conveniently, though, the best biceps exercises give you a bit of both, and if you include even two or three of the exercises below in your training, you’ll be golden. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. The OG biceps curl is still one of the best exercises you can do to fill out your shirtsleeves. “‘Supinated grip’ just means you're performing the curl with your palms facing up,” says Luke Carlson, founder and CEO ofDiscover Strength. “This can be done with dumbbells, a barbell, or on a machine. Either way, the supinated-grip biceps curl is key.” That’s because, of all the biceps exercises, this one hits the muscle group most holistically. “The biceps does three things,” explains Carlson. “The first function is to supinate, or rotate outwards. That's actually the first role of the bicep, and very few people who lift weights are aware of that. The second is to cause flexion at the elbow, which is what we think about when we do a curl.” (The third is to bring the humerus forward—that is, raise your arm.) The supinated-grip biceps curl takes direct aim at the first two. “To maximize the biceps, we want to make sure we're supinating and then curling as well,” says Carlson. The supinated-grip biceps curl “accomplishes two of the major functions of the biceps, so it’s a wonderful exercise, because it mimics the exact kinesiological function of the biceps.” How to do it: Trainer tip: You might have noticed some people at the gym rotating their grip as they curl the weights up, presumably in order to involve additional muscles. “They're essentially working on different areas of the biceps as they're playing around with the rotation of the forearm,” says Castrogaleas. The thing with this technique is, regardless of which way you’re rotating, you’re not hitting either set of muscles as directly as you would if you just picked one grip. “There’s no benefit to rotating as you curl up,” says Carlson. “There's also a lot of gym mythology about how, as you curl up, your pinky has to be above your index finger, and that's just not the case.” When it comes to biceps exercises, even subtle adjustments can make huge differences. While a hammer curl (technically, a neutral-grip biceps curl) might look almost identical to a supinated-grip biceps curl, there’s a lot more going on. “This is where we're going to target the brachialis—one of the major elbow flexors—and then also the brachioradialis, the muscle that connects into the forearm,” says Castrogaleas. Yes, you’re training your biceps muscles, but you’re also training the supporting muscles that will ultimately enable you to lift even more weight and possibly prevent an injury. “When you start to isolate a muscle, especially the biceps brachii—the short head and long head—those muscles are going to fatigue pretty fast, so you might start to use a little bit of momentum, which could put stress on tendons, the joints, and even your back,” he says. With the hammer curl, “we're engaging more of the muscles that give us grip and support.” How to do it: Trainer tip: As you curl the weights up, “you can bring the dumbbells slightly inwards, towards the midline of the body,” says Castrogaleas. “Either way, you're still going to be targeting similar muscles. However, once you go a little bit closer into the midline of the body, you can get the long head of the biceps to kick in a little bit more.” Also, a little bit of momentum is okay during your last rep or two, “especially when you're working towardsmuscular hypertrophy,” he says. “Just make sure you’re not arching through your back or pulling with your torso.” “The chin-up is a great way to stimulate the biceps through a full range of motion, including in a stretched position,” says Carlson. “We have some evidence that training in a stretched position, where the biceps is more elongated, might more effectively stimulate hypertrophy.” Not only is the chin-up a great exercise for building your biceps, but it’s actually also technically a functional movement, says Castrogaleas, so it comes with the added benefit of helping you perform isolation exercises (like the other moves on this list) and even some tasks outside the gym more safely and effectively. “It strengthens all of the areas that you need to hold a stable position,” says Castrogaleas. “Although a biceps curl is going to be simpler to perform, I like to make sure that the individuals that I work with have overall strength before they start to go into isolation movements.” How to do it: Trainer tip: “Make sure that as you're pulling yourself up, you're keeping your shoulders away from your ears,” says Castrogaleas. “What tends to happen, especially when you don't have adequate back, shoulder, or arm strength, is you start to pull a little bit too much with your shoulders or traps, and the shoulders start to come up to the ears a little bit. That can put a little bit more strain on your neck.” You could do preacher curls on a preacher bench or even a regular bench, but to get the most out of this exercise you’ll want to skip the free weights and head over to the machines. The simple reason: gravity. “If you think about it, gravity acts in one direction on a weight. But when you do a biceps curl, you're creating rotation around the elbow joint,” says Carlson. “So, you end up being strong and weak at different points. If you have a 30-pound barbell in your hands, at some points it's way too light. At others, it's too heavy.” With a machine, “there's direct resistance that your biceps muscles have to oppose at every portion of the range of motion. There are no dead spots; there's just constant tension throughout the entire range of motion,” he says. “So, I think, if anybody really wants to grow big biceps, a biceps curl machine should always be a priority.” How to do it: Trainer tip: If you have access to a biceps curl machine, Carlson advises using this instead of doing curls with free weights, including the supinated-grip biceps curl and hammer curl mentioned above. Whether or not this is possible will depend on the design of the machine—specifically, if its handles allow for different grips. “One hundred percent, if someone has access to [a biceps curl machine], they should definitely choose that,” he says. We already talked about how rotating your grip 45 degrees inward from a supinated grip to a neutral grip recruits more of the supporting muscles around the elbow and forearm. Well, the reverse curl (again, technically, a pronated-grip biceps curl) takes things a step further. “Like the hammer curl, we're still involving the different heads of the biceps and the brachioradialis and brachialis, but this one's going to mainly shift the focus to the forearms,” says Castrogaleas. It's still a biceps exercise (whenever you're flexing at the elbow, you’re involving your biceps), but you can think of the reverse curl more as a supporting movement that’s going to boost your performance across the board—from biceps curls to power cleans. “It’s going to help with compound movements, such as the chin-up, the pull-up, the lat pull-down, and really anything where the elbow has to flex,” he says. How to do it: Trainer tip: Most biceps curl machines won’t have a good grip option for reverse curls, but you can use a standard preacher curl bench to add extra stability and focus to this movement. If available at your gym, Castrogaleas recommends setting up on a preacher bench and using an EZ curl bar instead of dumbbells. (That’s the zig zag-shaped barbell that you can put plates on.) Unlike a typical straight bar, the EZ bar is going to let you put your hands in a more natural position while performing this exercise.",

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Kickbacks at the beach, far-away vacays, glizzies in the sunshine—all in all, the warmer seasons are a net positive. But the heat deprives us of one very important thing: layering. These are arguably the worst months for fashion enjoyers. Forced to shed our hard-earned drip, we have to rely on accessories to make up the difference. And while wecouldturn up the heat with swanky watches and icy earrings, there’s one accessory—blazing out of the unstoppablecowboy trend—that’s taking the lead this year. That accessory is the western belt. Don’t be alarmed: If you think western belts can be ostentatious—or a signal that you’re overcompensating forsomething—you’re not wrong. But those big honkin’F-150 belts, adorned with studs, swirly stitching, and a license plate-sized buckle aren’t the belts we’re talking about today. Instead, what we’re seeing is a minimal western belt, a subdued version that eschews the gaudier side of the cowboy aesthetic, but still has clear roots in the tradition. They’re slimmer, no wider than one inch, and come without the festoons of their peacock-y saloon-busting siblings. With just a few hits of metal at the keeper, the tip, and at the horse-shoe-shaped buckle, the stealthy western belt rides perfectly on your hips, whether or not your style leans western. They can add a pinch of pizzazz to a pared-downwhite teeandkhakisfit, or even bring some levity to a more serioustwo-piece suitwithout feeling like you’re Jon Voight inMidnight Cowboy. Take it from us: We’ve seen them around theGQoffice, in every cool guy haunt around New York City, and even on regular-degular dudes who haven’t got the time to pay any attention to the menswear landscape. The great news now is that brands big and small have caught on to the belt’s stylish versatility. From small-scale upstarts to runway behemoths and every brand in-between, the minimal western belt is everywhere. Here are just a few of our favorites on the market right now.

    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. In the menswear world, Japanese denim—artful, high quality, often woven on vintage machinery—is as universally beloved as french fries and Pedro Pascal. Levi’s, born and headquartered in San Francisco, is theundisputed heavyweight champ of jeans, and has been for 150 years. Today we get the best of both in a Pacific-Ocean-spanning collaboration known asthe Blue Tab collection. It upgrades the Levi’s silhouettes you know and love (and a few you might not know yet, butwilllove) with some of the finest denim Japan has to offer. The 11-piece limited collection has jackets, shirts and, of course, jeans made with fabrics you’d usually find hanging on the racks of menswear boutiques. Levi’s even developed a proprietary denim with famed Japanese mill Kaihara for pieces in the unisex capsule. Levi's Levi's Levi's Levi's What it lacks in breadth, Levi’s Blue Tab collection makes up for in beauty. For instance, the Marker Loose Fit Jeans were made with a lightweight selvedge denim woven on old-school shuttle looms, turning an already bonkers (in the best way) full-legged pair of jeans into something you can keep for decades. On the other end of the showoff spectrum, the collection’s 1980s 501 Original Fit Jeans are a near stitch-for-stitch reproduction of what Levi’s sold your dad — though this time around, the jeans are available in a kaleidoscope of washed-out blues, plus an inkyiterationif you feel like earning those fades on your own. As denim freaks know, dark Japanese denim in one of the greatest cuts of all time for less than $300 is close to petty theft. Levi's Levi's Levi's Levi's Since this is Levi’s, there are a few iterations on the brand’s denim jackets in the Blue Tab mix. Our favorite might be theType III Jacket; structurally it’s the same as ever, but the shade of blue is so deep and complex that it deserves to be in the Criterion Closet. Meanwhile, the collection’s Relaxed Button Down could very well become the MVP of your shirt supply. If, like us, you miss Levi’s now-shuttered premium lines (RIP Levi’s Vintage Clothing and Made & Crafted), its Blue Tab collection is the closest you’ll get to recapturing the heady days of relatively affordable top-tier denim gear in eminently wearable shapes and a broad run of sizes. This time around, though, the clock’s ticking: Blue Tab is only being released in limited numbers. Check it all out atLevi’s. Levi's Levi's Levi's Levi's",

    "title": "Every Single MoonSwatch Ranked",
    "article_text": "This is an edition of the newsletterBox + Papers,Cam Wolf’s weekly deep dive into the world of watches.Sign up here. Omega and Swatch are always full of surprises,but the new Snoopy MoonSwatch Mission to the Moonphasefeels like it might be theclimax of the MoonSwatch era.The two collaborators have milked everything they could out of this line,releasing a new limited-edition version nearly every month last yearafter dropping the original 11 models in 2022. The release of the Snoopy watch—which is stilldriving enough hype to shut down storestwo years after the line’s initial release—makes 29 MoonSwatches in total (there are 28 here because I consolidated the black and white versions of the Snoopy into a single entry). Human nature demands that we rank anything we can, so I’ve gone ahead and done that with every single MoonSwatch. 28. MoonSwatch Mission to Mercury The Mercury doesn’t bring the vibrancy and verve of the more colorful MoonSwatches, while also placing second in the Best Imitation of the OG Speedmaster competition. 27. Mission on Earth Desert If you ask me, the point of a MoonSwatch is to get the Speedmaster vibes cranked up to a million with fun characters, cute graphic renderings of planets, or super vibrant colors. The Mission on Earth checks none of those boxes so unfortunately it ranks near the bottom of the pile for me. 26 to 21. MoonSwatch Mission to Moonshine Gold Swiss Lantern, Beaver Moon, Snowflake, Flower Moon, Harvest Moon, Pink Moon I’m not a huge fan of the Mission to Moonshine watches as a concept. The MoonSwatches are supposed to be balls-to-the-wall fun, so adding a tiny gold-coated adornment to one feels like trying to class up a piece of American cheese (which is great!) with a single bead of caviar. Many of the designs, which generally appear only on the gold-coated hand, don’t hit for me either. The Swiss Lantern is reminiscent of the Red Cross logo. Why do I want a beaver imprint on my Moonwatch lookalike again? December’s Snowflake is a winter novelty item. June’s Flower Moon design shows up as harmless doodles on the golden hand. The Harvest Moon’s “barley” pattern ends up creating a nice texture. The Pink Moon adds the most zest out of this bunch. 20. Mission to the Moon I understand the Mission to the Moon’s appeal as the version that best apes the original Moonwatch, but that’s really not what makes this collaboration special to me. These MoonSwatches aren’t meant to be pieces racked with provenance and history—and they’re certainly not built to be worn as daily drivers. Sorry, but I don’t think the MoonSwatch is passing NASA’s extreme battery of tests. In the end, this is just a regular black watch that looks an awful lot like a Moonwatch but… isn’t one. 19. Mission to the Moon Moonshine Gold Same as above + a lil’ gold hand. 18. Mission on Earth This is where the fun begins. The Mission on Earth, with its navy blue dial and seafoam green case, is my least favorite of the good stuff. I still really like the combination, though, and think it’s a clever use of the Earth’s seen-from-space colors. The rankings got very difficult from this point on. 17. Mission to the Sun Even for me this watch might be havingtoomuch fun. And we all know what they say about the guy who flew too close to the sun, right? 16. Mission to Moonshine Gold Strawberry Moon Omega and Swatch hit a solid triple with this version of the Mission to Moonshine Gold. The playful strawberries would fit right in at the Sanrio store (positive). 15. Mission to Pluto While I’m usually not a huge fan of fauxtina, it looks great here with those burgundy subdials. 14. Mission on Earth Polar Lights Omega and Swatch aren’t just finding inspiration in the outer reaches of our galaxy to make great watches. Last summer, the pair stayed home and released a trio of “Mission on Earth” watches: Desert, Lava, and Polar Lights, proving there’s plenty of beauty on our current planet. This one’s blue color is borrowed from the lights of the Aurora Borealis but I particularly love those silvery dials and indices that mimic the stars. 13. Mission to Jupiter IfDune: Part Twois the best menswear movie of the year so far, this watch is the Lisan Al-Gaib. What really wins me over is those tangerine accents paired with the sandy dial and case. 12. Mission to Venus Barbie’s year of dominance might have come to an end, but I’m not over this powder-pink case. A watch as delicate and delightful as a cloud of cotton candy. 11. Mission to the Pink Moonphase If you’re into the Mission to Venus’s cotton-candy pink vibe, this watch does that but better. Not only are the colors more vibrant onthis Ed Sheeran-approved variantbut it also brings in more functionality with a Moonphase. 10. Mission to Saturn The image of Saturn at 6 o’clock is the type of detail every MoonSwatch could use. The planet’s really big ring makes for a perfect graphic sprinkling. 9. Mission on Earth Lava Bonus points are always given for a MoonSwatch with a rare Speedmaster variant counterpart. This Lava-inspired MoonSwatch is an homage to the beloved “Ultraman” version of the Speedy, which is known for its gregarious orange hands. This being the MoonSwatch, the brands weren’t satisfied withjusta bright cara cara-colored hand. Instead, the whole case is remade in this orangeish-red hue. I’m not complaining about the extra color. 8. Mission to Earthphase We have to give this watch props for “inventing” an entirely new complication. While many watches over time have featured a moonphase, which tracks lunar buddy over its many waxes and wanes, this one reverses the idea. If you’re wearing a Speedmaster or one of its descendants it’s at leastpossibleyou’re not on earth looking up at the moon but in space looking down at our home planet. If so, this is the watch for you. Omega takes the popular moonphase but inverts it so the wearer sees the earth from the perspective of standing on the moon. 7. Mission to Neptune The Mission to Neptune’s release coincided with the blue ceramic craze, making this one of the best original MoonSwatches—even with all the shenanigans around it. (About those shenanigans: original versions of this variation left a blue mark on the wearer’s wrist. It was temporarily removed from production until Omega and Swatch could fix the problem leading to a scarcity effect that ironically made the initially defective piece the most desirable of the OG selection.) Even without the unintentional rareness of this piece I think it still would have been a bestseller. It hits a sweet spot: the dark navy makes this the safest choice of the more colorful variations. 6. Neptune moonshine Above + a lil’ gold hand. 5. Mission to Uranus Depending on your maturity level, you’re either choosing this watch because you think it transcends the inevitable Uranus jokes or because you want tomakethe inevitable Uranus jokes. Opting for baby blue over navy blue requires taste and Austin Powers-level mojo. 4. MoonSwatch 1965 TheMoonSwatch 1965 comes with some brag-worthy historicalchops. The date is a tribute to the year that the Speedmaster became the official watch of NASA, setting the course for Omega to make history as the watch that was brought along for the moon landing. However, all this is really just an excuse to make an affordable version of theexcellent white-dial Speedy that Omega released in early 2024. The ‘65 MoonSwatch drafts off that new-ish watch while providing some cool details, like the vintage Omega logo on the dial. 3. Mission to Moonshine “Lollipop” My highest ranking Mission to Moonshine, because this watch delivers so much more than a tribute to the Beaver Moon. The lollipop-style hand is a sacred piece of design in Omega’s toolbox. This MoonSwatch plays direct tribute to the Speedmaster CK 2998-3 FAP from 1961 with a similar lollipop hand. (Hands are a big deal!) This is what the MoonSwatches should be doing: educating collectors and whetting their appetite to maybe own the real thing one day. 2. Mission to Mars Inarguably the best of the original MoonSwatches. You get serious nods to Omega history wrapped up with Swatch’s incredibly fun pops of color. This model is a tribute to Omega’s iconic “Alaska Project” watch, which came with a bright-red aluminum shield built to help the piece endure Alaska's extreme temperatures. The unique shape of the red hands, modeled after Mercury Space Capsules, also come from the Alaska Project Speedmaster. It’s the Swatch collaborations at their best: enabling customers to get a morsel of the bonafides with a lot more of the wackiness. (This is the same reason I like theArctic Ocean Blancpain x Swatchwith the radiation symbol best.) The Snoopy MoonSwatch is on another tier for me. It really has it all: See all of our newsletters, includingBox + Papers,here.",

    "title": "How a Watch Repair Expert Saved a Destroyed Rolex",
    "article_text": "At Grand Central Watch, a repair shop in midtown Manhattan, owner Wilson Masache carefully inspects a Rolex Explorer II that was burnt up in an apartment fire. The watch is a tragedy: more charred than the crust of a wood-fired pizza. From the blackened dial to the dysfunctional movement inside, the watch will require extensive restoration. The Explorer II is an especially interesting project for Masache, who is tasked with treating it as his own personal Ship of Theseus. The timepiece is alsothe star of our new watch-dedicated series,The Movement. The Movementmakes its debut onGQ’s YouTube channel today. The series walks through the restoration of a watch—in this case a charbroiled Rolex—in painstaking detail. Over the course of nearly 40 minutes, not only will you witness Masache bring the Rolex back to life, you’ll also find a comprehensive overview of what makes this Explorer special and how luxury timepieces like it function. The first episode opens with a close-up of our protagonist: the Rolex Explorer II. The series zooms in on the microscopic parts that watchmakers like Masache have to handle and outlines all the delicate maneuvers he performs in order to keep them safe. Special tools are sourced specifically to work on Rolex watches, like a movement holder, and even the simple removal of rusted hands requires layers of protective materials before separating them from the rest of the dial. The Movementstars a dramatically destroyed watch, but by watching the show you’ll come to understand timepieces in general. Throughout the episode, informational boxes pop up to describe what you’re looking at as the watch is disassembled and put back together. It’s cool to see a burnt watch returned to life, but even more satisfying when you realize you learned what a cannon pinion does or why a luxury Swiss timepiece sometimes needs to take a sound bath. The show is divided into separate sections, coursing out all the steps necessary to repairing a watch. Disassembly alone is a massive undertaking when dealing with a watch so badly damaged. Watchmakers have to take careful measures not to turn a damaged watch into an irreparable one. After it’s taken apart, the watch is cleaned and polished using all sorts of specialized equipment and tools, ranging from the aforementioned high-tech sound baths to simple pencils made expressly for this purpose. Lastly, the watch is put together again using a combination of fresh pieces from Rolex and the original ones Masache was able to salvage. In the last section, the Explorer II is put back together, and the final result is a real testament to the longevity of these finely made timepieces. Whetherit was once swallowed by a cow and left in a fieldor burnt up in an apartment fire, these are watches built to endure practically anything. And while a full repair sometimes requires new parts, it’s a miracle that anything short of actual sorcery can save this watch from a junkyard. If you’ve ever watched David Attenborough’s narration on thePlanet Earthseries and wished someone would replace the series’ darling mountain goats with a precisely made timepiece,The Movementis for you. I guarantee you’ll never find a more relaxed environment to learn about a watch's inner workings.",

    "title": "Black Dandyism Through the Decades: A Look Back Through the GQ Archives",
    "article_text": "In September 1967,Sammy Davis Jr. became the first Black man to appear on the cover ofGQ,in a photograph that looks just as ineffably cool now as it did then. Leaning up against a blond-wood fence, the legendary Harlem-born entertainer draped the jacket of his three-piece double-breasted plaid suit over his shoulders, his right arm loosely hugged around his torso, showcasing his wide gold pinky ring. The swoopy, hand-drawn cover line proclaimed Davis as “something else!” Something else, indeed—in more ways than our predecessors ever could have known six decades ago. Next week, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute will present its spring exhibitionSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style, which will parse a history of Black fashion and expression through the exuberant suiting and formalwear ofdandyism. The so-calledMen’s Galafelt like an opportune moment to look back on how Black creativity and style has manifested inGQ’s history—in front of and behind the camera; through words, clothes, and other wisdom. From Davis onward, we combed through the magazine’s back catalogs and found a lineage of new and familiar faces in various states of elegance and theatricality: Miles Davis at his grooviest; a fresh-faced Magic Johnson in pleated khakis; a vaudevillian portrait of Bernie Mac; Tyler, the Creator in a corduroy tux. We spoke toGQpioneers like Jim Moore and Mobolaji Dawodu, as well as trailblazing cover models Urs Althaus and Rashid Silvera, about how these images came to life. As more Black creatives joined the publication behind the scenes in the late 2010s, representations of dandyism in the magazine have continued to evolve. The thing about images, though, is that there is always more life going on beyond the frame. Early on, the magazine’s vision was anchored in a Eurocentric ideal of decorum, but over the decades its definition of style and sophistication evolved to include people of color, queer people, women, and those who reside at the intersection of those identities. Central to this expansion is the influence of transatlantic Black dandyism. In her 2009 bookSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity, Monica L. Miller explores how this sartorial tradition became a way for Black people to challenge dogmas of who gets to be seen as refined and respectable. That history and Miller’s research are at the heart of this year’s Met exhibition. When Sammy Davis Jr. graced the magazine’s September 1967 cover, he didn’t just model clothing; he broke barriers as the first person of colorto frontGQ.In a year fraught with violent manifestations of racial tension, it wasn’t easy to be a Black person on the cover of a historically white national magazine. The United States had just legally desegregated with the passage of the Civil Rights Act three years earlier, Malcolm X was assassinated two years prior, the carnage in the Vietnam War was escalating, and nearly every week a riot broke out across the nation in protest of police brutality and racial inequality. Still, Davis embodied the epitome of elegance, decked out in a Sy Devore three-piece, hair perfectly coiffed, and flashing a megawatt smile. Two years before hisGQcover, the American entertainer published his autobiographyYes I Can,where he recounted his family band’s reputation as the best-dressed group around: “Even if each of the trio owned only one suit and one pair of shoes, the suit was pressed, the shoes shined,” theGQprofiler notes in the text accompanying the 1967 shoot; later, when Davis hit the big time, he treated himself to Carnaby Street shopping sprees. “I have a feel for clothes. I think things out—there must be a reason for everything,” Davis said. No matter the circumstances, impeccable self-presentation was a constant. That’s the essence of the Black dandy—smiling and “stylin’” through it all, as Miller puts it. GQturned its gaze toward Africa in the February and April 1968 issues. The former featured a dashiki on the cover, while the latter centered on a journey to Kenya. In the accompanying April spread, a striking portrait of a rural Maasai family by Horn/Griner shows a man standing in a “French-cuffed dinner shirt of silvery blue rayon, nylon, and…metallic threads” paired with a dinner jacket from After Six. He’s dressed for a formal evening at home. On his feet are sandals worn in from a long day of walking. Although his attire is of Western origin, he still maintains his tribal identity through his ornate earrings and the staff in his hand. Black models begangracing the coverofGQin 1973, when Pat Cleveland became the standout star of the December “Elegance Again” issue. In the accompanying editorial, she radiates opulence, draped in everything from a mink-lined black cashmere coat to a sequin-striped John Anthony suit adorned with a dramatic lavallière collar. Though several men appear throughout the spread, Cleveland remains the centerpiece, effortlessly lounging and strutting aboard the SSMichelangelo. Urs Althaus, a Nigerian-Swiss model, was just 22 years old when he becameGQ’s first Black male model cover star on the November 1977 issue. According to Althaus, he didn’t quite grasp the gravity of that distinction untilGQart director Harry Coulianos greeted him at the New York shoot with a glass of champagne. They toasted and celebrated this landmark moment—though Coulianos did express his anxiety over the decision. “We were looking at the picture selections,” Althaus recalls, “and [Coulianos] went over to me and said, ‘I might be fired. It’s the first time we are coming out with a Black man in a [full] spread.’” The cover, however, was a success—and opened up opportunities for Althaus to model for Yves Saint Laurent, Valentino, Calvin Klein, and Armani. Two years later, in the November 1979 issue, Renauld White became the first African American male model to graceGQ’s cover. (According to Althaus, White actually shot hisGQcover prior to Althaus’s shoot in 1977, but it was left unpublished for several years.) The cover actually marked White’s third appearance inGQthat year—he starred in spreads in both the February and September issues as well. The February feature was particularly notable: Titled “For Black Men Only: A Complete Guide to Skin and Hair Care,” White not only modeled but also received a coordinator credit alongside skin care specialist Gordon Lee, who operated a Black treatment salon in New York; the piece served as a launching pad for a recurring column about grooming, health, and fitness called “Distinctively Black,” which was written by Lee and others, and ran throughout the 1980s. This lifestyle column—alongside a notable rise in advertisements featuring Black models and products tailored specifically for Black hair and skin—marked a pivotal shift: BlackGQreaders were finally beginning to see themselves reflected in the pages of the iconic American men’s magazine. Inside issues from the ’70s, Black designers, musicians, and athletes were spotlighted as vanguards of menswear. Eugene Reimen and Bert Middleton earned spots in the American Discovery designers’ roundup in 1971 for their innovative work—Middleton’s lavish furs and Reimen’s vivid color patchwork. Walt Frazier, the legendary New York Knicks point guard, took up a full page in his pinstriped suit for the February 1970 issue featuring up-and-coming athletes as part of a spread titled “Tomorrow People Today.” And at the intersection of music and dandyism, both Miles Davis and Isaac Hayes discussed their eclectic careers and equally eclectic wardrobes. “Nearly as celebrated as Miles Davis’s trumpet playing is his long-standing eye for fashion,” read a caption in a feature about the jazz legend from the winter 1970 issue, putting a spotlight on his “strikingly contemporary” preference for “unorthodox hides” and “casual vest-type tops” in the midst of one of his groovier phases. In October 1980, the year he would first star asStar Wars’s suave con man Lando Calrissian inThe Empire Strikes Back,Billy Dee Williams smoldered on the magazine’s cover in a stylish sport coat and skinny tie. The inside spread was full Hollywood movieland glamour, and Williams looked handsome as ever: posted up in a charcoal double-breasted suit on a plush poolside chaise the hue of a lemon rind; grinning widely in a sharp suit and dark aviator shades while leaned against his own Mercedes parked outside the storied LA celebrity hotspot Ma Maison, the birthplace of California cuisine on Melrose Avenue, where Wolfgang Puck cut his teeth. “When I’m not acting or painting, clothes serve a form of creative expression,” Williams said then. “Classic dressing is much easier to deal with since trends keep coming and going. These looks never change.” Williams’s starry appearance would mark the magazine’s transition from mostly featuring models on its covers to entertainers and celebrities, but not before Rashid Dilworth Silvera—a “Jamaican-made,” Boston-born educato with a post teaching literary philosophy at Scarsdale High School in Scarsdale, New York, where he would go on to teach for 36 years—would have his model-making turn on the April 1983 cover. Despite Silvera’s preternatural fashion sense passed down to him, he says, from the maternal grandparents who raised him, he had never had any intentions of modeling. But one summer, while Silvera was frolicking with his then-girlfriend outside his friend’s beach house on Fire Island, he was spotted by a nearby neighbor, the designer Perry Ellis, who flagged him down to aGQproducer. But it wasn’t until receiving a phone call to confirm the spelling of his name (long after he shot a number of suit-centric editorials with renowned fashion photographer Rico Puhlmann) that Silvera, then 35, learned that the magazine had selected a solo shot of him—a closeup in a chunky yellow knit sweater that showcased his sparkling eyes and glossy beard—as the cover. He was dumbfounded. “When they called me to ask me the correct spelling of my name, I’m thinking,This is someone messing with me. There’s a joke,” Silvera recalls now. “I mean,GQwas like a type of bible for me. And I’m the cover?” The cover, he says, was a green light to a whole new universe. He went on to become the first Black man to model in advertisements for Ralph Lauren, as well as one of the American menswear icon’slongtime muses. (“You’re going to be my Cary Grant,” Silvera recalls Lauren telling him when they first met.) Dandyism “embodies something that’s more than formal. It’s playful,” says Silvera. “I used to be a football player. I was an athlete. But my uniform was impeccable, do you get me? I mean, one of the reasons I ran so fast and I got to be sort of a famous athlete is because I didn’t want people to tackle me. I didn’t want to mess up my outfit.” To him, the fashion inGQwas always “about comfort. You know, it would be comfortable in your skin. If your skin is going to be your clothing, well then be as comfortable in that clothing as you would be in your own skin.” Fast forwardthrough the yuppie era to March 1987, when Magic Johnson was well on his way to cementing his place as one of the greatest offensive players the NBA has ever seen. He grinned in a navy sport coat, pleated khakis, and a polka-dotted yellow tie. Two years later, Michael Jordan—also sporting a dotted tie and a pearly grin—madehisGQcover debutwith a shoot by the legendary Richard Avedon; even then, just half a decade into his professional career, the cover line declared MJ as “the best there ever was.” The NBA was entering its superstar era, which would carry over intothe 1990swith its rising stars taking suits to new heights—literally, figuratively, spiritually, all of the above. In November ’93, the seven-foot-one Shaquille O’Neal graced the cover in a peaked-lapel suit whose jacket fell to his mid-thigh, paving the way for the fever-dream draft suits of the Anthonys and the Stoudemires to come. In the ’90s, from professional basketball to magazine-making, everything was going Hollywood. Denzel Washington, photographed in a monochromatic navy kit onthe January ’94 cover, was leading a new generation of Black movie stars. Halfway through the decade, the suits gotsleek,and so, too, were the models: Who else but the first Black male supermodel, Tyson Beckford, in a glen-plaid, peak-lapeled, single-breasted Valentino Couture kit and sporty wraparound shades, could usher in 1995 as “the Year of the Suit”? While the standardGQlook ofthis era—think clean, gray, boxy Armani suits—resulted in plenty of iconic images, it didn’t leave much room for the spirited wiles of dandyism. Those flourishes, however, would soon return in force. Inthe 2000s, hip-hop continued its ascent as a mainstream phenomenon—andGQwholeheartedly embraced the genre’s growing influence on music, fashion, and culture. Jay-Z and Kanye West fronted the Men of the Year issues in 2006 and 2007, respectively, both donning impeccably tailored suits that nodded to their rise as industry moguls. Elsewhere in the magazine’s pages, stars likePharrell WilliamsandAndré 3000reflected hip-hop’s colorful embrace of the preppy aesthetic. In the February 2009 issue, the latter’s fashion label, Benjamin Bixby, earned a coveted spot inGQ’s annual Best New Menswear Designers in America package. For Jim Moore,GQ’s creative director at large, it was a no-brainer to include the Outkast rapper’s designs in the roundup. “It was a mix of his love of Tommy [Hilfiger] from the early ’90s to his color sense and his history,” he explains. “It was everything from formal wear to fluorescent polo shirts. It had a lot of chutzpah and a lot of style, a lot of grit, a lot of his personality.” The decade, of course, also gave America its first Black president. For Barack Obama’s secondGQcover, in December 2008 (his first arrived during his campaign in September 2007), Moore wasn’t allowed to dress the president-elect due to a Secret Service rule prohibiting any incoming or sitting presidents from wearing any clothes other than their own. The suit that Obama pulled from his own closet for the shoot, Moore says, “was definitely a size too big.” With only a 15-minute window to get the shoot done, Moore went to extreme lengths to ensure a proper fit: “As I was talking to him,” he recalls, “I had the tailor go behind him and start pinning the back of it.” Some of the era’s most iconic covers also carry an air of mischief and satire. Take comedian Bernie Mac’s April 2003 cover, for example. Echoing the subversive spirit of 18th-century Pinksters celebrations or 19th-century cakewalks—where Black people parodied European dances and outfits—Mac appears in a tailcoat, top hat, tap shoes, and a hooked cane. In doing so, he not only satirizes traditional symbols of white American entertainment but also asserts his place within its legacy. In the 2010s,GQ’s purview of dandyism expanded. Janelle Monáe, for one, became a recurring figure in the magazine’s pages, thanks in part to the slim tuxedos she had made a vital part of her onstage uniform. “I want to redefine what it means to be young, black, wild, and free in America,”she toldGQ’s Mark Anthony Green in 2017. Meanwhile,Colin Kaepernick’s Men of the Year coverthat year opened doors for more Black creatives to work withGQbehind the scenes. In the lead-up to the shoot, Kaepernick requested to wear only designers of color for the cover and inside spread. “At the time, I felt ashamed that I hadn’t thought of the idea,” explains Moore,GQ’s creative director at large, “but as soon as he said it, I was like, ‘That’s the most brilliant idea.’” Kaepernick and his stylist Rachel Johnson providedGQwith a long list of Black designers, includingJerry Lorenzo of Fear of Godand Davidson Petit-Frère. Miles Pope,GQ’s current global fashion director, was an assistant on the shoot and recalls getting introduced to the bespoke boutique Harlem Haberdashery in the process. The brand continues to collaborate withGQto this day. In 2018, the legendary Harlem tailor and prototypical Black dandy Dapper Dan appeared ina glossy portfoliodedicated to modern dandies. “All the important people that I saw growing up, they had suits,” he toldGQat the time. “A suit was a sign of achievement, power.” When Nigerian-born stylist Mobolaji Dawodu—who would go on to become the magazine’s first Black fashion director—first joined the GQ team in 2016, he saw an opportunity to dress the magazine’s subjects in new ways. “In my brain,GQrepresented men in suits. That was my interpretation of it,” he says. “It represented men in suits, and the idea of tailoring,” says Dawodu, who cites Miles Davis, Fela Kuti, and James Bond as his perennial style icons. “It was exciting for me to bring in the full color. And as a Black male, it was exciting to bring familiarity and a perspective for Black subjects. I just wanted them to be fly, and for the clothes that fit well, it’s actually very simple…. It’s about feeling it. It’s an aura of taste. And it’s more than clothes. We’re talking about clothes, but it’s more than clothes.” Dawodu, who frequently incorporates tailoring traditions from Africa and Asia into his work, explains that his role as a stylist is more or less to help channel a subject’s inner flyness. Dawodu would go on to style street-cast shoots inDakar,Marrakech, andAtlanta. He dressedWill Smithin an embroidered Indian-made suit. He put the lateNipsey Hussle and his partner, Lauren London, in matching ethereal white ensembles, which they modeled alongside a gleaming white horse on a palm-tree-lined street in their hometown of Los Angeles. And he styled Tyler, the Creator—once rap’s enfant terrible—in a tan corduroy tuxedo forhis 2019 Men of the Year cover. “I’d never seen [Tyler] in a tux,” Dawodu recalls, “and I thought it would be a bold statement. It was just really about pushing an artist who’s already dynamic [even further].” GQentered a new era at the turn of the decade, which kicked off in earnest withNovember 2019’s “New Masculinity” issue, featuring a striking image of Pharrell in a voluminous down-quilted gown on the cover. The goal,GQglobal editorial director Will Welch wrote in his editor’s letter, was to explore “the ways that traditional notions of masculinity are being challenged, shifted, and overturned.” “One thing that any dandy has an abundance of is just a love for taking risks and not giving a shit what anybody else says, right? A performative willingness to be overdressed and get noticed, when I think the majority of men would prefer to just be conformist,” Welch says now. “When you talk about dandyism, there is that root in tailoring, there’s that preppiness. New Masculinity was about a different shift, but they’re deeply correlated. You never could have had gender fluidity and the new-masculinity moment without dandyism first.” One of the sharpest expressions of that mission arrived just over two years later, withLil Nas X on the coverof the 2021 Men of the Year issue. The accompanying shoot’s Kennedy-inspired portraits, lensed by Pari Dukovic, finds the pop star playing the roles of both husband and wife in crisp tuxedos and regal gowns, a nod to the oft-overlooked queer lineage of Black dandyism. “It was really about making him feel comfortable, and showing different sides of himself,” says Dawodu, who styled the Lil Nas X shoot. “Being fluid in the sense of wearing exactly what you want to wear, and not conforming to any specific idea of what the style is.” As Miller writes inSlaves to Fashion, “When tuxedoed…class, gender, and perceived racial hierarchies can be disguised, confused, unintentionally or deliberately transgressed.” She traces this subversive history back to Isaac Julien’s dreamlike 1989 filmLooking for Langston,which explores the lives of gay Black men during the Harlem Renaissance. The film’s subjects wear tuxedos both to conform to and to subtly undermine mainstream masculine ideals. Thus, the tuxedo became a symbol of “the queer artistic underground,” according to Miller. Zoë Kravitz also embodied this dualityon her MOTY coverthe next year. Moving forward, Pope,GQ’s global fashion director, says he hopes to see more Black talent in positions of power throughout the fashion industry. “I see a lot of brands and a lot of people pull inspiration from the Black experience and true Black icons and iconography, but then there’s no one in the room who matches that,” Pope explains. “Sometimes, you’ll see an inspiration board and you’re like, ‘Wow, I can point out where all these images are from, because they were part of the history that my parents and my grandparents [taught me about].’” For his part, Pope intends to use the magazine’s platform to help shape the next generation of Black dandyism. “I’m excited for that journey,” he says. “I’m buckled in. I’m ready for it.”",

    "title": "Outdoor Dining Is Terrible",
    "article_text": "The days are getting longer, theinseams are getting shorter, and the wrongest people in the world are very excited. That’s right: Outdoor dining season is upon us. And if you’re anything like me, you’re dreading the fervor with which other people are going to suggest grabbing lunch or dinner alfresco, and would rather dig into variouslight biteswithin the comfort of a fully enclosed space. Sadly, this is a losing battle, but it’s one I will embark on nonetheless. First, let me make some concessions. If the meal comes with a preexisting outdoor context built in (a barbecue, apicnic, etc.), go nuts. Throwing something on thegrill, basking in the sun like a lizard while it sizzles away, and then eating it off of the flimsiest paper plate that’s still street legal is rightfully a classic warm weather activity. I not only enjoy it, I wholeheartedly welcome it. When you go to someone’s house for a meal that’s prepared, cooked, and plated in their kitchen and some genius proposes that the entire operation moves to the deck or the backyard? I’m not thrilled, but I can understand that some people have lovelypatio setupsmore optimal for entertaining than their dining room. (Plus: your house, your rules.) Also, if food isn’t involved, I will gladly get anywhere from one to sevendrinkswith you outside. Obviously. But there’s no doubt that, dollar for dollar, outdoor dining at a restaurant is always a worse experience than simply eating inside. I admit that I'm approaching this issue from aNew York Cityresident’s perspective, and perhaps other cities don’t share the same olfactory problems. Namely: Everything reeks. That does not bode well for a meal. Neither does being attacked at all angles by car horns and sirens, theJordan and Pippenof annoying sounds. If you’re seated in the actual restaurant, your ear drums can be mercifully protected by these things called doors. They’vebeen around since 2000 BC, and for good reason. I’m not saying every restaurant I’ve ever been to had aplaylistI was in love with, but I’d take even the thumpiest bass over the wail of someone being transported to the hospital. The tide may even be turning here: most of the dining sheds in the city have been disassembled, it's harder than everto get a table outside, and there’s an ongoing battle in Dimes Square, the nexus of NYC outdoor dining, where popular wine bar Le Dive recently had itsrequest for a sidewalk seating permit denied. Perhaps you opt to reside somewhere quieter without three million rats competing for real estate with you. But I bet it still has weather! My main gripe with outdoor dining is that I’m never the right temperature. Skill issue, you say? Look, a man canonly own so much linen. Sometimes you get stuck in a situation where your starters are on the bench (the laundry basket) and you’re wearing second-string clothing (a T-shirt that fit better a few stomachs ago). When that happens, I can only focus on how much I’m sweating, how it’s making me look and smell, and the acts of violence I’d commit to be underneath a ceiling fan. On the other end of the temperature-regulation spectrum is the literallychilling experienceof dining outside, watching the sun go down, and feeling the temperature plummet in real time. What I’m saying is that I’m never the right bodily temperature when outdoor dining. Conversely, I’m almost always the right temperature when I’m inside a building, because that’s the point of buildings. Why sit outside and leave to chance what has already been perfected by science? I could unfurl a scroll filled with qualities I hate about the outdoor-dining experience, but I’ll devote my energy to the absolute worst part. No earthly phenomenon ruins things quite like my archnemesis: the wind.Oops, there goes my napkin. Didn’t need that anyway. That fun story I was in the middle of telling, charming everyone with my comedic timing? Completely waylaid by a 25-mile-per-hour gust.And yet, there’s an obvious solution. Ask for a spot inside, where your date’s sundress isn’t threatened by the gales, and all the contents of your table remain where they should be, rather than tumbling down the grimy sidewalk. (By the way, I’m not a monster, and you shouldn’t be either. If yourdatewants to take things outside, always defer to them. But if this is just you and the boys going out to dinner, don’t be afraid to put your foot down, indoors.) We haven’t even gotten to the bugs. Exposing your food to the elements is already kinda gross (and believe me, I’m the furthest thing from a germophobe—just ask the coworker who recently made the mistake of opening my AirPods case), but when insects are buzzing around, it only amplifies the feeling that I’m having tapas withOscar the Grouch. If I wanted to get swarmed by mosquitos when eating, I’d justapply for a spot onSurvivor. If it’s not the fauna that’s the problem, it’s the flora: thanks toclimate change boosting seasonal allergies, eating outdoors in 2025 is an itchier experience than ever before. Everything is coated in a visible layer of pollen dust. You’re telling me you want people sneezing to and fro in the same environment where beautiful crudo is being served?Not in my world. Not in the world I’m living in. I’m well aware that most of you won’t agree with me on this. All I ask is that you look inward and consider the error of your ways. Do you really want to spend the next two hours perched next to a dumpster, or is it just 72 degrees? Are you yearning to be overloaded by stinky sensory distractions, or are you just in it for the vibey Instagram pic? To that point, if you want to be outside that badly, go for a walk! Organize a little park hang. Go see abaseball game, where there’s food anyways. There are plenty of better ways to get out in the sun that don’t involve downloading the Resy app. Deep down, you know I’m right. So, this spring, as mediocre establishments with patios prepare to swindle us out of our hard-earned money, consider the humble indoor-dining restaurant. It may not have string lights or a neon sign hastily hung from some cheap, artificial wood, but you know what else it doesn’t have? Someone else’s weird dog. I’ll take a controlled environment where I know there won’t be any radical temperature shifts, swarming locusts, or unappetizing scents any sunny, beautiful day of the week.",

    "title": "What Will Be the Defining Shirt of Summer 2025? Menswear Experts Weigh In",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Just about every summer, it feels like one specific style of shirt jumps to the head of the menswear pack. We’ve seenloudly patterned camp shirtsandnatty knit polostransform from midcentury artifacts to bona fide trends.Lace and crocheted shirts, meanwhile, rocketed from bespoke boutiques to mainstream retailers in the blink of an eye just a couple of years back. Which begs the question: Which shirt will reign supreme during the summer of 2025? Should you be investing in boxy button-ups or airy slogan tees? Whose stock is rising and what’s on the way out? We called up a handful of serious men’s style pros for their predictions. ForNick Wooster—a menswear industry mainstay and street style legend who’s kept his finger on the pulse for decades—a great summer shirt rotation all starts with building a solid foundation. If you don't have perfect blue and white shirts—a blue-and-white stripe, a solid blue, a solid white—then you should start there,” he says. Wooster’s preferred shirting brands are Comme des Garçons Shirt, the legendary Japanese label’s button-down-focused offshoot, and Charvet, the age-old Parisian dress shirt purveyor. “For me, the perfect beach shirt is not a T-shirt,” he says, “but a white Charvet shirt that you’ve washed and have not ironed, and you wear that over a bathing suit.” It’s a look, he contends, that can easily take you from a day lounging by the pool or ocean directly to a restaurant or bar at night. Comme des Garçons SSENSE Charvet Mr Porter While Wooster believes that a long-sleeve shirt with the sleeves rolled up will always look more polished than short sleeves, he concedes that it’s hard to beat the ease and comfort of the latter. “It’s just easier sometimes to have on a short-sleeve shirt fromNeedlesorEngineered Garmentsor Officine Générale,” he says. “There are tasteful short-sleeved shirts that I feel you can wear, and you're not drawing attention with a big print.” Officine Générale Officine Générale Nepenthes Nepenthes Like Wooster, designer Tony Parrotti is fond of wearing long-sleeved shirts throughout the spring and summer. You’re gonna sweat either way, he argues, so you might as well choose the more stylish option. “There’s something really elegant about still sticking with a long sleeve in the summer,” says Parrotti, who worked as a shirtmaker for a bespoke tailor in New York City before launching the cult-lovedTony Shirtmakersin Damariscotta, Maine. The label’s newly-launched dress shirt is proof of Parrotti's commitment to midsummer long sleeves. This isn’t your average stiff, starched, office-readydress shirtwe’re talking about;  it comes in laundered Japanese cotton, a breezy and lightweight fabric with a crinkled texture. “It’s treated to basically look liketheperfectly wrinkled hung-dry shirt, which is what I love about it,” explains Parrotti. “You could still wear this under a suit to a wedding. And then you can wear this in your daily life: untucked, breezy, and boxy.” Tony Shirtmakers Tony Shirtmakers Tony Shirtmakers Tony Shirtmakers With a brass ring job at one of America’s most storied department stores,Jian DeLeonmakes it his business to know what stylish dudes are wearing. And lately, the longtime staple of the New York menswear scene has noticed men gravitating to two garments in particular: knit T-shirts and cropped, boxy, short-sleeved button-ups. “A knit T-shirt is a great, elevated substitute to wear underneath asport coat,” he says, pointing to how it slides right into the “tousled tailoring vibe” that is having a moment right now. The appeal of the boxy button-up, meanwhile lies in the desire to play into proportions and silhouettes. “It’s the perfect way to balance out a pair of oversized shorts or wider pants with a slightly higher rise. It’s definitely a look you’ll probably clock in places like Dimes Square in New York City or other hotspots for seeing TikTok trends IRL.” Merz B. Schwanen Nordstrom Second/Layer Nordstrom According toJasmine Benjamin—who has styled the likes of Donald Glover, Anderson .Paak, and Miguel and recently authoredthe upcomingCity of Angels—this summer is all about going boxy and cropped. “Whether it’s a T-shirt or camp-style shirt, it’s going to be a boxier fit,” Benjamin says. You want perfectly oversized basics that feel “lived-in and modern.” And while she notes you can never go wrong with a quintessential white T-shirt, Benjamin also thinks “we’ll start seeing more graphic T-shirts” again in 2025. It’s less about logo tees, however, and more about slogans—like the droll, sharply-designed versions fromCalifornia designer Eli Russell Linnetz’s ERL. ERL ERL Bare Knuckles Bare Knuckles Fashion industry vetsJames ScullyandTom Mendenhallrun the idiosyncratically curated shopJamestown Hudsonin upstate New York. “The store is an extension of our closet and we both appreciate a slight sense of humor when we dress,” says Scully. The duo noticed that many of their favorite eccentric summertime staples—like patchwork madras, Hawaiian prints, and heavy indigo dyes—have been harder to find on store racks recently. Not so at Jamestown. “This summer we were surprised to see [the return of] a big variety of shirt styles that men usually won’t gravitate to,” Scully adds, “like band collars, slimmer 1950s short sleeves, and popovers.” Ralph Lauren Ralph Lauren Fob Factory Haku Clothing Mendenhall is particularly thrilled with the vibrant madras shirts the pair sourced from Sage de Cret, the prep-leaning Tokyo label from designer Kimitoshi Chida.“Bright madras plaids have made a huge comeback from the most unconventional places,” he says, “especially from the Japanese brands we carry where it’s taken out of context and feels totally new.” Sage de Cret No Man Walks Alone Sage de Cret Dune and Salt",

    "title": "11 Best Venetian Loafers 2025, According to GQ Editors",
    "article_text": "All products featured on GQ are independently selected by our editors. However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. Venetian loafers, like the best of their family of footwear, are easy to wear ontwolevels. The first, and most obvious: they just slip right on. Ready, aim,boom—feet are shod. The second is that they work with anything: shorts, jeans, trousers, suits, whatever. These days, of course, loafer options abound, from classic penny loafers to downtownlow-slung loafers, the hardymoc-toeshoe to the ascendantboat shoe. But today we’re here to talk about theVenetian, a loafer that takes “easy” to a whole other level. That’s because the Venetian loafer dares to ask: what if a loafer wasn’t just easy, but sophisticated, too? As the name suggests, the shoe traces its roots back to Venice (Italy, not Florida). Early versions were essentially house slippers for European aristocrats swanning around marble hallways in flowing robes while drinking wine wearing their family’s name. Trueold-old-world luxury. Since then, the Venetian loafer has only absorbed more of Italy’s quintessential cool. Today’s version trades de Medici vibes for Jude Law inThe Talented Mr. Ripley, a Riva boat across Lake Como, an Aperol spritz at sunset. (You get this gist.) The Venetian loafer delivers all that by dialing back the loafer to its cleanest, most elegant self. There are no straps, no pennies, no tassels, and few embellishments. It’s just smooth, supple cowskin from front to back, with a gently shaped toe—almond or subtly square, your call—cut from suede or leather. The sole? Slim, sleek, quiet. The Venetian loafer is here to be seen, not heard. With that, we’ve rounded up the best Venetian loafers available: classics, handmade versions, and pairs perfect for a summer soiree, across a variety of prices. While you’re shopping, consider getting dust bags for the rest of your shoes—because the Venetian is just that easy to wear. G.H.Bass & Co. Nordstrom When it comes to loafers, all roads lead through G.H. Bass. It’s been pumping out some of the most approachable styles since 1876. The brand’s penny loafers are a gateway drug for guys getting into the loafer life, but its Venetian loafers are a quiet killer in the lineup: timeless, and clean, with just enough character to make heads nod in approval. That lowkey flair comes in the form of moc stitching around the toe flowing into a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it beefroll—that little bundle of leather where the seam meets the tongue. G.H. Bass’s Venetian loafer is unlined but cushioned and built with arch support, which should make them feel light without leaving your dogs in pain. Sperry Zappos Where the average Venetian feels Amalfi Coast, these Sperries are more Key West. They’re the kind of shoes you buyjustfor vacation, only to realize they’re so comfortable, you want to wear them long after the beachside piña coladas have dried up. Sperry, to its credit, follows through on that form with comfort-focused function: a double-stacked rubber sole absorbs even the longest boardwalk strolls, and yet the shoes are lightweight. They won’t anchor a tux, but these Venetian loafers, along with a pair of yourbreeziest pants, will hold you down for all the summer weddings, grad parties, and tropical getaways in your Memorial Day to Labor Day calendar. Sanders x Buck Mason Buck Mason Fromchinoscomfy enough for WFH days to ’90s-inspiredteeto a historic streak of wildly sought-aftercollaborations, Buck Mason is all gas, no brakes right now. It tends to cook with brands that have a storied past, which explains the recent team-up with U.K.-based Sanders, a shoemaker that’s been crafting footwear since 1873. You might know them as the brand Steve McQueen rocked inBullitt. And where Buck Mason could have gone the easy route with an updated, upgradedchukka, it instead went diving in the archive and came back to the surface with this, the Sanders Wholecut loafer. As per the name’s previous email, it’s made from a single piece of leather—no seams, no layers, nowhere to hide a bad cut. That forces the team at Sanders to use premium hides only, and results in a stunningly sleek silhouette. Inky matte-black leather and a meaty Oxford-style rubber sole means this loafer can hold down a straight-laced suit in ways that some other Venetian-type loafers might struggle. It also means the Sanders x Buck Mason Leather Wholecut loafer will be able to stay in your rotation long after Labor Day’s last beer is downed. Astorflex Huckberry Italian brand Astorflex has been in the shoe business for seven generations, still handcrafting each pair in its charming hometown of Castel d’Ario, nestled in northern Italy. The brand’s factory? Over 200 years old. Its methods? Surprisingly modern. Vegetable-tanned leather, natural rubber soles, and water-based adhesives channel sustainability mixed with old-world swagger. We really appreciate that the loafer is made of vegetable-tanned—instead of tanned using chrome —calf leather. (Both your body and Mother Nature are much better off without more of the latter.) Moc-toe stitching adds extra structure right where your feet bend the most. A leather-covered memory foam footbed offers support, while the lack of a lining makes the shoe limber right out of the box. So limber, in fact, that you can step on the heel and have yourself instantmules. Jacques Solovière Todd Snyder Okay, yes, fine: technically Jacque Soloviére’s Lex is a Belgian loafer, not a Venetian. But we’d argue that, A) the differences are minor, and B) whatever, it’s still Europe. And the woven raffia version of Soloviére’s slip-on maybe best represents the Venetian’s purpose: looking suave as hell, no matter the function. Weddings in the botanic garden? Suave. Brunch date with the in-laws? Very suave. Flipping burgers at the family reunion? Suavissimo. The secret is (duh) the raffia. A natural fiber made from the leaves of the raffia palm, it’s lightweight, breathable, and usually handwoven, giving each pair an earthy, artisanal vibe. Lined with natural calf leather and built on a lightweight sole with a double-stitched welt, these loafers also keep comfort top of mind. Pair them with abathing suitand a good book, or a pair ofhigh-waisted pants, or that creamlinen suitbegging to be let out of the closet. Then enjoy all the compliments. HEREU SSENSE The leather gurus at Spanish label Hereu make some of the most beautiful bags on the planet, so no surprise that their shoes are equally stunning. Inspired by Spanish Mediterranean culture, the brand blends folk art, traditional weaving, and an eye for details that whisper instead of shout. These beauties feature hand-braided seams and a classic moccasin construction, with the outsole stitched (not glued) to the upper for extra durability. Add a stacked leather heel, and you've got yourself a pair of loafers that are equal parts art and utility. Style them with somespring suitingor go all in on relaxed elegance with ultra-cozydrawstring pants. Either way, you’ll look like the cool friend who always knows the best tapas spot. August Special August Special Designer Joseph Pollard clocked time in New York with Best Made and Double RL, but a few years back he decamped to Gladwyne, Pennsylvania and launched his own label, August Special. There, he reimagines classic styles with a comfort-first twist and all-Italian craftsmanship. His loafer is really a house slipper with a full lining and a padded insole for effortless lounging (plus a Goodyear welt sole for durability). If you leave your home, try ‘em with a pair ofvintage jeans. Mr P. Mr Porter Mr Porter's in-house label Mr P. has long been an underrated source of dialed-in knits, relaxed tailoring, and easy-breezy shirts, and now the it’s here for the shoe side of your closet. The brand’s suede loafers pair perfectly with a Negroni, ideally seaside — while their sturdy gum sole should keep you as sure-footed on a yacht as on the sidewalk. Banana Republic Banana Republic We’ve been shouting out the return of Banana Republic for a few years, and these loafers might mark the brand’s mic drop moment of the season. With the gathered leather around the toe and the slightly wrinkled leather of the tongue they look louche, sharp, and dangerously unlike anything else here. Which explains why sizes are disappearing fast. Tecovas Tecovas Most know Tecovas for making some of the best bang-for-your-buck cowboy boots this side of the Mississippi (whatever side you’re on). But the footwear brand went fromTexas Rodeoto Jake Gyllenhaal’sRoadhousewith the Monterrey, a loafer that wears as easy as a Shiner Bock goes down. Marsèll SSENSE The first thing you notice is that soft edge running around the toe box — a no-nonsense piece of architecture and an ode to the usual seam. Then you realize that the Marsèll isn’t actually black, but a dark, rich brown. It’s a neither/nor scenario up and down the line. And a loafer that does it all, without doing things the same way. Vince Nordstrom Vince has gone through a few evolutions as a brand, but its footwear game has remained rock-solid throughout. We’d skip the pebble-grain versions and scoop up the suede styles — particularly the lighter “New Camel” color that feels like summer in a shoe. Style is subjective, we know—that’s the fun of it. But we’re serious about helping our audience get dressed. Whether it’s thebest white sneakers, the flyest affordable suits, or the need-to-knowmenswear drops of the week, GQ Recommends’ perspective is built on years of hands-on experience, an insider awareness of what’s in and what’s next, and a mission to find the best version of everything out there, at every price point. Our staffers aren’t able to try on every single piece of clothing you read about on GQ.com (fashion moves fast these days), but we have an intimate knowledge of each brand’s strengths and know the hallmarks of quality clothing—from materials and sourcing, to craftsmanship, to sustainability efforts that aren’t just greenwashing. GQ Recommends heavily emphasizes our own editorial experience with those brands, how they make their clothes, and how those clothes have been reviewed by customers. Bottom line: GQ wouldn’t tell you to wear it if we wouldn’t. We make every effort to cast as wide of a net as possible, with an eye on identifying the best options across three key categories:quality,fit, andprice. To kick off the process, we enlist the GQ Recommends braintrust to vote on our contenders. Some of the folks involved have worked in retail, slinging clothes to the masses; others have toiled for small-batch menswear labels; all spend way too much time thinking about what hangs in their closets. We lean on that collective experience to guide our search, culling a mix of household names, indie favorites, and the artisanal imprints on the bleeding-edge of the genre. Then we narrow down the assortment to the picks that scored the highest across quality, fit, and price. Across the majority of our buying guides, our team boasts firsthand experience with the bulk of our selects, but a handful are totally new to us. So after several months of intense debate, we tally the votes, collate the anecdotal evidence, and emerge with a list of what we believe to be the absolute best of the category right now, from the tried-and-true stalwarts to the modern disruptors, the affordable beaters to the wildly expensive (but wildly worth-it) designer riffs. Whatever your preferences, whatever your style, there's bound to be a superlative version on this list for you. (Read more about GQ's testing processhere.)",

    "title": "‘Andor’ Season 2 Is the Star Wars We Need Right Now",
    "article_text": "This story contains spoilers for the first six episodes ofAndorseason two. “Everyone has their own rebellion.” It’s a line that is repeated at least once or twice in the course ofAndor, the Disney+Star Warsseries whose wild critical success feels like it has all but turned around a franchise whose quality control has been increasingly suspect. Season two’s second volley of three episodes drops today, and if anything, it reinforces what a lot of fans thought about season one:Andorremains the first (and, thus far, sole) Star Wars property clearly written by, for and about adults. Thus far, the social-media reaction has focused on the question of just how “adult” aStar Warsseries should go, after the ending of episode three, in which Bix Caleen (Hit Man's Adria Arjona), whom we last saw in the previous season onAndorescaping to a new planet after being tortured by Imperial cops, is almost raped by an Imperial officer (who refers to her as an “illegal”) who has been harassing her at her camp. She promptly beats him to death with a wrench and kills another officer before escaping with Cassian Andor (Diego Luna, cementing his place in theStar Warshistory books near the namesFord, Hamill and Fisher). The ensuing debate was vigorous. “I really didn’t needAndorto retraumatize me about sexual assault,” ‪@aesthr.com‬ wrote on bluesky. “Writers really need to get over the ‘how do we show someone’s evil? We’ll just have him rape a woman’ stage. It’s needlessly cruel and just amateur craft.” Counterpoint: “Having a [show] where sexual violence from an imperial is explicitly called rape and match cutting to the Mothma family wedding where a young girl is being sold off shows that the creators understand how fascism is tied to misogyny and the ownership of women’s bodies, “ wrote Lady Emily ☄️ ‪@ladyemily.nebula.tv‬ And: “I think the big issue is that George Lucas’ films rely heavily on this weird ludonarrative dissonance where sex slaves, domestic assault, child murder, and genocide are clearly present but the tone drastically offsets that,” wrote @SirSnipeyy. “Andoris just finally taking this seriously.” While the debate about whether the threat of assault was necessary to see onscreen is valid as hell (and there is a good argument to be made that a content warning in front of the episode wouldn’t have killed anyone), it can’t be much clearer thatAndoris not for kids. Thus far we’ve seen Death Star construction czar Orson Krennic overseeing a strategy meeting about destroying a planet in a scene that borrows heavily fromConspiracy, an excellent 2001 film about Nazis planning the Holocaust. We’ve seen common people being tossed into prison for no reason at all, the machinations necessary to get ahead in a regimented bureaucracy, prisoners being used as slave labor for a literal war machine, and the way rebellions grow, person by person, block by block, and community by community. One ongoing storyline in the first season involved the action-packed difficulties of…fundraising. There’s no space-wizard stuff here at all; in place of the black-and-white fairy-tale themes and motifs that have prevailed since 1977’sA New Hope,Andoris all grey-toned spy fiction, about the difficult work of building yourself up to take action in the first place. The series is showrunner Tony Gilroy’s vector for every idea he has about war and revolution, and very few of them are going to be appropriate for the 10-year-olds at whom most ofStar Warsis aimed.Andoris for the former kids who were in 10 in 1977 and may have put away childish things, in favor of, say,DeadwoodorThe Agency. This season’s main plot revolves around a McGuffin planet called Ghorman (which might as well be called “France.”) It’s a world known for its textiles and little else, until the Empire figures out there is a mineral underground it needs and that it can’t get it without wrecking the planet. What do they need it for? Here’s a hint: it’s no moon, it’s a space station. This second arc emphasizes that everyone having their own rebellion means no two characters have quite the same motivations and no two relationships are quite alike. Bix, still sidelined by PTSD, is almost bullied back into action by Rebellion shot-caller Luthen Rael (Stellan Skarsgård, doing some of his all-time best work). Luthen continually pushes for greater and greater devotion to the cause; Bix and Cassian, now in hiding on Coruscant, are wrestling with what the last full measure of devotion even looks like. Senator Mon Mothma (an excellent Genevieve O'Reilly), having sacrificed her child to a marriage of convenience in order to keep money flowing to the cause, is realizing the limits of the democratic process under fascism. As she’s of a class that often thrives under authoritarianism, her stakes are wildly different from Cassian’s or, at the other end of the violence spectrum, the fanatical Saw Gerrera (Forest Whittaker going full Forest), a frontline Rebel who has no use for anyone to his political right. (He also likes huffing rocket fuel, maybe?) The Imperial characters have their own rebellions going. Former corporate cop Syril Karn (Kyle Soller), now a desk-riding bureaucrat who is realizing that some animals in the Empire are more equal than others, and Dedra (Denise Gough), an ambitious Imperial officer, are easily one of the most depressing couples on TV. (You never want to hear your girlfriend say “turn out the lights” after a business trip on her behalf.) And then there’s his mother Eedy (Kathryn Hunter, amazing), who wields passive-aggression the way Darth Vader used the Force. She remains one of the most terrifying villains the series has ever produced. (And word to whomever decided to pay tribute to the videophone bit fromMother.) There is nothing in the second volley of episodes as traumatic as the attempted rape (and Bix does get a measure of justice against her captors, in one of the series’ most satisfying scenes so far) but it’s easy to anticipate Internet objection to one particular death at the end of episode six, which results in one of the best monologues of the series’ run (credit to writer Beau Willimon.) Even in a galaxy far, far away,Andorstills ends up burying its [REDACTED]. It remains one of the best shows of the season, and the story of Cassian Andor has taken on a scope second only to the Skywalker family in theStar Warsmythos—but the rebellion against cliché only goes so far.",

    "title": "Some Good News: Americans Are Rejecting Trumpism",
    "article_text": "A common refrain in Trumpworld is “promises made, promises kept.” And when it comes to a lot ofDonald Trump’s most unpopular ideas, we are in fact seeing promises kept—and that’s the problem! We just crossedthe 100-day markin Trump’s second term, and there has understandably been a lot of despair witnessing some horrific things, likethree children, including a two-year-old and a four-year-old with cancer, being deported to Honduras. All three children are US citizens. In response to an emergency petition to stop the two-year-old from being sent abroad, a Trump-appointed judge said he had a “strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process.” (The Trump administrationhas claimedthe kids were put on the deportation flights at their mothers’ request, which attorneys dispute.) Then there’s the scary stuff happening in the federal government, from Trump disbanding committees focused onaviation securityandfood safety, to the overallhavoccaused byElon Muskand the DOGE crew. Autocrats want you to sink into despair and immobility, to see no light at the end of the tunnel. But we can already see some slivers of light and, yes, there is reason for optimism. That’s not to say pushing back against Trump’s extreme agenda is going to be easy—and there’s still quite a long way to midterms, never mind the 2028 election. But it’s heartening to see that a majority of the American people reject what this administration is doing on a host of issues. Trump has squandered any of the postelection honeymoon that presidents typically enjoy. His approval rating, which peaked at 52% a week after inauguration, has dropped to an average of 44%, according topollingcompiled byThe New York Times.Onepollconducted this month found that Trump has the lowest 100-day approval rating of any president in the last 80 years. Drilling down on issues, it looks even worse. A CNN pollfoundthat 59% of the public says that “Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions in the country,” with just “12% saying his agenda has helped to bring prices down.” Trump is now underwater on his handling of everything from immigration and border security (51% disapprove) to inflation and cost of living (60% disapprove), per anNBC News poll; it’s not pretty on foreign affairs (55% disapprove) or civil rights (53% disapprove), per aUMass poll.According to aNew York Times/Sienapoll, “two-thirds of voters, including 75% of independent voters, said that ‘chaotic’ was a good description of the Trump term so far.” There is some good news in this flurry of polls for Democrats, or anyone who believes in norms and institutions and wants to see the president held accountable. “Half or more of all Americans in the poll say they feel Congress (56%) and courts and judges (50%) are doing too little to check Trump’s power as president,”notesCNN. Speaking of promises made, one of Trump’s most jarring as a presidential candidate washis vow to be a “dictator”on day one. Well, a newPRRI surveyfinds that 52% of Americans say Trump is a “dangerous dictator whose power should be limited before he destroys American democracy.” It’s clear—from pollsand protests—that voters want Congress and courts to provide constitutional checks on Trump’s power, rather than lawmakers passively acquiescing to market-rattling trade wars, unlawful deportations, and all the assorted chaos of these past 101 days. As unpopular as Trump and his agenda are in recent polls, one “special government employee” apparently has him beat. Elon Musk has a57% disapproval rating, according to aWashington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll; his negative rating went up eight points since February as he really got underway in crushing and villainizing federal employees. But Musk has done a lot of stupid stuff, such as shooting off those“five things”emails to federal employees or dancing onstage witha chainsaw at CPAC. And we’ve learned even more about the world’s richest man—for example, asThe Wall Street Journalreported, that he manages a “legion” of babies. But ultimately, the biggest problem for Trump is the slow-motion car accident that is his tariff policy. Trump trade adviserPeter Navarropromisedon April 11 that “we’re going to run 90 deals in 90 days. [It’s] possible.” The Trump administration has yet to formally announce a single deal (though itteased this weekthat one is nearly finalized.) The downstream victims of the trade war are expected to be everyone from consumers totruckers, while shipments from China to West Coast ports are expected to plummet next week,according to CNBC. And all that saber-rattling that Trump engaged in during the beginning of his administration, all the musing about making Canada the51st statemay have had real consequences. Canada’s Liberal Party won the federal election this week; during hisvictory speech, party leader and Prime MinisterMark Carneysaid, speaking French, “We will strengthen our relationship with reliable partners in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. And if the US doesn’t want to play a pivotal role in the world economy, we will lead, not the Americans.” Meanwhile, Mexico seems to also be immune to Trump’s charms. “We are going to change the law to prohibit foreign governments from carrying out political and ideological propaganda in our country,” Mexican presidentClaudia Sheinbaumsaid recently about the Trump administration’s advertisements that have beenairing on Mexican television. Yet another American ally—and North American neighbor—alienated. AsAnne Applebaum,a journalist and expert on authoritarianism,put itto NPR last year: “What the autocrats—whether they’re in American politics or in Russian politics or in Chinese politics—what they want is for you to be disengaged.” Indeed, a checked out electorate is much easier to control than an active, engaged one. There is every reason to believe that Trumpism will fail as it’s driven by the whims of one erratic man and carried out by sycophants. Its central governing principle seems to be a kind of low-rent grift. Trump is emboldened, even as polls suggest he shouldn’t be, and it seems likely he’ll continue overplaying his hand in a second term. The lesson from the few months of Trump’s presidency can be summed up from this line fromAll the President’s Menabout another corrupt Republican president’s administration: “These are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Sam’s Club: Inside Altman’s AI World, Featuring Elon Musk, Donald Trump, and Peter Thiel",
    "article_text": "Sam Altmanreallywants to be liked. “That is his superpower,” saysKeach Hagey.“He’s very good at doing favors for people—getting people to see his vision. But he’s bad at telling people no.” That’s what theWall Street Journalreporter has taken away from years of covering the tech innovator’s career and the rise of ChatGPT. But it’s also the thread that runs through Atlman’s public life more broadly, Hagey tellsVanity Faireditor in chiefRadhika Jones,along with executive editorClaire Howorthand Hive editorMichael Calderone,on the latest episode ofInside the Hive.In it, Hagey, who’s coming out with a book on Altman next month, titledThe Optimist,goes deep on Altman’s progressive politics, his friendship withPeter Thiel,his feud withElon Musk,and his dealings withDonald Trump,along with his brief exit from OpenAI—a.k.a. “The Blip”—and vision for this potentially world-altering technology. The first thing to know about Altman is that he’s not a “nerd’s nerd,” as Calderone notes. “He could talk the talk of a tech nerd. But at the same time, he had this charm and this charisma…he could try to win over a room.” This, in part, is what scored Altman a partnership at the start-up accelerator Y Combinator, where he met Thiel, who inspired him to take bigger swings on hard-tech development. In 2016, however, their friendship was tested when Thiel “became really the only person just about in all of tech to support Donald Trump,” recounts Hagey. Despite being ardently opposed to Trump, Altman “stood up for Peter Thiel as his friend, but also in general as a philosophical point…that we’re not here to shut down people’s support for major party candidates,” she says. Shortly after Trump’s first election win, Hagey notes, Altman’s radical self-belief led him to consider a formal entrance into politics. “He had conversations with private folks aboutrunning for governor of Californiaand also about one day running for president,” Hagey says. “He figured there would be a millennial president, and why shouldn’t it be him? This speaks to his desire to justbein the room. This is what the OpenAI experience ultimately brought him.” (Altman told Hagey in the book he didn’t want to run for president.) Incidentally, Altman was nearlybootedfrom the room in 2023, when the OpenAI founder was abruptly fired by the company’s board of directors over a lack of confidence in his leadership. Although he was reinstated after internal pushback, Hagey found the episode revealing: “I learned about a bunch of moments where the board felt that Sam had misled them about safety stuff, about the speed of things, and how deep their distrust was of him.” Of course, being liked is already proving essential to staying afloat amid the second presidency of Trump, who governs by a loyalty-first approach. So far, from the looks of Trump’s $500 billion partnership with OpenAI, Softbank, and Oracle, Altman has managed to get back in the president’s good graces. But given his yearslong feud with Musk, who’s also competing in the AI space, there’s no guarantee that Altman will manage to stay out of the crosshairs. As Jones notes, there may just be a “bigger target on his back.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Netflix Publicist Kelly Dalton Wants to Tell Her Own Story, in Hopes of Helping Others Who Have Been Raped",
    "article_text": "PublicistKelly Daltonhas been working with filmmakers her whole career, helping them share their stories and the personal connections they have to their films. As an awards specialist at Netflix for the past seven years, she’s worked on more than two dozen high-profile movies, includingMarriage Story, The Irishman, The Lost Daughter,andMaestro.But now she’s leaving Netflix, with plans to tell her own story for the first time. Dalton is exiting the streamer this week to start her own production company, called Higher Altitude Productions. She’s also writing a script based on the journey she undertook after being raped in college and spending more than a decade battling the resulting trauma. Until recently, she had only told close friends and family about that harrowing 2010 experience. But now she’s decided she’s ready to share her story in a film, mostly so she can explain the healing experience of a little-known process called restorative justice. “There’s a significance to this moment for me,” she tellsVanity Fair.“Ever since I had experienced this trauma, it’s like there’s chains of shame around my feet and around my wrists, and every step I take in trying to work through it has been met with so much resistance. Sharing my story in this way is cutting those chains and releasing me of that, and choosing to love myself fully.” Restorative justice, a concept coined in the 1970s, allows a victim to meet with their offender to express the real impact of the crime they endured. It’s a mediated meeting, often lasting an entire day, in which the victim is able to speak about their experience and hopefully find some closure. Dalton had never heard of the idea until a lawyer suggested it to her more than a decade after her assault. “I don’t think I would’ve gotten that closure, in a way, and that acknowledgment and accountability of his actions, if I had chosen a different path,” she says. “But this is not me trying to convince people that restorative justice is the best option for them. Everyone deserves to choose how they want to heal through a trauma like this and to choose when they decide to heal through it.” Dalton was assaulted by someone she knew well and considered a friend of her family. After she told her parents what had happened, she met with a legal team to explore what could be done. “They outlined the options. You could choose the criminal path, or you can choose to do nothing,” she says. Dalton, who grew up in Canada and still lived there at the time, was told that the legal process could take 18 to 24 months. She had recently been diagnosed with Lyme disease, which was causing her challenging health issues, and she was concerned that she wouldn’t have the physical or emotional stamina for a drawn-out criminal court experience. She instead turned her attention to her health problems. As the years went on, she started building up her career—eventually joining the independent awards-consulting firm LTLA Communications in Los Angeles. She worked on films such asSpotlightandLa La Land,then moved over to Netflix with the LTLA crew in 2018. But every year, she’d reach back out to her legal team to see if there was any other way to move forward with a case against her assailant. “I would challenge them like, ‘There has to be another option, because I’m suffocating in silence and I’m numbing myself emotionally,’” she says. “I was very disconnected and not living or feeling.” When a lawyer first suggested restorative justice, Dalton read up on the process, coming to believe it might provide her with the healing she needed—even if there would be no legal ramifications for her assailant. “I was really committed to finding a way to hold him accountable and to share my voice and to try to take my power back without retraumatizing myself,” she says. She had her legal team send a letter over to her assailant, which requested his attendance at a restorative justice meeting and stated that Dalton might have to think seriously about filing criminal charges if he declined. He agreed to the meeting, and Dalton finally saw her assailant face-to-face for the first time in 12 years. Dalton came into the meeting with her legal team and a prepared statement. But after reading her opening remarks, she asked her legal team to leave so that she could speak to him with just the mediator present. Their eight-hour conversation was off the record, but Dalton left with the closure she needed after the assailant took accountability for his actions. “It had such an impact on my life and changed my life, honestly, and gave me my power back and gave me my voice back in a way that I am so grateful for,” she says. Later that night, she got together with her family and close friends for a small dinner celebration in honor of the progress she’d made toward healing. After that meeting in 2022, Dalton gradually began sharing her experience with more people in her life. She soon realized that many survivors had never heard of the process of restorative justice. With so few survivors successfully getting a conviction—according to RAINN, out of every 1,000 sexual assaults, 975 predators will walk free—Dalton wanted more people to know there was another path to closure. It may have taken her 15 years to find a level of peace that allows her to tell her story publicly to a larger audience, but now a door has opened for her to share it both in this article and in the script she’s currently writing. “There’s so much beauty in the experience that I’ve had, but it’s taken me a lot of time and a lot of tears and a lot of confusion and a lot of uncertainty,” she says, adding that her production company will focus on showcasing real, honest stories that resonate with people. “If sharing this helps one person feel connected and not alone, that matters and it helps.” Revealing her story has also, it turns out, helped her in unexpected ways. She adds, “I learned through the process of sharing it that I actually feel so much strength and so much more power if I don’t give it the power to hide it.” RAINNhas resources for those affected by sexual assault.

    "title": "King Charles Offers Hope to Those Facing the “Daunting” and “Frightening Experience” Of Cancer",
    "article_text": "King Charles IIIsent a moving and deeply personal message of support to cancer patients during a Wednesday reception at at Buckingham Palace, drawing on his own experience of being diagnosed with the illness. The king, who was diagnosed withan undisclosed form of cancer last year, issued a message of love and hope to anyone going through a similar journey. During his speech, he noted that over 1000 people are diagnosed with cancer each day in the UK. “Each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening experience for those individuals and their loved ones,” the king said. “But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.” The king andQueen Camillahosted the reception at Buckingham Palace Wednesday evening to pay tribute to a number of organizations supporting cancer patients and their families, along with health research groups dedicated to preventing the disease. Guests also included radio hostAdele Roberts,former footballerAshley Cainand actorRichard E. Grant,who have all been personally affected by the illness. “As patrons of many such organizations, The Queen and I have seen at first-hand how you not only fund vital research and deliver exceptional healthcare but also create spaces where patients and their families find sanctuary, understanding and practical assistance when they need it most,” the king said during the reception. He added that his own diagnosis had given him “an even deeper appreciation of the extraordinary work undertaken by the remarkable organizations and individuals gathered here this evening, many of whom I have known, visited and supported over the years. And it has reinforced what I have long observed during these visits—that the darkest moments of illness can be illuminated by the greatest compassion.” Representatives of leading cancer charities, including Breast Cancer Now, Maggie’s and Children’s Hospice South West and Macmillan Cancer Support, were present for the reception in the palace ballroom. The room featured displays demonstrating the work of groups like Wigs for Heroes and Move Dance Feel, which uses dance to support women with cancer. At the reception, Macmillan’s CEOGemma Petersthanked the king for his continued support and his openness in talking about his illness. His Majesty had “inspired so many others to reach out for support from organizations like Macmillan,” she said. “Every day we see the impact that cancer is having on people’s lives and that experience is even worse for some people because of who they are or where they live, which is entirely unacceptable. We are on a mission to transform cancer care, but we cannot do it on our own.” King Charles closed his speech with a message of hope to anyone affected by the disease. “While every patient’s journey may be different, together you are ensuring that a cancer diagnosis need never mean facing the future without hope and support,” he said, quoting Dame Deborah James who died of bowel cancer in 2022. The king has never revealed the form of cancer he was diagnosed within February 2024, but the palace has confirmed that he is receivingongoing treatmentand tolerating it well. Though he was admitted to a hospital briefly following a round of treatmentin late March, he has continued to carry out a full schedule of engagements, includinga recent state tour of Italy.

    "title": "Everything We Know So Far About Jeff Bezos's Relationship With Donald Trump",
    "article_text": "The once frosty relationship betweenDonald TrumpandJeff Bezoshas been warming up lately, due in large part to the Amazon founder’s apparent newfound willingness to lick the president’s boots and the president’s longstanding affection for bootlickers. But Tuesday offered a brief window into their old feud afterPunchbowl News reportedthat Amazon planned to display the cost of tariffs next to product prices on its website. White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittsaidshe’d talked to the president about the report and called the move “hostile and political.” She accused Amazon of partnering with a “Chinese propaganda arm,” referencing a 2021Reuters reportabout Amazon removing reviews on PresidentXi Jinping's speeches and writing. The two billionaires appear to have quickly hashed it out over a phone call after a reportedly “pissed”Trump called Bezos. AndAmazon released a statement sayingit had only ever considered the tariff feature—which it didn’t go forward with—for its low-cost store. After the ordeal, Trump had only good things to say about Bezos. “He was terrific,”Trump toldreporters. “He solved a problem very quickly, and he did the right thing, and he’s a good guy.” The brief lover’s quarrel was a bit of déjà vu from Trump’s first term in office. But the speedy resolution is an indicator of just how much has changed since then. Here’s a look back at how the relationship between Trump and Bezos has turned from sour to sweet. The spat between Trump and Bezos dates back to at least 2015, when Trump was still running for the Republican presidential nomination, and tweets were still 140 characters. It was around that time that Trump began trolling Bezos, accusing him of using theWashington Postas a “tax shelter” for Amazon. “The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!” Trumpwrote, likely in retaliation for thePost’s critical coverage of his campaign. Bezos, who was still willing to stand up for that coverage, quickly clapped back: “Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace,”Bezos wrote, along with a link to a video of his space company’s recent rocket landing. The Trump-Bezos dynamic was hardly any chummier once Trump clinched the nomination, and began calling for antitrust scrutiny into Bezos’s businesses. In an interview withSean Hannityin May 2016,Trump accused Bezosof “getting away with murder tax-wise.” He argued Bezos was using thePost“as a tool for political power against me and against other people” and said, “We can’t let him get away with it.” ThePost’s then executive editor,Martin Baron, stood up for the paper’s editorial independence from Bezos, saying at the time that he had “received no instructions from Jeff Bezos regarding our coverage of the presidential campaign—or, for that matter, any other subject.” Bezos backed that sentiment in his own interview with Baron, also in May 2016, saying that Trump’s ranting against thePostwas “not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave.” “We want a society where any of us, any individual or institution, if they choose to, can scrutinize, examine and criticize an elected official, especially a candidate for the highest office in the most powerful country on Earth. It’s critical,” he said. “What would be shocking and disturbing is if you weren’t doing that.” Shocking and disturbing, indeed! Bezos extendedan olive branch to Trump after the 2016 election, saying he would give the new president his “most open mind.” But Trump wasn’t interested in making nice and continued to hammer on about Amazon’s alleged tax evasion on Twitter. Those attacks escalated whenTrump beganlaying pressure on the US Postal Service to raise shipping rates on Amazon,causing its stock priceto slide. Once the pandemic hit,Trump threatenedto withhold desperately needed funding from the Postal Service, unless it hiked prices on Amazon. “Every time they bring a package, they lose money on it,”Trump saidat the time, arguing the Postal Service should “raise the price of a package by approximately four times.\" Arguably the biggest battle between Trump and Bezos was over a $10 billion Pentagon contract codenamed JEDI, which theTrump administration awardedto Microsoft in 2019. Shortly after,Amazon suedthe administration over the snub, arguing that the president’s “personal vendetta” against Bezos had cost Amazon Web Services the contract. The lawsuit referencedreportingfrom a book on Defense SecretaryJim Mattisin which Trump allegedly told Mattis to “screw Amazon” out of the JEDI deal. In a blog post about the case, Amazon lashed out at Trump’s “blatant cronyism.” “The President has removed perceivedpolitical threatsfrom their roles simply for doing their jobs,” the post read. “A similar pattern has emerged within the [Department of Defense] assenior military leadershipcannot exercise their sound judgment without facing retribution, “The President has become emboldened of late in flaunting his role influencing government contracts forpolitically motivated reasons.” After thePentagon cancelledthe contract altogether, the courts dismissed the lawsuit as moot. Apart from the fight over the JEDI contract, Trump and Bezos’s squabbles quieted to a simmer during the Biden years, likely because Trump himself was banned from the social platforms where he did most of his Bezos-bashing. This period also aligned withBezos’s own personal transformation, including his decision to step down as CEO of Amazon in 2021, though he remains the company’s executive chair. The Biden Administration hardly had a friendly relationship with Amazon. PresidentJoe Bidenappointed famed Amazon criticLina Khanto chair the Federal Trade Commission, whichproceeded to file a lawsuitagainst the e-commerce giant (and pretty much every other tech giant), accusing it of “illegally maintaining monopoly power.” That suitremains ongoing. It’s unclear how much the Biden administration’s crackdown on tech monopolies played into Bezos’s sudden political shift, but by the time the 2024 election rolled around, he was already courting Trump’s affections. The day of Trump’s attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania,Bezos tweetedthat Trump had “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire,” and according to Axios,the two men had a phone callshortly after that formed the basis of their bromance. As the 2024 election neared, Bezos’s once hands-off-approach to thePost’s journalism unraveled when he spiked the paper’s endorsement ofKamala Harris. It was the first time thePosthad declined to endorse a candidate since the 1980s. In an op-ed explaining the decision,Bezos wrotethat endorsements create “a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence.” The decisionreportedlycost thePosthundreds of thousands of subscribers. Of course, Bezos didn’t seem quite so concerned about the “perception of bias” when, after the election,he and Sanchez dined with TrumpandElon Muskat Mar-a-Lago, or whenAmazon donated$1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, or when he stood behind Trump on the dais as he took the oath of office in January. By February of this year, Bezos’s political realignment was clear—and if it hadn’t been, he certainly made it so whenhe published a memoon the new direction of thePost’s op-ed page. “We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” he wrote in a message he shared on X. “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.” ThePosthas since seen an exodusof top talent, including the editor of the opinion section,David Shipley. Bezos wrote that he had offered Shipley “the opportunity to lead this new chapter,” but that “if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no.’” Apart from the minor tiff about tariffs, the formerly rocky relationship between Trump and Bezos has been smooth over the course of Trump’s first 100 days in office. So smooth, thatBlue Origin reportedly just landeda $2.3 billion NASA contract. So much for #sendDonaldtospace. The president is doing just fine by Bezos here on Earth.

    "title": "The UK Has Found Another Reason to Be Mad at Meghan Markle",
    "article_text": "Thus far,Meghan Markle’slifestyle brand As Everhas only beenshipping its productsto customers in America. But over the last week, a few lucky people in the UK got a special delivery of her raspberry preserves thanks to a partnership with Colford, a London-based gifting service. “A pleasure to assist @Meghan, Duchess of Sussex in spreading jam and joy amongst friends in the UK,” the company wrote on its Instagram account. “Our white glove chauffeur service facilitated a seamless handover at every doorstep.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Colford, which helps companies and individuals source and deliver sustainable gifts, was founded in 2023 byImogen BeresfordandNathan Cole.Beresford is married to TV presenterAlex Beresford,whomade headlinesin 2021 after he defended Meghan fromPiers Morgan’s attack onGood Morning Britain.Last week, Alex Beresford took to Instagram to thank Meghan for sending a jar of the jam to their family home, along with a Jellycat stuffed animal for the couple’s daughter,Camille. The announcement comes as Meghan’srecent appearanceon a friend’s podcast has sparked a mini-controversy in UK tabloids. On Monday, Meghan sat for her first extended podcast interview with her friend and neighbor,Jamie Kern Lima.During the conversation, Lima mentioned that Meghan has a habit of sending thoughtful gifts, citing one delivery in particular. “One time I had in-laws and all these people visiting, a very full house, and all of a sudden I got word that you had dropped something off,” Lima said. “You dropped off this gift basket with ice cream and homemade strawberry sauce to put on top of the ice cream, just to see if that helps lighten my load. It was as if you’re in my shoes, feeling what I was feeling without me even needing to tell you anything.” Thevideo uploadof the podcast featured a photograph of the gift, which included ice cream from Straus Family Creamery along with a card with Meghan’s personal emblem. The note read, “With the Compliments of HRH The Duchess of Sussex.” Because Meghan and Harry agreed not to use the “HRH” title for public purposes when they left their roles in the palace in 2020, some British outlets and commentators accused Meghan of violating the agreement with Queen Elizabeth II by sending the note.Ingrid SewardofMajesty Magazineargued that the late queen “would be highly offended, as she was very sensitive about that,” according to theDaily Mail. In response, a source close to Meghan and Harry toldthe BBCthat the gift to Lima was private and given more than a year ago, and that the couple does not use the “HRH” title for public or commercial purposes. In the selection of As Ever products reviewed byVanity Fair,all refer only to the name “Meghan” and none refer to her as “The Duchess of Sussex.” For years, UK commentators have wondered if Meghan and Harry would be able to sustain public attention without an endorsement from the royals, and the apparent success of As Ever is one indication that they can. It’s unclear if anyone beyond “friends and family” can get their hands on As Ever in the UK, but there is still an obvious demand for coverage of Meghan, even if it is negative.

    "article_text": "Please give a warm welcome toAiryn De Niro.In a story forThem,Robert De Niro’s 29-year-old daughter introduced herself to the public as a trans woman—opening up about her childhood, her aspirations, and how she has navigated her transition journey. Born in 1995, Airyn is one of the legendary actor’s seven children. TheRaging Bullstar shares two kids with his first wife, actorDiahnne Abbott:Drena,57, Abbott’s daughter from a previous marriage whom De Niro adopted, andRaphael,48. Abbott and De Niro divorced in 1988. De Niro then had twins Airyn andJulian,29, with actor and modelToukie Smith;he and Smith were in a relationship from 1988 to 1996. In 1997, De Niro married actorGrace Hightower,and together they hadElliot,27, andHelen Grace,13. De Niro and Hightower split in 2018. In April of 2023, the now 81-year-old actor welcomed his seventh child,Gia,with his girlfriend,Tiffany Chen. Airyn spent her childhood mostly out of the spotlight despite the massive success of her father, a two-time Oscar winner. “Obviously, no parent is perfect, but I am grateful that both my parents agreed to keep me out of the limelight. They wanted it very private,” she toldThem.“They have told me they wanted me to have as much of a normal childhood as possible.” But on March 19 of this year, Airyn’s privacy was invaded when theDaily Mailpublished a paparazzi photo of her as she went to visit her father at the Greenwich Hotel, essentially outing her as a trans woman. In the accompanying article, Airyn was also misgendered and described as a “nepo baby” who’d undergone a “shock transformation.” “I actually didn’t find out about theDaily Mailthing until like a week after it was posted,” Airyn toldThem.“Not only did they get information wrong about me…they just sort of reminded me that people really don’t know anything about me.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Here are a few things you should know about Airyn: She’s an aspiring model and voice actor who’s also studying to be a mental health counselor. She also wants to achieve success on her own. “I wasn’t brought up having a side part in one of dad’s movies or going to business meetings or attending premieres,” she toldThem.“My dad was very big on us finding our own sort of path. I would want [success] to happen on my own merit.” Airyn revealed that she auditioned for the role of Jules onEuphoria,which ultimately went toHunter Schafer,as well as a character in the video gameLeague of Legends.Her twin, Julian, is also an actor, playing a youngBarack ObamainThe First Ladyand appearing on Broadway in a recent revival ofThe Sign in Sidney Brustein’sWindow. As a child, Airyn said, she felt out of place as a “bigger-bodied person,” which was difficult for her to process. “Everybody else in the family [was] relatively thin or fit; I was not, so I sort of stood out like a sore thumb and there wasn’t anybody in my family that could relate to that experience,” she said. She also opened up toThemabout other issues she faced growing up as a femme, biracial, queer person. “[Gay men were] ruthless and mean. I didn’t even fit that beauty standard, which is thin, white, muscular, or just super fit, masculine,” she toldThem.“I was always told I was too much of something or not enough of something growing up: too big, not skinny enough. Not Black enough, not white enough. Too feminine, not masculine enough. It was never just, ‘You’re just right, just the way you are.’” In November of last year, Airyn began hormone therapy. “Who wants to be an old man?” she joked toThem.Airyn began transitioning after seeing the rising success andvisibility of trans women. “Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media, and getting to see them in their success…I’m like, You know what? Maybe it’s not too late for me,” she said. “Maybe I can start.” Her transition was also influenced by the Black women in her life, like her mother. “I think stepping into this new identity, while also being more proud of my Blackness, makes me feel closer to them in some way,” she said As a biracial trans woman, Airyn wants “queer people of color and bigger-bodied people to have anAlex Consani,” she toldThem,referencing the influential transgender model. “I want queer people of color and bigger-bodied people to have a Hunter Schafer.” And while she doesn’t want her famous last name to book her any roles, she does dream of one day sharing the spotlight with a family member. “A part of me has always wanted to model and sort of follow my mom’s footsteps,\" she said. “Honestly, if I could be on the cover ofVoguewith her or recreating one of her pictures, that would be a dream come true.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "Donald Trump Wants Another Job He’s Not Qualified For: Pope",
    "article_text": "If anyone ever took the expression “fake it ‘til you make it” too literally, it’sDonald Trump. Trump has found his way into the White House twice; mostly recently, despite being a convicted felon with no prior political experience, and as of late has clung to a joking-not-joking throughline aboutfinding a way to make it a three-fer, Constitution be damned. So, it should come as no surprise that he thinks he’d be a fantastic pope too. On Tuesday, whenasked by reporterswho he thinks should be the successor to therecently deceased Pope Francis, Trump tossed off, “I’d like to be pope. That’d be my number one choice.” Forget the fact that Trump isn’t a member of the clergy, or the College of Cardinals, who will convene for aconclave to select their new leaderbeginning May 7—he’s not even Catholic. Though confirmed earlier in life into Presbyterianism, in 2020,Trump told the Religious News Servicein an interview that he now identifies as a non-denominational Christian. After an assassination attempt in July 2024, Trump, already popular with Evangelical Christian voters, dialed up the religious rhetoric in his messaging. At hisinauguration in January, he even said that he was “saved by God to make America great again.” When pressed, however, he did have one alternative suggestion for who should succeed Pope Francis. Sort of. “No, I don’t know. I don’t have a preference,” Trump continued. “I might say, we have a cardinal that happens to be out of a place called New York who is very good. So we’ll see what happens.” Presumably, he was referring to CardinalTimothy Dolan, wholed the invocationat Trump'sinauguration. “Please, God bless America, please mend her every flaw,” Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, said as he prayed for Trump at the beginning of his second term. Maybe Trump was trying to play coy by not mentioning Dolan by name, or perhaps he couldn’t remember it and figured that a made-in-the-USA answer couldn’t fail. The world may never know. Sen.Lindsey Graham, for one, appeared to cheerfully second Trump’s self-nominationon social media on Tuesday. “I was excited to hear that President Trump is open to the idea of being the next Pope,” Graham wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “This would truly be a dark horse candidate, but I would ask the papal conclave and Catholic faithful to keep an open mind about this possibility!” He continued: “The first Pope-U.S. President combination has many upsides.

Then there’sNicola Coughlan—who stepped out before May 5 to receive the Konbini Commitment Award for activism at Canneseries, the French TV festival that precedes the annual Cannes Film Festival. TheBridgertonstar showed up in aRobert Wuncouture gown that was unique for more than one reason. Nicola Coughlan in Robert Wun Couture Coughlan took to the pink carpet in this strapless sculptural gown with an hourglass silhouette. Its central slit ends just above the knee. The actor coordinated her look with a pair of pointed heels and a flowing shawl that created a dramatic train. This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. \"It has always been a dream to work with Nicola,” the designer wrote on Instagram. “It is an absolute honor to contribute to this well-deserved and special moment.\" With understated jewelry and her blonde hair pulled back and gathered in a ponytail, every element of Coughlan’s look was designed not to overpower the particularity of this dress. Its asymmetrical neckline is embellished with a pointed detail that rises up to above the actress’s head, making the dress taller than Nicola Coughlan herself. The dress’s shape has a specific inspiration: a certain species of thespathiphyllumflower known as the “Peace Lily.” The plant is noted for its elegant appearance and ability to purify the air. By choosing to pick up the prestigious award in a dress with a meaning beyond its aesthetic, Coughlan made a bold statement—and delivered a strong message of hope. Original story fromVF Italia.

    "title": "The Truth Underlying Pete Hegseth’s Job Security",
    "article_text": "DuringPete Hegseth’s contentious confirmation hearing to becomeDonald Trump’s defense secretary, Democrats argued that the Fox News morning host lacked the management experience to lead a department with an $850 billion budget. Now past his 100-day mark, Trump is coming to share that view. According to three sources close to the White House, Trump has told people he is frustrated with the chaos swirling around Hegseth and the Pentagon. In recent weeks, Hegseth dismissed three of his closest advisers, whom he later accused of leaking to the media—all three have denied it—and his chief of staff stepped down. “He fired all the people he trusted,” a prominent Republican who recently spoke with Hegseth told me. Hegseth was also at the center of Signalgate, having shared military attack plans in chats with White House officials and another group that included his wife, brother, and personal lawyer. (While Hegseth’s brother and lawyer have roles in government, they are outside of the circle that would typically be informed on such issues.) A senior White House official told me Trump recently ordered Hegseth to get his act together. Trump hinted at his displeasure in an interview withTheAtlanticthis week,tellingthe magazine: “I had a talk with him, a positive talk, but I had a talk with him.\" Anna Kelly,a White House spokesperson, responded on Tuesday: “The media constantly relies on bad sources who desperately want to drive a wedge between President Trump and his Cabinet officials. Unfortunately for them, the President continues to stand with Secretary Hegseth, who is doing an incredible job leading the DOD and is joining the President in Michigan today.” Sources close to Hegseth told me the stress of the job seems to be fueling his chaotic decision-making. “He’s very paranoid,” said the prominent Republican.TheWall Street Journalrecently reported that Hegseth challenged the then acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to take a lie detector test as part of a leak investigation. “I’ll hook you up to a f—ing polygraph!” Hegseth reportedly shouted at AdmiralChristopher Grady.Sources told me that Hegseth is relying on a shrinking circle of advisers that includes his lawyer,Tim Parlatore,and his wife,Jennifer,a formerFox & Friendsproducer. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment. Most remarkably, Hegseth’s former advisers are speaking out on the record. In mid-April, former Pentagon spokespersonJohn UllyotwroteaPoliticoop-ed that described a “full-blown meltdown” at the Pentagon under Hegseth. On Saturday, former Pentagon adviserColin Carrollappeared onMegyn Kelly’s podcast and portrayed Hegseth as image-conscious and obsessed with leaks. When asked by Kelly if he thought Hegseth was emotionally okay, Carroll replied: “I honestly—I don’t know. I’m not sure.” People close to Hegseth told me that the debate over Hegseth’s leadership is also becoming a proxy battle between warring foreign policy camps. “This is about Neo Cons vs America First,” a Republican close to Trump told me. Hegseth’s allies who want the administration to pursue a realist foreign policy suspect that the hawkish wing of the GOP is pushing negative stories to force Hegseth out. “It’s very treacherous,” a Hegseth ally told me. In recent days, Hegseth’s allies have heard that Florida governorRon DeSantiscould be in the running to take over at the Pentagon if Hegseth steps down. “That is a total fabrication,” said DeSantis’s communications director,Bryan Griffin.“The governor has said nothing on the matter, one way or another, to anyone. The media and political gossip crowd needs to stop making stuff up for clicks.” Despite it all, Hegseth’s job appears safe—for now. Trump hastoldpeople he doesn’t want to fire cabinet members who are the subject of negative media reports. It’s part of the unofficial “no scalps” policy Trump has enforced during his second term. “The feeling inside the White House is “let’s not be reactionary,’” said a former campaign official who remains close to the West Wing. “What we’ve learned over four years of Trump is that the news cycle moves so fast that nothing matters anymore.” Still, Hegseth remains under enormous pressure to bring stability to the Pentagon at a moment when global tensions are on the rise. On Monday, CNNreportedthat a Navy F-18 Super Hornet fighter jet rolled off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman while the aircraft carrier made an evasive maneuver to avoid a Houthi attack in the Red Sea. It was a reminder for Hegseth, not that one was needed, that running the Pentagon is a matter of life and death.

    "title": "Amber Ruffin Reveals Powerful Ending to Her Axed White House Correspondents’ Dinner Speech",
    "article_text": "WhenThe Late Show With Stephen Colbertinitially bookedlate-night hostandwriterAmber Ruffin,her appearance was scheduled to come days after her headlining set at theWhite House Correspondents’ Dinner. That is, until she wassuddenly firedfour weeks ahead of the journalism-focused event. “I thought I was gonna be here talking about some, ‘Oh yeah, I did such a good job’ or ‘Oh well, you know, it’s a tough house’—like, one of those two,” Ruffin said during Tuesday night’s episode. “I didn’t think I’d be here going, ‘Yeah, well, my big mouth got me in trouble.’” Outgoing White House Correspondents’ Association presidentEugene DanielsemailedWHCA members on Saturday, March 29, according toThe Hollywood Reporter,saying that the board had unanimously decided to disinvite Ruffin after weeks of consideration. The reversal memo arrived one day after White House deputy chief of staffTaylor Budowichcriticized the comicon social media, sharing a clip of Ruffin appearing onTheDaily Beast Podcast;in the video, she described the Trump administration as “kind of a bunch of murderers” and said she had been told to skewer “both sides” of the political aisle. “There’s no way I’m gonna be freaking doing that, dude. Under no circumstances,” Ruffin said in the clip. The comedian toldStephen Colbert,who famouslyskeweredthen presidentGeorge W. Bushat the 2006 WHCD, that she thought it would be “impossible…and also a little dangerous” to joke about both sides of the political spectrum. “Because we’re at a point now where one side issnatching people up off the street and putting ’em on a plane,” said Ruffin, “and the other side is, you know, not doing that.” At last weekend’s WHCD,Vanity Fair’sNatalie Korachasked the organization’s president about presiding over a dinner without eitherDonald Trumpor a headlining comedian in attendance. “This year, this was the right move,” Danielssaid, adding that “the folks in the room—everything I’ve heard is that people feel like they got what they paid for and what we promised.” Ruffin, who brieflyaddressed her axinglate last month onLate Night With Seth Meyers,told Colbert: “I was really, really sad for like two hours. But then I had a brunch, so then I felt great. I thought, If they didn’t want me doing that show before I had even opened my mouth, then they would have been really, really sad with what they got.” She added, “After they fired me, I looked back at my Google Doc and was like, This would have been bad. They would not have liked it.” When asked to share some jokes from her abandoned set, Ruffin declined—though she did reveal how she planned to conclude her speech. “I was gonna end it with like, ‘This administration is trying to get you to hate other people, and that’s not your natural state. Human beings are made to love one another…. And they got you by convincing you that you’re filled with hate, and you absolutely aren’t. It’s the opposite of what you’re made for,’” Ruffin said. “And saying that out loud now makes me glad that I got canceled.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "After ‘Fargo,’ Allison Tolman Kept Getting “Knocked Down.” Then Came ‘St. Denis Medical’",
    "article_text": "InAlways Great, Awards Insider speaks with Hollywood’s greatest undersung actors in career-spanning conversations. In this installment,Allison Tolmancelebrates a milestone with Tuesday night’s season finale ofSt. Denis Medical,her new NBC sitcom. In this week’s season finale ofSt. Denis Medical,Allison Tolman’s supervising nurse Alex sums up her arc with three words: “I show up.” The steady soul of NBC’s hit mockumentary, Alex has been tasked with keeping things afloat amid a dangerous lack of funding in her spillover hospital—and its unpredictable array of chaotic personalities. By season’s end, she just wants to take a day off to be present for her husband’s own medical procedure, a vasectomy. As always, she struggles to find that balance. But this time, Alex allows herself a bit of grace. Reflecting on a question posed at the top of the episode, she realizes her “superpower” in life. It’s modest, human, and undeniable: She shows up. Tolman, a versatile actor who got her start in Chicago’s theater scene, fits Alex like a glove. The star has showcased her gift for deadpan comedy inSt. Denis Medical,effortlessly playing to camera as Alex reacts in weary resignation to each of the show’s wild, silly turns. “I took to it like a duck to water,” Tolman tellsVanity Fair. But the star also related to Alex’s deeper psychology: “I like to have a handle on things, and I don’t like it when I don’t know what’s going on.” Since she was cast in the first season of FX’sFargoin the early 2010s, this trait has been tested—especially after that show vaulted Tolman into the spotlight. She got an Emmy nomination. She led some broadcast shows that didn’t make it past a single season. She found herself feeling left behind by the prestigeFargomachine, as theNoah Hawleyanthology cast different actors for a totally new story in its second (and subsequent) seasons. By the time the pilot for NBC’sSt. Denis Medicalcame along, she had her doubts. “I’ve not loved the network experience. It didn’t feel like a supersafe place for an actress [like me] who’s felt like a character actress,” Tolman says. “I’m trying to establish myself as someone who can lead a show, and I felt like I kept getting knocked down.” ButSt. Denis Medicalhas been renewed for a second season. It’s a critical and ratings success. And along withMax’sThe Pitt,it’s leading a wave of hit series that play like timely throwbacks: entertaining comfort food in the form of good people doing good. “There’s a really decent core in both of those shows, and it is no surprise to me that that’s what we want out of our entertainment right now,” Tolman says. “We still have a need for shows that just feel good, that make you feel okay and kind of held, and are about decent people just trying their best.” When she was cast inFargo,Tolman had just a few screen credits to her name: an episode ofPrison Breakfrom a decade earlier, a 2009 short film calledA Thousand Cocktails Later,and a recurring arc in the low-budget queer comedySordid Lives.She’d spent years on the Chicago stage when she was cast as sheriff’s deputy Molly Solverson, the spiritual successor toFrances McDormand’s iconic Marge Gunderson. Molly butts heads with a hitman played byBilly Bob Thorntonand a deceptive insurance salesman played byMartin Freeman.Tolman is a marvel in the show: assured, quietly righteous, indefatigable. Yet during production, she felt anything but calm. “I was so out of my element when I was shootingFargo.I really had to fake it. I just didn’t know what I was doing,” she says. “MakingFargowas like being on Mars. I wasn’t trying to be a television star; I just wanted to have health insurance. I had to just be like, ‘I don’t know what a mark is. I don’t know what that means. What do you mean, “Now we’re lighting?”’ I didn’t knowanything.” She also had to work through her famous costars’ specific methods. “With Martin, every take is a wild swing, and it’s incredible to watch—and I was like, I don’t think I work like that,” Tolman says. “It took a long time to be comfortable with figuring out what my process was with filming.” The craft of screen acting was only the first thing she had to learn. OnceFargopremiered to great fanfare, Tolman started looking up what fans were saying. She read everything—from criticisms of her abilities to insults about her appearance. “I would search our hashtags. I wanted to know. And people do say terrible, terrible things—terriblethings,” she says. Tolman learned by force to “thicken up” her skin and what to avoid on the internet. She was not affected, at last, by comments on her actual work inFargo.“They’d insult my talent, and I’d be like, ‘Well, you’re obviously insane. That’s silly,’” she says. “I have a pretty unshakable faith in my talent, as unpopular a thing as that might be for an actor to say.” This helped with what came next. “One of the strange things about suddenly becoming successful in this business is that you have to hire an entire team of people,” Tolman says. “Suddenly you’re the CEO of the company of You.” In carefully assembling her team of representatives, Tolman and co. agreed on “the power of no.” Tolman felt that after earning an Emmy nod for leading the biggest new show of the year, she needed to choose the right follow-up. “I remember feeling like I could be patient and I should be patient,” Tolman says. “The fact that I broke late and that I still had these skills that I could go back to the job market with, frankly, was really helpful.” She madeKrampus,a campy holiday horror movie led byToni ColletteandAdam Scott,before signing onto her first post-Fargoshow:Downward Dog.The idiosyncratic half hour starred Tolman as a millennial working at a marketing company while navigating matters of romance and friendship; it was narrated by her dog in moody, existential monologues about solitude and companionship. Critics largely admired the dramedy, which resembled a cult indie hit out of Sundance. That it landed at ABC proved the project’s fatal flaw—it aired as a summer burn-off and was canceled after a season. Tolman stayed in the broadcast world, finding success as a scene-stealing recurring player on hits likeBrooklyn Nine-NineandGood Girlswhile struggling to secure her own next vehicle. She led another one-and-done, the ABC mystery-thrillerEmergence,just before the pandemic broke out. At the same time, she had to grapple with the ghost ofFargo—the enduring feeling of “standing at the station and watching a train leave that you wanted to be on,” Tolman says. “That was hard. It was really sad.” She pitched anAmerican Horror Story–esque format where cast members returned to laterFargoseasons in fresh roles. “But no one said anything.” So gradually, Tolman started looking back toward the prestige space, eager to feel thatFargofeeling again. “I would tell my team, if there’s a list of actresses my age who are in contention for these roles, I should be on that list—I just don’t see why I shouldn’t be,” she says. “If they don’t like me, they don’t like me, but I should be in these rooms.” Lo and behold, Tolman nabbed and nailed a plum role inGaslitas Winnie McLendon, the journalist whose bond with conservative activist Martha Mitchell (Julia Roberts) helped lead to the Watergate scandal’s public explosion. “You think of movie stars as having their own sort of gravitational pull because of their aura or because they’re so beautiful or whatever, but I found Julia had her own gravitational pull because she was just a fuckingpowerhouse,” Tolman says. “She really knows what she wants. I found her admirable and funny—really funny.” Allison Tolman accepts the award for Best Supporting Actress at the 2014 Critics Choice Awards forFargo. By this point, Tolman thought she might be done with network fare. She wasn’t even sure if the sitcom remained a viable format. “I was like, ‘Are we still making sitcoms? Are they done?’” she says. “IsAbbott Elementarygoing to be the last bastion of this? What are we doing?” ButSt. Denis Medicalresonated with Tolman thanks to its writing—and its timing. Her father had fallen very ill, and Tolman had returned home to Texas; her mom was visiting the hospital every day, and only had the mental bandwidth for a sitcom when she got home. TheSt. Denispilot script was sent to Tolman a few months later. She thought, “There’s really a place for shows like this.” The first season was picked up during the SAG-AFTRA strike; Tolman was a strike captain. It was renewed for season two as devastating wildfires raged around Los Angeles this past winter. “It’s very weird to be in the position where you’re getting good news when no one is getting good news,” Tolman says. “This whole town is depressed.” But there is pride inSt. Denis Medicalshooting in Los Angeles, providing jobs and doing its small part to keep the local industry afloat during a dark time. For Tolman, there’s also relief at having a regular job at all. “Not a lot of people are working. People are freaked out about if they’re going to have to change careers, if they’re going to have to leave town,” Tolman says. “It’s a scary time, so it’s not lost on me how lucky we are to be coming back at a time when things are so tenuous.” And for someone who’s experienced some high highs and low lows in Hollywood, Tolman has a good handle on how to maintain perspective. “Sometimes, you’re shaking hands with people on a Friday and they’re canceling your show the following Thursday,” she says. “When we were waiting to hear about season two, I was like, ‘This will be my first season-two pickup’—so it was just such a huge, huge relief. Now I get to experience this interim time that I’ve never had before. I’m coming back. I know what my job is.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",

    "title": "The 27 Best Movies on Amazon Prime to Watch Now (May 2025)",
    "article_text": "Only one streaming service lives on a site that will sell you paper towels with no shipping costs: Amazon Prime Video. But while shopping for household goods, you may also wonder, What are the bestmovieson Amazon Prime Video?Vanity Fairis here to help. Truly, there are countless films on Prime Video you can rent for a few bucks—but if you are already an Amazon Prime subscriber, you get access to a ton of free, good movies. There are comedies, horror films, dramas, classics, sexy tennis movies withZendaya(okay, only onesexy tennis moviewith Zendaya), and a lot more. So don’t get stuck holding the remote like a schmuck while your spouse eats all the Häagen-Dazs. Take a look at this curated list and pick something outbeforeyou turn the television on. Director:Ben AffleckGenre:Comedy-dramaNotable cast:Matt Damon, Viola Davis, Ben AffleckMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:73 No one makes a movie whenyoudo well at work, but your work doesn’t involve clinching a decades-spanning pop-culture moment, does it?Matt Damonplays thereal-life genius at Nikewho convincedMichael Jordanto stick his name on a new shoe, which sounds like the dumbest idea for a feature film ever. But the way directorBen AffleckputsAirtogether, it’s almost like a heist picture, withViola Davis’sDeloris Jordanas the final obstacle. It’s pure rah-rah capitalism, but one of the top movies on Amazon Prime Video to guarantee a smile. Director:Carl ReinerGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Steve Martin, Lily Tomlin, Richard LibertiniMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:85%Metacritic:68 For those of us old enough to have seen this in theaters, we’ve been mumbling “put Edwina backinbowl” for 40 years. (It’s been a struggle.) This zany supernatural comedy is probably a little dated in its treatment of Eastern religions, but that hopefully won’t offend you too much when you see everymanSteve Martin’s physical antics after 50% of his body is overtaken by undead zillionaireLily Tomlin.Though this is still a bananas picture, it was the first of Martin’s films that wasn’t just a joke parade likeThe JerkorDead Men Don’t Wear Plaid—an important turn in the road for a great career. Director:John LandisGenre:Horror-comedyNotable cast:David Naughton, Griffin Dunne, Jenny AgutterMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:89%Metacritic:55 “Beware the moon, lads!” The OG horror-comedy,An American Werewolf in Londonremains fur-raisingly scary, genuinely funny, and still a little shocking.David Naughton’s transformation sequence is the gold standard for practical special effects, but don’t forget that little piece of flappy skin onGriffin Dunne’s face in the hospital scene—yeeeeach! The big finish at Piccadilly Circus is a warning to all us Yanks: Never go to England! Director:Robert WiseGenre:Science FictionNotable cast:Arthur Hill, James Olson, Kate ReidMPA rating:GRotten Tomatoes:68%Metacritic:60 Only a special kind of movie could be set in 1971 andstilllook futuristic. But that’s the central pleasure to Robert Wise’s punch-card-computing classic. Based on Michael Crichton’s first medical sci-fi thriller, this Space Race–era picture suggests that some of the moon rocks coming back from outer orbit may contain akiller virus,and only a diverse team of mega-brains can figure out a cure against a ticking clock. (Don’t watch if you love lab monkeys.) What’s remarkable is that this is a gripping movie that somehow hinges on bureaucratic processes—procuring talent, sending teletypes, an extended sequence of going down the right elevator. It sounds boring as hell, but trust me that Robert Wise shoots every second like it is life or death. Director:Paul GreengrassGenre:Action-dramaNotable cast:Tom Hanks, Barkhad Abdi, the seaMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:82 Tom Hanksgives one of the best performances of his career (and yet somehow didn’t get an Oscar nom) as the titular Captain Phillips, though social media users are well aware that he is not the captain for the entire duration of this film. (Yes,Paul Greengrass’s nail-biter of a piracy drama is the origin ofthis meme.) This terrifying film will have you thinking twice before you order cheap goods that require international shipping. Director:Luca GuadagninoGenre:Romantic dramaNotable cast:Zendaya, Josh O’Connor, Mike FaistMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:88%Metacritic:82 InChallengers,Zendaya is serving…tennis balls. What did you think I was going to say? This extremely of-the-now relationship drama volleys back and forth in time, but builds to one ace of a finish. And when you know the score, it’s a reallovestory. (I’ll stop now.) Anyhow, betweenLuca Guadagnino’s roaming camera,Trent ReznorandAtticus Ross’s electronica soundtrack, andJosh O’ConnorandMike Faistsharing a churro, this is one of the hottest movies on Prime Video right now. Director:Edward BergerGenre:DramaNotable cast:Ralph Fiennes, Stanley Tucci, John LithgowMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:79 Intrigue! at the Vatican.Ralph Fiennesleads a group of crimson-robed holy men through a series of surprisingly dishy days and nights while determining who gets to be the next pope. The Holy See soon becomes the Holy I See What You Did, as past scandals are uncovered and men of the cloth maneuver to support their personal faves. Nominated for eight Oscars and winning one for best adapted screenplay,Conclavewill, if nothing else, renew your faith in page-turning “airport novel” cinema. Director:Gareth EdwardsGenre:Science FictionNotable cast:John David Washington, Gemma Chan, Allison JanneyMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:68%Metacritic:63 If you accept that one day artificial intelligence will eventually attempt to slaughter all humans, the second part of that equation is the need to create some kind of lasting peace.The Creatoris a cracking science fiction film about that eventual drive toward detente, but not before some striking battle sequences involving some wild “I've-never-seen-that-in-a-movie-before” tech. (Allison Janneyresuscitating the mind of a terrified, freshly-killed soldier from beyond death to extract information is one of darkest sequences in a movie ever.) For whatever reason this movie didn't quite land during its initial release, but maybe now, with AI in our lives far more than just two years ago, it's worth a second look. Director:Fred ZinnemannGenre:SuspenseNotable cast:Edward Fox, Michael Lonsdale, Derek JacobiMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:91%Metacritic:80 Back in the old days, when you wanted to assassinate a head of state, you had to do it without Google Maps, cell phones, or those guns that put a little red spot on the guy before you shoot. This is the world of Fred Zinnemann’sThe Day of the Jackal,which is based on a tiny speck of truth (in as much as French nationalists wanted to bump off Charles de Gaulle, and there was a real assassin codenamed the Jackal) and is a flat-out masterpiece of no-nonsense spycraft. Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly by writing that the movie “is two and a half hours long and seems over in about 15 minutes.” Director:Spike LeeGenre:Drama (but also comedy)Notable cast:Spike Lee, Rosie Perez, John TurturroMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:92%Metacritic:93 “20 D Energizers!”Spike Lee’s heat-soaked masterpiece is among the most insightful and socially relevant films of all time, but let’s not forget something: It’s alsoincrediblyfunny, and includes a tidal wave of great performances and zingers that also make this an uncommonly quotable movie. I can personally attest that, for more than 30 years, I’ve been repeating Sal’s “Extra cheese is $2!” and Sweet Dick Willie’s “It ain’t never too hot or never too cold!” whenever the opportunity presents itself. Director:Rusty CundieffGenre:ComedyNotable cast: Rusty Cundieff, Kasi Lemmons, Larry B. ScottMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:83%Metacritic:62 One of the best Prime movies for 1990s nostalgia, this mockumentary is one of the great hip-hop comedies, poking fun at the rap trends of the time. (Indeed, it must be noted that there were several stars with “Ice” in their name.) This low-budget picture, inspired byThis Is Spinal Tap,made its Sundance debut just before a bigger-budget rap mockumentary,CB4,hit theaters. While that film had bigger stars, this had (and still has) far more edge to it. Its director and star,Rusty Cundieff,later created theTales From the Hoodseries and directed much ofChappelle’s Show. Director:Mike NicholsGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft, Katharine RossMPA rating:PG (rated upon rerelease)Rotten Tomatoes:87%Metacritic:83 Dustin HoffmanandAnne Bancroftsaw to it that there was no physical generation gap in this counterculture epic by, um, meeting discreetly in hotel rooms. Despite the passage of time, there’s a universality to young Benjamin Braddock’s conundrum of not knowing what the hell he wants to do with his life now that he’s graduated college. (“Plastics” isn’t the answer.)Mike Nichols’s legendary film, with its Simon and Garfunkel soundtrack, had considerably fewer overt political moments in it than many other movies of the era, which is probably why it has lasted so long. Director:Alexander PayneGenre:Comedy dramaNotable cast:Paul Giamatti, Dominic Sessa, Da’Vine Joy RandolphMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:97%Metacritic:82 I’m still not convinced this film wasn’t shot in 1971, then buried in the ground all this time. InAlexander Payne’s tribute to films likeHarold and MaudeandThe Last Detail,Paul Giamattiis perfect as the pungent, wall-eyed classics professor stuck babysitting a rich kid at a boarding school, played byDominic Sessa,over Christmas break. Of course, the pair, along with their self-exiled, grieving lunch lady (Da’Vine Joy Randolph,winner of thebest-supporting-actress Oscar), end up bonding in this bittersweet winner. Director:Philip KaufmanGenre:Horror-sci-fiNotable cast:Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, Leonard NimoyMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:92 Watch this if for no other reason than to find out where that GIF of Donald Sutherlandpointing and making a crazy facecomes from. This remake of the 1950s Cold War fright fest is a high-water mark for 1970s permissiveness—there’s alotof gore and nudity for a PG movie here. Also, it certainly gives Leonard Nimoy his best non-Spock role, as a pop psychologist. The central metaphor of “pod people” coming to replace the American public is also vague enough to suit all political paranoias. Director:Godfrey ReggioGenre:ExperimentalNotable cast:The planet EarthMPA rating:Not ratedRotten Tomatoes:91%Metacritic:72 This art house mainstay is still revolutionary in its craftsmanship and hesitancy to explain itself.Godfrey Reggio,a former monk/social activist/political advertising man, collaborated with tech-forward cinematographerRon Frickeand celebrated composerPhilip Glassto makeKoyaanisqatsi,a portrait of the natural world and its human inhabitants living in a weirdly beautiful disharmony. (The title means “Life out of Balance” in the Hopi language.) No one had ever seen such a collection of images put to music quite like this before—and Reggio’s style was immediately seized upon by Madison Avenue, making this one of the most influential pictures of the late 20th century. It’s also never boring despite it having no dialogue or plot. A great one to stream during a late night. Director:Sofia CoppolaGenre:DramaNotable cast:Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, Giovanni RibisiMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:95%Metacritic:91 I dunno about you, but whenever I’m bored at a hotel, it’s never as glamorous as this. (I’m usually trying to figure out how the thermostat works.)Sofia Coppolafamously conceived of her breakout film not by creating a typical screenplay, but by writing short paragraphs reflecting on time spent in Tokyo, envisioningBill Murrayin the main role. It then tookher a yearto get him to agree to be in the film—opposite a 17-year-oldScarlett Johansson. Director:Regina KingGenre:DramaNotable cast:Kingsley Ben-Adir, Leslie Odom Jr., Eli Goree, Aldis HodgeMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:98%Metacritic:83 Four Black men on the verge of changing the world—Sam Cooke, Jim Brown, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali (still known as Cassius Clay)—meet in a hotel room in 1963 to examine the roads that lie ahead for them. Based on a speculative play by Kemp Powers that is in turn based ona true meetup, Regina King’s film adaptation offers the floor tofour powerhouse performers. Leslie Odom Jr. is particularly effective as Sam Cooke in a musical sequence. Director:Christopher NolanGenre:DramaNotable cast:Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Florence PughMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:90 The only Academy Award winner for best picture about a guy who slowly gets an all-access pass taken away from him. Okay, that’s not whatOppenheimeris really about, but the eggheads at Los Alamos were all about breaking things down to their component parts. Anyway, for all ofChristopher Nolan’s love of enormous IMAX cameras and the theatrical experience, this movie still comes together like clockwork when streaming on Prime Video. Director:John SaylesGenre:DramaNotable cast:Mary McDonnell, Alfre Woodard, David StrathairnMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:100%Metacritic:Not listed In the late 1980s and early 1990s,John Sayleswas pumping out brilliant, literate, funny, and emotional independent films at a regular clip—andPassion Fishmight be the best of the bunch. It starsMary McDonnellas a soap opera star who moves back to Louisiana after a traffic accident leaves her paralyzed. While wallowing in self-pity, she bonds with a nurse,Alfre Woodard,the only caregiver who doesn’t quit because she has no other options open to her.David Strathairncostars as a local fisherman. In a parallel universe, this is the most famous movie of the 1990s, because it’s absolutely fantastic. Director:Emerald FennellGenre:DraAAAA-maaaaa!Notable cast:Jacob Elordi, Barry Keoghan, Rosamund PikeMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:71%Metacritic:61 Emerald Fennell's poke at British aristocracy is a warm, salty bath of satire provided you approach it with the right attitude. There are some twists and turns to the plot (and, quite frankly, the big reveal is a bit of a whiff) but it's the ride along the way that you'll remember, withBarry Keoghanloving and hatingJacob Elordiin an endless cycle of depraved class struggle. Be sure to stick around for the dance sequence at the end. Director:Martin BrestGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Al Pacino, Chris O’Donnell, WomenMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:85%Metacritic:57 “Hoo-ah!”Al Pacinomade the full transformation into “Loud Al” with this sleeper success from directorMartin Brest.In it, he plays an ornery, blind, retired army colonel who starts palling around with a prep school student (Chris O’Donnell), teaching him how tolive,how totruly live.(UnlikeZorba the Greek,it does not involve dancing on the sand, but there are other commonalities.) This is definitely a movie from another time, but if you ignore the occasionally creaky sexual politics and instead focus on the outstanding New York City location photography, you may find yourself having a good time. It won Pacino his first acting Oscar after seven nominations. Director:Ang LeeGenre:DramaNotable cast:Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh GrantMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:97%Metacritic:84 The first of Jane Austen’s six major novels, adapted at a time when the author’s work had finally been freed from soporificMasterpiece Theatreassociations. DirectorAng Leeand screenwriterEmma Thompson, who also stars in the film, deliver a fast-paced, funny, and juicy version with a whole lot of romping around the countryside, getting caught in the rain, swooning, weeping, and making ever so many witty remarks. Director:David FincherGenre:DramaNotable cast:Jessie Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Justin TimberlakeMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:95 DirectorDavid Fincherand screenwriterAaron Sorkin’s ballad of the tech bro is arguably the quintessential film of its era, detailing the Wild West of new internet wealth. Yes, Facebook got people back in touch with their lost high school chums, but was it worth making these immature, hoodie-wearing dweebs zillionaires? Hit “like” if you have thoughts. Director:Richard AyoadeGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Craig Roberts, Sally Hawkins, Paddy ConsidineMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:88%Metacritic:76 One of the great, somewhat forgotten recent quirky teen romance films,Richard Ayoade’sSubmarinecould be reductively described as a “BritishRushmore,” but…is that such a bad thing? It has a similar snappy style of editing and production design, as well as a delightful, youthful melancholy. The soundtrack includes six original songs byAlex Turnerof the Arctic Monkeys, which may give you a good idea of what you are in for here. Director:Eugene AsheGenre:Romantic dramaNotable cast:Tessa Thompson, Nnamdi Asomugha, Regé-Jean PageMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:94%Metacritic:74 This terrific early-’60s-set Harlem melodrama is a tender and witty look at the worlds of jazz and, uh, early cooking shows, with lavish sets, costumes, and production design. It’s also just charming as hell to watchTessa ThompsonandNnamdi Asomughaflirt, fall in love, suffer setbacks, yearn for one another, and then…live happily ever after? Well, I’m not gonna spoil it; you need to watch for yourself. Director:Seth MacFarlaneGenre:Action-AdventureNotable cast:Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, TedMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:69%Metacritic:62 What’s funnier than a Boston dirtbag? A Boston dirtbag that’s also a teddy bear.Ted,from the frequently annoyingSeth MacFarlane,is a cavalcade of inappropriate jokes that, in the safety of your own home, you can respond to as your heart desires, with no fear of shame. (There’s a bit in here about the stuffed animal’s tag that is simultaneously adorable and shocking.) The ending may drag on a little long, and all the stuff aboutFlash Gordonoverstays its welcome, but just because you start streamingTedwhile cracking a brewski doesn’t mean you need to finish it. It’s still pretty damn funny. Director:Barbra StreisandGenre:Drama-musicalNotable cast:Barbra Streisand, Mandy Patinkin, Amy IrvingMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:69%Metacritic:68 “What kind of creature are you???” “I’m just a woman!!!”Barbra Streisand’s ahead-of-its-time masterpiece currently enjoys the critical respect it deserves, though it got something of a (sexist) cold shoulder upon its release. (Look at those middling critic scores: ashanda!) This marvelous film, in which a bright young woman must go undercover as a man to study religion, boasts romance, comedy, searing drama, and even some great musical numbers. There’s never been another movie quite likeYentl. The most-viewed movie on Amazon Prime is the remake ofRoad House,believe it or not. Right now, withDie Hardis doing big numbers, probably because we just made it through Christmas. I didn't include on the list just because I want to give that movie a rest for a little while. According to IMDb, the 10 most popular series on Prime areThe Boys, Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan,The Man in the High Castle,The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,The Grand Tour,Bosch,Carnival Row,Paatal Lok,Goliath,andUpload.",

    "title": "The 22 Best Movies on Hulu to Watch Right Now (May 2025)",
    "article_text": "Each night, you look into your lover’s eyes and ask, “Will no legacy media outlet tell me about the best movies on Hulu?” Luckily,Vanity Fairis here for you. One glance at the platform’s A-to-Z listing reveals that there are almosttoo manygood movies on Hulu to choose from, and it can become a chore to figure out which to choose. After a deep dive into the Hulu archive (the Hu-chive?), we’ve selected a top mix of classics, comedies, dramas, horror pictures, documentaries, and, importantly, a few titles that got overlooked upon their initial release. Our list is in alphabetical order, so you gotta scroll close to the bottom to get toY Tu Mamá También.Hu loves ya? Director:Rodney AscherGenre:DocumentaryNotable cast:Keanu Reeves (archival), Elon Musk (archival), Philip K. Dick (archival)MPA rating:Not ratedRotten Tomatoes:66%Metacritic:62 A gem awaiting rediscovery, this good faith analysis of individuals who are convinced we live in a simulation is either an eerie exploration of insanity or the most important documentary you’ll ever watch…becauseit’s all true.Rodney Ascher,whose previous work includes theShining-obsessedRoom 237,usesThe Matrixas a touchpoint for this (expanding?) syndrome and interviews his subjects virtually, using gaming avatars. Read our mind-scrambling interview with the directorhere, then prepare to soak yourbrain in a vatfor a while. Director:Ridley ScottGenre:Sci Fi/HorrorNotable Cast:Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerrit, John Hurt, Veronica CartwrightMPA Rating:RRotten Tomatoes:93%Metacritic:89 The original and still the best. A haunted house story, a workplace drama, and a twist-filled mystery—all set in outer space. Sigourney Weaver’s rocket to superstardom started here when she played the greatest interplanetaryfinal girl, and John Hurt’s legendary tummy ache was a milestone for practical special effects. Several (not all!) of the sequels and prequels to this movie are good, but no matter how many times you’ve seenAlien, you will always find something new in it. Director:Gina Prince-BythewoodGenre:Romantic dramaNotable cast:Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Nate Parker, Minnie DriverMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:83%Metacritic:73 A classic showbiz romance updated for today (or 2014, but that’s close enough), withGugu Mbatha-Rawas an R&B/pop sensation trapped by fame andNate Parkeras the hunky police officer/would-be politician who first saves her life, then takes her heart. This is glossy soap opera filmmaking at its finest, with an extended sequence at a beachside hideaway that may have you hitting pause and heading to Travelocity. One of the better romantic movies to watch on Hulu. Director:Damien ChazelleGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Margot Robbie, Brad Pitt, Jean SmartMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:57%Metacritic:61 Okay this recent big swing fromLa La Land'sDamien Chazelleis mostly remembered for being an awards and box office dud, but if ever there were a project meant for a streaming reevaluation it's something likeBabylon. This jaundiced look at the early years of Hollywood opens with aGarden of Earthly Delights-like party and concludes with a frenzied montage summarizing the history of cinema. At well over three hours, it doesn't all work, but a lot of it—likeMargot Robbie's spunky Nellie LeRoy zooted up on cocaine—is charming. (The defecating elephant, less so.) Director:Penny MarshallGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Tom Hanks, Elizabeth Perkins, Robert LoggiaMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:98%Metacritic:73 Tom Hanks romping around New York City as a wide-eyed 12-year-old in an adult's body inBigis one of the great entries in the 1980s “wonderment” canon. (Tidbit:Steven Spielberg's younger sisterAnneco-wrote the script, so if you've ever caught an Amblin vibe from this, you aren't nuts.) Even back in 1988 the “wait, so did they sleep together” moment was a little weird, and now simply checking reddit for fan theories gets you on an FBI list. Also maybe the whole mystical Zoltar machine has the taint of antiziganism. Hopefully neither consideration will prevent you from rewatching. It's something of a miracle there hasn't yet been a dreadful Hollywood remake or legacy-sequel. Director:Alice RohrwacherGenre:Crime/comedyNotable cast:Josh O’Connor, Isabella Rossellini, Alba RohrwacherMPA rating:Not ratedRotten Tomatoes:94%Metacritic:91 This charming Italian film (which had a rare, unplanned “extended run” throughout 2024 in New York art houses, a once common phenomenon that hardly exists in the streaming era) starsJosh O’Connoras a sensitive thief returning to his band of artifact bandits. He possesses an ability to know where to dig while sniffing out Etruscan treasure in tiny towns. A kaleidoscope of colorful characters emerge, as does a criminal plot in this sun-soaked and very amusing tale—one of the best new movies on Hulu. Directors:Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi and Jimmy ChinGenre:DocumentaryNotable Cast:Alex Honnold, El CapitanMPA Rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:97%Metacritic:83 Free Solois a great movie to stream on Hulu because if you watch it in a theater, they may throw you out for gasping, moaning, and shouting, “Are younuts?!?!”Alex Honnold(who didnotdie, to paraphraseGonzo the Great) is a professional meshuggeneh who climbs the sides of mountains with no safety gear, because I guess the world isn’t terrifying enough. It is a fascinating and riveting portrait. Director:Wes AndersonGenre:Comedy (for the most part)Notable cast:Ralph Fiennes, F. Murray Abraham, Saoirse RonanMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:92%Metacritic:88 The Grand Budapest Hotelis a rich and remarkable film that showcases all ofWes Anderson’s unique talents. It’s a story within a story within a story (and maybe one more? I should watch it again on Hulu…) that seems, at first, like a delicate puff pastry, but eventually sours as the clicking boots of history muddy up our reveries of the past. The cast is ludicrously packed, butRalph Fiennesis at his madcap best in the center of it all—part Jerry Lewis, part Cary Grant. Director:Karyn KusamaGenre:HorrorNotable cast:Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, J.K. SimmonsMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:46%Metacritic:47 Pay no attention to those low critic scores. (Or if you do, search my name and see that I was always on the right side of history.) This teen supernatural horror-comedy, scripted byDiablo Codynot long after she won an Oscar forJunoand createdUnited States of Tara,was shrugged aside at the time of its release, but it’s now been fully embraced as a sharp critique of exploitation tropes and a modern spin on feminism (as well as a win for bisexual representation). That doesn’t mean it’s a college lecture:Jenniferstill has plenty of guts and gore, zingy dialogue, and music by Florence + the Machine, Panic! at the Disco, and other groups of the era. Director:Christopher NolanGenre:Science fictionNotable cast:Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Matt DamonMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:73%Metacritic:74 On the one hand, this movie about black holes, relativistic space travel, and “the problem of gravity” has a stamp of approval from theoretical physicistKip Thorne.But it also hits hardest when we watch space cowboyMatthew McConaugheycry about missing his kids. It hits second-hardest when brave planet-hopping warriorMatt Damonrealizes he lacks the fortitude to face true isolation. Humanity, it’s a puzzle!Christopher Nolandoes all he can to take these very simple emotions and tie them up in all kinds of crazy wormholes and tesseracts (and set them to what is arguablyHans Zimmer’s best score). This film is a miracle. Director:Brian De PalmaGenre:Spy thrillerNotable cast:Tom Cruise, Jon Voight, Vanessa RedgraveMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:66%Metacritic:59 For nearly 30 years, we’ve been watching guys tear off their face to revealTom Cruise’s face underneath. And no matter how many times he does it, it’s still awesome. Few would have expected back in 1996 that this television series adaptation would have begotten so many sequels, and pushed the envelope for what we can expect in preposterous cinematic stunts. While the movies have gotten larger as time has marched on, few things compare to the first entry’s sequence where Ethan Hunt, his glasses, and his sweat are dangling over a touch-sensitive room where he’s gotta steal a floppy disc or something. That acrobatic scene, and so much else in the film, still hold up. Director:Jonathan LynnGenre:ComedyNotable Cast:Joe Pesci, Marisa Tomei, Ralph MacchioMPA Rating:RRotten Tomatoes:85%Metacritic:68 The most righteous ofall best-supporting-actress Oscar winners,Marisa Tomeirevolutionized outer-borough representation with her sharp, sassy, and sexy performance as auto enthusiast Mona Lisa Vito. Her fiancé, a dopey personal injury attorney played byJoe Pesci,must decamp from Brooklyn to Alabama to rescue two unjustly accused nice guys, and tell a whole lotta jokes along the way. An added (and unexpected) benefit of the film is that trial litigatorslist itas one of the top movies that actually shows courtroom proceedings in a factual light. Director:Guillermo del ToroGenre:Drama/horrorNotable cast:Bradley Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette, David StrathairnMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:80%Metacritic:70 This carnival-set motion picture has pulled a disappearing act. It was nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards (as well as best cinematography, costumes, and production design), but it came out during COVID times, when few were going to see 150-minute remakes of Tyrone Power movies. But guess what: Featuring an absolutely stacked cast, the film is a terrific, moody look inside the tarot-reading tent, treating classic B picture tropes with a respect and care rarely seen. Director:Rob ReinerGenre:ComedyNotable cast:Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace ShawnMPA rating:PGRotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:78 Feel you've seen this one too many times already? Inconceivable! More to the point, perhaps there is a young child in your life feeling a little under the weather who could use a tale of chivalry and sorcery as a pick-me-up? Streaming services are awash in high fantasy series, but none of them have the wit and verve of this late ‘80s cross-generational classic. Sure, this is a comedy, butMandy Patinkin’s final act of vengeance against his late father works as drama because you care so much about the characters. Cameos from Andre the Giant, Peter Cook andCarol Kane, plusMark Knopfler's original music, sweeten the package. Director:Jesse EisenbergGenre:Comedy-dramaNotable cast:Jesse Eisenberg, Kieran Culkin, Jennifer GreyMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:86 Writer-director-starJesse Eisenbergwas inspired to makeA Real Painafter an actual visit he made to the former home of a beloved family member who grew up in Poland. He andKieran Culkinplay very different cousins who make the trip and philosophize in settings that see-saw from the gorgeous to the unthinkable. Culkin’s role as an annoying-yet-lovable extrovert is an extraordinary example of “the part he was born to play,” and the actor is well deserving of the praise he has received for his magical performance. Director:Jonathan DemmeGenre:DramaNotable cast:Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline, Mamie GummerMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:65%Metacritic:54 On paper, there’s nothing special aboutRicki and the Flash.It’s another movie about a family in crisis, trying to patch up old wounds. But it starsMeryl Streep,her actual daughterMamie Gummer,and others (like a youngSebastian Stan!)—and, most importantly, it was directed by Jonathan Demme in peak humanist form. (Sadly, this was his last narrative feature.) Streep’s Ricki Rendazzo (real name Linda) walked away from her life to become the nextBonnie Raitt,but she actually earns her living bagging groceries. A wedding-slash-reunion won’t fix the past, but it might start to pave a new future—and the film’s big concert finish proves that no one could capture the cinematic possibilities of live music performances quite like Demme. Director:Jim SharmanGenre:MusicalNotable cast:Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon, Meat LoafMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:80%Metacritic:65 Yes, yes: If ever there were a motion picture that was meant for the theater, it’sThe Rocky Horror Picture Show,with its shadows cast and talk-backs. But maybe you want to have a smaller version of the experience in the intimacy of your own home? (Whatever couldthatlead to?) However, in addition to being reminded of the B-movie tropes and LGBTQ+ themes, you must be forewarned: A rewatch of this film meansRichard O’Brien’s enduring songs (“Over at the Frankenstein Place” being my favorite) will get stuck in your head and simply never leave. Director:Jan de BontGenre:Action-adventureNotable cast:Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, Dennis HopperMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:95%Metacritic:78 ThisKeanu Reeves–led hit is such a classic work that a young person watchingDie Hardmight describe that film as “Speedin a skyscraper.”Dennis Hopperis the world’s most high-concept terrorist, strapping a bomb to a bus that will explode should it go slower than 50 miles per hour. Why would he do this? How would he do this? More importantly, how can wethankhim for doing this? Reeves, a determined cop, teams up withSandra Bullock,who moves from passenger to hero in just 116 minutes. Step on it. Director:QuestloveGenre:DocumentaryNotable cast:The 5th Dimension, Stevie Wonder, Mahalia JacksonMPA rating:PG-13Rotten Tomatoes:99%Metacritic:96 The ubiquity of cell phone cameras and the internet means that what happened with the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival could never happen again. I don’t mean there couldn’t be a great and meaningful celebration of music—I mean that it couldn’t almost beforgottenthanks to poor archiving. Luckily,Questlovemade the effort to unearth this important milestone in Black culture, and this reflection/celebration, which does not skimp on the footage, became an Academy Award–winning documentary. Director:Sean BakerGenre:DramaNotable cast:Kitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, James RansoneMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:96%Metacritic:86 For many, this was the film that broughtAnoradirectorSean Bakerto their attention; a delirious, warts-and-all portrait of transgender sex workers in Los Angeles. It was shot on a minuscule budget, using three iPhone 5S cameras with then cutting-edge enhancement apps and Steadicam rigs. This lent itself nicely to Baker’s documentary-inclined sensibilities, while his artistic eye shined through the common “cell phone” format. Finding beauty among the downtrodden, which is inherent to the script, is reflected in the look of the movie itself. It’s a groundbreaking work. Director:Martin ScorseseGenre:Drama (but also comedy)Notable cast:Leonardo DiCaprio, Margot Robbie, Jonah HillMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:79%Metacritic:75 If you don’t believe in time travel, just dial upThe Wolf of Wall Streeton Hulu and see how three hours can zip by in 20 minutes.Martin Scorsese’s satiric take on gutter capitalism is a dizzying whirl of bad behavior. WatchLeonardo DiCaprioromp around his Long Island mansion with his fast cars and drugs snorted from surprising locations, and wait for his inevitable downfall. This is the movie that made Margot Robbie an international sensation, but also reminded us thatJonah Hill(andRob Reiner!) are clutch supporting characters. Director:Alfonso CuarónGenre:DramaNotable cast:Gael García Bernal, Diego Luna, Maribel VerdúMPA rating:RRotten Tomatoes:90%Metacritic:89 This Spanish-language romantic drama introduced international audiences toAlfonso Cuarón,Gael García Bernal,andDiego Luna,all in one heady, lusty swoop.Y Tu Mamá Tambiénfollows two sexually ripe young men who have their first adult affairs—with the same older woman. The three take a road trip, that most liberating of cinematic forms, and ride it until, eventually, the wheels come off. The journey, however, will provide memories for a lifetime. Did you not just read the list? I spent hours on this damn thing. Yes, there are many good movies on Hulu right now. WatchDead Poets Societyif you want to cry orQuiz Ladyif you want to laugh. I don’t know what you mean. The one with the most streams? Probably something for morons. My number one is probably an epic likeFord v Ferrari. It’s gotta beThe Rocky Horror Picture Show,especially if you dress up. When was the last time you saw it? What, youneversaw it?!!? Correct that now. Boy, you’ve really got a hang-up about “number one,” don’t you? Do you have to go to the bathroom or something? Anyway, the scariest movie on Hulu right now isThe Host.

    "title": "The Tiger Woods–Backed Virtual Golf League Reinventing the Game",
    "article_text": "Inside a cavernous arena in Palm Beach Gardens on a chilly-for-Florida Tuesday night in January, about 1,500 of us pile into our seats. We all know why we’re here. Governor Ron DeSantis, flanked by a chiseled-chinned bodyguard, knows. DJ Khaled, with his luxuriantly coiffed beard on full display, knows. Serena Williams, the women’s tennis icon and widely regarded GOAT of the sport, also knows. Alexis Ohanian, her husband, cofounder of Reddit, and this evening’s Sonny Crockett cosplayer thanks to his white sport coat, knows as well. So does showrunner and streaming hitmaker Shonda Rhimes. So does world champion soccer player Alex Morgan. So does every single ticket holder, some of whom spent close to $1,000 just to get through the doors. Celebrities and civilians, all eagerly anticipating the arrival of the man of the evening. First we see the smoke, a billowing cloud of red that engulfs him from head to toe, a picture we’re watching on two large high-definition monitors at the front of the arena. Then the opening chords of Survivor’s “Eye of the Tiger” kick in as the smoke clears, and we see him in the flesh. It’s Tiger Woods, striding down a tunnel and into the arena, sporting a boyish grin and his signature red polo. When Woods spots his teenage son, Charlie, in the stands, he delivers an emphatic high five punctuated by a full belly laugh, walks onto the field of play, and acknowledges the crowd, pointing both index fingers skyward. A deafening roar floods the air. SoFi Center workers toss t-shirts and hammer towels into the crowd between holes on the course. Collin Morikawa is here too, and he knows what he’s up against. The 28-year-old phenom made his first 22 consecutive cuts on the PGA Tour, second only to Woods’s 25-cut record—and he’s ready to release the same competitive energy tonight. Morikawa stands to the side as Woods positions himself on a tee box 35 yards from a holy-shit-size simulator screen 64 feet wide and 53 feet high, big enough to stack seven gray whales with room to spare. Mark Morrison’s “Return of the Mack” suddenly blares over the arena’s loudspeakers. Then Woods makes contact, sending his golf ball 270 yards down the fairway, through a digital landscape, as shouts of “In the hole!” and “Attaboy!” ring out from snapback-capped dudes in the crowd. Woods walks off to his right. Morikawa readies his team. The match is on. Welcome to TGL. Golf, one might say, is a sport that has long managed to alienate swaths of society without even trying. It’s the quiet activity of country clubs that takes hours to complete. (Though the origin of the line is disputed, many writers, the cheeky bunch we are, have described golf as being of such considerable length that it’s enough to “spoil a good walk.”) For many, it’s maddening to follow, let alone learn. Whiff opportunities abound, the sort of stuff that can turn middle-aged men apoplectic right after unironically uttering the phrase “There he is!” Now, a bankable list of top-flight players, television veterans from NBC and ESPN, A-list celebrities—including Justin Timberlake, Justin Bieber, Shaquille O’Neal, Stephen Curry, and Jimmy Fallon—and a madcap group of visionaries from the PGA Tour and other sports leagues are betting hundreds of millions of dollars that golf can be something more. The TGL, which kicked off its inaugural season in January, is unlike anything the game has ever seen. (The abbreviation stands for TMRW Golf League, a nod to the founding organization.) An effort almost five years in the making, TGL is a made-for-TV revision of the sport that plans to become the mecca of sports simulations by turning golf into a freewheeling video game: 40-second shot clocks to keep matches short and fast-paced, and 15-hole courses to keep play to two hours. Golfers don’t compete individually but rather on teams—six in all, spread across the US—in three-on-three-style contests with a rotating fourth player who sits out. Through the first nine holes they play alternating shots, while holes 10 through 15 are played one on one, each teammate squaring off on their own for two holes apiece. “This is insane,” Morikawa told me. “It’s what I want my backyard to look like.” All 24 players—who, in addition to Woods and Morikawa, include the likes of Rickie Fowler and eventual 2025 Masters Tournament champion Rory McIlroy—are top pros from the PGA. They’re mic’d up at every match, much the same way the NFL uses hot mics to catch candid commentary—although it’s not optional in TGL. The point is to hear players talking tactics and trash to one another. And every single match airs live on ESPN from the SoFi Center, a nearly 250,000-square-foot enclosed arena that cost $50 million, with general admission seating on the first floor and club boxes for VIPs just above. “It’s dramatic for the game,” Woods said from the broadcast booth during the very first televised match, a week before he got his introduction to TGL. “Here’s something that’s going to change the game, how it’s perceived, how it’s looked at.” Picture being courtside at an NBA game, and you have the gist of what a TGL match is like on the ground. At times, you’re no farther than 10 feet from some of the best golfers in the world. Cheering is encouraged, beers and mixed drinks flow freely, and golf balls zip to the sound of Avicii and Kanye West. (DJ Irie, the man who formerly spun tracks for the Miami Heat, handles the music.) “The atmosphere’s so different for us. When you get 1,500 eyeballs looking directly at you, things change,” says Morikawa, captain of the Los Angeles Golf Club. “You got to be there for two hours, and you don’t want to let the team down.” Matches begin on two tee boxes, one behind the other, facing the massive screen. Golfers start on the box farther back to drive. Once they’re within 70 yards of the pin, they move to the box in front. Courses are immense. (How’s a 720-yard par 5 sound to you? Over a freaking canyon, by the way.) Ball-tracing technology projects the flight of each ball, based on its spin, speed, angle of attack, and even the number of dimples it contains, as it impacts the screen and continues to soar through virtual environments. A tee box with fresh grass is replaced on the SoFi Center Course. Play shifts to the back of the arena at around 45 yards away. An overhead spotlight highlights where golfers’ balls land, and they finish each hole on a short-game complex of more than 22,000 square feet, complete with sand bunkers and a synthetic putting green with seven pin placements. The green is positioned on a 41-yard-wide rotating turntable, like a revolving stage, and kitted out with nearly 600 underground actuators, morphing the physical terrain golfers navigate based on which of the league’s 30 bespoke holes they’re playing. Taken together, all of these simulations allow golf to skirt around the sport’s typical constraints by blending digital and physical reality. “It’s a cool new idea, something that’s not been done before, and I think an opportunity that you wouldn’t want to miss,” says LA club member Tommy Fleetwood, a Brit with a full beard, a mop of brown hair, and the nickname Fairway Jesus, not only for his looks, but also for his knack for hitting the fairway on a golf course. “We could all be part of the growth of something that’s unbelievable.” Win a hole and you win a point. That is, unless you play the hammer, an orange golf towel that teams can chuck onto the field to double a hole’s point value. Each team gets three per match. (The team that doesn’t throw the hammer has to accept the challenge or concede the hole.) The team with the most points at the end of 15 holes wins. The top four teams go to the playoffs in mid-March—mere weeks before the Masters—and the champion takes home $9 million. (In 2025, Atlanta Drive GC won the money and the inaugural SoFi Cup, beating New York Golf Club in a best-of-three series.) Perhaps the closest analogue in the pro game is the Ryder Cup, where 12-man teams from the US and Europe go head-to-head, but TGL’s idiosyncrasies surely won’t be for everyone. The league’s fourth match featured the highly anticipated Tiger vs. Rory contest, which ended in a tie and therefore went into overtime, in which Woods’s team emerged victorious after winning a closest-to-the-pin chip-off. Michael Wilbon ofPardon the Interruptionfame was not impressed, comparing the event to a TV studio. He took it further the following week just after McIlroy won at Pebble Beach, extolling the physical beauty of the course and the joy one presumably feels as great players step up to tee off at hole 18, staring down the legendary cypress tree on the fairway. “This is why you don’t give a damn, or I don’t, about golf in a studio,” said Wilbon. “This is why I’m not watching TGL.” Other criticism has focused on TGL’s stylistic elements, specifically when it comes to putting hot mics on traditionally reserved and impassive athletes. An article in theWashington Postthat appeared just before the season began quoted golf analyst Geoff Fienberg, who said listening to player commentary mid-match “will either be really cool or end up being like a cringe karaoke sort of vibe.” Damn kids and their rock music. Still, golf traditionalists need not worry much, it seems. “No one’s out here saying this is a replacement for golf,” says Ohanian, who, along with Serena Williams and her sister Venus, owns the LA Golf Club. “This is a complement to it. And this is a way to elevate the stars of the sport in a different format.” Success for TGL depends on just that: an abridged, wacky, more in your face, and, itcouldbe, more fun version of golf resonating with arena goers and viewers at home. Breaking down the barriers, in other words, between spectators and generational golf talent. The league’s backers, investors and players alike, talk about demystifying the game by marrying tradition with a digital future. Do that, and you make golf more accessible to new audiences as well as longtime followers, who probably want to know what’s going on inside the mind of a PGA golfer as they’re lining up a shot. All that’s left to do now is get tons of viewers to take TGL seriously. Shrinking the game of golf is something Mike McCarley, founder and CEO of TMRW Sports, began thinking about long before he came up with the concept for TGL. He cut his teeth at NBC Sports starting in 2000, working on broadcasts for Sunday Night Football and the Olympics and making big sporting events even bigger for a more appealing television presentation. The challenge, always, was doing the same for obscure sports with rules that large audiences probably don’t understand well. That was especially true with the Olympics, when activities like curling come under the spotlight. By the time McCarley had taken over the Golf Channel in 2011, he began wondering if there was a better TV experience for a sport played on yawning courses over several days. “I always talked about keeping one foot in the tradition of the game and the other foot trying to take the sport into the future,” says McCarley. Three things happened that brought his vision to life. The first occurred about 10 years ago, when McCarley linked up with Ryan Dotters, the CEO of Full Swing, a top designer of golf simulators. McCarley picked the company to set up its simulator inside a studio at the channel, a place that could be used for instruction. The next happened during the pandemic, when he was able to follow Woods around a largely abandoned golf course, something that had never happened in tournaments unthreatened by the specter of an airborne virus. People usually just staked out one spot on the course and only saw snippets of their favorite golfers. Put the game inside, though, and golfers don’t have to walk, which means fans get to see every shot, from the tee to the final putt. “I always talked about keeping one foot in the tradition of the game and the other foot trying to take the sport into the future,” says McCarley. What he required, however, was the screen. And in the middle of 2022, he found his answer. Through Dotters he met Andrew Macaulay, then the chief technology officer of Topgolf. The pair convened in Sweden—incidentally, an ideal test facility for indoor golf, because who plays in subzero temperatures? There Macaulay set up a large hanging canvas, roughly the size of a movie-theater screen, onto which a projector displayed one of Full Swing’s simulated courses. Then they started hitting golf balls from 35 yards away. The number was special: As Macaulay had learned during his tenure at Topgolf, that’s the exact distance necessary to get enough data from a golf ball’s flight path to accurately predict where it will land in a virtual environment. It also benefits golfers. A view from behind the camera showing the ESPN commentators desk in front of the SoFi Center course. “They could actually start to see the shape of the ball before it hit the screen,” McCarley says. Even before this early proof of concept, McCarley already had buy-in from the sport’s biggest ambassadors: Woods, McIlroy, and the PGA Tour itself. He took his first meeting with Woods in January 2021. At the end of 90 minutes, he and Woods were on the same page about leaning into a technology that could grow the game. “I think this is going to work,” McCarley recalls him saying. He told McCarley he would help develop the league and be one of the players—as long as McCarley threw all his weight behind it. He already had. He quit his job and founded TMRW Sports. (Pronounce it “tomorrow.”) TGL is its first project; Woods and McIlroy are cofounders. In late November, I flew to Palm Beach Gardens to get an early look at how a TGL match would play out. SoFi Center was still in the middle of construction, but the playing area—with the field, the green, and the screen—was set up. Seeing the screen was enough to know why PGA golfers could be convinced to try arena golf. It’s five stories tall, 24 times bigger than the standard 16-by-9 version. I watched Fleetwood, McIlroy, and Morikawa launch tee shots at the thing over several days, and each player was more in awe than the last. “This is insane,” Morikawa told me. “It’s what I want my backyard to look like.” Driving practice brought into stark focus one of the biggest changes in TGL: no caddies. Players use TV monitors by their benches that run simulator software. It allows them to drag and drop where they’d like to aim their ball. As they get closer to the hole, the course image displayed on the large screen shifts correspondingly. This is where the mics on the players gets interesting. They talk strategy with one another instead of with a caddy. The three-on-three nature of every contest means that each player has to leave a ball where their teammate can get it closer to the green. Players who can’t drive the ball the farthest tend to avoid teeing off on holes that are much longer than anything they’d encounter in the real world. When teams finally make it over to the rotating, undulating green, all three players go. Guys who would normally compete against each other on the PGA Tour are suddenly working together to decipher the curves and dips that might befall their ball en route to the cup. “The triples format, from what I saw, was really cool because everyone’s involved,” Morikawa told me a little over a month later, once the season began and he had an opportunity to watch the opening match and see theory become practice. As for the screen itself, Macaulay says they first tried bullet-resistant Kevlar, but golf balls zooming at close to 200 mph tore right through it. The screen they have instead is multilayered material. The front layer, which displays the course image, is produced by a company called Dazian out of South Hackensack, New Jersey. It’s like what you’d see on a rinky-dink simulator screen in the rec room of a city condo complex, except these unpixelated images are generated by nine state-of-the-art projectors. The middle layer provides elasticity. Behind both layers is a vinyl backing that almost resembles the sail of an old wooden frigate. This layer not only ensures that golf balls don’t leave unsightly dents all over the front screen; it also makes it so that balls drop straight to the ground instead of ricocheting back into a golfer’s face. “The scale is the thing for me that blows my mind,” McIlroy said during a TGL preview show on ABC just after the new year. “Every time I step in here, I’m just blown away by the size of the screen.” Big, big names own these TGL teams. Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox, is the primary proprietor of TGL’s Boston Common Golf team, which counts McIlroy as one of its foursome. Meanwhile, Arthur Blank—billionaire cofounder of Home Depot and owner of the Atlanta Falcons—threw his monetary muscle into starting TGL’s Atlanta team. Yet the Los Angeles Golf Club won the initial bid to become the league’s first franchise, largely because that’s the way Ohanian wanted it. (In addition to being insanely tall, Ohanian is very competitive.) And he had something of a leg up: He sat on the board of directors for Woods’s nonprofit and fielded the golf legend’s call just as TGL was getting off the ground. What would a guy from the world of tech start-ups and venture capital think of a digital golf league? “He said to me, ‘I want this to exist in the world because I know what it’s going to do for the sport,’” Ohanian recalls. “Tiger Woods tells you that, and you’re like, let’s fucking go to war.” Ohanian won’t share the exact amount he shelled out in the end, but he admits it was somewhere between $25 million and $100 million. Lest one doubt his aptitude or passion, one should know that Ohanian, who grew up in Maryland, spent his childhood as a fan of the Washington you-know-whos. “I suffered under the cruel hands of Dan Snyder for decades,” he tells me. “And most of my decisions as a team owner, I often think, What would Dan do? And then I do the opposite.” His all-black Cybertruck, the third one off the lot, is emblazoned in the rear with the LAGC logo. (In a serendipitous turn, the LA squad also became the first team to make the playoffs, in a come-from-behind overtime victory on February 24. Morikawa sunk the decisive putt to tie the match, executed a rather Woods-like fist pump, and then chucked his golf ball to a fan in the stands. Their outcome in the playoffs, however, was surely less than desirable, as they lost their match to finish third in the standings on the year.) Tiger Woods being projected on a screen as he enters the SoFi Center with Jupiter Links. At five in the evening on the second Tuesday of January, I returned to the now completed SoFi Center for the second contest of the 2025 season. It would be Woods’s Jupiter Links Golf Club, with Max Homa and Kevin Kisner in tow, against Morikawa and his boys from LAGC, Justin Rose and Sahith Theegala. (Alas, Fairway Jesus was sitting out.) Since November, when I first met Morikawa and Fleetwood, I had been intermittently checking in with the LA team as they prepped for their season opener. When I walked into the arena, its composition reminded me of the Wells Fargo Center, where I go to see the Philadelphia 76ers rip my heart out every year. There’s a store for fan gear, a small copy of the same arena green for attendees to try out, concession stands, a “clubhouse” bar for people with fat wallets, and a seating arrangement in the shape of a horseshoe—one that gives anyone, anywhere lines of sight to both the simulator screen and the putting green that bookend the playing field. “You can see every single shot from every single player, all happening live right in front of you,” says McCarley. Maybe one of the coolest features is at the top of the arena. The two tee boxes have three fields of play, with real grass for the fairway and the rough, and a square of the same sand used at Augusta National for long bunker shots. Chew up enough divots, and golfers need fresh grass—which is grown just outside the arena. From the ceiling hang two monorail tracks. Before every match, maintenance crews haul in and drop new squares of fairway and rough, especially useful as the inaugural season proceeded. (On Presidents Day, TGL put on a triple-header, with matches at 1, 4, and 7 p.m. Squares were swapped before each one. No one wants to tee off on hand-me-down grass.) Not long after I showed up, the first fans started walking in. Quickly it transformed into a land of quarter-zips and khakis, polo shirts and white New Balance sneakers. A mix of bros and business class began filing into their seats. I took a breath and swore I smelled the aroma of new money—and Olipop prebiotic soda. It occurred to me that the Manning brothers might rejoice in such a paradise, and then I remembered that Eli Manning is a minority owner of the New York Golf Club. President Donald Trump’s challenger in the primaries, DeSantis, came in shortly after 6 p.m. to watch warm-ups. He was soon hobnobbing with Woods right on the field. When DJ Khaled walked in, a TGL employee snapped a photo of us as I suppressed a rabid urge to dap him up while smooth-talking “another one” right in his face. Before Woods took the field of play for the opening tee, I got a look inside the production truck, where Jeff Neubarth—formerly of ESPN, Turner Sports, and Callaway Sports—takes command not only of what people in the arena see on the high-def monitors, but also of all the action that viewers see back home. There are 73 different cameras at his disposal: a sky cam like you’d see at an NFL game, multiple cameras embedded on the field itself, a robot cam on wheels, and even a camera that sits directly at the top of the simulator screen. By the Presidents Day triple-header, there were rotating cameras inside the flagsticks on the green. “You want to take people where they haven’t been,” he says. I realized, though, that being at the match itself meant I would miss the dialogue between players, as their live-mic conversations are not streamed over loudspeakers during the match. Sure, it’s a thrill seeing some of golf’s best players live in front of you. But I wouldn’t hear what they were saying to one another. Whatever tactics they were discussing on the field I had to try to infer based on their body language. (A buddy who watched TGL told me that it’s “made for TV,” an observation that probably doesn’t bug TGL’s leadership.) Shortly after 7 p.m., we break away from Scott Van Pelt, the host of all these TGL broadcasts, and go directly to the picture on the field. Roger Steele, the in-venue emcee for the league, stands mid-arena to make the player introductions. The LA players walk on to the Tupac classic “California Love.” Homa and Kisner make their way in. And then in walks Woods. On his way to the playing field, he low-fives Will Lowery, podcast host ofBeyond the Fairwayand team ambassador for Jupiter Links. “You ready for this?!” Woods calls out. I split from the truck to make my way back into the arena, and it’s pure pandemonium. The field of play is awash in red light. Fans are hollering and whistling from their seats. Neon strobes are going crazy, which I had expected once I was told the guy who does TGL’s lighting is the former lighting director of the WWE. Finally, Woods walks out to the tee box to lead off the match with a 376-yard par 4. Right at the start, the game’s greatest throws a curveball. Woods looks back at his teammates with a small smile on his face and then whips the hammer towel out of his back pocket. Like an NFL coach throwing the red challenge flag, he holds it at arm’s length and drops it on the field. Because he threw it before his tee shot, it’s enforced automatically. It’s not hard to deduce the savvy reasons for chucking a hammer. Maybe you’ve been hitting great from the tee all night. Maybe you’re walking to the green going for birdie—you might as well drop the orange towel, hope the other team accepts, and then putt like your life depended on it in order to win the hole and get the points. Then, of course, there’s the other reason for deploying the hammer: The instant it hit the arena green, the crowd cheered almost as loudly as when they saw Woods emerge from the tunnel. Soon DJ Irie was spinning the favorite song of people who favor obnoxiously large pants. Slices of “U Can’t Touch This” began mixing with the cacophony of the arena environment: shouts, applause, the twisting of tops of aluminum-bottled Dasani, the sweet, sweet clinking sound that emerges when a titanium driver impacts a golf ball, the looks of disapproval from Charlie Woods whenever Dad misses a putt. Players from the Jupiter Links at the SoFi Center. By the time the two teams made it onto the green for the first hole, LA didn’t even bother making Woods putt because they knew the ball was going in. The team conceded the putt instead. Although the points didn’t go to Jupiter Links. The hole ended in a tie, because even if Woods had sunk the putt, both teams would’ve hit the same number of shots. Tied holes are still a thing. Golf traditionalists, breathe easy. As the match progressed, I could tell the vibe I got from inside the arena was undoubtedly different from the at-home viewing experience. Fans mugged for the in-arena cameras (like people do during NBA games) and cheered wildly. “This is siiick” seemed to be spectators’ unofficial motto of the evening. (I heard it dozens of times.) And, unlike what golf stereotypes might suggest, no one I saw was slowly being lulled into a state of somnolence. Taking a nap would’ve been hard anyway: During one commercial break, the music kicked up loud and Steele ran onto the field and got the crowd moving in a wave back and forth to a mash-up of techno and “Seven Nation Army.” At one point I was taken upstairs to the TGL owners’ box and spotted DJ Khaled watching from the front row. To my chagrin, the better angels of my nature won out, and I refrained from belting out an a cappella version of “All I Do Is Win.” Still, regardless of all the excitement inside the arena, I did wonder how TV ratings were faring. When I met up with Ohanian in his owners’ box, where I politely declined the cake pop hors d’oeuvre offered to me, the match was 8 to 1 in favor of LAGC, who would end up winning 12 to 1. I had heard from some TGL folks that viewership dropped off during the opening match of the season, where the final score was 9 to 2, with people tuning out once the outcome had become a foregone conclusion. Would the same thing happen as the season went on, or would more people along the way discover the league and start watching? (Later I learned that viewership hovers, on average, around 610,000. Of the 10 matches that aired in prime time on ESPN, viewership eclipsed 800,000.) “There is a scenario where no one watches,” Ohanian had told me before tonight. “But Tiger Woods alone is worthy of a pilgrimage multiple times a year. And you never bet against Tiger Woods.” Even, so it seems, in a losing contest. Because if you tuned out early, you missed one of the most exciting plays of the evening: At the 14th hole, with Los Angeles leading 10 to 1, it was Kisner’s turn to try to sink a putt. His ball had landed in a bunker and so was placed in one of the three located on the rotating green. He stepped into the sand with his wedge, sized up his shot, and then made contact. The ball flew straight at the pin, bounced off, and launched through the air. Kisner looked up, smiling, almost unable to believe what he did. Morikawa fell down from laughing so hard. And even through the ruckus erupting from the arena crowd, which hadn’t thinned out at all, I heard Woods giggling uncontrollably and realized that’s why I was here. I was getting something I would never see: one of the greatest to ever play, just out with his boys, having a good time, entertaining thousands and thousands of people who will never watch him the way they did tonight.

    "title": "The 25 Best Shows on Netflix to Watch in May",
    "article_text": "We’ve all been overwhelmed by streaming TV choices, only to give up and watch something we’ve already seen. But this curated list of the best shows on Netflix is here to narrow down your decision-making and help you figure outexactlywhich titles you want to sample next. Sara Rowell (Betty Gilpin) has fled the comforts of city life in Philadelphia to set off for Utah with her young son, Devin (Preston Mota). And while life is perilous foreveryone on the frontier—it’s 1857, and control of the region is under dispute by settlers from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, representatives of the US government, and multiple Indigenous tribes—Sara can’t change her mind and go back to where she came from, as she’s wanted for murder. A brutal massacre at a settlers camp throws her together with Isaac Reed (Taylor Kitsch), a resourceful survivor who maintains close ties with the Shoshone tribespeople who raised him. Soon, various factions are crisscrossing the territory, many keeping their criminal intentions from the marks they think they can dominate. It can be a brutal watch, but it’s also one of Netflix’s most gripping series. This true crime dramatization tellsthe story of Belle Gordon(Kaitlyn Dever), who launched a healthy living app and wrote a cookbook while living with brain cancer…or was she? We watch Belle’s story unravel from the perspectives of several characters. There’s Milla (Alycia Debnam-Carey), the wellness blogger she idolized and eventually creeped out with her excessive familiarity. There’s Chanelle (Aisha Dee), the strategist whose close contact with Belle made her suspect she could be a fraud. And there’s Justin (Mark Coles Smith), the journalist Chanelle contacts with Belle’s story—and who’s already connected to it through his wife Lucy (Tilda Cobham-Hervey), a fan of Belle’s who’s been following her during her own cancer journey. Belle’s audacity and the height she reaches before her fall make this one of the most bingeable true-crime stories on Netflix. Héctor Belascoarán Shayne (Luis Gerardo Méndez) is an engineer with a beautiful wife and a handsome home…but his soul yearns for something different. So he sends away for a course to learn how to become a private detective—although, as the son of leftist political activists, he is careful to tell everyone whose path he crosses that he is actually anindependentinvestigator. And in 1970s Mexico City, there are plenty of people who could use help but might not get it through official legal channels. Each episode is a self-contained mystery, so if you’ve already run through all ofColumboandPoker Faceon Peacock and are looking for a new show about a detective who’s kind of a mess—and not a cop—this could be your next Netflix binge. Nick KrollandAndrew Goldbergwent through puberty together as middle school friends, went into comedy as adults…and then, withMark LevinandJennifer Flackett,cocreated this animated sitcom. About kids but not reallyforthem,Big Mouthhas become one of the most outrageous comedies on Netflix by delving into such sensitive topics as first periods, masturbation, and sexual identity. It also uses the filthiest words you’ve ever heard (and some you possibly haven’t) for body parts and fluids. The voice cast features Kroll in roles as varied as protagonist Nick Birch, his classmate Lola, their coach Steve, and a Hormone Monster named Maury; you’ll also hearJohn Mulaney, Fred Armisen,andMaya Rudolph,among many others—including, starting in season four,Ayo Edebiri.The eighth and final season drops May 23. Comedy writerCharlie Brookerstepped out of his primary genre for this sci-fi anthology series. In the style ofThe Twilight Zone,each episode tells a self-contained story, generally about a dystopian application or evolution of technology we are familiar with. (The titleBlack Mirrorrefers to the look of a TV, computer, or phone screen when it’s turned off.) What if you lived in a bunker and pedaled a stationary bike for hours on end to earn “merits” for your food and entertainment? Could a computer simulation allow our consciousness to outlast our physical form? What if a popular streaming platform eavesdropped on your phone calls and turned your life into a drama series starring a CGISalma Hayek? These are just a few questions raised overBlack Mirror’s run, which continues this month: Season seven dropped last month. Watch six seasons ofBlack Mirroron Netflix If FX’sShōgungripped you last year, maybe you’re in the market for another Japanese historical epic to fill the time until season two.Maya Erskinevoices Mizu, a female warrior whose mother disguised her as a boy for protection during her childhood. As an adult, Mizu has continued posing as a man in order to pursue a revenge plot against several men who illegally remained in Japan after the Tokugawa shogunate closed its borders…and one of those men is her father. Other voice performers includeGeorge Takei, Brenda Song,andNever Have I Ever’sDarren Barnet.The show is undoubtedly one of the most visually arresting adult animation shows on Netflix. For its first three seasons,Borgenfollowed the rise, fall, and rise again of Birgitte Nyborg (Sidse Babett Knudsen), a center-left politician in the Danish parliament who, at the beginning of the series, shocks the country and herself by becoming prime minister. Viewers thrilled to stories about Birgitte forming coalitions with like-minded parties, smoothly defending her policies in combative TV interviews, and supporting her teen daughter through a mental health crisis. In 2022, nearly 10 years afterBorgen’s third-season finale, a fourth season—retitledBorgen: Power & Glory—premiered on Netflix. Now a menopausal Birgitte is foreign minister (comparable to secretary of state) to Signe Kragh (Johanne Louise Schmidt), a younger prime minister addicted to girlboss posturing on social media. We join them in time for the first big clash in their professional relationship, as a major oil deposit is discovered in Greenland, a self-governing country that is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. The news causes conflict among the Greenlandic residents who would like to realize the economic benefits of extracting the oil; the Danes who would also like to stake their claim on it; and environmental activists, including Birgitte’s son, who oppose fossil fuel extraction. The season isn’t based on any specific true story…but maybe you feel now would be a good time to learn more about Greenland, for no particular reason. Life can be rough in late ’50s Poplar, a disadvantaged neighborhood in London’s East End. But while struggling residents must endure deprivations of all kinds—unethical landlords, insecure employment, open racism for new immigrants of color—one boon they can count on is top-notch medical care. Working with the UK’s National Health Service, an order of Anglican nuns—assisted by several secular nurse-midwives—provide pre- and post-natal care to Poplar families; as the series has progressed through more than 10 seasons (and counting!), it’s also moved forward in time to show characters dealing with limb differences caused by Thalidomide; an outbreak of diphtheria; and the introduction of the pill. No less an eminence thanVanessa Redgravenarrates. The attention to detail on the period design, the understated performances, and the thoughtful portrayal of complex issues make this one of the best TV shows on Netflix. The 13th season—the show’s latest, with more to come in the future—has just been added to the platform. (Warning for anyone suffering from American health insurance—or suffering in America without it: the care depicted on this show may cause intense jealousy.) Forty years ago, Lucille LaRusso (Randee Heller) moved her son, Daniel (Ralph Macchio), from Newark to the Los Angeles suburb of Reseda. There, Daniel found out the hard way that Valley bullies didn’t play; in fact, they also had real fighting skills honed under toxic sensei John Kreese (Martin Kove) at his Cobra Kai dojo. Eventually, Daniel hooks up with Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) to learn karate and face off against his main antagonist, Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka), at a local competition. The feature filmThe Karate Kidwas followed by three sequels, a remake, and, finally, a series, which picks up with Daniel and Johnny in middle age. Since their fraught teen years, things have changed: Johnny is now an underdog scraping together a living as a handyman, while Daniel is the Valley’s most successful car dealer. Karate is still the main preoccupation ofeveryonein the region, but now it’s Daniel’s and Johnny’s kids—biological as well as ad hoc—who are learning how to use it against one amother. The show is unserious in the very best way, and both Zabka and Macchio are clearly having the time of their lives. The final five episodes (before a new feature film comes to theaters in May) dropped in February. Forget, if you can,the scandalthat caused 2018’sRoseannerevival to come to an abrupt end: everyone else who worked on the show without being hateful were allowed to continue working on a version ofRoseannewithoutRoseanne.The series premiere directly follows the offscreen death of the titular character who spawned it, and portrays how her husband Dan (John Goodman), sister Jackie (Laurie Metcalf), and daughters Becky (Alicia Goranson) and Darlene (Sara Gilbert) go on without her. (Becky and Darlene’s brother,Michael Fishman’s D.J. also appears sporadically for the first few seasons.) After the conclusions ofShameless,Mom,andSuperstore,The Connersis one of the last working-class sitcoms on TV, and very much worth your time. The seventh and final season recently concluded on ABC. Among his many other credits, writerPeter Morganhas defined himself as an interpreter of current events, fromThe Special Relationship(aboutTony BlairandBill Clinton) toFrost/Nixon(about the televised interviews the former conducted with the latter), with many stops in between. WhenThe Queen,about the eponymous monarch’s reaction to the death of Princess Diana, became a critical and awards sensation, a series follow-up about the royal family was the obvious next step. From 2016 to 2023,The Crownchronicled the entire professional life of Queen Elizabeth II, starting just before her coronation and extending into the adulthood of her most famous grandchildren.The Crownis one of the most controversial titles on Netflix—particularly if you ask a member of the family being portrayed—and it’s also one of the most lavish. If the royal family, including current members and those who have departed, has been on your news feed lately, this might tide you over between updates. Justin Simienhad an indie hit in 2014 as the writer-director of the feature filmDear White People,following students of color at a predominantly white Ivy League college; he returned to the story in 2017, adapting his own work into a series that became one of the best dramedies on Netflix.Logan Browningstars as Samantha White, who delivers hard truths to her classmates via her college radio show, from which the series derives its name;Brandon P. Bellreprises his film role of all-American Troy Fairbanks; andGiancarlo Esposito—who recently debuted as a key cast member onThe Residence,also on Netflix—serves as narrator for the first three (of four) seasons. Producer-directorJung Jong-yeonwould already be a reality TV legend if all he’d done wasThe Genius, a fiendishly complex game of skill, strategy, and insight. But we’re lucky he’s gone from fiendish to diabolical withThe Devil’s Plan, a new show that will hopefully return for more seasons. Twelve extremely impressive contestants—including an MIT-trained lawyer, a professional poker player who studies biology on the side, and an actor-slash-inventor with an MSc in evolutionary psychology—face off in tests of their intelligence. But there’s a social game too. If you’re tired of American competition shows that feel the same year after year, give this brain-breaker a shot. Season two premieres May 6. After Denise (Lisa Bonet), the second-eldest sibling onThe Cosby Show,graduated high school, she moved on to Hillman College, a fictional HBCU located in Virginia. There, she met roommates Jaleesa (Dawnn Lewis), a recent divorcée enrolled as a mature student, and Maggie (Marisa Tomei), a sweet and daffy military brat. Other students in her orbit include Southern belle and Hillman legacy Whitley (Jasmine Guy), after whose family Denise’s dorm is named, and Dwayne Wayne (Kadeem Hardison), a math genius with a crush on Denise. Bonet departed the show (eventually turning up for a later-season guest spot) when she became pregnant, and series creatorBill Cosbyforbade her characterfrom also carrying a pregnancy to term as an unmarried woman. (In retrospect, who better to be an arbiter of morality?) But the show continued for five more seasons, welcoming in new students played byCharnele Brown, Cree Summer,andJada Pinkett,not yet Smith. ReadLeah Faye Cooper’sVForal historyto find out how this show became one of the most important sitcoms of its day. In the late ’90s and early ’00s, pop groups were routinely assembled not through organic connections and shared musical influences, but because the members wanted to be famous and managers wanted to make money off them. So it was with the Girls5eva, who had an entire rise and fall in a matter of months. Decades later, a chance sample by a new artist brings Dawn (Sara Bareilles), Wickie (Renée Elise Goldsberry), Summer (Busy Philipps), and Gloria (Paula Pell) back together, and they decide to try for a comeback. While this comedy’s first two seasons aired on Peacock, Netflix now has the entire run—including the third season, which premiered last year. You will need all your faculties to make sure you see and hear every gag in this extremely joke-dense show—hands down one of the funniest sitcoms on Netflix. Watch three seasons ofGirls5evaon Netflix Three Michigan moms—sisters Beth (Christina Hendricks) and Annie (Mae Whitman), plus Ruby (Retta), their friend since all three were teens—run into pressing financial difficulties at the same time. What if they solved all their problems at once by robbing the supermarket where Annie works? It seems like a winning plan, until they find out the store is entangled in a complex criminal operation—and that the only way they can avoid disaster is to get recruited to work in it themselves. Treat yourself to four seasons of one of the best crime dramedies on Netflix. And, if you wish, turn on NBC to check outGrosse Pointe Garden Society,from the same creators. Hilda (voice ofBella Ramsey,now back forseason two ofThe Last Of Uson HBO) used to live in a forest cabin with her mother Johanna (Daisy Haggard) and deerfox Twig. Then that home was destroyed, so the family moved to the walled city of Trolberg. Hilda soon finds out that the city is full of unusual characters—including a bureaucratic elf named Alfur (Rasmus Hardiker), who becomes a friend. If your kids need a break fromBluey,give this, one of the best family series on Netflix, a shot. If you don’t have kids, you might still enjoy its beautiful animation and soothing rhythms. The third and final season premiered in December 2023. Watch three seasons ofHildaon Netflix Originally an Australian program (which isalso available to streamon Netflix),Love on the Spectrumhas much in common with other unscripted dating shows. Participants are looking for love, and since their searches have not been successful, they’ve sought expert coaching on how they might proceed differently. However, this show differs from the majority with participants who are on the autism spectrum, meaning they may face specific challenges that neurotypical people don’t. Portraying its daters without condescension,Love on the Spectrumis one of the sweetest reality shows on Netflix—and a brand-new seasonpremiered in April. For every short season of what is practically an event series,David Letterman—the original host of bothLate NightandLate Show—curates a tiny group of guests and spends an entire episode with each for an in-depth conversation. Past visitors includeTina Fey,Howard Stern,andBarack Obama,giving his first talk show interview after leaving office. The rhythms are definitely different from what you’re used to seeing with Letterman, but it’s still a joy to watch one of the greats. A new season five episode dropped in April.

In his version, Tom Ripley (Andrew Scott) is running short cons in New York when a PI named Alvin McCarron (Bokeem Woodbine) approaches him with an invitation to meet shipbuilder Herbert Greenleaf (Kenneth Lonergan). Only when one of Ripley’s go-to scams goes awry does he make contact, subsequently finding out that Greenleaf wants to send him to Italy to convince his wastrel son, Dickie (Johnny Flynn), to come back to America. That might have been a solid plan—if Greenleaf had done just a little more due diligence on this freelancer.

    "title": "The Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson Love Story",
    "article_text": "Bill Belichickfamously led the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl wins during a historic 24-year-run. But someone else appeared to call the shots for the 73-year-old coach during his recentCBS News Sunday Morninginterview: his 24-year-old girlfriend,Jordon Hudson. During an otherwise benign segment about his forthcoming memoirThe Art of Winning: Lessons From My Life in Football,Belichick was asked byTony Dokoupilhow he met Hudson. “Not talking about this,” she interjected from the producer’s table, sounding more like a manager or publicist than a romantic interest. Dokoupil turned to respond to Hudson rather than the subject of his interview. “No?” “No,” she confirmed. Hudson is seen watching the interview with sunglasses perched on her head and a scowl on her face. Dokoupil noted in voiceover that “Jordon was a constant presence during our interview.” This wasn’t the first time that their relationship, and 49-year age gap, has been the subject of viral headlines. Hudson has been playing an increasing role in Belichick’s personal and professional lives after she debuted their relationship on her Instagram page last October. Since then, the 24-year-old pageant contestant, former cheerleader, and licensed cosmetologist appeared with Belichick inBen Affleck’s Super Bowl commercial. She was dubbed his “creative muse” in the credits of his new book.The Athleticreported earlier this month that she has told the University of North Carolina, where Belichick is now head football coach, how to handle certain press situations, after Belichick asked that the former social media ambassador be copied on his emails. And she recently launched a new company, Trouble Cub Enterprises, of which she is the CEO. So far, according toPeople,she has filed 14 trademarks related to famous Belichick sayings including “No Days Off” and “Do Your Job.” “If successful,” wroteThe Cutlast month, “the filings would allow for Belichik—and presumably Hudson—to profit directly off of any merchandise created with the phrases.” The company is currently hiring an executive assistant for Hudson—a job listing on LinkedIn advertises an annual salary range between $80,000 and $150,000 and stipulates that applicants must be “comfortable working with high-status personnel.” They met in 2021, when Belichickreportedlysigned her textbook while the two were seated together on a plane. (In February, Hudson trumpeted the couple’s four-year “meetiversary” on Twitter: “Cheers to the fact that you still let me give you lengthy philosophical lectures.”) They did not begin dating until the former coach had broken up withLinda Holliday,Belichick’s girlfriend of 16 years and a former sports correspondent forStyle Boston,according toTMZ.The coach was previously married toDebby Clarke,the mother of his three adult children, for nearly 30 years. Belichick and Hudson’s romance bloomed in full view last year, months after he and the New England Patriots parted ways following a historic 24-year partnership. Patriots ownerRobert Kraftexplained in asubsequent interviewone of the reasons he had to “fire” Belichick: “I had given him so much power. He had full control over everything. And shame on me, I should’ve had some checks and balances.” (Belichick maintains the parting was mutual.) The gruff coach’s seeming power reversal with his girlfriend has reportedly been surprising to Belichick’s inner circle: “This guy is known as being such a strong voice and in many ways autocratic—and here he is becoming mush in her hands and letting her direct everything,” one person toldPage Six. “She is so much younger, so inexperienced and so lacking in perspective and professionalism.” Another insider speaking to the same outlet called the relationship “alarming” and described Hudson as “a runaway train.” Last fall, the usually reserved coach joined social media—a surprise given he has spoken about his complete disinterest in the medium. Belichick acknowledged this inhis first post: “I am (surprisingly) thrilled to announce my decision to utilize social media platforms.… This debut was inconceivable a few months ago, but exciting now!!” In December 2024, Belichickinkeda lucrative deal to become the head football coach at the University of North Carolina. Months earlier, he went Instagram official with his nearly college-age girlfriend. She curated her own view of the coach dubbed the Greatest of All Time on Instagram to her growing audience. In March 2025, she posted avideoof the legendary coach flat on his back on a beach in Florida, hoisting the former cheerleader in an airplane pose. Underneath the caption, “My favorite workout?#Billates,” one user posted, “What the hell happened to coach bro?” Another added, “His strength is better than most his age.” This April, Hudson wished “the happiest of birthdays to mytwin flame” in a carousel featuring a photo of Belichick feeding her cake. On Halloween, Jordan posted aphotoof Belichick holding a fishing rod and her in a mermaid’s tail and pearl bodice, staged to look like he caught her. “Ouch,” was the caption. Per her Instagram, she was an overachiever in high school—commuting to cosmetology classes at night while also working as a henna tattoo artist, modeling, and cheerleading. In 2019, the same year Belichick led the Patriots to their most recent Super Bowl win, she reminisced about the year prior when she reserved her Saturdays for “homework and chores.” This past Valentine’s Day, Hudson shared aphotoof herself draped over Belichick in a revealing silver gown. Both parties posed with their championship rings—his from his eight total Super Bowl wins, andhersfrom her days with BSU Cheerleading. The same week, Hudson reportedly emailed the University of North Carolina. “Is there anyone monitoring the UNC Football page for slanderous commentary and subsequently deleting it/blocking users that are harassing BB in the comments?” she wrote, according to theThe Athletic. Belichick chimed in on the chain: “I cannot believe that UNC would support my being called a ‘predator.’” On another Instagram post, beneath a photo of a jacket she had made in Belichick’s honor, she wrote, “And yes, it is ironic that I went from never having watched a professional American football game, ever, to meticulously creating an honor piece for this guy. Funny how much things change in time, don’t ya think?” She alsoposteda flier of a charity event she coordinated, called “Not Untouched: Awareness Dinner Hosted by Jordon Hudson,” at a New Orleans steakhouse. In the bottom left corner, it was noted that Belichick would offer photos and signatures. On Tuesday, Hudson [posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJCLV9BAjXS/?img_index=1) a screenshot of an email Belichick sent about what he viewed as sensational press around his book last April: “I am not going to be the conductor of a hype train in the book promotion—we have enough hype to work with.” After theCBS News Sunday Morningsfiasco,TMZreportedthat people at UNC “are now concerned about Hudson’s influence on Belichick’s tenure as the head football coach in Chapel Hill…especially with her, essentially, taking on a role as his manager.” (Vanity Fairhas reached out to Belichick and Hudson for comment.) AsTMZ’s source put it, there’s a “growing sense this could become a problem.”",

    "title": "Andor’s Adria Arjona: Bix’s Redemption Is “So Much More Complex Than Revenge”",
    "article_text": "Andorhas certainly put Bix Caleen (Adria Arjona) through it. She’s arguably the person who set theStar Warsseries’ events into motion by linkingher love interest, Cassian(Diego Luna), with the Rebellion’s grand architect, Luthen (Stellan Skarsgård). Since then, she has been tortured by Empire-sanctioned interrogator Dr. Gorst (Joshua James);more recently, she narrowly staved off an attempted sexual assault by an Imperial lieutenant. In season two’s episodes four through six, which premiered Tuesday on Disney+, she moves into a hideout apartment with Cassian on the planet of Coruscant—finally able to experience a period of sustained romance with her partner, if also still struggling to overcome her trauma. She can’t sleep. She’s battling addiction. She wants to help out with the Rebellion, but is fighting to make it another day. Arjona’s visceral portrayal of Bix’s inner torment reaches a turning point at the end of episode six, which sees her get her payback. She lures Dr. Gorst into a trap before hooking him up to the same interrogation machine—that is, torture device—that he subjected her to in season one. Both emotionally and literally, Bix sees the light here—a new dawn for herself. Episode six’s final seconds reveal Cassian waiting for her outside, indicating that they pulled off this gambit together—and are now ready to move forward. Arjona had been eagerly awaiting this cliff-hanger, which lands at the midpoint ofAndor’s final season. “It makes me feel really emotional because it’s our goodbye season, but it also feels right,” she says on this week’sLittle Gold Men.(Read our conversation below, and stay tuned for audio excerpts.) “We’re leaving with a fucking bang. Sorry that I cursed, but we are, because everyone just really brought it this season.” Vanity Fair:I know you are given a sense of your character’s arc in advance, but still, what was it like first reading Bix get her revenge at the end of episode six? Adria Arjona:[Series creator]Tony Gilroybelieves that information is power; he doesn’t believe that withholding information is power. So like you said, he pretty much gave me my whole season arc right when season one ended. I had a little bit of time to digest, but that still doesn’t remove the fact of actually having to perform it. In season one, Bix is trying desperately to come back to her own, to that person that we all met in season one, episode one—so when I read that turning point for her here, it was like I finally got something for Bix to fight back. Just to press that button, to have that release, was incredible. Adria Arjona and Diego Luna inAndor. In this batch of three episodes, Bix is struggling while fighting to find a way forward. It ends with her doing just that, and with Cassian in lockstep with her. How did you see her getting to that point? With everything that happens with her and Dr. Gorst, in the [season’s] first three episodes, you really understand how much she’s struggling with these nightmares. She’s sleep-deprived. By the time you get to four, five, and six, you see her coping with these nightmares in a very different way. She’s addicted to these droppers because she desperately wants to get better and wants to be a part of this rebellion and have a say—to have some importance with Cassian and Luthen. She feels good enough to be like, This is what’s going to make me feel better. Revenge is what’s going to cure me. These droppers couldn’t, escaping couldn’t. Our love helps, but Cassian’s in and out. There’s so much happening that she wants to be a part of. To give it back to Dr. Gorst was such a big redemption, but again, it’s Tony Gilroy—it’s so much more complex than revenge. She says at one point to Cassian in these episodes, “I can handle more than you think.” You’ve spoken really from the very beginning about how Bix is underestimated. Getting to this point with him, what was she trying to communicate—and what did she need from him? They support each other in a very beautiful way throughout these episodes. They never judge each other. They both believe that they’re a part of something greater. They believe in the cost; they believe in the Rebellion. What she means is, “Please don’t underestimate me. Please let me be a part of it because that’s what’s going to save me. Help me help myself.” It’s what she’s begging for. But at the same time, she’s in a very dark place and almost speaking like an addict. She’s like, “I can do it, just believe in me. Let me be a part of this.” At the climax of the sixth episode, Luthen calls out for a mission. Right before that, he talks with Cassian about how Bix is a potential liability. What do you make of that perception of her? Where is he at the end of the episode in terms of his feelings toward her? If I interpret it just as an actress, I go, Damn, she kind of is. He’s not wrong—like, if they only knew what she was doing behind closed doors and what she was hiding. Bix feels that the second [Luthen] comes in. He surprises her and she’s embarrassed and ashamed—the house is a mess. There’s so much shame in that scene for her. All she’s ever wanted was for Luthen to take her seriously and be like, “Come on, we’re going.” But she sees it. The second he walks in, Bix realizes, Oh, he’s here for something. And the second he stepped into this house, he changed his mind. I don’t know if she’s showered in a couple days. She’s definitely not cleaned the house, and that’s evident. He catches her. He’s very aware of what she’s doing, which brings yet even more shame. Solidifying this with Cassian—Cassian believing in her and believing that she’s not a liability, that she’s got it, that Bix is somewhere in there—means the world to her. She hopes to one day pay forward to him. Luthen also says to Cassian that it would’ve been more “interesting” if Bix didn’t tell Cassian that he stopped by and spoke with her. Why do you think shedoestell him? That’s an interesting question. It’s that beautiful trust that they both have. Bix has learned so much that at this point she’s like, I can’t keep bottling things up. I’ve got to tell him. Again, it’s shameful for her to even speak it out loud, but the way she tells Cassian is different. She’s like, “He wanted me to be a part of something.” She twists it a little bit, to see if Cassian thinks or believes what Luthen believes. But there’s also a part of me that goes, She loves Cassian, and she’s okay with showing her true self to him. It’s probably the only person she does that with. It’s so lovely to see you and Diego actually, finally get to play a real romance for a few episodes, however complicated. Can you talk a little bit about that? Diego’s so incredibly generous and so smart when approaching a scene, so I knew personally I was going to learn a lot. Bix finally gets to experience this love and this trust, and I think being from Ferrix and loyal being tattooed to her soul, experiencing this love with Cassian and going through this rebellion with a partner felt right. That dance sequence, that tribal ritual that they both perform solidifies everything, and it tells you so much about these two characters. Tony wanted a ritual. He wanted to showcase that these two characters were lived-in. They had experienced so much through life together, even way before, through childhood. And finally now they’re together. It was early on when filming season two, and I remember just being in this rehearsal space with Diego. Diego took over that scene in a very beautiful way and I trusted him, like Bix would trust him throughout the show. I blindly just followed him, and that was the starting point of who these characters were going to be this season. Diego has expressed his desire to tell the story of Cassian and Bix in the year we do not see, between seasons one and two. Are you with him? Do you want to do that? Look, I would love to do that at one point, maybe. I’m so excited for this season, and I’m so excited for the arc of these characters and where this season ends for every character. The journey that we all go through in the season is so precise and so beautiful that I’m at a place right now where my mind can’t wrap itself around that one-year gap. I don’t know what that year would be like, and I haven’t quite thought about it a lot. But yes, if Diego’s in, I’m always in. How did you approach Bix’s physicality and internal torment? Especially given the passage of time between these episode batches—each covers a year. It was a challenge, I’m not going to lie to you. I’ve never revisited a character, so I was so scared that I wasn’t going to be able to get back to her. The second that I put the costume on, it all came back. I saw myself in the mirror—her hair, her costume. The second you walk onto aStar Warsset, you’re like, Oh, I’m in. I’m here. Her mental state was one that I wanted to pay a lot of justice to. People deal through trauma differently, and I had all these questions for Tony: “What kind of woman is she? Is she someone that shoves things under the rug? Is she someone that powers through? Is she someone that asks for help?” The answer was, “A little bit of everything.” When you deal with trauma, every day is different. You have good days and bad days, and I really wanted to pay tribute to that. And Bix is dealing with all of this whilealsodealing with a whole rebellion happening right outside her front door. It was a lot to wrap my head around, but I was very cushioned coming back. Everybody from season one came back season two—meaning hair, makeup, art department. I felt protected and in a very safe space to go to the places that I had to go through, especially for episode three [in which Bix is assaulted] and showcasing the abuse of power inStar Wars.It felt important. Being addicted to droppers also felt really important and relevant. It was a big honor to be able to go there. Is there anything for you in just getting to play in different settings? Bix is a long way away from Ferrix, for now on Coruscant. But especially in this season, she’s on the move. Bix is the most Ferrixian woman in the world. [Laughs] She’s incredibly grounded and loyal, and she left her home. Maybe in the back of her mind, at one point, she was excited about the idea of leaving her home and fighting for what she believed in and being more involved in the cause and helping Cassian and Luthen. But the way she leaves is so heartbreaking. She didn’t get to say her goodbyes. She heard in the back what was going on with [Cassian’s mother] Maarva. Leaving a place that you love so dearly and then constantly fleeing—Bix is not grounded at all this season. Trying to find her footing is all she’s desperately trying to do throughout all these episodes. She’s constantly trying to find her place, and in episode four, five, and six, she’s still not where she wants to be. She almost feels like she’s in a little bit of a prison, being overprotected, and she wants to get out. Do you carry that at all, these experiences of trauma and feeling trapped? You do. There were moments where I felt frustrated for her. You go to these places and it’s all fictitious, but your nervous system doesn’t know. Certain parts stay with you, and you have to deal with them. Thank God, I’m very happy in my own life and I get to come home to something very different. Yeah, it feels a little bit like an adjustment. But in a way, that feels right. I’m feeling and going through it, and through Bix I learned so much. I learned to speak up and ask for help. And she’s just never a victim—I learned that from her as well. Her dignity as a Ferrixian woman is contagious. That bled into my life in a good way. In these three episodes, I don’t think you see Bix leave the Coruscant apartment until the very end, right? I know you’re not necessarily filming in order, but you can feel a real release in your performance, just in getting to a new place. Yeah, she’s in a city, she doesn’t know anybody there. She’s waiting for Cassian. She doesn’t feel productive in any way. Bix used to run her own shipyard and was outside constantly and moving. There was always purpose. To be in a place where every day is the same and repetitive, yeah, it’s incredibly depressing for her. By the time that she gets out, she walks every step with so much power to get to Dr. Gorst; by the time that she gets to him, it’s like, game on. We did film that in order. I was constantly on this very dark set and I didn’t see the sunlight. It’s from six in the morning until 6:00 or 7:00, winter in London. So you’re not seeing sunlight at all for days and days. To finally be able to film a scene and breathe fresh air felt really gratifying. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

The Centre for Health Protection on Tuesday revealed a case of a 47-year-old man who underwent an amputation of his left lower leg two days after developing a Group A Streptococcal infection, following acupuncture treatment he received at two traditional Chinese medicine clinics. The man developed a fever and left thigh pain on April 11 and subsequently sought care from a private hospital, where he was diagnosed with septic shock and necrotising fasciitis, commonly known as a “flesh-eating infection”. The man, who had underlying illnesses, was transferred to Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam the next day and underwent a left lower limb amputation on April 13. His clinical specimens tested positive for Group A Streptococcus. According to the centre, the man received acupuncture treatments on April 7, 9 and 10 from two registered traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in Sheung Wan and Causeway Bay.",

    "title": "Diabetes deaths fall to lowest levels in years, in early CDC figures",
    "article_text": "Watch CBS News Updated on:  April 30, 2025 / 10:07 AM EDT/ CBS News Diabetesdeaths in the U.S. have fallen to some of the lowest rates in years, according to new preliminary figures published by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, reversing a surge in mortality that was seen during theCOVID-19 pandemic. There were 26.4 deaths per 100,000 people from diabetes, according to early death certificatedatafor the third quarter of 2024 published this month by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Death rates from diabetes peaked in 2021, according to CDCfigures, at 31.1 deaths per 100,000 people for that year. Diabetes was the eighth leadingcause of deathin 2021. The CDC says the link between COVID-19 and diabetes may be to blame for that increase. \"Data show an increase in mortality rates for all people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and research shows that people with underlying conditions, including diabetes, are more likely to become very sick from COVID-19 and have a higher risk of hospitalization and death,\" Christopher Holliday, head of the CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation, told CBS News in a statement. Holliday added that research shows the pandemic may also have made it harder for Americans to properly manage the disease, ranging from interruptions to physical activity to disruptions to routine medical care diagnosing and treating the disease. \"While diabetes-related death rates have decreased since 2021, they have not returned to pre-pandemic levels,\" Holliday said. There were 103,294 deaths from diabetes in 2021, up more than 17% from 87,647 deaths in 2019 before the pandemic. Provisionaldatareported so far for 2024 have tallied 94,294 diabetes deaths last year. Diabetes deaths had been largely falling in recent years before the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an increase in the prevalence of the disease. Those trends were before the introduction of new diabetes treatments like Ozempic and Mounjaro that have seenhigh demand. Nearly 1 in 10 adults had diagnosed diabetesin 2023, according to the CDC's National Health Interview Survey. Expertscautionthat analyzing long term trends in diabetes deaths is complex for a number of reasons, including changes in the definition of the disease over the past decades and variation in how death certificates record diabetes deaths. Also, not all death certificates record diabetes as the main \"underlying cause of death\" but instead as a contributing factor, which is counted separately. \"Diabetes is a more common contributing cause of death, not the primary underlying cause of death. Furthermore, most deaths among people with diabetes are cardiovascular and would be counted among the cardiovascular,\"Elizabeth Selvin, director of the Johns Hopkins Welch Center for Prevention, Epidemiology and Clinical Research, said in an email to CBS News. Selvin said it is up to doctors to choose whether to select diabetes or other underlying health conditions as the cause of a heart attack death. \"All of this to say, trends in underlying causes of death will reflect awareness of diabetes and coding practices; It is hard to know what role these play in these data,\" Selvin said.

    "title": "Ukraine and US sign much-awaited minerals deal: As it happened",
    "article_text": "Ukraine and the US signed an agreement on Wednesday that will direct a portion of the revenues from the development of Ukraine’s natural resources into a joint investment fund. Kiev hopes the deal will incentivize US President Donald Trump to maintain military and financial aid to Ukraine amid the conflict with Russia. The US has been attempting to broker a ceasefire since February, as Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky and other top officials in Kiev have accused the Trump administration of promoting“pro-Russian”narratives. The two sides initially planned to sign the agreement in February, but the deal fell through at the last minute after a meeting between Trump and Zelensky devolved into a heated argument. According to reports, US officials originally pushed for 50% American ownership of Ukraine’s rare-earth minerals – which Zelensky rejected at the time. This live stream has ended.",

    "title": "US-Ukraine minerals deal: What is known so far",
    "article_text": "Washington and Kiev are set to sign a major mineral resources agreement, which US President Donald Trump has been pushing for months. Ukrainian Economy Minister Yulia Sviridenko has flown to the US to seal the deal, Prime Minister Denis Shmigal said on Wednesday, adding that the document should be signed within 24 hours. Neither the US nor Ukraine have officially presented the details to the public yet. Reuters, which claims to have seen a draft of the document, reported that it would involve creating a joint fund that would receive half of all profits the Ukrainian government gets from any new natural resources permits issued in Ukraine. The document reportedly does not specify how the money will be spent or who controls the spending decisions. The agreement would provide the US with preferential access to any new Ukrainian resource deals but would not give it direct control over Ukraine’s mineral resources or gas infrastructure, according to Reuters. Kiev also reportedly refused to include any requirements that it pay the US back for billions of dollars spent on military assistance. America can still count any new military aid as its contribution to the joint fund, according to Shmigal. The two sides have reportedly hit a last-minute snag, according to sources cited by Reuters and CNN. Washington reportedly insists on signing two technical documents detailing certain provisions of the deal along with the agreement. Kiev insists that the agreement must first be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament before other documents can be signed, according to the Financial Times. Speaking at a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Ukraine sought to make last-minute changes to the already agreed deal.“We’re sure they’ll reconsider that. We are ready to sign this afternoon, but they aren’t,”he told journalists. Trump stated that“we’ve made a deal where our money is secure where we can start digging and do what we have to do.”It is unclear if he was referring to the original US proposal or the final deal. The White House has yet to make an official announcement.",

    "title": "Robert De Niro Doesn’t Think Daughter Airyn Being Trans Is a “Big Deal”",
    "article_text": "Update, Thursday, May 1, 2 p.m. ET:Robert De Nirohas nothing but love for his children. After his daughterAiryncame out as a trans woman in a story forThem,the two-time Oscar winner publicly affirmed his support for his daughter. “I loved and supported Aaron as my son, and now I love and support Airyn as my daughter. I don’t know what the big deal is,” De NirotoldVarietyin a statement. “I love all my children.” Every parent should take a page out of De Niro’s book. The original post continues below. Please give a warm welcome to Airyn De Niro.In a story forThem,Robert De Niro’s 29-year-old daughter introduced herself to the public as a trans woman—opening up about her childhood, her aspirations, and how she has navigated her transition journey. Born in 1995, Airyn is one of the legendary actor’s seven children. TheRaging Bullstar shares two kids with his first wife, actorDiahnne Abbott:Drena,57, Abbott’s daughter from a previous marriage whom De Niro adopted, andRaphael,48. Abbott and De Niro divorced in 1988. De Niro then had twins Airyn andJulian,29, with actor and modelToukie Smith;he and Smith were in a relationship from 1988 to 1996. In 1997, De Niro married actorGrace Hightower,and together they hadElliot,27, andHelen Grace,13. De Niro and Hightower split in 2018. In April of 2023, the now 81-year-old actor welcomed his seventh child,Gia,with his girlfriend,Tiffany Chen. Airyn spent her childhood mostly out of the spotlight despite the massive success of her father, a two-time Oscar winner. “Obviously, no parent is perfect, but I am grateful that both my parents agreed to keep me out of the limelight. They wanted it very private,” she toldThem.“They have told me they wanted me to have as much of a normal childhood as possible.” But on March 19 of this year, Airyn’s privacy was invaded when theDaily Mailpublished a paparazzi photo of her as she went to visit her father at the Greenwich Hotel, essentially outing her as a trans woman. In the accompanying article, Airyn was also misgendered and described as a “nepo baby” who’d undergone a “shock transformation.” “I actually didn’t find out about theDaily Mailthing until like a week after it was posted,” Airyn toldThem.“Not only did they get information wrong about me…they just sort of reminded me that people really don’t know anything about me.” This content can also be viewed on the site itoriginatesfrom. Here are a few things you should know about Airyn: She’s an aspiring model and voice actor who’s also studying to be a mental health counselor. She also wants to achieve success on her own. “I wasn’t brought up having a side part in one of dad’s movies or going to business meetings or attending premieres,” she toldThem.“My dad was very big on us finding our own sort of path. I would want [success] to happen on my own merit.” Airyn revealed that she auditioned for the role of Jules onEuphoria,which ultimately went toHunter Schafer,as well as a character in the video gameLeague of Legends.Her twin, Julian, is also an actor, playing a youngBarack ObamainThe First Ladyand appearing on Broadway in a recent revival ofThe Sign in Sidney Brustein’sWindow. As a child, Airyn said, she felt out of place as a “bigger-bodied person,” which was difficult for her to process. “Everybody else in the family [was] relatively thin or fit; I was not, so I sort of stood out like a sore thumb and there wasn’t anybody in my family that could relate to that experience,” she said. She also opened up toThemabout other issues she faced growing up as a femme, biracial, queer person. “[Gay men were] ruthless and mean. I didn’t even fit that beauty standard, which is thin, white, muscular, or just super fit, masculine,” she toldThem.“I was always told I was too much of something or not enough of something growing up: too big, not skinny enough. Not Black enough, not white enough. Too feminine, not masculine enough. It was never just, ‘You’re just right, just the way you are.’” In November of last year, Airyn began hormone therapy. “Who wants to be an old man?” she joked toThem.Airyn began transitioning after seeing the rising success andvisibility of trans women. “Trans women being honest and open, especially [in] public spaces like social media, and getting to see them in their success…I’m like, You know what? Maybe it’s not too late for me,” she said. “Maybe I can start.” Her transition was also influenced by the Black women in her life, like her mother. “I think stepping into this new identity, while also being more proud of my Blackness, makes me feel closer to them in some way,” she said As a biracial trans woman, Airyn wants “queer people of color and bigger-bodied people to have anAlex Consani,” she toldThem,referencing the influential transgender model. “I want queer people of color and bigger-bodied people to have a Hunter Schafer.” And while she doesn’t want her famous last name to book her any roles, she does dream of one day sharing the spotlight with a family member. “A part of me has always wanted to model and sort of follow my mom’s footsteps,\" she said. “Honestly, if I could be on the cover ofVoguewith her or recreating one of her pictures, that would be a dream come true.” HowMiriam AdelsonWent From Big MAGA Winner to Casino Loser in Trump’s First 100 Days The Truth UnderlyingPete Hegseth’s Job Security “It’s About Him”: How Trump Is Perverting thePresidential Photo Stream Inside the Case ofKim Kardashian’s Paris Robbery HowSebastian StanBecame Hollywood’s Most Daring Shape-Shifter The Ballad ofBill Belichickand Jordon Hudson JuilliardIs Going Tuition-Free Elon Musk’sBreeding SpreeIsSoMuch Wilder Than You Thought EveryQuentin TarantinoMovie, Ranked MeetElon Musk’s 14 Childrenand Their Mothers (Whom We Know of) From the Archive:Sinatra and the Mob",
